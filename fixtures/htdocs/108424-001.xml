  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim.  Upsetting, you say?  Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school.  Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed.  But what the reader knows, her family does not.  Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some.  But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.  To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>Enzo knows he is different from other dogs: a philosopher with a nearly human soul (and an obsession with opposable thumbs), he has educated himself by watching television extensively, and by listening very closely to the words of his master, Denny Swift, an up-and-coming race car driver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through Denny, Enzo has gained tremendous insight into the human condition, and he sees that life, like racing, isn't simply about going fast. On the eve of his death, Enzo takes stock of his life, recalling all that he and his family have been through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A heart-wrenching but deeply funny and ultimately uplifting story of family, love, loyalty, and hope, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Racing in the Rain&lt;/em&gt; is a beautifully crafted and captivating look at the wonders and absurdities of human life...as only a dog could tell it.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A powerfully emotional and beautifully written story of heartbreaking loss and undying love&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a fishing guide and struggling artist from a south George trailer park. She was the beautiful only child of South Carolina’s most powerful senator. Yet once Doss Michaels and Abigail Grace Coleman met by accident, they each felt they’d found their true soul mate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years into their marriage, when Abbie faces a life-threatening illness, Doss battles it with her every step of the way. And when she makes a list of ten things she hopes to accomplish before she loses the fight for good, Doss is there, too, supporting her and making everything possible. Together they steal away in the middle of the night to embark upon a 130-mile trip down the St. Mary’s River—a voyage Doss promised Abbie in the early days of their courtship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where the River Ends&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; chronicles their love-filled, tragedy-tinged journey and a bond that transcends all.</description>

  <description>SELECTED BY &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America's&lt;/em&gt; "READ THIS!" BOOK CLUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in South Carolina in 1964, &lt;em&gt;The Secret Life of Bees&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Lily Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. When Lily's fierce-hearted black "stand-in mother," Rosaleen, insults three of the deepest racists in town, Lily decides to spring them both free. They escape to Tiburon, South Carolina--a town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by an eccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters, Lily is introduced to their mesmerizing world of bees and honey, and the Black Madonna. This is a remarkable novel about divine female power, a story women will share and pass on to their daughters for years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PENGUIN READERS GUIDE INSIDE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Description from back cover of book.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Philip Beard’s stunning debut novel is fifteen-year-old Tess DeNunzio’s letter to her sister, Zoe, lost to a hit-and-run driver on a day when it seemed that nothing mattered but the tragedies playing out in New York and Washington. &lt;em&gt;Dear Zoe&lt;/em&gt; is a remarkable study of grief, adolescence, and healing with a pitch-perfect narrator who is at once sharp and naïve, world- worried and self-centered, funny and heartbreakingly honest. Tess begins her letter to Zoe as a means of figuring out her own life, her place in the world, but the result is a novel of rare power and grace that tells us much about ours. BACKCOVER: �Like &lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt;, [&lt;em&gt;Dear Zoe&lt;/em&gt;] is a piercing look at how family recovers from a devastating loss. Everything about this moving, powerful debut rings true.”&lt;br&gt; —&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; �Beard peels away the layers of his protagonist’s anguish simply and sensitively. . . and creates real, multidimensional and affecting characters.”&lt;br&gt; —&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; �The whole novel . . . rings with truth.”&lt;br&gt; —&lt;em&gt;The Buffalo News&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From bestselling author Anne Rivers Siddons comes a bittersweet and finely wrought story of friendship, family, and Charleston society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At twelve, Emily Parmenter knows alone all too well. Left mostly to herself after her beautiful young mother disappeared and her beloved older brother died, Emily is keenly aware of yearning and loss. Rather than be consumed by sadness, she has built a life around the faded plantation where her remote father and hunting-obsessed brothers raise the legendary Lowcountry Boykin hunting spaniels. It is a meager, narrow, masculine world, but to Emily it has magic: the storied deep-sea dolphins who come regularly to play in Sweetwater Creek; her extraordinary bond with the beautiful dogs she trains; her almost mystic communion with her own spaniel, Elvis; the dreaming old Lowcountry itself. Emily hides from the dreaded world here. It is enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then comes Lulu Foxworth, troubled daughter of a truly grand plantation, who has run away from her hectic Charleston debutante season to spend a healing summer with the quiet marshes and river, and the life-giving dogs. Where Emily's father sees their guest as an entrée to a society he thought forever out of reach, Emily is at once threatened and mystified. Lulu has a powerful enchantment of her own, and this, along with the dark, crippling secret she brings with her, will inevitably blow Emily's magical water world apart and let the real one in—but at a terrible price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poignant and emotionally compelling, Anne Rivers Siddons's &lt;em&gt;Sweetwater Creek&lt;/em&gt; draws you into the luminous landscape of the Lowcountry. With characters that linger long after you've turned the last page, this engaging tale is destined to become an instant classic.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“ I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.” &lt;/em&gt;January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</description>

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Jasira wants what every girl wants: love and acceptance and the undivided attention of whoever she's with.  And if she can't get that from her parents, then why not from her mother's boyfriend, or her father's muscle-bound neighbor, Mr. Vuoso? Alicia Erian's incandescent debut novel, &lt;em&gt;Towelhead&lt;/em&gt;, will ring true for readers who remember the rarely poetic transition from childhood to young adulthood.  Jasira is a creature of contradiction: both innocent (reading romantic intentions into the grossest displays of lust) and oddly clear-sighted, especially when it comes to the imbalance of power, and the things we do for love. When her mother exiles her to Houston to live with Jasira's strict, quick-to-anger Lebanese father, she quickly learns what aspects of herself to suppress in front of him.  In private, however, she conducts her sexual awakening with all the false confidence that pop culture and her neighbor's &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt; magazines have provided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jasira tells her story with candor and glimmers of dark, unexpected humor--as when she describes her mother's boyfriend Barry's assistance in her personal grooming: "A week later, Barry broke down and told her the truth. That he had shaved me himself. That he had been shaving me for weeks. That he couldn't seem to stop shaving me." The freshness of her narrative voice sets &lt;em&gt;Towelhead&lt;/em&gt; apart from the sentimental or purely harsh treatment of similar subject matter elsewhere, and makes the novel a promising follow-up to Erian's well-regarded short story collection, &lt;em&gt;The Brutal Language of Love&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;--Regina Marler&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In this smart, sexy, wickedly funny new novel, the acclaimed author of &lt;strong&gt;Right Before Your Eyes&lt;/strong&gt; introduces an unforgettable and irresistibly real heroine: a woman who is forced to reinvent herself— and discovers that the biggest risk is not taking one at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michaela “Mike” Edwards doesn’t do sugar and spice. But when mishandled office politics get her unexpectedly fired, the young advertising hotshot finds herself doing the unimaginable: moving back in with her widowed father, unraveling her complex feelings for an Aussie journalist named Gunther, and rethinking her entire life. She could never have guessed that fate would land her in a classroom teaching “life skills” to sixth-grade girls who desperately need her. But with a best friend rapidly becoming something more, and a family she’s just discovering, Mike is about to learn that going places in life doesn’t have to mean going it alone.</description>

  <description>�I couldn’t cook but I could sew. It would have been better the other way around.” So begins this witty and transporting new novel by the acclaimed Erin McGraw, introducing us to Nell Plat, who, at age seventeen, finds herself unhappily married and the mother of two baby girls. For a young woman with a hunger for excitement and glamour, Kansas circa 1900 offers nothing but a flat horizon. Still, Nell find some joy sewing and making dresses for women in town. Dreaming over her sewing machine, she begins to entertain ambitions she knows she cannot share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on Erin McGraw’s grandmother’s life, here is the story—told in Nell’s own irreverent and wise voice—of what happens when Nell runs away to Los Angeles in the year 1901 as the new motion-picture industry is just taking root. Nell marries again, has a daughter, and goes into business as a costumer in the Hollywood of the Roaring Twenties, renaming herself Madame Annelle. But a knock on the door by her grown daughters, precisely the thing she has most feared, threatens to take apart the new life Nell has so carefully built. Forced to confront the legacy of the life she believed she had shed, Nell struggles to make the right choices the second time around and finds herself truly transformed.&lt;br&gt;In vividly bringing to life the story of Nell Plat, Erin McGraw gives voice to the stories of the countless young women who, unsatisfied with their lives, headed to Hollywood in its heyday.

  <description>What had happened to my beautiful boy? To our family?What did I do wrong? Those are the wrenching questions that haunted every moment of David Sheff ’s journey through his son Nic’s addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery. Before Nic Sheff became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy, joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets.David Sheff traces the first subtle warning signs: the denial, the 3 A.M. phone calls (is it Nic? the police? the hospital?), the rehabs.His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself, and the obsessive worry and stress took a tremendous toll. But as a journalist, he instinctively researched every avenue of treatment that might save his son and refused to give up on Nic.&lt;br&gt;Beautiful Boy is a fiercely candid memoir that brings immediacy to the emotional rollercoaster of loving a child who seems beyond help.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I have been standing on the side of life, watching it float by. I want to swim in the river. I want to feel the current.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So writes Mamah Borthwick Cheney in her diary as she struggles to justify her clandestine love affair with Frank Lloyd Wright. Four years earlier, in 1903, Mamah and her husband, Edwin, had commissioned the renowned architect to design a new home for them. During the construction of the house, a powerful attraction developed between Mamah and Frank, and in time the lovers, each married with children, embarked on a course that would shock Chicago society and forever change their lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this ambitious debut novel, fact and fiction blend together brilliantly. While scholars have largely relegated Mamah to a footnote in the life of America’s greatest architect, author Nancy Horan gives full weight to their dramatic love story and illuminates Cheney’s profound influence on Wright. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on years of research, Horan weaves little-known facts into a compelling narrative, vividly portraying the conflicts and struggles of a woman forced to choose between the roles of mother, wife, lover, and intellectual. Horan’s Mamah is a woman seeking to find her own place, her own creative calling in the world. Mamah’s is an unforgettable journey marked by choices that reshape her notions of love and responsibility, leading inexorably ultimately lead to this novel’s stunning conclusion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elegantly written and remarkably rich in detail, &lt;em&gt;Loving Frank&lt;/em&gt; is a fitting tribute to a courageous woman, a national icon, and their timeless love story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advance praise for &lt;em&gt;Loving Frank:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Loving Frank&lt;/em&gt; is one of those novels that takes over your life. It’s mesmerizing and fascinating–filled with complex characters, deep passions, tactile descriptions of astonishing architecture, and the colorful immediacy of daily life a hundred years ago–all gathered into a story that unfolds with riveting urgency.”&lt;br&gt;–Lauren Belfer, author of &lt;em&gt;City of Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This graceful, assured first novel tells the remarkable story of the long-lived affair between Frank Lloyd Wright, a passionate and impossible figure, and Mamah Cheney, a married woman whom Wright beguiled and led beyond the restraint of convention. It is engrossing, provocative reading.”&lt;br&gt;——Scott Turow&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It takes great courage to write a novel about historical people, and in particular to give voice to someone as mythic as Frank Lloyd Wright. This beautifully written novel about Mamah Cheney and Frank Lloyd Wright’s love affair is vivid and intelligent, unsentimental and compassionate.”&lt;br&gt;——Jane Hamilton&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I admire this novel, adore this novel, for so many reasons: The intelligence and lyricism of the prose. The attention to period detail. The epic proportions of this most fascinating love story. Mamah Cheney has been in my head and heart and soul since reading this book; I doubt she’ll ever leave.”&lt;br&gt;–Elizabeth Berg</description>

  <description>I am not my illness. "Girl with Anxiety," "Trauma of the Week" -- no. I hate stuff like that. Everyone, everyone has their issue. But the one thing my illness did make me realize is how necessary it is to ignore the dangers of living in order to live. And how much trouble you can get into if you can't.&lt;br&gt;Jade DeLuna is too young to die. She knows this, and yet she can't quite believe it, especially when the terrifying thoughts, loss of breath, and dizzy feelings come. Since being diagnosed with Panic Disorder, she's trying her best to stay calm, and visiting the elephants at the nearby zoo seems to help. That's why Jade keeps the live zoo webcam on in her room, and that's where she first sees the boy in the red jacket. A boy who stops to watch the elephants. A boy carrying a baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Sebastian, and he is raising his son alone. Jade is drawn into Sebastian's cozy life with his son and his activist grandmother on their Seattle houseboat, and before she knows it, she's in love. With this boy who has lived through harder times than anyone she knows. This boy with a past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade knows the situation is beyond complicated, but she hasn't felt this safe in a long time. She owes it all to Sebastian, her boy with the great heart. Her boy who is hiding a terrible secret. A secret that will force Jade to decide between what is right, and what feels right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master storyteller Deb Caletti has once again created characters so real, you will be breathless with anticipation as their riveting story unfolds.</description>

  <description>"I like to play indoors better 'cause that's where all the electrical outlets are," reports a fourth-grader. Never before in history have children been so plugged in—and so out of touch with the natural world. In this groundbreaking new work, child advocacy expert Richard Louv directly links the lack of nature in the lives of today's wired generation—he calls it nature deficit—to some of the most disturbing childhood trends, such as rises in obesity, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), and depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Some startling facts: By the 1990s the radius around the home where children were allowed to roam on their own had shrunk to a ninth of what it had been in 1970. Today, average eight-year-olds are better able to identify cartoon characters than native species, such as beetles and oak trees, in their own community. The rate at which doctors prescribe antidepressants to children has doubled in the last five years, and recent studies show that too much computer use spells trouble for the developing mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nature-deficit disorder is not a medical condition; it is a description of the human costs of alienation from nature. This alienation damages children and shapes adults, families, and communities. There are solutions, though, and they're right in our own backyards. &lt;em&gt;Last child in the Woods&lt;/em&gt; is the first book to bring together cutting-edge research showing that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy childhood development—physical, emotional, and spiritual. What's more, nature is a potent therapy for depression, obesity, and ADD. Environment-based education dramatically improves standardized test scores and grade point averages and develops skills in problem solving, critical thinking, and decision making. Even creativity is stimulated by childhood experiences in nature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Yet sending kids outside to play is increasingly difficult. Computers, television, and video games compete for their time, of course, but it's also our fears of traffic, strangers, even virus-carrying mosquitoes—fears the media exploit—that keep children indoors. Meanwhile, schools assign more and more homework, and there is less and less access to natural areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Parents have the power to ensure that their daughter or son will not be the "last child in the woods," and this book is the first step toward that nature-child reunion.</description>

  <description>Aging, self-absorbed rock star Judas Coyne has a thing for the macabre -- his collection includes sketches from infamous serial killer John Wayne Gacy, a trepanned skull from the 16th century, a used hangman's noose, Aleister Crowley's childhood chessboard, etc. -- so when his assistant tells him about a ghost for sale on an online auction site, he immediately puts in a bid and purchases it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The black, heart-shaped box that Coyne receives in the mail not only contains the suit of a dead man but also his vengeance-obsessed spirit. The ghost, it turns out, is the stepfather of a young groupie who committed suicide after the 54-year-old Coyne callously used her up and threw her away. Now, determined to kill Coyne and anyone who aids him, the merciless ghost of Craddock McDermott begins his assault on the rocker's sanity.</description>

  <description>The author who took readers into the strange and fascinating world of Salt Lake City escort services now returns to New York, where a young woman becomes inexplicably drawn to an accused murderer who hails from her hometown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grace — a single, early-thirties copy editor — drinks alone in the same bar every night, confides in her longtime bartender, and observes New York City life from the sidelines. But when a local coed is found dead, and a college student from Grace’s hometown is arrested for the murder, something within her stirs. Though the media has portrayed the boy, Charles, as a spoiled rich kid who killed as revenge for a rebuffed sexual advance, Grace senses deeper layers and complications to the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consumed by discovering the truth behind his crime, Grace strikes up an unlikely friendship with the accused killer, becoming more and more obsessed with the case. Barely sleeping and slipping further behind at work, she inadvertently dredges up some dark parts of her own childhood, including the death of her younger sister twenty-five years earlier. And when Grace returns to her childhood home in Ohio, she intends to chase the mystery behind Charles’s crime, but finds the mystery she is chasing is actually her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"Abu-Jaber's voluptuous prose features insights into the Arab American community that are wisely, warmly depicted."—San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirty-nine-year-old Sirine, never married, lives with a devoted Iraqi-immigrant uncle and an adoring dog named King Babar. She works as a chef in a Lebanese restaurant, her passions aroused only by the preparation of food—until an unbearably handsome Arabic literature professor starts dropping by for a little home cooking. Falling in love brings Sirene's whole heart to a boil—stirring up memories of her parents and questions about her identity as an Arab American.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praised by critics from The New Yorker to USA Today for her first novel, Arabian Jazz ("an oracular tale that unfurls like gossamer"), Diana Abu-Jaber weaves with spellbinding magic a multidimensional love story set in the Arab-American community of Los Angeles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in a lush, lyrical style reminiscent of The God of Small Things, infused with the flavors and scents of Middle Eastern food, and spiced with history and fable, Crescent is a sensuous love story and a gripping tale of risk and commitment.</description>

  <description>Wally Lamb's two previous novels, &lt;em&gt;She's Come Undone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I Know This Much Is True,&lt;/em&gt; struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Hour I First Believed,&lt;/em&gt; Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary -- and American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hour I First Believed&lt;/em&gt; is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;New York City thrums with energy, wonder, and possibility in this magical novel about the life of Nikola Tesla.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is 1943, and the renowned inventor Nikola Tesla occupies a forbidden room on the 33rd floor of the Hotel New Yorker, stealing electricity. Louisa, a young maid at the hotel determined to befriend him, wins his attention through a shared love of pigeons; with her we hear his tragic and tremendous life story unfold. Meanwhile, Louisa discovers that her father—and her handsome, enigmatic love interest, Arthur Vaughan—are on an unlikely mission to travel back in time and find his beloved late wife. A masterful hybrid of history, biography, and science fiction, &lt;em&gt;The Invention of Everything Else&lt;/em&gt; is an absorbing story about love and death and a wonderfully imagined homage to one of history's most visionary scientists.</description>

  <description>Knopf Canada is proud to welcome this bestselling, Pulitzer Prize—winning author with eight dazzling stories that take us from Cambridge and Seattle to India and Thailand as they explore the secrets at the heart of family life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the stunning title story, Ruma, a young mother in a new city, is visited by her father who carefully tends her garden–where she later unearths evidence of a love affair he is keeping to himself. In “A Choice of Accommodations,” a couple’s romantic getaway weekend takes a dark turn at a party that lasts deep into the night. In “Only Goodness,” a woman eager to give her younger brother the perfect childhood she never had is overwhelmed by guilt, anguish and anger when his alcoholism threatens her family. And in “Hema and Kaushik,” a trio of linked stories–a luminous, intensely compelling elegy of life, death, love and fate–we follow the lives of a girl and boy who, one fateful winter, share a house in Massachusetts. They travel from innocence to experience on separate, sometimes painful paths, until destiny brings them together again years later in Rome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unaccustomed Earth&lt;/strong&gt; is rich with the author’s signature gifts: exquisite prose, emotional wisdom and subtle renderings of the most intricate workings of the heart and mind. It is the work of a writer at the peak of her powers.</description>

  <description>A brain scientist's journey from a debilitating stroke to full recovery becomes an inspiring exploration of human consciousness and its possibilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On the morning of December 10, 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor, a thirty-seven-year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist, experienced a massive stroke when a blood vessel exploded in the left side of her brain. A neuroanatomist by profession, she observed her own mind completely deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life, all within the space of four brief hours. As the damaged left side of her brain--the rational, grounded, detail- and time-oriented side--swung in and out of function, Taylor alternated between two distinct and opposite realities: the euphoric nirvana of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace; and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized Jill was having a stroke, and enabled her to seek help before she was lost completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;My Stroke of Insight&lt;/em&gt;, Taylor shares her unique perspective on the brain and its capacity for recovery, and the sense of omniscient understanding she gained from this unusual and inspiring voyage out of the abyss of a wounded brain. It would take eight years for Taylor to heal completely. Because of her knowledge of how the brain works, her respect for the cells composing her human form, and most of all an amazing mother, Taylor completely repaired her mind and recalibrated her understanding of the world according to the insights gained from her right brain that morning of December 10th.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Today Taylor is convinced that the stroke was the best thing that could have happened to her. It has taught her that the feeling of nirvana is never more than a mere thought away. By &lt;em&gt;stepping to the right of our left brains&lt;/em&gt;, we can all uncover the feelings of well-being and peace that are so often sidelined by our own brain chatter. A fascinating journey into the mechanics of the human mind, &lt;em&gt;My Stroke of Insight&lt;/em&gt; is both a valuable recovery guide for anyone touched by a brain injury, and an emotionally stirring testimony that deep internal peace truly is accessible to anyone, at any time.</description>

  <description>What's the Southern woman's favorite brand of mayo? Why do we have to keep a "funeral casserole" in the freezer? Why do Southern men call their fathers "Deddy" no matter how big and powerful they've become?  &lt;br&gt;Step into the wacky world of "womanless wedding" fund-raisers, in which Bubbas wear boas. Meet two sisters who fight rural boredom by washing Budweiser cans and cutting them into pieces to make clothing. Learn why the word "snow" sends any right-thinking Southerner careening to the Food Lion for extra loaves of bread and little else.  &lt;br&gt;What's the Southern woman's take on Wonderbras, fried turkeys and `tater guns, Barbie and Ken (tip: she's a ho), politicians (tip: they're all hos) and marital success (if you can't agree on a perfect pizza ratio, y'all are doomed)?  &lt;br&gt;Humor columnist and slightly crazed belle-by-birth &lt;em&gt;Celia Rivenbark&lt;/em&gt; tackles these and other lard-laden subjects in &lt;em&gt;Bless Your Heart, Tramp&lt;/em&gt;, a hilarious look at Southern - and just plain human - foibles, up-close and personal.  &lt;br&gt;So pour yourself a glass of sweet tea and curl up on the pie-azza with &lt;em&gt;Bless Your Heart, Tramp&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;If you're a Southerner, you'll understand. If you're not - well, God help you.</description>

  <description>Generations struggle in the American frontier West. "Every ranch...had lost a boy," thinks Dakotah Hicks as she drives through "the hammered red landscape" of Wyoming, "boys smiling, sure in their risks, healthy, tipped out of the current of life by liquor and acceleration, rodeo smashups, bad horses, deep irrigation ditches, high trestles, tractor rollovers and 'unloaded' guns. Her boy, too...The trip along this road was a roll call of grief."</description>

  <description>Welcome to the luminous and marvelously inventive world of "The Ghost in Love." A man falls in the snow, hits his head on a curb, and dies. But something strange occurs: the man "doesn’t "die, and the ghost that’s been sent to take his soul to the afterlife is flabbergasted. Going immediately to its boss, the ghost asks, what should I do now? The boss says, we don’t know how this happened but we’re working on it. We want you to stay with this man to help us figure out what’s going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ghost agrees unhappily; it is a ghost, not a nursemaid. But a funny thing happens—the ghost falls madly in love with the man’s girlfriend, and things naturally get complicated. Soon afterward, the man discovers he did not die when he was “supposed” to because for the first time in their history, human beings have decided to take their fates back from the gods. It’s a wonderful change, but one that comes at a price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Ghost in Love "is about what happens to us when we discover that we have become the masters of our own fate. No excuses, no outside forces or gods to blame—the responsibility is all our own. It’s also about love, ghosts that happen to be gourmet cooks, talking dogs, and picnicking in the rain with yourself at twenty different ages.</description>

  <description>Bev is the Smart One, who finally leaves her artistic ambitions in chalk dust (and her humor-impaired husband in the arms—and legs—of his nubile protégée) to become a schoolteacher. Clare is the Pretty One, who married well and seems to be living a designer version of the suburban dream. Joey is the Wild One, struggling to stay clean and sober now that she's used up her fifteen minutes of fame as a one-hit-wonder rock star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They love each other but mix like oil, water, and hundred-proof gin . . . a combination that threatens to combust over family tensions, suspected infidelities, a devastating accident, a stunning confession, and the sudden reappearance of their handsome, now all-grown-up former neighbor, Kenny Waxman, who's back in town making his mark as a TV comedy writer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems they'll never understand where their differences begin and their own destructive tendencies end. Then it happens: the sisters discover a decades-old body stuffed inside an industrial drum and begin a bold, heartbreaking, and sometimes hilarious journey that will either bring them together . . . or tear them apart for good.</description>

  <description>Sabine-- twenty years a magician's assistant to her handsome, charming husband-- is suddenly a widow. In the wake of his death, she finds he has left a final trick; a false identity and a family allegedly lost in a tragic accident but now revealed as very much alive and well. Named as heirs in his will, they enter Sabine's life and set her on an adventure of unraveling his secrets, from sunny Los Angeles to the windswept plains of Nebraska, that will work its own sort of magic on her.</description>

  <description>Finally, after four hit novels, Carrie Fisher comes clean (well, sort of ) with the crazy truth that is her life in her first-ever memoir. In &lt;em&gt;Wishful Drinking&lt;/em&gt;, adapted from her one-woman stage show, Fisher reveals what it was really like to grow up a product of "Hollywood in-breeding," come of age on the set of a little movie called &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and become a cultural icon and bestselling action figure at the age of nineteen.  &lt;p&gt; Intimate, hilarious, and sobering, &lt;em&gt;Wishful Drinking&lt;/em&gt; is Fisher, looking at her life as she best remembers it (what do you expect after electroshock therapy?). It's an incredible tale: the child of Hollywood royalty—Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher—homewrecked by Elizabeth Taylor, marrying (then divorcing, then dating) Paul Simon, having her likeness merchandized on everything from Princess Leia shampoo to PEZ dispensers, learning the father of her daughter forgot to tell her he was gay, and ultimately waking up one morning and finding a friend dead beside her in bed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wishful Drinking&lt;/em&gt;, the show, has been a runaway success. &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; declared it "drolly hysterical" and the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; called it a "Beverly Hills yard sale of juicy anecdotes." This is Carrie Fisher at her best—revealing her worst. She tells her true and outrageous story of her bizarre reality with her inimitable wit, unabashed self-deprecation, and buoyant, infectious humor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Since she first gave voice to the struggles of a generation of women with Up the Sandbox, Anne Roiphe has been a unique chronicler of how we live in relationships and in families. In Married, Roiphe offers an elegant defense of married life from the wry perspective of a wife and mother who survived the 1950's, the sexual revolution, and the women's movement.Drawing upon a captivating range of examples from history, literature, and popular culture--ranging from Jane Austen's Emma to Bill and Hillary Clinton--as well as her own two marriages, Roiphe looks at the state of wedded union from an emotional as well as a social perspective. With her trademark blend of wit and wisdom, she explores such questions as why we have marriage, the stresses that threaten a marriage, what marriage asks of us, and what marriage gives to us.Just as she won women's hearts by celebrating the neglected joys of motherhood in Fruitful (shortlisted for the National Book Award), Roiphe is certain to capture a wide audience with her passionately affirmative answer to the basic question we ask about marriage. Does she think it's worth it? In Married Anne Roiphe answers with a resounding "I do."</description>

  <description>In her author’s note, Marion Winik writes that in Mexico on the Day of the Dead, �people build altars to their loved ones . . . they go to the cemetery and stay all night, praying, singing, drinking, wailing. They tell the sad stories and the noble ones; they eat cookies shaped like skeletons. They celebrate and mourn at once.” Striking that balance, &lt;em&gt;The Glen Rock Book of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; presents snapshot portraits of The Jeweler, The Driving Instructor, The Bad Influence, The Queen of New Jersey—and roughly fifty others who have touched Winik’s life, from her son’s second grade teacher to Keith Haring. Tied together by the inimitable, poignant voice of Winik, these losses form not only an autobiography but a story of our time, delivering a lyrical journey that ultimately raises the spirits.</description>

  <description>Nobel laureate Doris Lessing's classic novel of the pivotal summer in one woman's life is a brilliant excursion into the terrifying gulf between youth and old age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the summer begins, Kate Brown—attractive, intelligent, forty-five, happily married, with a house in the London suburbs and three grown children—has no reason to expect that anything will change. But by summer's end the woman she was—living behind a protective camouflage of feminine charm and caring—no longer exists. &lt;strong&gt;The Summer Before the Dark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;takes us along on Kate's journey: from London to Turkey to Spain, from husband to lover to madness, on the road to a frightening new independence and a confrontation with herself that lets her finally and truly come of age.</description>

  <description>After catching her husband having an affair and being fired from her job, Maggie Walsh suddenly finds her perfectly organized existence has become a perfect mess. She decides, for the first time in her life, to do something daring -- and flees to her best friend, Emily, in the faraway wonderland of Los Angeles. In this mecca of tanned, beautiful bodies, unsvelte, uncool Maggie is decidedly a fish out of water. Yet, overnight, she's mixing with film folk, pitching scripts, even experimenting with sex -- and discovering that the end of a marriage is not the end of the world.</description>

  <description>Meet Rachel Walsh. She has a pair of size 8 feet and such a fondness for recreational drugs that her family has forked out the cash for a spell in Cloisters – Dublin’s answer to the Betty Ford Clinic. She’s only agreed to her incarceration because she’s heard that rehab is wall-to-wall jacuzzis, gymnasiums and rock stars going tepid turkey – and it’s about time she had a holiday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what Rachel doesn’t count on are the toe-curling embarrassments heaped on her by family and group therapy, the dearth of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll – and missing Luke, her ex. What kind of a new start in life is this?</description>

  <description>Award-winning writer Stewart O'Nan has been acclaimed by critics as one of the most accomplished novelists writing today. Now comes his finest and most complete novel to date. A year after the death of her husband, Henry, Emily Maxwell gathers her family by Lake Chautauqua in western New York for what will be a last vacation at their summer cottage. Joining is her sister-in-law, who silently mourns the sale of the lake house, and a long-lost love. Emily's firebrand daughter, a recovering alcoholic recently separated from her husband, brings her children from Detroit. Emily's son, who has quit his job and mortgaged his future to pursue his art, comes accompanied by his children and his wife, who is secretly heartened to be visiting the house for the last time. Memories of past summers resurface, old rivalries flare up, and love is rekindled and born anew, resulting in a timeless novel drawn, as the best writing often is, from the ebbs and flow of daily life.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nothing will break this mother-daughter bond. Not even the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Deborah Monroe and her daughter, Grace, are driving home from a party when their car hits a man running in the dark.

  <description>&lt;br&gt;From the twisted imagination of Christopher Moore (&lt;em&gt;The Stupidest Angel, The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove,&lt;/em&gt; et al.) comes a dark -- and wonderfully weird -- novel about a hapless San Francisco thrift shop owner recruited to become a soul collector for the Scythe Wielder himself, Death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie Asher is a typical Beta Male. He's not exceptionally handsome or tall or strong, and he's definitely not the heroic type. But the slightly neurotic Asher has a good life; he owns a secondhand store in San Francisco, and his wife, Rachel, is about to give birth to their first child. Then the unthinkable happens: Asher's wife dies shortly after giving birth to a baby girl. When Asher inexplicably witnesses a Merchant of Death (a seven-foot black dude named Minty Fresh, who sports a green suit and is invisible to everyone else) enter the hospital room and take his wife's soul, he too becomes involved in the soul re-acquisitioning business. Accompanied by two giant hellhounds and his trusty sword-cane, Asher's dirty job leads him to an apocalyptic confrontation with the real forces of darkness  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparable to works from popular satirical authors like Tim Dorsey, Carl Hiaasen, Terry Pratchett, and Paul Di Filippo, Moore's blend of dark fantasy, supernatural mystery, and absurdist fiction will have readers irresistibly hooked from the first page to the last. Chock-full of laugh-out-loud sequences and more than a few profoundly moving morsels of existentialist insight, &lt;em&gt;A Dirty Job&lt;/em&gt; handles some highly sensitive subjects (terminal illness, grief and healing, the afterlife, etc.) with both humor and reverence -- a truly twisted masterwork. &lt;em&gt;Paul Goat Allen&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Get ready to paint the town green."New York Times" bestselling authors Maeve Binchy and Marian Keyes top an impressive roster of the Emerald Isle's most popular women writers as they celebrate the joys and perils of love and the adventure and constancy of female friendships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Maeve Binchy's "Carissima," an ex-pat returns to Ireland and shakes things up for her family, who finds her free spirit scandalous. In "Soulmates," by Marian Keyes, one woman's relationship is so bleedin' perfect that it's driving her friends crazy. In Cathy Kelly's "Thelma, Louise and the Lurve Gods," two women on a madcap Stateside road trip encounter a pair of insanely good-looking men....These fabulous stories and a baker's dozen more prove that when it comes to spinning a good yarn, the Irish are the best in the business.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;em&gt;The Middle Sister&lt;/em&gt; comes a heartwarming tale of second chances and the unparalleled love between mothers and daughters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fifteen-year-old Olivia Jean finds herself in the “family way,” her mother, Daisy, who has never been very maternal, springs into action. Daisy decides that Olivia Jean can’t stay in New York and whisks her away to her grandmother’s farm in Alabama to have the baby–even though Daisy and her mother, Birdie, have been estranged for years. When they arrive, Birdie lays down the law: Sure, her granddaughter can stay, but Daisy will have to stay as well. Though Daisy is furious, she has no choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, under one little roof in the 1960s Deep South, three generations of spirited, proud women are forced to live together. One by one, they begin to lose their inhibitions and share their secrets. And as long-guarded truths emerge, a baby is born–a child with the power to turn these virtual strangers into a real, honest-to-goodness family.</description>

  <description>This is the heart-rending drama of one family's courage, heartbreak, sacrifice, and triumph in confronting an agonizing medical condition, written by two master storytellers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cory Friedman woke up one morning when he was five years old with the uncontrollable urge to twitch his neck and his life was never the same again. From that day forward his life became a hell of uncontrollable tics, urges, and involuntary utterances. Eventually he is diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome and Obsessive Compulsive disorder, and Cory embarks on an excruciating journey from specialist to specialist, enduring countless combinations of medications in wildly varying doses. Soon it becomes unclear what tics are symptoms of his disease and what are side effects of the drugs. The only certainty is that &lt;u&gt;it kept getting worse.&lt;/u&gt; Despite his lack of control, Cory is aware of every embarrassing movement, and sensitive to every person's reaction to his often aggravating presence. Simply put: Cory Friedman's life is a living hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE is the true story of one family's decades-long battle for survival in the face of extraordinary difficulties and a rigid medical establishment.</description>

  <description>5:30 a.m., Brianna Pelletier gets ready for her daily pounding. As she lies on the couch, her dad beats her chest, then her back, coaxing the mucus out of her lungs. The pounding doesn’t take care of everything. Brianna’s held out for a long time, but a body with cystic fibrosis doesn’t last forever. It doesn’t matter that Brianna has a brilliant mathematical mind or that she’s a shoo-in for MIT. Or even that her two best friends are beautiful, popular, and loyal. In the grand scheme of things, none of that stuff matters at all. The standard life, lasting maybe seventy-five years, is no more than a speck in the sum total of the universe. At eighteen, and doubting she’ll make nineteen, Brianna is practically a nonentity. Of course she’s done the math. But in her senior year of high school, Brianna learns of another kind of math, in which an infinitely small, near-zero quantity can have profound effects on an entire system. If these tiny quantities didn’t exist, things wouldn’t make the same sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny, tear-jerking, and memorable, the author’s second novel for teens introduces readers to an extraordinary girl who learns that the meaning of forever can change, and that life – and death – is filled with infinite possibilities.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forever Changes&lt;/em&gt; is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</description>

  <description>An unforgettable debut novel about the way we look at others, and the way we see ourselves.&lt;p&gt; Meghan Ball is both the most visible and the most invisible person in school. Her massive size is impossible to ignore, yet people freely spill their secrets in front of her, perhaps because they think she isn't listening. But she is. Now her attention has turned to a new girl: Aimee Zorn, with her stick-figure body and defiant attitude. Meghan is determined to befriend Aimee, and when she ultimately succeeds, the two join forces to take down their shared enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This provocative story explores the ways in which girls use food and their bodies to say what they cannot: I'm lonely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>More at home in the water than in the company of her own family, a young woman fulfills her unlikely dream of becoming a mermaid. &lt;br&gt; Welcome to Weeki Wachee Springs, located on the beautiful Gulf Coast of Florida. Hailed as the City of Live Mermaids, the fabled Springs has been attracting tourists since 1947, but as of late, business is drying up. As if paying the bills, making constant repairs, and playing den mother and swim coach to a bunch of wayward teenage girls wearing fish tails isn't enough, Miss Thelma Foote now has to find a way to compete with the newly opened Walt Disney Resort and keep Weeki Wachee and its school of mermaids afloat. &lt;br&gt; It's a fresh start for Delores Walker when she steps off the bus in Tampa to become a minimum-wage mermaid. The family fights, the father who walked out on her, and the dingy Bronx apartment are a thousand miles behind her. With her arrival at Weeki Wachee, luck seems to change for everyone. &lt;br&gt; In the tradition of Rebecca Wells, Betsy Carter writes of family and sisterhood, of chasing dreams, and of finding your way as she conjures up a time in America when anything was possible-- even mermaids from the Bronx.</description>

  <description>With a history of childhood loss and tragedy, Arliss Greene grows up to love his cattle more than his family. The memory of his family's displacement, due to TVA's construction of Norris Dam, stays with him as he struggles to make a living farming. His son Daniel tries to distance himself, but an inexplicable attachment to East Tennessee causes him to return to the hilltop where he grew up. He is shocked and disappointed when his wife, Leda, a city girl, ends up working with Arliss, farming the family land. Decisions are made, with repercussions that reverberate throughout their lives, the lives of their children, and the life of the farm from the 1930s to the beginning of the new century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written with an unerring ear for the cadence and language of the South, &lt;em&gt;Harvest&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful, character-driven novel. A story of family, marriage, farming, baseball, the power of memory, and what sustains people through loss, &lt;em&gt;Harvest&lt;/em&gt; is a reckoning of sacrifices and a testament to human resilience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Catherine Landis, the author of the critically lauded BookSense 76 pick &lt;em&gt;Some Days There's Pie&lt;/em&gt;, has written a compelling new novel with an assured Southern inflection and lovingly rendered three-dimensional characters.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the national bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Whistling in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; comes another funny, poignant, unforgettable story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The summer Gibby McGraw catches her big break, the cicadas are humming, and it?s so warm even the frogs are sweating. Brain damaged after a tragic car accident that took both her parents, Gibby is now NQR (Not Quite Right), a real challenge for a fledgling newspaper reporter. Especially when she stumbles upon the dead body of the next governor of Kentucky, Buster Malloy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Armed with her trusty blue spiral note-book, Gibby figures that solving the murder might be her best chance to prove to everyone that she can become Quite Right again. But she gets more than she bargained for when she uncovers a world of corruption, racism, and family secrets in small town Cray Ridge. Lucky for her, she?s also about to discover that some things are far more important than all the brains in the world, and that miracles occur in the most unexpected moments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Acclaimed novelist Anne Rivers Siddons's new novel is a stunning tale of love and loss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For as long as she can remember, they were Cam and Lilly--happily married, totally in love with each other, parents of a beautiful family, and partners in life. Then, after decades of marriage, it ended as every great love story does...in loss. After Cam's death, Lilly takes a lone road trip to her and Cam's favorite spot on the remote coast of Maine, the place where they fell in love over and over again, where their ghosts still dance. There, she looks hard to her past--to a first love that ended in tragedy; to falling in love with Cam; to a marriage filled with exuberance, sheer life, and safety-- to try to figure out her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a journey begun with tender memories and culminating in a revelation that will make Lilly re-evaluate everything she thought was true about her husband and her marriage.</description>

  <description>They came together as sorority sisters on a Southern campus is the '60s: Elegant Kate, walking a tightrope over an abyss of lies ... Sensitive, sensible, self-contained Cecie ... Ginger, the sexy, vibrant heiress, richer than sin ... and poor, hopeless, brilliant Fig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four young women bound by rare, blinding, early friendship -- they spend two idyllic spring breaks at Nag's Head, North Carolina, the isolated strip of barrier islands where grand old weather-beaten houses perch defiantly on the edge of a storm-tossed sea. Now, thirty years later, they are coming back. They are coming back to recapture the exquisite magic of those early years, to experience again the love, enthusiasm, passion, pain, and cruel betrayal that shaped the four young girls into women and set them all adrift on the ... Outer Banks.</description>

  <description>Born mute, speaking only in sign, Edgar Sawtelle leads an idyllic life with his parents on their farm in remote northern Wisconsin. For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose remarkable gift for companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. Edgar seems poised to carry on his family's traditions, but when catastrophe strikes, he finds his once-peaceful home engulfed in turmoil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the Sawtelle farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who accompany him, until the day he is forced to choose between leaving forever or returning home to confront the mysteries he has left unsolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with breathtaking scenes—the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain—&lt;em&gt;The Story of Edgar Sawtelle&lt;/em&gt; is a meditation on the limits of language and what lies beyond, a brilliantly inventive retelling of an ancient story, and an epic tale of devotion, betrayal, and courage in the American heartland.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Belle Cantrell felt guilty about killing her husband and she hated that. Feeling guilty, that is. A lady shouldn't do something she's going to feel guilty about later was a rule Belle kept firmly in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Welcome to the world of beautiful, irrepressible Belle Cantrell, years before she becomes grandmother to Sissy LeBlanc of Loraine Despres' bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Scandalous Summer of Sissy LeBlanc&lt;/em&gt;. It is 1920, prohibition is in full swing, women are clamoring for the vote -- and in the little town of Gentry, Louisiana, narrow-minded intolerance is on the rise. Sent to jail for swimming in an indecent bathing costume with a group of suffragists, Belle Cantrell knows her behavior broke the rules. But sometimes -- most of the time -- she has to twist the rules a little, because they all say the same thing: "Don't."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sexy, sassy story of murder, adultery, romance, bigotry, and regular church attendance, with laugh-out-loud humor and a cast of zany, endearing characters you won't forget, &lt;em&gt;The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell&lt;/em&gt; is a big comic love story . . . and much more.</description>

  <description>An elephant never forgets . . . but can she dream?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For forty-one years, Samson Brown has been caring for Hannah, the lone elephant at the down-at-the-heels Max L. Biedelman Zoo. Having vowed not to retire until an equally loving and devoted caretaker is found to replace him, Sam rejoices when smart, compassionate Neva Wilson is hired as the new elephant keeper. But Neva quickly discovers what Sam already knows: that despite their loving care, Hannah is isolated from other elephants and her feet are nearly ruined from standing on hard concrete all day. Using her contacts in the zookeeping world, Neva and Sam hatch a plan to send Hannah to an elephant sanctuary—just as the zoo's angry, unhappy director launches an aggressive revitalization campaign that spotlights Hannah as the star attraction, inextricably tying Hannah's future to the fate of the Max L. Biedelman Zoo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A charming, poignant, and captivating novel certain to enthrall readers of &lt;em&gt;Water for Elephants&lt;/em&gt;, Diane Hammond's &lt;em&gt;Hannah's Dream&lt;/em&gt; is a beautifully told tale rich in heart, humor, and intelligence.</description>

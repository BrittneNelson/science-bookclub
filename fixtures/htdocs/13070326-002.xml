  <description>Everyone knows that guns are dangerous; they have long been a subject surrounded by controversy. Combine them with sex and you have a subject that is virtually taboo, but smoking hot. This anthology explores the intersection of these two worlds, and the sensual possibilities they inspire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Bounty Hunter&lt;/em&gt;, William Hunt is hot on the trail of lover-turned-outlaw James Campbell. But when William finally catches up with James, bringing him to justice is the last thing on his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changing the Guard&lt;/em&gt; introduces Tomi Vuorela, working security in a frozen off-world outpost. When Andile Harper intrudes on his seclusion, Tomi must determine if the interloper is a harmless workman or a dangerous terrorist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avery Belfour is &lt;em&gt;The Machinist&lt;/em&gt;, kidnapped by a rival colony in need of his services. But the dark and deadly Harrow may have other plans for Avery first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;My Rifle Is Human&lt;/em&gt;, the more a Gunslinger like Fil sexually satisfies his shapeshifting partners, the Ordinances, the more likely they'll survive as weapons on the battlefield. When late-bloomer Morris becomes Fil's latest partner, however, it will take all Fil's patience and skill to seduce and inspire Morris in time for the next wave of attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyler Maxwell from &lt;em&gt;In the Pines&lt;/em&gt;, a former New York cop now working a desk job in Alaska, buys a gun as a present and begins to dream about the mysterious and beautiful Flynn. But Flynn is more than a dream, and Tyler must find the truth before he loses his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, in &lt;em&gt;Compromised Judgment&lt;/em&gt;, Rózsa Ignác is working to uncover a gunrunning operation supplying arms to his enemies. He's certain that Cistalan Konrád is involved, but his attraction to the other man puts himself and the entire investigation in danger.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ugh! I only got to read Cornelia Grey's story before my loan expired and this was ripped from my Kindle (that is what you get for not paying attention!). However, I borrowed this anthology for Cornelia's story so I wasn't too upset. <br /><br />"Bounty Hunter" was a darker read than I expected, but excellent...]]>

  <description>The weather outside is frightful, but this Minnesota northwoods cabin is getting pretty hot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stylist Frankie Blackburn never meant to get lost in Logan, Minnesota, but his malfunctioning GPS felt otherwise, and a record-breaking snowfall ensures he won’t be heading back to Minneapolis anytime soon. Being rescued by three sexy lumberjacks is fine as a fantasy, but in reality the biggest of the bears is awfully cranky and seems ready to gobble Frankie right up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Gardner wasn’t always a lumberjack—once a high-powered Minneapolis lawyer, he’s come home to Logan to lick his wounds, not play with a sassy city twink who might as well have stepped directly out of his past. But as the northwinds blow and guards come down, Frankie and Marcus find they have a lot more in common than they don’t. Could the man who won’t live in the country and the man who won’t go back to the city truly find a home together? Because the longer it snows, the deeper they fall in love, and all they want for Christmas is each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains power outages, excessive snowfall, and incredibly sexy bears.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When a tornado meets a volcano, nothing is safe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soldier of fortune Prophet Drews always worked alone—until Tom Boudreaux became his partner. But when Tom walked away three months ago, ostensibly to keep Prophet safe, Prophet learned the true meaning of &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; alone. Everyone knows that Prophet, a Navy SEAL turned CIA spook turned mercenary, can look after himself. Which means he must’ve driven his lover away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with half a world between them, Prophet can’t get the man out of his head. Maybe that’s why he’s in New Orleans in the middle of a hurricane, protecting Tom’s aunt. But the only looter around is Tom, bursting back into Prophet’s life. It turns out that Prophet’s been stuck in &lt;em&gt;Tom’s&lt;/em&gt; head—and heart—too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their explosive reunion gets even hotter when Tom is arrested for murder. As they fight to clear his name, they delve deep into his past, finding enemies among everyone they meet. Staying alive in such a dangerous world is hard enough, but they soon discover that fighting to stay together is the most difficult thing they’ve ever done.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From acclaimed author Katie McGarry comes an explosive new tale of a good girl with a reckless streak, a street-smart guy with nothing to lose, and a romance forged in the fast lane.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The girl with straight As, designer clothes and the perfect life—that's who people expect Rachel Young to be. So the private-school junior keeps secrets from her wealthy parents and overbearing brothers...and she's just added two more to the list. One involves racing strangers down dark country roads in her Mustang GT. The other? Seventeen-year-old Isaiah Walker-a guy she has no business even talking to. But when the foster kid with the tattoos and intense gray eyes comes to her rescue, she can't get him out of her mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isaiah has secrets, too. About where he lives, and how he really feels about Rachel. The last thing he needs is to get tangled up with a rich girl who wants to slum it on the south side for kicks-no matter how angelic she might look. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when their shared love of street racing puts both their lives in jeopardy, they have six weeks to come up with a way out. Six weeks to discover just how far they'll go to save each other.</description>

  <description>Evan Costa learned from a very early age that there was no such thing as unconditional love and that it was better to settle for what you could get instead of expecting the world to give you what you need. As Ethan, porn model for Johnnies, he gets exactly what he wants—comradeship and physical contact on trade—and he is perfectly satisfied with that. He’s sure of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah Stevens has spent most of his adult life helping to care for his sister and trying to keep his beleaguered family from fraying at the edges. He’s had very little time to work on his confidence or his body for that matter. When Jonah meets Ethan, he doesn’t see the hurt child or the shamelessly slutty porn star. He sees a funny, sexy, confident man who—against the odds—seems to like Jonah in spite of his very ordinary, but difficult, life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sensing a kindred spirit and a common interest, Ethan thinks a platonic friendship with Jonah won’t violate his fair trade rules of sex and touch, but Jonah has different ideas. Ethan’s pretty sure his choice of jobs has stripped away all hope of a real relationship, but Jonah wants the whole package—the sexy man, the vulnerable boy, the charming companion who works so hard to make other people happy. Jonah wants to prove that underneath the damage Ethan has lived with all his life, he’s still gold with promise and the ability to love.</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />I'm a tiny bit conflicted about this book. On one hand, Amy Lane's angst-filled books are like chocolate for me. I can't get enough. I loved her tormented main characters and their fight for their happy endings. Ethan is no different. I really liked the bones of this story- the ideas...]]>

  <description>*Contains Spoilers for Unacceptable Risk - Hidden Wolves book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul Hunter just spent two days as a captive to werewolves, his life hanging in the balance, a witness to crimes and craziness. Now he's back in his regular life, and living with Simon, the man he's been falling for. And he's part of a werewolf pack. He needs his brain to somehow catch up with all of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon thought saving his human mate from his own pack would be the hardest thing he'd face with Paul, but he's beginning to realize that was just the beginning. He has to figure out how their future will work, and convince his skittish lover that staying with the pack is better than leaving it, while hints of threats to Paul's safety keep him awake at night. Fortunately Simon is up for the challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This is a significantly expanded version of the short story "Interlude" that was previously on my website)</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Becoming Alpha made Aaron responsible for protecting his new pack against outside threats, but fighting his own desires might pose an even bigger challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Aaron took down a crazy dominant wolf and inherited half a pack, he knew the Alpha job wasn't going to be easy. A week later, he's finding out what an understatement that was. Having a gay wolf in his pack brings lethal threats from other werewolves. Then humans locate his wolves and move in to try to capture and exploit one of them. Aaron has enough pressure and demands without letting his long-suppressed sexuality escape his rigid control. But keeping his distance from a young man who appeals to all his senses could be Aaron's biggest challenge.</description>

  <description>When his regular masseuse is called away on a family emergency, Tomas does not expect Darren, her temporary replacement, to be such an attractive distraction. Tomas has always been a serious, no-nonsense type of swimmer;  after all, elite competition leaves no room for unprofessional conduct. However, he finds it extremely difficult to stay on the right side of the professional line with Darren tending to his needs.</description>

  <description>THE YEAR was 1882, and the last of the native tribes had dropped to their knees and slipped on their yokes under the boots and guns of the US Cavalry. The Blackfoot were the last, and then the buffalo hunt failed. The vast plains were barren and empty, and the people began to starve. Desperation spread like poison across the land. Evil men, seeing their chance, fed on the hunger, ate the clean hearts of the people. The blood that was spilled in 1882 has not been avenged today. The ghosts are waiting for someone to set them free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert looked over to the corner of the porch. Their old fishing poles were leaning against the screen. He carried them back to his chair, started untangling the nylon fishing line. Val’s pole was for serious fishermen, a supple thin Orvis fly rod with a reel full of braided yellow nylon. His pole was cheap, from Wal-Mart, with a soft cork handle and a reel with a sticky thumb button. Val laughed when he saw it, said it was for little boys fishing at reservoirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He put Val’s pole back in the corner, carried his down the slope to the river bank. It took him a little while to find his balance again. He didn’t try to get into the water. That would probably be too much for his shaky leg. But after a few casts he got his rhythm again, let the weight fly out low over the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a splash a bit upriver, and a moment later a young man appeared, walking down the middle of the shallow river from rock to rock in green hip waders, dressed in the dark green uniform of Fish and Wildlife. He had a fishing pole over his shoulder and a woven oak creel. From the weight of it on his shoulder, Robert could see he’d had some luck. He was Indian, Blackfoot, maybe, and his long hair was tied back at his collar. He raised a hand in greeting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert nodded back. “Evening.” He reeled in his line, and the man watched the red and white bobber bouncing across the water in front of him.&lt;br&gt;The man’s face was impassive, but he blinked a couple of times when he watched the line come out of the water, bobber, lead weight, no hook. No fish. “I guess I don’t need to ask you if you have a fishing license,” the man said. “Since you aren’t really fishing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert nodded to the creel over the man’s shoulder. “Looks like you’ve had some luck.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man eased the basket off his shoulder, dipped it down into the icy river water. “Yes, I sure did.” He slapped the Fish and Wildlife patch on his uniform shirt. “Course, I don’t need no stinkin’ license! Just another example of the generalized corruption of the Federal Government.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert grinned at him. “Wonder how many times you hear that in the course of a week? We must be in Idaho! I’m Robert Mitchell.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man reached for his hand and they shook. “I’m Cody Calling Eagle.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Some mistakes are worth making.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reclusive comic book artist Trip Spector spends his life doodling super-square, straitlaced superheroes, hiding from his fans, and crushing on his unattainable boss until he meets the dork of his dreams. Silas Goolsby is a rowdy FX makeup creator with a loveless love life and a secret streak of geek who yearns for unlikely rescues and a truly creative partnership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against their better judgment, they fall victim to chemistry, and what starts as infatuation quickly grows tender and terrifying. With Silas’s help, Trip gambles his heart and his art on a rotten plan: sketching out Scratch, a “very graphic novel” that will either make his name or wreck his career. But even a smash can't save their world if Trip retreats into his mild-mannered rut, leaving Silas to grapple with betrayal and emotions he can't escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What will it take for this dynamic duo to discover that heroes never play it safe?</description>

  <description>Everyone expects her to succeed...&lt;br&gt;Karen plays the cello like an angel, and it’s the only thing that makes her truly feel alive. But her father’s dream—for her to join a prestigious orchestra—leaves no time in her life for anything but music...not even love. Trapped on her path, she doesn’t know how to rebel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone expects him to fail...&lt;br&gt;Connor plays rock guitar like the devil himself, and his ability has got him all the way from a dead-end life in Belfast to a scholarship at Fenbrook Academy. But beneath his arrogance and charm, he doesn’t believe he has what it takes. He’s spent his time in New York drinking and partying, and the only future he sees is a return to Ireland as soon as he flunks out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what no one expects...&lt;br&gt;When Karen’s duet partner is injured, the bad boy guitarist and the shy, sheltered cellist are forced to team up. Neither likes the idea, but what begins as anger and distrust slowly spirals into love...and lust. If they can face up to their feelings, they might just have a chance together. If Connor will allow Karen to stop his fall, maybe he can show her a life she never thought possible...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This New Adult Romance is recommended for readers 17+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note for readers of Dance For Me&lt;br&gt;A self-contained romance with no cliffhanger ending, this book focuses on Karen and Connor, but Natasha, Darrell, Clarissa, Neil and Jasmine from Dance For Me all appear as well.</description>

  <description>Adam Craig is burned out.  Lead singer of the hard rock band Black Varen, he's tired of the empty life of groupies, paparazzi, and hotel rooms.  Worse, a life in the closet.  After the final concert of their latest tour, he flees the after-party in pursuit of memories of lost summers and carefree days, until he passes out on the patio of a shuttered lake resort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles Caldwell is a brilliant artist, tied by agoraphobia and social anxiety to his family's lodge.  Alone but for his parrot, he spends his days illuminating manuscripts and hiding from the complexities of life.  When he discovers Adam asleep in a deck chair, he's furious but intrigued.  Adam soon charms his way into Miles' bed, and they lose themselves in a summer idyll, safe from the compromises and claims of reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Adam's life, with all its demands, is waiting for him.  And Miles, uncertain of Adam's true feelings, is battling demons of his own.  Somehow, the man who's never home and the man who never leaves it must find the strength to fight for a future together.</description>

  <description>Ten years and many boyfriends later, Cassidy Winters finally returns to the ancestral home of his grandmother, Sadie Hart, despite the best efforts of his father to prevent it. Cassidy's plans of a quiet, seaside ceremony to wish a final farewell to Sadie quickly unravel as interruptions run roughshod beginning with Neil who walks out of the ocean and straight into Cassidy’s bed. The dominos topple one by one when the little dog he rescues from the hounds of hell brings him to Ben, the hunky vet who rescues Cassidy right back. News of his arrival spreads faster than Cassidy’s legs, bringing his boyhood friend and first love Nate Sommers to his doorstep – leaving Cassidy spiraling into a multi-layered love snafu. As if the island wasn’t getting crowded enough for Cassidy’s good taste and bad decisions, best friends Ollie and Spencer arrive in time to witness the uninvited return of Cassidy’s most recent ex, Teddy, who’s refusing to stay dumped. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fists fly and all hell breaks loose amid mojitos and martinis as Cassidy finds himself planning a huge party to celebrate Sadie's life. Accusations are aimed as arguments and libidos boil over, but even through the chaos Cassidy knows exactly what he wants. While he's certainly willing, he isn’t sure if he's ready or able for love and life... &lt;br&gt;At Pipers Point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Copyright 2010 Ethan Day. All Rights Reserved.</description>

  <description>Josh knew the night shift at the Quik-Mart would be full of freaks and geeks—and that was &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the hell portal opened in the parking lot. Still, he likes to think he can roll with things. Sure, the zombies make a mess sometimes, but at least they never reach for anything more threatening than frozen burritos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, it’s not all lizard-monsters and the walking dead. There’s also the mysterious hottie with the sly red lips and a taste for sweets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh has had the hots for Hot Guy since the moment he laid eyes on him, and it seems Hot Guy might be sweet on Josh too. Now if only Josh could figure out whether that’s a good thing, a bad thing, or something in between. After all, with a hell vortex just a stone’s throw away, Josh has learned to take nothing at face value—even if it’s a very, very pretty face.</description>

  <description>Everyone knows that Prophet—former Navy SEAL, former CIA spook, full-time pain in the ass—works alone and thinks only about the trouble he can cause. But his boss, Phil Butler of Extreme Escapes, LTD., has just assigned Proph not only a new partner but also a case haunted by ghosts from Proph’s past. Suddenly, he’s got to confront them both head on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tom Boudreaux—failed FBI agent, failed sheriff, full time believer in bad luck—is wondering why the head of a private contracting firm has hunted him down to offer him a job.  Still he's determined to succeed this time, despite being partnered with Prophet, EE, LTD’s most successful, lethal, and annoying operative, and even though the case is also resurrecting his own painful past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, Prophet and Tom must find a way to take down killers in the dangerous world of underground cage matches, while fighting their own dangerous attraction. And when they find themselves caught in the crossfire, these two loners are forced to trust each other and work together to escape their ghosts . . . or pay the price.</description>

  <description>Will Connors is struggling to hold together a failing farm; his wife has died, his son has gone, he's not without enemies and he's dealing with the after-effects of a debilitating accident.  It's a life of toil which doesn't allow for very much pleasure, and he's in danger of becoming embittered until a chance acquaintance wanders back into his life and everything begins to change.  The problem, however, is that John Anderson has a price on his head - and, very soon, Will and John find themselves desperately concealing more than one dangerous secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Devil in Dead Horse, sequel to End of the Trail, is now available!

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;It took some guts to pose for this photo. But I wanted to be true to my desires at last, and yeah, impress this guy I met. In my street clothes, most people wouldn't even guess I am gay and those who know assume I am a top, but I am not. This guy, he is really cute, quite petite, and kind of flamboyant, but he has a core of steel. Perhaps he is the one who will see me as I am and complete me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;The man in the photograph wears black stockings and lace suspenders, and his back is to the camera. He also wears leather: gloves, a belt cinched around his arm, and a double strapped harness over his shoulder and looping around his waist. Under the ankh tattoo in the small of his back, his ass is bare, and a faint blush of pink from a spanking is barely visible…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A rich portrait of post-Victorian England, &lt;em&gt;The Deepest Night&lt;/em&gt; seamlessly blends thrilling romance with riveting history and adventure—perfect for fans of Libba Bray and Lauren Kate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s 1915, and sixteen-year-old Lora Jones is finishing up her first year as a charity student at Iverson, a prestigious, gothic boarding school on England’s southern coast. While she’s always felt different from everyone around her, now she finally knows why: She is a drákon, a rare, enchanted being with astonishing magical abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As war hits Britain’s shores, and Lora reels from an unimaginable loss, she finds that her powers come with grave and dangerous responsibilities. At the request of Armand Louis, the darkly mysterious boy whose father owns Iverson, Lora will spend her summer at his lavish estate. To help the war effort—and to keep Lora by his side—Armand turns his home into a military hospital, where Lora will serve as a nurse. For Armand is inescapably drawn to her—bound to her by heart-deep secrets and a supernatural connection that runs thicker than blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet while Lora tries to sort out her own feelings toward Armand, fate offers an unexpected surprise. Lora discovers there is another drákon, a prisoner of war being held in Germany. And that only she, with her newly honed Gifts, will be able to rescue him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Armand, Lora will cross enemy lines on an incredible mission—one that could bond her to Armand forever, or irrevocably tear them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully written, deeply romantic, and filled with daring adventure and magic, &lt;em&gt;The Deepest Night&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing novel of the enduring pull of destiny, and the eternal strength of love.</description>

  <description>Part of the  &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11278174-first-time-for-everything"&gt;First Time For Everything Daily Dose 2011 collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zack and Larry have been best friends since middle school and are now college roommates. But when Larry hears that other guys they know are getting paid to have gay sex on camera, he convinces Zack that they could pick up some quick, easy cash by being in one of these films… together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Zack thinks making a gay porn film with his best friend is disturbing, he is absolutely horrified when Larry proposes they “rehearse” for the film so they won’t be nervous in front of the director. As the they fumble their way through a checklist of sexual positions and acts, Zack finds himself seeing Larry in an entirely new light—a very sexy new light, and possibly a romantic one, as well. But does Larry feel the same? Or is this all for easy money?</description>

  <description>My name is Etan, and I am Adorned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A living piece of art, I exist to please the divine rulers of Kered. With nowhere to turn after my father died, I tried my luck in the capital city. Little did I know how quickly I would be robbed, beaten and forced to sell myself into servitude. But I was lucky enough to gain the attention of Roberd Tallisk, an irascible but intriguing tattoo artist who offered to mark me with enchanted ink for the enjoyment of the nobles. I was given a chance to better my station in life, and I could not refuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the divine rulers want not only the art but the body that bears it. In their company I can rise above the dregs of society and experience a life most only dream of, at the cost of suffering their every desire as a pawn in games of lavish intrigue. Their attention is flattering, but I find I'd rather have Tallisk's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught between factions, I learn that a revolution is brewing, one that could ruin Kered—and Roberd and myself along with it…</description>

  <description>Everyone enjoys peace and tranquility, and Victor Bayne is no exception. He goes to great lengths to maintain a harmonious home with his partner, Jacob. Although the cannery is huge, it’s grown difficult to avoid the elephant in the room…the elephant with the letters FPMP scrawled on its hide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once Jacob surrendered his PsyCop badge, he infiltrated the Federal Psychic Monitoring Program. In his typical restrained fashion, he hasn’t been sharing much about what he actually does behind its vigilantly guarded doors. And true to form, Vic hasn’t asked. In fact, he would prefer not to think about the FPMP at all, since he’s owed Director Dreyfuss an exorcism since their private flight to PsyTrain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Vic has successfully avoided FPMP entanglement for several months, now his debt has finally come due.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Love is the greatest outlaw of all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vali Florescu, heir to a powerful local boyar, flees his father’s cruelty to seek his fortune in the untamed Carpathian forests. There he expects to fight ferocious bandits and woo fair maidens to prove himself worthy of returning to depose his tyrannical father. But when he is ambushed by Mihai Roscat, the fearsome Crimson Outlaw, he discovers that he’s surprisingly happy to be captured and debauched instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mihai, once an honoured knight, has long sought revenge against Vali’s father, Wadim, who killed his lord and forced him into a life of banditry. Expecting his hostage to be a resentful, spoiled brat, Mihai is unprepared for the boy to switch loyalties, saving the lives of villagers and of Mihai himself during one of Wadim’s raids. Mihai is equally unprepared for the attraction between them to deepen into love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vali soon learns that life outside the castle is not the fairy tale he thought, and happy endings must be earned. To free themselves and their people from Wadim’s oppression, Vali and Mihai must forge their love into the spear-point of a revolution and fight for a better world for all.</description>

  <description>History grad James Sheridan thinks his biggest problem in life is trying to find a suitable outfit for his upcoming Ph.D. candidacy exam. That is, until he accidentally texts a changing-room selfie meant for his fashionable sister to his ex, the domineering Professor Carson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James and Carson haven’t seen each since James fled their power games two years ago. Back in his undergrad days, Carson was his Professor, and not just in the academic sense: a man of unusual tastes and extreme sexual demands, James had been happy to sate Carson’s savage appetites. Too happy, in fact. He never could trust himself not to let Carson push too far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now James is older and wiser, and sharing some seriously flirtatious vibes with a cute menswear rep. When Carson replies to James’s errant text, ready to pick up where they left off, James can’t help being drawn back into Carson’s control. It’s only when Carson suggests involving the salesman that James has to ask himself how far is too far, and whether he’s willing to go there with Carson again.</description>

  <description>Is seeing really believing? Hank would never dream of coming on to the most striking guy at the bar—but it’s his lucky night since Thomas, the burgundy-haired vision in black lipstick and mirrored shades, takes it upon himself to make the first move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the encounter itself is mind-blowing, the hot-and-heavy grapple in the janitor’s closet isn’t the only way in which Thomas blows Hank’s mind.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A fresh, meaty, sink-your-teeth-in-and-hold-on-tight new adult fantasy series kicks off with King Hall…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;King Hall — where the Mysticals go to learn their craft, get their degrees, and transition into adulthood. And where four new Rulers will rise and meet their destinies.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lily Ruckler is adept at one thing:  survival.  Born a Mystical hybrid, her mere existence is forbidden, but her nightmare is only about to start. Fluke, happenstance, and a deep personal loss finds Lily deeply entrenched with those who would destroy her simply for existing — The Mystical Kings.  Being named future Queen of the Shifters shoves Lily into the spotlight, making her one of the most visible Mysticals in the world. But with risk comes a certain solace — her burgeoning friendships with the other three Prodigies: a wicked Vampire, a wild-child Mage, and a playboy Elemental. Backed by their faith and trust, Lily begins to relax into her new life. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Then chaos erupts as the fragile peace between Commoners and Mysticals is broken, and suddenly Lily realises the greatest threat was never from within, and her fear takes on a new name: the revolution. </description>

  <description>A prequel to &lt;em&gt;Shivaree&lt;/em&gt;. The third and final book in the series, &lt;em&gt;Getaway&lt;/em&gt;, will be out on January 5, 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane thinks he's simply auditioning a new musician for his bar, but when Gabriel saunters into the Shivaree it becomes clear the man has more to offer than just his talent. Gabriel's got sexual charisma potent enough to make a straight man such as Shane lose his senses, lose sleep, lose himself to dark desires and not want to find his way back to reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is not a love story. This is a story about an unforeseen attraction that brings a strong, sane man to his knees, and about lovers tangled up in each other too deep to know who's in control and who's helpless.</description>

  <description>Austin thinks driving a 1989 Geo Spectrum fourteen hundred miles in the middle of winter is a bad idea. But he would never forgive himself if the man he loved, Zach Roth, got himself killed in Idaho, so he agrees to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, he has something to prove. He wants Zach to know that its more than just Zach’s deliciously wicked body he adores. And if it takes spending Hanukkah in Zach's Grandma’s old hatchback to prove it, then so be it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever the optimist, Zach believes everything will turn out for the best. But bad weather, robberies, blown gaskets, run-ins with the police and motel bedspreads of questionable cleanliness seem to conspire against them, and they may need eight days of miracles just to keep each other and their romance alive.</description>

  <description>‘Fasten your seatbelts for another round of domestic adventures with houseboy Gillibran Brown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his own words: ‘think of me as a gay male version of Flora Thompson writing not so much about Larkrise to Candleford as Arsehole to Breakfast Time. The BBC will never commission it as a series, but there you go, it’s their loss.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gilli walks, talks and quips us through another year with his beloved dictators Dick and Shane.</description>

      <![CDATA[Spending some time with Gilli is like comfort reading for me. I feel like I know him on a deep, intimate level. It feels familiar and it is very easy to become wrapped up in Gilli's life. <br /><br />I love the dynamic between Gilli and his daddies. I, like Gilli, always want more out of Shane, but I see wha...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Between Moonlight and Luck...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;u&gt;free&lt;/u&gt; collection of three vignettes, occurring after &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11997139-moonlight-becomes-you"&gt;Moonlight Becomes You&lt;/a&gt;, but before &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13345731-the-luckiest"&gt;The Luckiest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath–&lt;/strong&gt; "It felt so perfect. They were finally touching the way it was meant to be. No anger, no resentment, just wonder."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affirmation–&lt;/strong&gt; "The last leg of the tour, after that concert at Madison Square Garden, had been like a fantasy. Part of him still expected that any second he'd wake up and it would've all been a dream."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allegiance–&lt;/strong&gt; "He started walking, feeling a little unsteady on his feet, with only one thought in his mind: snagging a bottle of tequila from the bar and getting up to the room he’d been given for the night."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Moonlight Becomes You&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count:&lt;/strong&gt; 10,500 (approx)</description>

  <description>For weeks, college student Casper has been the victim of sail-by goosing and groping. The problem is that Casper would very much like to get more than groped by those wonderful, big, hot hands. With a journal full of clues, he sets out to discover who his mystery groper is. He may, however, be in serious trouble once he discovers the ominous identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hot Hands is the first of five in a series of short stories, called ‘College Fun and Gays’. Each story is independent of the others and each covers a deep issue. Hot Hands focuses on the effects of high school bullying for being gay. Except for Hot Hands and its sequel, Cold Hands, they can be read in any order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This title was previously published with a different cover.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Few authors have had careers as successful as that of Connie Willis. Inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame and recently awarded the title of Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Willis is still going strong. Her smart, heartfelt fiction runs the gamut from screwball comedy to profound tragedy, combining dazzling plot twists, cutting-edge science, and unforgettable characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a near future mourning the extinction of dogs to an alternate history in which invading aliens were defeated by none other than Emily Dickinson; from a madcap convention of bumbling quantum physicists in Hollywood to a London whose Underground has become a storehouse of intangible memories both foul and fair—here are the greatest stories of one of the greatest writers working in any genre today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All ten of the stories gathered here are Hugo or Nebula award winners—some even have the distinction of winning both. With a new Introduction by the author and personal afterwords to each story—plus a special look at three of Willis’s unique public speeches—this is unquestionably the collection of the season, a book that every Connie Willis fan will treasure, and, to those unfamiliar with her work, the perfect introduction to one of the most accomplished and best-loved writers of our time.</description>

  <description>Natasha is one of the most promising ballet dancers at the prestigious Fenbrook Academy of Performing Arts and she’s just landed a life-changing audition. But no one knows the guilt she carries...or the damage it makes her inflict on herself when she’s alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darrell is a multi-millionaire designer at 25. But past traumas have pushed him into isolation and the intense pressure of his work has brought him to the edge of burnout. Seeking inspiration, he sees Natasha dance and hires her as his muse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she dances for him, the two become entwined in a passionate but troubled relationship. He starts to see the pain inside her and helps her gradually lower her defenses...but Darrell has demons of his own. Can two broken people save each other? Or will the darkness they’re hiding consume them both?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This New Adult Romance is recommended for 17+ due to mature themes, sexual situations and language.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Length: 9 hrs and 48 mins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years undercover with one of the worst gangs in the country left FBI agent Joshua Chastain shattered. Battling nightmares and addiction, he leaves the concrete jungle for New Mexico horse country, hoping to start over on his uncle's ranch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foreman Eli Kelly spends his life rehabilitating abused animals, and Joshua is just another lost soul. But as Joshua slowly begins to put his life back together, Eli realizes that Joshua is a lot more than his newest project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joshua's plan seems to work - maybe a fresh start was just what he needed. Then, just when he has finally found a sense of peace, crime and hatred nearly destroy all his hard work forcing him to reevaluate what he wants out of his relationship with Eli and his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2013 Rowan Speedwell (P)2014 Dreamspinner Press</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />This is a short, enjoyable fairytale, done Roux-style. What do I mean by that? Though it is a fantasy and it starts off with a sweet, etherial atmosphere, it quickly becomes more sarcastic and banter-y, like many Roux books. And that isn't a bad thing. I found myself grinning through...]]>

      <![CDATA[This was one unique little book! It was a ghostly paranormal that went from sweet to creepy and back, and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was very well written, and had some twists and turns that I didn't see coming. A very nice short read for those interested in the afterlife.  ]]>

  <description>Tracey Garvis Graves - and Anna and T.J. - return in this companion novella to the New York Times bestseller On the Island&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When twenty-three-year-old dot-com millionaire Owen Sparks walked away from his charmed life, he had one goal in mind: get as far away as possible from the people who resented his success, or had their hand out for a piece of it.  A remote uncharted island halfway around the world seemed like a perfectly logical place to get away from it all.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calia Reed wasn't part of Owen's plans.  The beautiful British girl - on holiday in the Maldives with her brother, James - made Owen wonder if getting away from it all might be a lot more enjoyable with a carefree girl who didn't know anything about the life he left behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Owen had no idea how much his carefully detailed plans would go awry.  Nor did he realize that a decision he made would have such a catastrophic effect on two passengers who boarded a plane in Chicago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when Owen shows up at Anna and T.J.'s door with an incredible story to tell, everyone involved will learn just how much their lives are intertwined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uncharted includes an early look at Covet, coming September 2013.</description>

  <description>Danny Bright was born to entertain. He just needs his big break. So when he hears that Blue Horizon Records is holding auditions looking for the next big thing, Danny jumps at the chance. It doesn’t turn out exactly as he imagined, though. Instead of getting solo contracts, Danny and four other guys are put into a boy band.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Innocent, idealistic Elliot Price thinks he’s headed for college. An impulsive decision to sing in the local talent search changes all that. A bigwig producer happens to see him, hands him a business card, and turns Elliot’s life upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elliot and Danny are close from the beginning. They love all the guys, but it’s different with each other. Soon their friendship turns into feelings more intense than either of them can ignore. The other three boys only want Danny and Elliot to be happy, but when their management team and record label discover two of their biggest tween heartthrobs are in a relationship, they’re less than pleased. Danny and Elliot find themselves in the middle of a circle of lies and cover-ups, all with one bottom line—money. They have to stay strong and stick together if they don’t want to lose themselves… and each other.</description>

  <description>Ever since his partner died, Frank has resigned himself to staying single. He wards off the loneliness by spending time with friends on the paintball field and running his high-end brothel, the Market Garden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After one of his most lucrative rentboys quits, Frank is thrilled when a gorgeous replacement walks through the door. A former US soldier, Stefan is hot, bold, and perfect for the Market Garden’s clientele, especially those with a thing for camouflage and drill sergeants. He's perfect for Frank, too, except Frank has a rule about not getting involved with his own rentboys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During a frisky game of paintball, Stefan makes it clear that he doesn't care about the rules. Not the rules of the game, and definitely not Frank's refusal to get involved. He captures Frank on the field using stealth and cunning, and makes it clear that he’ll do anything to keep a hold of him off the field too.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;If it flies, drives, or fornicates, it’s cheaper to rent it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spencer is in a rut. Long hours at the law firm are sucking the life out of him, and he doesn’t have time or energy for a relationship. He’s lonely, horny, and itching for something new, so he tries the Market Garden, an exclusive—and expensive—brothel. Spencer isn’t in the door five minutes before a cocky rentboy makes his move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick isn’t just any rentboy, though. He’s a Dom, he’s a sadist, and he’s everything Spencer didn’t know he was missing. One night turns into more, and before long, Spencer is one of Nick’s regular clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both men think they’re just scratching each other’s backs: Spencer’s exploring a submissive, masochistic side he never knew he had, and Nick is getting off and getting paid. But as time goes on, it’s clear their strictly professional arrangement . . . isn’t, and if Nick has one hard limit, it’s that he doesn’t get romantically entangled with his johns. The problem is, while Nick doesn't want to be owned, Spencer’s no longer content with just renting.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Turnabout is foreplay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High-end Market Garden rentboys Tristan and Jared have found their niche. Men are willing to pay good money to watch Tristan tease Jared, and the two of them seduce London’s elite with sex and power games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except Tristan is less and less interested in getting money out of the johns these days. He wants his partner in crime, and he wants the seduction to be real. But is Jared just in this for the pay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rolex, the john who started it all, returns to Market Garden, the boys jump on the opportunity to service him—and each other—for a fresh pile of cash. Rolex isn’t the only one itching for a rematch, though. Jared’s been waiting for a chance to get back at Tristan for teasing him so mercilessly the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And for a former stripper, revenge is a dish best served extra hot.</description>

  <description>In freshman year, Riley Evans met the best friends he ever thought he'd have, Jason and Eric. But then his friendship with Eric turned into something much more. That relationship ended almost as soon as it began, and Riley hasn't let anyone near his heart since. Until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Riley needed him most, Jason helped pick up the pieces. Six years later, he's once again part of Riley's life. Riley is slowly letting Jason past his defenses and is starting to see how good they are together. They're even planning a romantic weekend getaway. Then, out of the blue, Eric calls, claiming he wants Riley back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley has been dreaming about Eric for six years, but suddenly he can't he stop thinking of Jason. Jason, who has always been there when Riley needs him-who puts Riley's happiness above his own, even if that means his own heart will suffer. Jason insists Riley face his old feelings for Eric to make sure they're really gone. But are they? If Riley can't learn from his mistakes, he may be destined to repeat them-and Jason won't wait forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;They aren’t real; at least that’s what I was always told. Yet here I am, bound and at their mercy. I have no memory of how I got here. I know that I’m supposed to be afraid and ashamed of the things they do to me, but the thing is, I’ve never felt safer or more loved in my entire life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Three elves crowd around a captured human. The human is bound and gagged; chains attached to his collar restrain him to the floor, and his hands are cuffed behind his back. The elves are all clothed but the human’s clothing has been torn away, rendering him naked and vulnerable. Each elf is tall, slender, and elegant, with long flowing hair. All three elves are reaching out toward their captive human, beginning to explore his body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It's all fun and games until somebody falls in love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase has just arrived at a much anticipated leather convention, and he’s about to lose his mind. Not only is his ex attending, but Chase is also rooming with Derek, a submissive he’s been dying to top. Although Derek is in search of a Dom, he made it painfully clear when the two of them hooked up for a very hot—but very vanilla—night just before the convention that he wasn’t interested in submitting to Chase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derek isn’t stupid. No matter how desperate he is to submit to Chase, he wants no part of a rebound relationship. As long as Chase is still pining after the sub who broke his heart a few months ago, Derek’s keeping him at arm’s length. Besides, there’s another Dom at this convention, the gorgeous Master Raul, who Derek is determined to attract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Chase and Derek are confronted with all their kinks, from ropes to leather, bondage to flogging—not to mention each other—they can only ignore their mutual attraction for so long.</description>

  <description>It’s a good thing Gabe Bristow lives and breathes the Navy SEAL credo, “the only easy day was yesterday,” because today, his life is unrecognizable. When his prestigious career comes to a crashing halt, he’s left with a bum leg and few prospects for employment that don’t include a desk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until he’s offered the chance to command a private hostage rescue team and free a wealthy American businessman from Colombian paramilitary rebels. It seems like a good deal—until he meets his new team: a drunk Cajun linguist, a boy-genius CIA threat analyst, an FBI negotiator with mob ties, a cowboy medic, and an EOD expert as volatile as the bombs he defuses. Oh, and who could forget the sexy, frustratingly impulsive Audrey Van Amee? She’s determined to help rescue her brother—or drive Gabe crazy. Whichever comes first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the death toll rises, Gabe’s team of delinquents must figure out how to work together long enough to save the day. Or, at least, not get themselves killed.Because Gabe’s finally found something worth living for, and God help him if he can’t bring her brother back alive.</description>

  <description>Thanks to Collin Montes, Theta Alpha Gamma now welcomes gay and bisexual students. Persuading his Uncle Monty, president of the TAG Alumni Association, that the open approach won’t adversely affect TAG’s reputation is Collin’s own first step toward coming out. As long as there are no repercussions, he’ll escape the closet by graduation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter repercussions, stage left: someone rigs the TAG House water heater to launch through the ceiling, then plants a bomb—thankfully unsuccessful—in the fraternity’s basement. Now Collin has his hands full not only trying to convince his uncle that this might not be the work of homophobes, but also dealing with a fratful of brothers worried about their kegger fridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paramedic Eric Dixon can’t stop thinking about the kid he met during a call at his former college fraternity house. The age gap between them is trumped by sexy eyes, so when Eric sees Collin again at the bomb scene, he pursues him. Soon, Eric is dreaming of being a househusband, fighting to keep Collin safe from whoever’s trying to destroy the fraternity, and helping his sweet young thang realize that repercussions sometimes have silver linings.</description>

  <description>When Jonathan Kechter agrees to a blind date with Cole Fenton, he expects nothing more than dinner and a one-night stand... but he gets more than he bargained for in Cole. Cole is arrogant, flamboyant, and definitely not Jon’s type. Still, when Cole suggests an arrangement of getting together for casual sex whenever they're both in town, Jon readily agrees. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their arrangement may be casual, but Jonathan soon learns that when it comes to Cole Fenton, nothing is easy. Between Cole’s fear of intimacy and his wandering lifestyle, Jonathan wonders if their relationship may be doomed from the start—but the more Cole pushes him away, the more determined Jon is to make it work.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a very lovely romance from my new favorite woman, Marie Sexton. I didn't love Cole and Jonathan together at first and I wasn't sure how she would turn this book around. Slowly but surely, I fell for these characters and saw what all the fuss was about. <br /><br />Now did I love this as much as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7493186.Promises" title="Promises by Marie Sexton">Prom...</a>]]>

  <description>Fans of David Attenborough will enjoy experiencing the wonders of nature through Mike Spinak's pictures and words. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine witnessing hummingbird chicks being raised on the nest from front row seats, with every step shown as it unfolds, accompanied by fundamental explanations of the "whys" behind what you're seeing. In Mike Spinak's "Growing Up Humming", you'll see hummingbirds as you've never seen them before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The elder chick has flown from the nest, and now follows her mother while learning how to live like an adult. The younger chick hasn't yet fledged, and life will be easier for her mother when both are flying. What happens when a mother hummingbird wants her chick to leave the nest, but the chick isn't ready? This fact-filled, true story, photo book shows the answers in a heartwarming tale the entire family can enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The photos are so captivating you just want to gaze at them for hours rather than turn the page to continue the story." - Katie H.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The story itself is wondrous - Mike simply wrought words from inspiration that the hummingbirds gave him." - Nataliya Field&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I gave a copy to my 10 year old niece who enjoyed it so much that she read the whole thing front to back in one setting (and then spent a couple of hours wowing the adults with hummingbird facts)." - James Beswick, Amazon Top 1000 Reviewer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...delightful for persons of any age ... a breathtaking microcosm that few people have witnessed and which somehow makes you feel blessed ... marvelous, awesome story." - P.B. Sharp, Amazon Top 500 Reviewer</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;How far will a good man go to save his home and loved ones?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord James Dupree must recover his family's stolen Luck, the elven talisman that has protected the Dupree lands for generations. Without the talisman, the Dupree vineyards are failing and creditors are closing in. The Luck is his only hope of saving his home and his family from poverty and ruin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his abhorrence of slavery, James wins an elven slave in a game of cards. The slave, Loren, provides the only chance to enter the Lands Between and recover the stolen Luck. Despite James's assurances and best intentions, Loren does not trust his new master and James finds it all too easy to slip into the role of slave master when Loren defies him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two work together through hardship and danger, James finds himself falling in love with Loren. And when a hidden enemy moves against them, he must choose between his responsibility to his family and his own soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word Count: ~78,000&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Delirium - EPISODE 1 of the nine-part, first season of the Debt Collector serial. &lt;br&gt;SEASON ONE NOW COMPLETE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's your life worth on the open market? &lt;br&gt;A debt collector can tell you precisely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lirium plays the part of the grim reaper well, with his dark trenchcoat, jackboots, and the black marks on his soul that every debt collector carries. He's just in it for his cut, the ten percent of the life energy he collects before he transfers it on to the high potentials, the people who will make the world a better place with their brains, their work, and their lives. That hit of life energy, a bottle of vodka, and a visit from one of Madam Anastazja's sex workers keep him alive, stable, and mostly sane... until he collects again. But when his recovery ritual is disrupted by a sex worker who isn't what she seems, he has to choose between doing an illegal hit for a girl whose story has more holes than his soul or facing the bottle alone--a dark pit he's not sure he'll be able to climb out of again.</description>

  <description>An accident in Drew Clifton's past left the former novelist with aphasia, unable to communicate through either speech or writing. Through sheer strength of will, he built a quiet but lonely life for himself. But now he’s fallen in love with Travis Miller. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis has his own issues—a permanent eye injury and unemployment. But he’s determined to help Drew find ways to engage and succeed again in the wider world, and a guitar-playing gig at a local coffeehouse seems like a good start. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Warner and Chris Nock happen to be in the audience that evening, and they have a few niggling problems of their own. Perhaps a chance meeting will provide solutions that might benefit all of them.</description>

  <description>Grime and Punishment The Brothers Grime is Jack Masterson's way of helping people in crisis after disability ends his career as a firefighter. Jack's people get to a scene long after the physical trauma ends. They don't solve crime or rescue the victims. They help people move on. The new job is all Jack wants or needs, until he gets the call about old flame Nick Foasberg's suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan Halloran's cousin Nick has been on a downhill slide for a long time. Despite that, Ryan does everything he knows to help. Ryan only understands part of what happened between Nick and Jack in high school, but after Nick's suicide, Ryan agrees both he and Jack need closure. They work together to clean the scene and despite the situation, heat flares between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack is keeping a painful secret and fighting his attraction to Nick's lookalike cousin, Ryan. Ryan calls himself a magnet for lost causes and worries Jack might be the next in a long line of losers. Despite his misgivings, despite the past and the mistakes they've both made, Jack gives Ryan something to look forward to, and Ryan gives Jack a reason to stop looking back, in Grime And Punishment.</description>

  <description>Chase and Jimmy have been a couple for years. When age begins to take a toll on Jimmy’s mother, both men head down to Jimmy’s native Alabama to help her out. They understand that they are walking into a town firmly planted in the Bible Belt, where Jimmy stayed in the closet because of his fear of judgment. But they don’t understand just how bad it can get, and how it will threaten to tear their good relationship apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of two weeks, old friendships rise up like ghosts and new problems rush in like a hurricane from the coast. Can Chase and Jimmy survive a town hellbent on judgment? Or will they see their good relationship unravel under the strain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains Steamy Male on Male Action Along With Mature Language.</description>

  <description>Minerva True is a River Dweller and mystic who lives deep in the forested hills of a river valley on the fringes of the world. She is the only person who sees the ancient danger that resides on a nearby chapel grounds. Most pay little heed to her warnings, and in the end only a small band of friends stand beside her. A tale of love and duty ensues, challenging the destinies of Minerva, the young hero Leith, his lover Aubrey, and the mute boy, Deverell. Leith’s half-crazed mother Calpurnia has her own aspirations, however, that prove detrimental not only to Minerva, but to everyone she comes in contact with.</description>

  <description>In six weeks Zoe Harper will marry Dan Costi in an over-the-top Sydney society wedding, complete with fire-eaters and belly dancers. But when she receives an unexpected gift from her future mother-in-law, Zoe realises she’s making a huge mistake. In a blazing sidewalk argument, she breaks up with her fiance, and his mother--who has joined the fight via conference call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the advice of friends and co-workers, along with some inspiration from late-night-television self-help guru Dr. Pam, Zoe sets out to find the life she thinks she should be living. Always a planner, she makes a list of goals: travel, career, tattoos, and no relationships. It’s all carefully laid out, until she meets Angus Creed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In six weeks Angus is supposed to lead the opening waltz at a charity ball in New York City. Only problem is, the handsome billionaire construction magnate with the tabloid past can’t dance. Not one step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tainted by gossip and with a well-publicised failed engagement behind him, Angus has become a master at keeping an emotional distance. Until he meets Zoe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as dancing lessons, slowly becomes something more. Angus begins to let down his guard and open his heart, even when his past makes an unexpected and unwelcome return. As Zoe discovers the real man behind the headlines, she questions where her new choices are taking her. Her goals look good on paper, but are they what she really wants? And by the time she realises where her heart lies, will it be too late?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; Too many secrets. Not enough time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Merrick is supposed to be the level-headed one. The peacemaker. Since it’s just him and his three hotheaded brothers against the world, that’s a survival tactic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now he’s got problems even his brothers can’t help him survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His so-called girlfriend, Quinn, is going quick as mercury from daring to crazy. Meanwhile, Quinn’s dancer friend Adam is throwing Nick off balance, forcing him to recognize a truth he’d rather shove back into the dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can feel it—the atmosphere is sizzling. Danger is on the way. But whatever happens next, Nick is starting to find out that sometimes nothing you do can keep the peace.</description>

  <description>Jessica McClain has just discovered she's the biggest threat the supernatural world has seen in over eight-hundred years, but there's only one thing on her mind - finding her mate. Rourke's been kidnapped by a wicked goddess and his only chance of survival lies in her hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding Rourke and defeating the goddess proves to be difficult enough, but when the Underworld comes calling and Jessica discovers she's accused of crimes she hasn't committed, the entire game changes. The price they are demanding for her freedom is too steep. There is no way she can ever pay it back.</description>

  <description>Orphan Jack Templar has no memory of his parents and only the smallest details from his Aunt Sophie about how they died. The day before Jack's fourteenth birthday, things start to change for him. At first it's great: A sudden new strength helps him defend his nose-picking friend "T-Rex" from the school bully, and even his crush, Cindy Adams, takes notice. But then a mysterious girl named Eva arrives and tells him two facts that will change his life forever. First, that he's the descendent of a long line of monster hunters and he's destined to be in the family business. Second, that there's a truce between man and monster that children are off-limits...until their fourteenth birthday! Jack has only one day before hundreds of monsters will descend on his little town of Sunnyvale and try to kill him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that weren't enough, things get even more complicated when Jack discovers that the Lord of the Creach (as the monsters are collectively known) holds a personal grudge against him and will do anything to see that Jack has a slow and painful death. To stay alive and save his friends, Jack will have to battle werewolves, vampires, harpies, trolls, zombies and more. But perhaps the most dangerous thing he must face is the truth about his past. Why do the other hunters call him the last Templar? Why do they whisper that he may be the "One?" Why do the monsters want him dead so badly?  Even as these questions plague him, he quickly discovers survival is his new full-time job and that in the world of monster hunters, nothing is really what it seems.</description>

  <description>Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what seventeen-year-old Sky realizes after she meets Dean Holder. A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she’s never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he’s nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn’t at all who he’s been claiming to be. When the secrets he’s been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky’s life will change forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended for readers 17+ due to sexual content, harsh language and heavy subject matter.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>English prof-slash-cowboy Raine Magrath knows Johnny Bravo is an airhead. A beautiful young Apache film-making genius airhead, but still. They meet in a hot tub during Johnny's first film festival, but he bolts before his work is even shown. When Johnny drifts back to Taos a year later, they slide into a slow cowboy two-step so easily Raine starts to think Johnny might be the one. When Johnny's young cousin Weasel joins them, Raine's life seems complete, a ready-made family to love and protect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raine is sure that with his gentle guidance, Johnny can achieve the sort of worldly success Raine turned his back on years before. But Johnny has his own idea about what he wants his life to become. Too late Raine remembers that Johnny runs when he feels a chain tightening around his neck. Raine's quest for the perfect family might be the very thing that tears them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Ryan lowers his lips to my ear. "Dance with me, Beth."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No." I whisper the reply. I hate him and I hate myself for wanting him to touch me again....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I dare you..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone knew the truth about Beth Risk's home life, they'd send her mother to jail and seventeen-year-old Beth who knows where. So she protects her mom at all costs. Until the day her uncle swoops in and forces Beth to choose between her mom's freedom and her own happiness. That's how Beth finds herself living with an aunt who doesn't want her and going to a school that doesn't understand her. At all. Except for the one guy who shouldn't get her, but does....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan Stone is the town golden boy, a popular baseball star jock-with secrets he can't tell anyone. Not even the friends he shares everything with, including the constant dares to do crazy things. The craziest? Asking out the Skater girl who couldn't be less interested in him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what begins as a dare becomes an intense attraction neither Ryan nor Beth expected. Suddenly, the boy with the flawless image risks his dreams-and his life-for the girl he loves, and the girl who won't let anyone get too close is daring herself to want it all....</description>

  <description>With power comes enemies. Lots of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter Garrity just wants to be left alone. He's learned the hard way that his unusual abilities come at a price. And he can't seem to afford any allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's up to his neck in hostiles. His grandfather, spoiling for a fight. The Merrick brothers, who think he ratted them out. Calla, the scheming psycho who wants to use him as bait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's Kate Sullivan, the new girl at school. She's not hostile. She's bold. Funny. Hot. But she's got an agenda, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With supposedly secret powers rippling to the surface everywhere around him, Hunter knows something ugly is about to go down. But finding out what means he'll have to find someone he can trust. . .</description>

  <description>Book three in the Love-Bots series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a riot erupts in Built4’s stein-building lab, the alpha stein Kee drags a submissive young lab assistant into his cage. Kee’s been studying the human. Ben’s sad eyes and slender form call to Kee—urging him to equal parts lust and possessiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prisoner to the alpha, Ben surrenders to the stein’s fierce determination and gentle seductions. He’s long hated his job, feeling like a monster for following his boss’s orders, especially once he’s seen intelligence flickering in the alpha’s green eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Kee’s to escape, he needs Ben’s help to learn about the world outside the laboratory—a world full of people, sex and experiences Kee’s only beginning to discover. And guilt-ridden over the things he’s done, Ben can only forgive himself if the alpha forgives his sins first.</description>

  <description>Born the only female in an all male race, Jessica McClain isn’t just different—she’s feared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After living under the radar for the last twenty-six years, Jessica is thrust unexpectedly into her first change, a full ten years late. She wakes up and finds she’s in the middle of a storm. Now that she’s become the only female full-blooded werewolf in town, the supernatural world is already clamoring to take a bite out of her and her new Pack must rise up and protect her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not everyone is on board. The werewolf Rights of Laws is missing text and the superstitious werewolves think that Jessica means an end to their race. It doesn’t help when Jessica begins to realize she’s more. She can change partway and hold her form, and speak directly to her wolf. But the biggest complication by far is that her alpha father can't control her like he can the rest of his wolves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mercenary who’s been hired by the vampires shows up to extract information about the newly turned werewolf only days after her change, they find themselves smack in the middle of a war and there's no choice but to run together. When it’s up to Jessica to negotiate her release against her father’s direct orders, she chooses to take an offer for help instead. In exchange, Jessica must now swear an oath she may end up repaying with her life.</description>

  <description>It's been months since Aria learned of her mother's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Months since Perry became Blood Lord of the Tides, and months since Aria last saw him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Aria and Perry are about to be reunited. It's a moment they've been longing for with countless expectations. And it's a moment that lives up to all of them. At least, at first. Then it slips away. The Tides don't take kindly to former Dwellers like Aria. And the tribe is swirling out of Perry's control. With the Aether storms worsening every day, the only remaining hope for peace and safety is the Still Blue. But does this haven truly exist?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Threatened by false friends and powerful temptations, Aria and Perry wonder, Can their love survive through the ever night? In this second book in her spellbinding Under the Never Sky trilogy, Veronica Rossi combines fantasy and sci-fi elements to create a captivating adventure-and a love story as perilous as it is unforgettable.</description>

  <description>Dante Walker is flippin’ awesome, and he knows it. His good looks, killer charm, and stellar confidence has made him one of Hell’s best — a soul collector. His job is simple, weed through humanity and label those round rears with a big red good or bad stamp. Old Saint Nick gets the good guys, and he gets the fun ones. Bag-and-tag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sealing souls is nothing personal. Dante’s an equal opportunity collector and doesn’t want it any other way. But he’ll have to adjust, because Boss Man has given him a new assignment: Collect Charlie Cooper’s soul within 10 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante doesn’t know why Boss Man wants Charlie, nor does he care. This assignment means only one thing to him, and that’s a permanent ticket out of Hell. But after Dante meets the quirky, Nerd Alert chick he’s come to collect—he realizes this assignment will test his abilities as a collector, and uncover emotions long ago buried.</description>

  <description>Terrell Washington’s childhood was a trifecta of suck: being black, gay, and poor in America has no upside. Terrell climbed his way out of the hood only to hit a glass ceiling and stop, frozen, a chain restaurant bartender with a journalism degree. His one bright spot is Colby Meyers, a coworker who has no fear, no inhibitions, and sees no boundaries. Terrell and Colby spend their summers at the river and their breaks on the back dock of Papiano’s. As terrified as Terrell is of coming out, he’s helpless to stay away from Colby's magnetic smile and contagious laughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Colby is out of college now, and he has grand plans for the future—plans Terrell is sure will leave his scrawny black ass in the Sacramento dust until a breathless moment stolen from the chaos of the restaurant tells Terrell he might be wrong. When the moment is shattered by a mystery and an act of violence, Terrell and Colby are left with two puzzles: who killed their scumbag manager, and how to fit their own lives—the black and the white of them—into a single shining tomorrow.</description>

  <description>Justin falls for Kevin the instant they pass each other on a sidewalk. Only, Kevin’s not gay. The higher ups at Kevin’s company are gay, however, and Kevin’s accidental meeting with Justin gives him an idea how to get around his controlling female supervisor. If he can gain access to the top men at an exclusive gay club, he might be able to finally share his ideas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin instantly agrees to be his date, despite the obvious heartbreak that’s headed his way for going out with a straight man. At the club, Kevin gets a chance to meet the company owner, Victor Chen, and the man seems interested… both in his ideas and his date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kevin can’t deny his attraction to Justin, but he’s not gay. Right? He should step aside and let Justin have a chance to date Victor, who’s gorgeous, rich, and shares Justin’s interest in fashion. Despite his internal struggles, he really wants to explore their growing bond. Justin is certainly game, but a part of him knows they can’t have a future together. Is there more to their instant attraction than either suspect?</description>

  <description>Alpha wolf Emma Parker is loyal to a fault, even if it means losing the love of her life when he’s ousted from the pack. She’s never stopped needing him, and when a black witch curses the pack, she wonders if she’ll even survive. It’s a poison of the blood, and with each bite, the virus spreads, leaving the infected rabid and under the control of an evil Alpha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyle Benton is starting over. He’s a lone wolf, betrayed by the only woman he’s ever loved. Until Emma barges back into his life, as gorgeous and determined as ever. He’s hell bent on resisting her, or at least making her suffer. But she needs him in a way that touches him to his very soul. Now he has to determine how to set her free, and if he can, how he can ever let her go.</description>

It is hard to tell a complete story in only 61 pages but Shawntelle Madison does a very nice job of it. My final take is that it was a enjoyable read but I probably won't...]]>

  <description>Introverted college student Lane Moredock is in a bad place. His mother has been arrested for securities fraud, his father is on the run, and everyone, including the SEC, suspects Lane knows where the missing millions are. Lane, with no money and nowhere to live, makes a desperate deal that lands him in trouble and leaves him unwilling to trust a so-called Dom again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photographer Derek Fields lost money to the Moredocks, and is as sure as anyone that Lane is guilty despite his claims. A chance meeting with Lane shows him there might be something more to the young man than arrogance and privilege, and Derek wonders if Lane might be just what he’s been looking for: a sub with the potential to be a life partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lane slowly begins to open up to Derek and explore his needs as a submissive, the investigation closes tighter around him. Lane might be everything that Derek wants, but first Derek needs to trust that Lane is innocent—and Lane needs to trust Derek with the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contains BDSM, some puppy play, and a very obnoxious macaw!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Auntie Social is the biggest, baddest drag queen in Atlanta—she knows what she wants and she gets it. She’s tough, merciless, and top dog. That’s what Paul Stewart, reporter for the Journal, had heard, and all he expects when he’s assigned to interview the legend.. But nobody really knows the person behind the make-up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if…what if the person behind the sarcasm and music was more than just a man in a dress? What happened in his life that, thirty years later, made him a successful CEO, a philanthropist, and a legend in the gay community? Thirty years and almost a million dollars raised for people living with HIV/AIDs, yet still no one knows the real story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until one night, one man breaks through the shell, and Matthew Trammell—Auntie Social—opens the door he closed many years ago and lets his secrets spill out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pain is like rain, it covers your skin and soaks in bone-deep, but it eventually recedes and allows fresh things to grow.</description>

  <description>Skip thought he had it all: the fabulous husband, the great apartment, and the teaching job he’d always wanted. Even the cat was perfect. When his partner of eight years decides he wants something else—something that doesn’t involve Skip or the apartment or even the cat—Skip decides it’s time to go home to the other side of the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Skip’s hometown doesn’t just hold a loving meddling mother but also the memories of his awkward crush on a boy he met his senior year in high school. A boy he humiliated himself in front of just when it looked as if his fantasies might become reality. Finding out Paul Miller is now working at the same high school where Skip has just been hired flips his world upside down. After a heated night together, Skip is happy being friends with benefits. Paul will have to convince him love is worth the risk.</description>

  <description>Meet Patrick Cleary: party boy, loser, and spaz. Patrick’s been trying desperately to transform himself, and the results have been so spectacular, they’ve almost killed him. Meet Wes “Whiskey” Keenan: he’s a field biologist wondering if it’s time to settle down. When the worst day of Patrick’s life ends with Whiskey saving it, Patrick and Whiskey find themselves sharing company and an impossibly small berth on the world’s tackiest houseboat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patrick needs to get his life together—and Whiskey wants to help—but Patrick is not entirely convinced it’s doable. He’s pretty sure he’s a freak of nature. But Whiskey, who works with real freaks of nature, thinks all Patrick needs is a little help to see the absolute beauty inside his spastic self, and Whiskey is all about volunteering. Between anomalous frogs, a homicidal ex-boyfriend, and Patrick’s own hangups, Whiskey’s going to need all of his patience and Patrick’s going to need to find the best of himself before these two men ever see clear water.</description>

  <description>The Siren is a modern-day retelling of My Fair Lady with uptight English literary fiction editor Zachary Easton as an unwilling Professor Higgins and well-known wild child Nora Sutherlin as his erotica-writing Eliza Doolittle. Zach only has six weeks left at Royal House New York before he heads to Los Angeles to take over as Chief Managing Editor at Royal West. When his boss orders him to help Nora Sutherlin rewrite her latest novel, Zach agrees to work with her only if he is given complete control over the fate of her book. If Nora doesn’t rewrite it to his satisfaction in six weeks, Royal won’t publish it.</description>

  <description>Days away from high school graduation, with hardly a penny to his name, Evan Lowry needs to earn money for college. When he comes across an ad for modeling, he thinks his luck has changed—until he learns he’s interviewing for an adult film and will be expected to have sex. On camera. With other men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For gay porn star Brandon Court, the shine has worn off of regular shoots. He and his producer, Les, decide to try something new: a reality-show porno set at a beach house. When he meets wide-eyed and naïve Evan for the first time, Brandon isn’t sure if he wants the kid to get lost or get naked. Naked wins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On set, Brandon takes Evan under his wing, and over the next month, they are thrown together in every intimate way conceivable—except emotionally. Both Brandon and Evan are terrified of trying for anything deeper, and insecurities and doubts wear on their hopes, but the chemistry between them won’t let them slow things down.</description>

  <description>It’s the summer of 1974 and 21-year old Dawn Emerson has only three things she wants to do: compete one last time in the Ellensburg Rodeo, win back her ex-boyfriend Ryan, and become the best damn music journalist at Central Washington University. But all her plans are left in the dust when she’s contacted by Creem magazine to go on the road with one of her favorite groups, the up-and-coming metal band, Hybrid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first the assignment reads like a dream come true. Not only will Dawn land some much-needed credibility as a female music journalist, but she’ll finally get to experience life from the other side of the stage, and maybe crack the drunken, enigmatic code that is guitarist Sage Knightly. Instead, Dawn finds herself on an aging tour bus filled with ego-maniacs, band politics and a whole lot of sex, drugs and rock n’ roll. When monsters start showing up in dressing rooms and some of Sage’s groupies become increasingly strange and dangerous, Dawn discovers the band is not only going places – they’re going straight to Hell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Dawn has a backstage pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Devil's Metal is the first book in a two-part New Adult Horror/Paranormal Romance and very (very!) loosely based on the author's exploits as a music journalist. Hell comes in different forms.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The world might not have been ready for vampires when NOPD Detective Travis Boudreaux had the bad taste to sit up at his own funeral, but two years later, the new cause célèbre is civil rights for preternatural beings and most humans are on the bandwagon. Except whoever is killing vampires and wannabes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Sam Garrett hates all things preternatural. Having your undead partner try to make you his first meal will do that to a guy. One final screw-up gets Sam banished to the Paranormal Criminal Investigations Unit—the Odd Squad—under the oversight of Detective Danny Burkette. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it’s up to Burkette to work with Garrett by day and Boudreaux by night as they follow a trail of clues that leads from the historic cemeteries of New Orleans to the bayous of southern Louisiana. Under the all-too-interested gaze of a Master vampire and the local werewolf pack Alpha, they discover some lessons in life—and death—take longer to learn…and not all second chances are created equal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This is an erotic urban fantasy. In this series the vampires don’t sparkle, werewolves kill, and the men sometimes have sex. With each other.</description>

  <description>Sometimes the right choice can be the deadliest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ellie Watt made the ultimate sacrifice for Camden McQueen, she never thought it would be easy. But walking away with her ex-lover, Javier Bernal, in order to ensure Camden’s safety has brought a whole new set of dangers. With Javier’s plans for Ellie growing more secretive by the moment, Ellie must find a way to stay ahead of the game before her past swallows her whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Camden’s new life is short-lived. Fueled by revenge and pursued by authorities, he teams up with an unlikely partner in order to save Ellie. But as Camden toes the line between love and retribution, he realizes that in order to get back the woman he loves, he may have to lose himself in the process. He might just turn into the very man he’s hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in dual POV from Camden and Ellie.</description>

  <description>As a sophomore at Brown University, Kevin Roose didn't have much contact with the Religious Right. Raised in a secular home by staunchly liberal parents, he fit right in with Brown's sweatshop-protesting, fair-trade coffee-drinking, God-ambivalent student body. So when he had a chance encounter with a group of students from Liberty University, a conservative Baptist university in Lynchburg, Virginia, he found himself staring across a massive culture gap. But rather than brush the Liberty students off, Roose decided to do something much bolder: he became one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liberty University is the late Rev. Jerry Falwell's proudest accomplishment - a 10,000-student conservative Christian training ground. At Liberty, students (who call themselves "Champions for Christ") take classes like Introduction to Youth Ministry and Evangelism 101. They hear from guest speakers like Mike Huckabee and Karl Rove, they pray before every class, and they follow a 46-page code of conduct called "The Liberty Way" that prohibits drinking, smoking, R-rated movies, contact with the opposite sex, and witchcraft. Armed with an open mind and a reporter's notebook, Roose dives into life at Bible Boot Camp with the goal of connecting with his evangelical peers by experiencing their world first-hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roose's semester at Liberty takes him to church, class, and choir practice at Rev. Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist Church. He visits a support group for recovering masturbation addicts, goes to an evangelical hip-hop concert, and participates in a spring break mission trip to Daytona Beach, where he learns how to convert bar-hopping co-eds to Christianity. Roose struggles with his own faith throughout, and in a twist that could only have been engineered by a higher power, he conducts what would turn out to be the last in-depth interview of Rev. Falwell's life. Hilarious and heartwarming, respectful and thought-provoking, Kevin Roose's embedded report from the front lines of the culture war will inspire and entertain believers and non-believers alike.</description>

  <description>One day three white mice discover three jars of paint--red, blue, and yellow. Both parents and children alike will appreciate this lighthearted presentation of a lesson in color. “Walsh’s cut-paper collage illustrations have bold colors and just the right simplicity for the storyline. A real charmer that’s great fun as well as informative.”--&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a new book for my 3 year old's repertoire. I liked that it taught her more about colors and that it encouraged interaction between the two of us while we read it. It could have been a bit more FUN for my taste but she has requested it three nights in a row so who am I to argue!]]>

  <description>When dream hunter Dylan Ryve spots a beautiful shapeshifter raising hell in a bar, he knows he wants the wild young man. But Travis Feris is more to Dylan than a few hot minutes outside in the snow; he's the assassin's ticket into the magical town of Arcada. He didn't plan to rescue the kid, but when he found the shifter being attacked, the opportunity to play hero was too good to pass up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the solitude of a long winter night, Dylan walks in Travis's fevered dreams, learning about Arcada and the pack, and showing the shifter the man he'd been so very long ago. When morning comes, both men know their lives will be forever entwined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Dylan, Travis learns that he is a strong, valued member of the pack. The dreamwalker sees his own worth reflected back at him in the dark blue eyes of the wolf. Yet when Dylan has the chance to free himself from centuries of enslavement, can he betray the man he has come to love&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM elements, domination/submission</description>

  <description>For so long I’d dreamed of his touch, how his hands would feel on my skin, how his lips would feel on mine. But never had I believed it would be possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, here I now stood. With him. I couldn’t bring myself to open my eyes, fearful I’d find it was all just another fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Please,” he spoke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was definitely not a dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written for the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.  The story is available as a free download on this book page.  There is also a sequel now available &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16000560.Man_to_Man_Coverage__The_Extra_Point"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These boys are two of America's most popular NFL heart throbs. They've been eyeing each other for months now. The sexual tension between them is so intense, they're shocked their teammates haven't noticed yet especially with their unconscious desire to touch as much as possible. They can't help but undress one another with their eyes but whenever they get into talking range they always end up taunting each other about who's the best quarterback and always end up pissing each other off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please, Author, tell me how these two get together and make a relationship work when they play for separate teams, live in separate states and work in a 'man's' industry where being gay is a career killer. How have they managed to hold back their desperate desire for each other when they're both possessive and jealous of anyone who touches the other and all they want to do is fuck like bunnies? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. Contrary to my last sentence, I don't want this filled with lots of sex. I want to feel the sexual tension but with very minimal sex (sex would include anything that allows them to get off, FYI - handjobs, bjs, frotting, etc.). I would like a sweet but intense love story. No girl bits, cheating, menage, open relationship or too much talk of other sexual conquests. Unless they are boasting on the field. I would like banter, please, and lots of it. I wanna see them pissed off to the point they aren't sure whether to punch the other or kiss him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Two brawny quarterbacks share a post-game moment on the field. They’re well-known adversaries, but is the tension between them simply rivalry...or is it something more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY INFO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;genre: contemporary&lt;br&gt;tags: gay-for-you; first time; athlete; bromance; football; sports; opposites attract; enemies-to-lovers; frottage&lt;br&gt;content warnings: none&lt;br&gt;word count: 16,058&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In a universe where corruption and deception rule all aspects of life, sparks of rebellion threaten to ignite . . . &lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;BORN OF SILENCE&lt;/strong&gt; As the Resistance leader, Zarya Starska's only goal is to topple the government that destroyed her entire family and left her penniless. Her biggest asset is a mysterious man known only as Kere. But Kere has a dark secret. Born into a world that is as privileged as it is corrupt, his real name is Darling Cruel-and he is heir to the government Zarya wants to overthrow. No one has ever seen the real man behind the legend. No one except Zarya. But when she allows a weapon he designed to be used against his beloved sister, all bets are off. Betrayed by the Resistance, Darling's goal is not only to reign, but to kill every Resistance member he can find. Zarya must stop Darling's reign of terror, but can she reach past his insanity to restore the hero who once fought by her side?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Earth, Fire, Air, Water – they have more power than you dream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since her ex-boyfriend spread those lies about her, Becca Chandler is suddenly getting all the guys—all the ones she &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; want. Then she saves Chris Merrick from a beating in the school parking lot. Chris is different. &lt;em&gt;Way&lt;/em&gt; different: he can control water—just like his brothers can control fire, wind, and earth. They’re powerful. Dangerous. Marked for death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now that she knows the truth, so is Becca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secrets are hard to keep when your life’s at stake. When Hunter, the mysterious new kid around school, turns up with a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, Becca thinks she can trust him. But then Hunter goes head-to-head with Chris, and Becca wonders who’s hiding the most dangerous truth of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The storm is coming . . .&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

I read the entire thing in 4 hours and completely ignored my poor husband <em>(sorry honey, I'm reading about Merrick boys, 'kay?!)</em>. It was a wonderful blend of action, paranormal, and romance.

  <description>Unregistered paranormal Caleb Jansen only wants a normal life. But when a demon murders his brother, Caleb knows he has to avenge Ben’s death, no matter what the cost. Unfortunately, his only allies belong to an extremist group who would kill Caleb if they found out about his talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gray is a wandering spirit, summoned to hunt and destroy demons by drinking their blood. This hunt goes horribly wrong, and for the first time in his existence Gray is trapped in a living, human body. Caleb’s body…and Caleb is still in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hotshot federal agent John Starkweather thinks he’s seen it all. But when he’s called to exorcise Caleb, he finds a creature which isn’t supposed to exist outside of stories. For Gray is a drakul: a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having spent his life avoiding the government as an unregistered ‘mal, Caleb can’t let himself trust a federal exorcist, no matter how sexy. And he certainly isn’t going to give into the heat growing between them and sleep with Starkweather.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Starkweather win Caleb’s trust and convince him he isn’t the enemy? Can Caleb keep Gray under control, as the drakul experiences the temptation of a living body for the first time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because if he fails and Gray gives in to bloodlust, Starkweather will have no choice but to kill them both.</description>

  <description>Alex Tanner is a male nurse who divides his time between his job and his television schedule. His idea of the perfect partner, like so many other people’s, is a tall, dark, and handsome man. Preferably alive and breathing. Surely that’s not asking too much? Then an uninvited guest—a ghost, of all things—forces Alex to question what he’s always looked for in a lover and his definition of what makes a person so beautiful.</description>

  <description>Todd Gregory has become one of the most acclaimed writers and editors of gay male erotica over the past ten years. His short stories run the gamut from romance to noir to horror to fantasy—but the common denominator is always hot, passionate sex between two men. Published everywhere from websites to anthologies to magazines, Todd Gregory is always provocative—physically and intellectually. Here, in &lt;em&gt;Promises in Every Star&lt;/em&gt;, for the first time, all of his published short stories are in one place. This collection also includes several never-before-published stories.</description>

  <description>Tired of being judged by his appearance, Clay Pennington &lt;br&gt;decides the time has come for drastic action.  Partying and &lt;br&gt;one-night stands have gotten old, but how’s a boy supposed to &lt;br&gt;find someone when nobody looks beyond his surface to the &lt;br&gt;man inside?  A wilderness retreat seems like just the ticket &lt;br&gt;for proving he’s more than everyone else believes—until he &lt;br&gt;actually gets there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything is a lot more difficult than he expected, including &lt;br&gt;the man he’s partnered with for the week.  Sexy, surly Trent &lt;br&gt;Raines is a puzzle Clay would love to solve, but the man &lt;br&gt;pushes him away at every turn. Totally out of his element and &lt;br&gt;stuck with a survival partner who barely tolerates him, it’s &lt;br&gt;not long Clay starts to wonder if he’s made a huge mistake.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Clay can get through the week, he just might find &lt;br&gt;himself… and a lot more.</description>

Adam is convinced it's fate that draws him into the showers after a night of studying so he can finally get a chance to be with the guy he's been crushing on for two years. Lincoln had no idea being with a guy could be more than getting off, but Adam's definitely more than he ever expected. Can they make it work for more than one night? Can they build the foundation of a relationship that will last for years to come?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres/Tags:&lt;/strong&gt; Gay M/M / Contemporary / Coming of Age / Virgin / High School / Teens / Coming Out / HEA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approx.

      <![CDATA[Yes, real life sex is nothing like romance novel sex. As much as I sometimes wish it were so! Real sex is sillier and more awkward and not always perfect, as this short points out. I really liked how true this rang. Very well done.]]>

  <description>Dan thinks about just driving, leaving the whole mess behind. He's got enough money. He could just arrange to get his stuff and his horse shipped to wherever he's going. Taking off is what he used to do when things got to be too much, and it worked pretty well, really.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan Wheeler thought he'd found lasting love and stability with his life and work partner, Justin Archer. But when Dan finds himself alone again, still working as a horse trainer for Justin's parents, he has to find a way to accept that his perfect life is gone forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he meets billionaire Evan Kaminski, who arrives to buy a horse for his younger sister, and Evan's lover Jeff Stevens, a horse trainer who seems to understand more than just Dan's job. Struggling to deal with all the upheavals in his life, Dan finds himself drawn to both Evan's mercurial passion and Jeff's quiet wisdom. Is Dan strong enough to take a chance on new love, or would it be better—safer—for him to be alone?</description>

  <description>Ryan is assigned to Jamie Peterson for his class's secret gift exchange. If word gets out that he has to make a handcrafted gift for flamboyant  and openly gay Jamie, Ryan will be the laughing stock of the school. It's a good thing no self-respecting boy would be caught dead in a craft store, because otherwise he'd be at risk of being spotted when his mom drags him to her weekly craft workshops. He hopes Jamie will appreciate all the trouble he's going to for this assignment. Finding the perfect gift is gonna be tricky. Jamie deserves something good, though, after all the crap he has to put up with at school. At least, Ryan tells himself that's the reason he's putting so much thought into the gift. It couldn't be that he has feelings for Jamie, could it?</description>

  <description>A fiery and romantic adventure, perfect for fans of Grace Lin, Kristen Cashore, or Lisa See!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade Moon is a Fire Horse -- the worst sign in the Chinese zodiac for girls, said to make them stubborn, willful, and far too imaginative. But while her family despairs of marrying her off, she has a passionate heart and powerful dreams, and wants only to find a way to make them come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a young man named Sterling Promise comes to their village to offer Jade Moon and her father a chance to go to America. While Sterling Promise's smooth manners couldn't be more different from her own impulsive nature, Jade Moon falls in love with him on the long voyage. But America in 1923 doesn't want to admit many Chinese, and when they are detained at Angel Island, the "Ellis Island of the West," she discovers a betrayal that destroys all her dreams. To get into America, much less survive there, Jade Moon will have to use all her stubbornness and will to break a new path . . . one as brave and dangerous as only a Fire Horse girl can imagine.</description>

      <![CDATA["The Fire Horse Girl" was a very well written YA historical fiction novel. It was my first young adult book in this genre, and I expected something edging the immature side for some reason. I was a bit surprised at the range of emotions that this book covered. There is a lot of sadness in this no...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Some things are sweeter than revenge.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I need a boyfriend.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hearing those words from the mouth of his very straight ex-friend is enough to make columnist and editor Nate Gray choke on his Corona. It’s been thirteen years since Kellan Brooks’s father crushed Nate’s family on his climb to wealth and power. Even longer since he entrusted Kellan with the confession that he might be gay—only to have his best friend out and humiliate him to their entire high school. The last thing Nate expects is Kellan begging for his help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Breaking off his engagement to a senator’s daughter was the last straw for Kellan’s CEO father. Frustrated at being cut off, his father’s stinging words—that he wishes Kellan had never been born—still ringing in his ears, Kellan turns to Nate. In a move worthy of a corporate raider, Kellan plans the ultimate revenge. Come out as the boyfriend of the man his homophobic father betrayed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Convincing Nate to play along isn’t easy. It’s even harder to figure out why the lie feels so close to the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Contains old friends, old enemies, a dramatic cat rescue, soft drink references and a lot of teasing before the steamy sex. Readers are cautioned against drinking any beverage while reading to avoid accidental snorting or spraying of said beverages.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Roe Davis is a man who works hard, keeps to himself, and never mixes business with pleasure — until he takes a weekend away from his new job at Nowhere Ranch and runs into the owner at the only gay bar for two hundred miles. Getting involved with the boss is a bad idea, but Travis Loving is hard to say no to, especially when it turns out their kinks line up like a pair of custom-cut rails. As Loving points out, so long as this is sex on the side, no interfering with the job, they could make it work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The truth is, there’s good reason Roe never settles down and always spends his birthdays and holidays celebrating alone. Shut out in the cold by his family years ago, Roe survived by declaring he didn’t need a home. As his affair with Loving grows into more than just sex, Roe finds out what happens when he stays put a little bit too long: the past always catches up with you. Eventually, even a loner gets lonely, and home will grow up through whatever cracks you leave open for it — even in a place called Nowhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publisher's Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices, strong BDSM theme and elements, fetish play.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Victor Bayne honed his dubious psychic skills at one of the first psych training facilities in the country, Heliotrope Station, otherwise known as Camp Hell to the psychics who've been guests behind its razorwire fence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vic discovered that none of the people he remembers from Camp Hell can be found online, and there’s no mention of Heliotrope Station itself, either. Someone's gone through a lot of trouble to bury the past. But who?</description>

  <description>They say first love never dies...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From critically acclaimed author Kate Ellison comes a heartbreaking mystery of mental illness, unspoken love, and murder. When sixteen-year-old artist Olivia Tithe is visited by the ghost of her first love, Lucas Stern, it’s only through scattered images and notes left behind that she can unravel the mystery of his death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s a catch: Olivia has gone colorblind, and there’s a good chance she’s losing her mind completely—just like her mother did. How else to explain seeing (and falling in love all over again with) someone who isn’t really there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the murder trial looming just nine days away, Olivia must follow her heart to the truth, no matter how painful. It’s the only way she can save herself.</description>

  <description>"Daddy" is not a title Rue Murray wanted, but he never thought he'd have sex with a woman either. Now he's the unwitting father of a newborn named Alice. Between bartending and cosmetology school, Rue doesn't have time for babies, but he can't give her up. What Rue needs is a babysitter, and he's running out of options. He's on the verge of quitting school to watch Alice himself when he remembers his reclusive new neighbor, Erik. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erik Van Nuys is a sci-fi novelist with anxiety issues to spare. He doesn't like people in general, and he likes babies even less. Still, with his royalties dwindling, he could use the extra cash. Reluctantly, he takes on the role of manny-and even more reluctantly, he finds himself falling for Alice and her flamboyant father. Rue and Erik are as different as two people can be, and Alice is the unlikeliest of babies, but Rue has never been happier than when Alice and Erik are by his side. At least, not until he receives an offer that puts all his dreams within reach and he's forced to choose: the future he's always wanted, or the family he thought he never did.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/em&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, opposites attract, but in this sexy, smart, eBook original romance from RITA finalist &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author &lt;/strong&gt;Ruthie Knox, they positively combust! When a buttoned-up banker falls for a bad girl, “about last night” is just the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath Talarico knows a mistake when she makes it, and God knows she’s made her share. So many, in fact, that this Chicago girl knows London is her last, best shot at starting over. But bad habits are hard to break, and soon Cath finds herself back where she has vowed never to go . . . in the bed of a man who is all kinds of wrong: too rich, too classy, too uptight for a free-spirited troublemaker like her.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nev Chamberlain feels trapped and miserable in his family’s banking empire. But beneath his pinstripes is an artist and bohemian struggling to break free and lose control. Mary Catherine—even her name turns him on—with her tattoos, her secrets, and her gamine, sex-starved body, unleashes all kinds of fantasies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When blue blood mixes with bad blood, can a couple that is definitely wrong for each other ever be perfectly right? And with a little luck and a lot of love, can they make last night last a lifetime?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: &lt;em&gt;Because of You, Ride with Me, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Midnight Hour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The fear of getting caught is half the fun.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lowly art gallery assistant Caesar Romano is freely out of the closet. Now he’d just like to get out of his Nana’s guest room. Everything—his reputation and his financial freedom—is riding on the success of tonight’s gallery opening. If only he could shake free of the past so easily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mysterious gatecrasher, Dan Green, looks like a promising addition to his pending new life—until Caesar’s ex shows up and suddenly the opening disintegrates into a half-naked dance melee. When the glitter settles, a missing sculpture of Justin Timberlake has Caesar up to his eyebrows in extortion, intrigue and a wild sexual adventure underneath, inside, and on top of a variety of furnishings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the cast of suspects piles up, so do the questions. Like who’s really blackmailing whom? And what does a stolen paint-by-numbers clown matter when Dan is so outrageously capable of blowing Caesar’s resistance to smithereens?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This book contains graphic language, sex, lies, intrigue, clowns, kleptomania, anal sex, oral sex, mutual masturbation, bad driving, good cooking, and the missing head of a Justin Timberlake statue. Not for the sour of disposition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was really great romantic suspense from L.B. Gregg, who now cements her status as a solid 3.5-4 star author for me. <br /><br />First of all, I loved the heat level of this book. For some reason, in the two other L.B. Gregg books that I read, the sex was just not that hot for me. However, in this book,...]]>

      <![CDATA[**3.75 stars**<br /><br />What can I say, I love Twisted Hilarity! She has a humorous, sweet way of writing that I really dig. This short wasn't as wonderful as her longer works but I still enjoyed it. It has nice romance and I love a red-headed MC! It wasn't a light read though, which was misleading. There...]]>

  <description>Official Blurb: &lt;br&gt;New Orleans Police Detective Sam Garrett can't believe his bad luck when he's assigned to investigate a string of gay-bashings turned deadly in the French Quarter. Especially when he realizes Travis Boudreaux, his new, hot, and most-likely-straight partner, plans to use him as bait. The worst part? They’ve got no back-up because the rest of the city is preoccupied by another series of killings — the victims drained of blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This book was written as part of the Love is Always Write event for the M/M Group. It is available for free at All Romance eBooks or for .99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Original Prompt:&lt;br&gt;This son of a bitch has been underneath my skin ever since he transferred into the department. Word has it that he's one of the best damn homicide detectives in the city, but the fact of the matter is that he's a Grade A arrogant asshole. Pretty much every time he opens his mouth, I want to slug him – or stick my tongue down his throat, I'm not always really sure which, or even if I want to choose one. My libido doesn't seem to give a tinker's damn that I'm pretty sure he's straight, and while jerking off in the shower is starting to get pretty damn old, I foresee a lot more of it in my future – because the Chief just paired us up to work a new case…</description>

      <![CDATA[I think that this book was a great intro to a new series. It was short but it felt pretty well developed for only 35 pages. I love sexy cops and this is like sexy cops with a twist. And a non-white MC? Very cool. I'm not into that cover but I'll let it slide. I'm certainly moving forward and read...]]>

  <description>Nobody ever said running a gay escort agency was going to be easy. Harry takes on more than he can chew when he recruits a new boy who might be straight, might just be confused, or might be interested in servicing someone other than the clients. Then there's a client whose specific kinks mean for the first time in years Harry will have to handle a job himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long-time boyfriend Liam may be losing patience with having his life so influenced by hookers and emergency phone calls. Looks like he might become ex-boyfriend Liam... but is that such a bad thing? What should be done about the pushy bottom who won't go away until Harry agrees to dominate him? Is the new boy cut out for this business? There are vultures in the city. Harry is just a big, sparkly, gay one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 110,555</description>

The world became a different place when they met that day on the dock.</description>

  <description>For the past six months, Jared’s been selling sex at Market Garden, a London club that caters to the better-off. But business is slow in the run-up to Christmas, when businessmen and bankers are too busy bickering over bonuses to rent themselves a little high-class action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Jared’s wallet finds the downtime unnerving, the rest of him rather enjoys the opportunity it gives him to admire Tristan, an old hand in the club whose reputation usually sees him well-booked. Jared has been crushing on Tristan for months—he’s no more immune to Tristan’s cockiness and confidence than the johns, and those are just Tristan’s inner qualities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Jared’s about to chat Tristan up, a businessman asks for something a little different: he wants to book them both. They agree—and Jared finds himself going from crush to mind-bending lust as he’s made the pawn in a sexual power game. Tristan shows him how a pro handles a john while delivering the top-shelf sex for which the Market Garden is so rightly renowned.</description>

  <description>With names like Dallas and Brooklyn they could've either been best friends...or worst enemies. The war started in third grade, with a surprise punch to the face, and lasted until the summer after high school when Brooklyn and Dallas are stuck working at the same store. At night. Together. It should've been a recipe for disaster. But instead of outright combat, they slowly start to notice that not only do they not hate each other, but perhaps they have more in common than either of them knew. Soon, amidst unexpected laughter and camaraderie, Dallas realizes that maybe the guy who used to be his number one enemy could actually be his perfect match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free novelette written for the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/20149.M_M_Romance"&gt;M/M Romance&lt;/a&gt; group's "Hot Summer Days" event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres/Tags:&lt;/strong&gt; Gay M/M / Contemporary / Virgins / First Love / Enemies to lovers / High School / Summer Romance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approx.

Sure, it is HEAVY on the sappiness but I love a good enemies to lovers story. Combine that with a coming-of-age tale and virgins? You got me, you go...]]>

  <description>Jack worked hard to obtain a normal life. He might not love it, but it's better than the criminal life he left behind—even if it cost literally everything, and he really does hate being a damned delivery man. On the bright side, his route includes a friendly old lady who makes the world's best cookies and regales him with tales of her hot, jet-setting son. Normalcy definitely has perks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he walks in on her and her son arguing with men at gunpoint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free short story written for the M/M Romance Group's "Hot Summer Days" event.</description>

  <description>Emory James is, by his own admission, not the type of person the adjective &lt;em&gt;exciting&lt;/em&gt; would ever deign to touch with a ten-foot pole. &lt;em&gt;Cautious&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;reserved&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;staid&lt;/em&gt;, however, all crowd around him like best friends. Still, he gets by -- or at least he gets by up until his fiancée dumps him at the altar. Out of spite, he takes a solo honeymoon to Thailand, where he can pretend to be someone better than himself for a little while. In meeting Nate, a fellow traveler, Emory slowly discovers how to stop pretending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word Count: 58,561 (approx.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>17-year-old Becca spent her whole life protecting her brother from, well, everything. The abandonment of their father, the so called 'experts' who insist that voices in his head are unnatural and must be dealt with, and the constant threat of being taken away to some hospital and studied like an animal. When two representatives appear claiming to have the answers to Ryland's perceived problem, Becca doesn't buy it for one second. That is until they seem to know things about Ryland and about Becca and Ryland's family, that forces Becca to concede that there may be more to these people than meets the eye. Though still highly skeptical, Becca agrees to do what's best for Ryland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they find at St. Brigid's is a world beyond their imagination. Little by little they piece together the information of their family's heritage, their estranged Father, and the legend of the Holder race that decrees Ryland is the one they've been waiting for. However, they are all--especially Becca--in for a surprise that will change what they thought they knew about themselves and their kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She meets Alex, a Holder who is fiercely loyal to their race, and for some reason, Becca and Ryland. There's an attraction between Becca and Alex that can't be denied, but her true nature seems destined to keep them apart. However, certain destinies may not be as clear cut as everyone has always believed them to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becca is lost, but found at the same time. Can she bring herself to leave Ryland now that he's settled and can clearly see his future? Will she be able to put the the feelings she has for Alex aside and head back to the US? And can Becca and Ryland ever forgive their father for what he's done?</description>

      <![CDATA[**4.5 stars**<br /><br />I really enjoyed this fun UF book. One warning that may turn people off from this story: It is VERY similar in concept to X-Men. Very. It is basically an Irish, YA, romantic version of the story. The plot involves a boarding school for children with special powers (Holders), and thei...]]>

  <description>A sensual thief and a sexy god of nature... and another sexy god of nature. Hooooo, boy. This little thief’s in trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nemaro's life is just about the way he wants it. He has a career (as a thief), he has friends (three barbarian women and a forest god), and he's got money (before he spends it on wine, women, and all things leather). Everything changes when the nearest water god decides that Nemaro is the perfect material for a good romp in the hay. Now, the forest god is pissed, the barbarian women are laughing, and the water god won't leave him alone. Nemaro is in big trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status:&lt;/strong&gt; INCOMPLETE/ONGOING&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>By twenty-four, Carter Stevenson has stuttered and ticced his way to debilitating shyness. Although his friends accuse him of letting his Tourette's dictate his life, Carter moves from Los Angeles to a quiet California town. He'll keep his head down and avoid people. He doesn't anticipate his new neighbor, Ethan Hart, crashing into his solitude and forcing him to get out and live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the beginning, Ethan makes his love for Carter clear. But he fears Carter won't see past Ethan's damaged brain, even though it makes Ethan more attuned to his emotions than most people. For Carter, there's a bigger issue: he's been burned by so-called "perfect" matches, and he won't risk his heart again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One way or another, Ethan's determined to show Carter they belong together. Then Ethan receives tragic news. Suddenly he must turn to Carter for strength and support. Will Carter come through when Ethan needs him most?</description>

  <description>A short story about love, loss and finding love again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ronin Eastland has lost his love of 12 years in a drunk driving accident. Broken and devastated, Ronin retreats into his own world where he slowly succumbs to the pain of losing the only man he'd ever love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maverick Holliday wakes up in a white room and finds out he's dead. If that's not bad enough, his twink-looking somewhat angel tells him he can go back to Ronin. There's just one catch-Maverick won't remember who he is. Sent back down to earth in the body of another man, Maverick Holliday--now Maverick Cruise, tends to the sick and needy-until a broken man winds up in his ER. Drawn to the widower, Maverick can't understand why he feels so close to Ronin Eastland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Maverick ever truly remember the love he and Ronin shared? Will fate bring them together for a second time around?</description>

  <description>Rafe Bridges stopped mixing business with pleasure long ago, but when he receives a call from an intriguing cop who needs help searching for an old family friend, he breaks down and takes on the case. With each day that passes, Rafe becomes further fascinated with Jeremy Halliday...but the biggest problem isn't his attraction to the cop or his growing need for him. It's the tiny little detail of Jeremy being straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy isn't as immune to Rafe as he'd like to believe and as they work together, sifting through a case that is more mysterious and dangerous than it seems, Rafe draws away from him. Knowing he might miss out on someone incredible, Jeremy has to figure out what and who he really wants. And soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is black and white anymore.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a very enjoyable GFY book, my first by this author. I think the strongest aspect of this book was Jeremy's path to self-discovery and his growing relationship with Rafe. The author does a great job describing Jeremy's mental state. I felt like the reader truly gets inside his head-space...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION&lt;/strong&gt;: Two young men stare at each other through a chain-link fence. They are holding hands through it; one has nail polish and lip gloss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY LETTER:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I first crossed paths with him at the library on campus, I didn't know what to think. Lip gloss, eyeliner, eye shadow, nail polish? Back in the small town where I grew up, a boy would have never dared to dress like him. When an assignment to create a video news segment from one of our professors places us both in the same group, personalities clash, and what started as fascination on my part turns into instant dislike, which he seems to immediately return. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's smart, quick-thinking, creative…but also snarky, moody, defensive, and basically the complete physical opposite of every guy I've ever been attracted to. And yet, despite the fact that I think he needs an attitude adjustment, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; thinks I'm just a backward country hick, I've quickly come to realize that sometimes the line between love and hate really &lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt; paper thin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you! :)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/169842-harper"&gt;~Harper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. An HEA would definitely be preferred to an HFN ending.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY INFO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;genre: contemporary&lt;br&gt;tags: first love; college; coming out; gay-for-you; enemies to lovers&lt;br&gt;content warnings: none&lt;br&gt;words: 68,123&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;he story you are about to read celebrates love, sex and romance between men. It is a product of the Love Is Always Write Event sponsored by the Goodreads M/M Romance group and is published as a free gift to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Love Is Always Write?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Goodreads M/M Romance group invited members to choose a photo and pen a letter asking for a short M/M romance story inspired by the image; authors from the group were encouraged to select a letter and write an original tale. The result was an outpouring of creativity that shined a spotlight on the special bond between M/M romance writers and the people who love what they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A written description of the image that inspired this story is provided along with the original request letter. If you’d like to view the photo, please feel free to join the Goodreads M/M Romance group (&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/20149" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/2...&lt;/a&gt;) and visit the discussion section: Love Is Always Write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you are an avid M/M romance reader or new to the genre, you are in for a delicious treat.</description>

  <description>Forty-five-year-old English professor Nathan Qells is very good at making people feel important. What he’s not very good at is sticking around afterward. He’s a nice guy; he just doesn’t feel things the way other people do. So even after all the time he’s spent taking care of Michael, the kid across the hall, he doesn’t realize that Michael’s mob muscle uncle and guardian, Andreo Fiore, has slowly been falling in love with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreo has bigger problems than getting Nate to see him as a potential partner. He’s raising his nephew, trying to leave his unsavory job, and starting his own business, a process made infinitely more difficult when a series of hits takes out some key underworld players. Still, Dreo is determined to build a life he can be proud of—a life with Nate as a cornerstone. A life that is starting to look like exactly what Nate has been looking for. Unfortunately for Dreo—and for Nate—the last hits were just part of a major reorganization, and Dreo’s obvious love for Nate has made him a target too.</description>

  <description>Germany, 1945. The Third Reich is on its knees as Allied forces bomb Berlin to break the last resistance. Yet on an airfield near Berlin, the battle is far from over for a young mechanic, Felix, who’s attached to a squadron of fighter pilots. He’s especially attached to fighter ace Baldur Vogt, a man he admires and secretly loves. But there’s no room for love at the end of the world, never mind in Nazi Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Baldur narrowly cheats death, Felix pulls him from his plane, and the pilot makes his riskiest move yet. He takes a few days’ leave to recover, and he takes Felix with him. Away from the pressures of the airfield, their bond deepens, and Baldur shows Felix the kind of brotherhood he’d only ever dreamed of before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there’s no escaping the war, and when they return, Baldur joins the fray again in the skies over Berlin. As the Allies close in on the airfield where Felix waits for his lover, Baldur must face the truth that he is no longer the only one in mortal danger.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I've left some clues for you.&lt;br&gt;If you want them, turn the page.&lt;br&gt;If you don't, put the book back on the shelf, please."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins the latest whirlwind romance from the bestselling authors of &lt;em&gt;Nick &amp;amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist&lt;/em&gt;. Lily has left a red notebook full of challenges on a favorite bookstore shelf, waiting for just the right guy to come along and accept its dares. But is Dash that right guy? Or are Dash and Lily only destined to trade dares, dreams, and desires in the notebook they pass back and forth at locations across New York? Could their in-person selves possibly connect as well as their notebook versions? Or will they be a cosmic mismatch of disastrous proportions?</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />I've discovered a new genre that I love: Emo, hipster, snarky teens who talk in very witty dialog. And that make me laugh... a lot. The book is about a 16 year old boy, Dash, who goes on a scavenger hunt of sorts around New York City to try to meet a girl (Lily) who left a notebook w...]]>

  <description>My name is Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden. Conjure by it at your own risk. I'm a wizard. I work out of an office in midtown Chicago. As far as I know, I'm the only openly practicing professional wizard in the country. You can find me in the yellow pages, under Wizards. Believe it or not, I'm the only one there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With rent past due and a decent meal becoming an issue of some importance, Harry needs work, and soon. A call from a distraught wife, and another from Lt Murphy of the Chicago PD Special Investigation Unit makes Harry believe things are looking up, but they are about to get worse, much worse. Someone is harnessing immense supernatural forces to commit a series of grisly murders. Someone has violated the first law of magic: Thou Shalt Not Kill. Tracking that someone takes Harry into the dangerous underbelly of Chicago, from mobsters to vampires, while he himself is under suspicion of the crimes. One thing is certain, if he can't stop whoever is on this killing spree, Harry will be the next victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Publisher (Buzzy Multimedia)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Atticus O’Sullivan, last of the Druids, lives peacefully in Arizona, running an occult bookshop and shape-shifting in his spare time to hunt with his Irish wolfhound. His neighbors and customers think that this handsome, tattooed Irish dude is about twenty-one years old—when in actuality, he’s twenty-one &lt;em&gt;centuries&lt;/em&gt; old. Not to mention: He draws his power from the earth, possesses a sharp wit, and wields an even sharper magical sword known as Fragarach, the Answerer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, a very angry Celtic god wants that sword, and he’s hounded Atticus for centuries. Now the determined deity has tracked him down, and Atticus will need all his power—plus the help of a seductive goddess of death, his vampire and werewolf team of attorneys, a sexy bartender possessed by a Hindu witch, and some good old-fashioned luck of the Irish—to kick some Celtic arse and deliver himself from evil.</description>

  <description>When soccer star Chris Fischer moves next door to an openly gay classmate, he doesn't realize the wall between their rooms will be so thin he'll hear his neighbor's every move. But soon he and Peter become friends, and Chris is intrigued—imagining what happens on the other side of the wall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Active on the Queer Student Council, Peter Cohen wishes he wasn't so damn hot for his straight neighbor. He can't tell if Chris is flirting or in denial or what, but Chris's innocent overtures lure Peter into flirtation that throws his world into chaos. Peter doesn't want to date a closet case, but he desperately, passionately wants Chris. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Chris must choose whether to run away from his new feelings or embrace a relationship with the guy he loves. And Peter must decide if he can give his heart to a guy who hasn't yet figured it all out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;** A Siren Erotic Romance&lt;br&gt;[Siren Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Romance, M/M, HEA]</description>

  <description>Cole Kenjiro McGinnis, ex-cop and PI, is trying to get over the shooting death of his lover when a supposedly routine investigation lands in his lap. Investigating the apparent suicide of a prominent Korean businessman's son proves to be anything but ordinary, especially when it introduces Cole to the dead man's handsome cousin, Kim Jae-Min.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jae-Min's cousin had a dirty little secret, the kind that Cole has been familiar with all his life and that Jae-Min is still hiding from his family. The investigation leads Cole from tasteful mansions to seedy lover's trysts to Dirty Kiss, the place where the rich and discreet go to indulge in desires their traditional-minded families would rather know nothing about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also leads Cole McGinnis into Jae-Min's arms, and that could be a problem. Jae-Min's cousin's death is looking less and less like a suicide, and Jae-Min is looking more and more like a target. Cole has already lost one lover to violence-he's not about to lose Jae-Min too.</description>

I couldn't give a crap who killed whom and I don't love the anxious feeling that romantic suspense gives me. ::shrugs:: <em>I'm a wuss!</em><br /><br />But I really liked this one.<br /><br />This is your typical <em>guy gets injured past...</em>]]>

  <description>Ed Maurer’s life would be fine if he could just get Laurie Parker off his back. He’s bounced back, more or less, from the neck injury that permanently benched his semi-pro football career, and he volunteers now at a local community center. It’s just that every time he turns around, that damn professional dancer is in his way, hating Ed right back. But when a bargain Ed strikes at the center lands him as an assistant in Laurie’s ballroom dancing class, their perceptions of each other turn upside down. Both Ed and Laurie have heartbreak in their pasts, but somehow dancing together eases their individual pain. For Ed, dancing with Laurie becomes a way to reconnect with his body after losing football. For Laurie, partnering with Ed has erased some of his fear of performing and brought back joy to a sport he wasn’t sure he could ever truly love again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Laurie and Ed lose themselves in dance, their lives continue to spin around them: Ed’s injury makes it clear he’s nowhere near recovery, Laurie feels the pressure by friends and family to perform once more, and the community center that has become such an important part of both their worlds threatens to close. Alone, they haven’t had the strength or spirit to face what life has hurled at them. But as the turns of their personal paths lead them into the arms of love, Ed and Laurie begin to think that if they dance this dance together, they might be able to succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read an excerpt here: &lt;a href="http://heidicullinan.com/excerpts/dance-with-me" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://heidicullinan.com/excerpts/dan...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />I am a big fan of Heidi Cullinan. Honestly, her sex scenes are stolen right out of my brain (how did you get in there?!?) and I could read a book solely of her filthy, dirty bedroom talk. However, this book was a bit on the schmaltzy side for me. I am not a dancer and I appreciate da...]]>

  <description>With more than five million copies sold, Flowers for Algernon is the beloved, classic story of a mentally disabled man whose experimental quest for intelligence mirrors that of Algernon, an extraordinary lab mouse. In poignant diary entries, Charlie tells how a brain operation increases his IQ and changes his life. As the experimental procedure takes effect, Charlie's intelligence expands until it surpasses that of the doctors who engineered his metamorphosis. The experiment seems to be a scientific breakthrough of paramount importance--until Algernon begins his sudden, unexpected deterioration. Will the same happen to Charlie?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An American classic that inspired the award-winning movie Charly.</description>

He and Cooper have never been anything but friends, though, and as seems to be his luck, whenever he’s considered trying to make a move, either he or Cooper have been otherwise involved. Now that’s all about to change. Spring break is here, and for the first time in years they’re both single. Quinn thinks his time has finally come, his chance to put his plan to seduce Cooper to the test, but things don’t go quite the way he plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word count:&lt;/strong&gt; 9,412</description>

  <description>Confident almost to the point of arrogance, Jurgen never worried about his boyfriend leaving him until he overheard Nik telling his best friend he wants to move out of town. That's when the macho cop realizes that maybe asking Nik to move back to tiny Whitetail Rock—where he was tormented when he was younger for being gay and looking different—wasn't Jurgen's most brilliant idea. Now he's on a mission to find a way to fix things so Nik will stay. Which should be no problem because he's good at fixing stuff, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nik isn't sure what he was thinking, moving back to his hometown after graduating with his MFA. Jobs in his field are non-existent and reminders of some of the worst times in his life are abundant. But Jurgen lives in Whitetail Rock, and Nik is willing to put up with a hell of a lot to be with him. Except maybe Jurgen's own efforts to "fix" something that's not broken...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Losing nearly everything leaves room for the one thing they can’t live without.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few excruciating minutes pinned in a burning building cost Ryan Ward his job as a firefighter, the easy camaraderie of his coworkers, his girlfriend, and damn near cost him his left leg. Giving up, though, isn’t an option. Compared to the alternative, choosing a new profession, going back to school, and renting a room from the college groundskeeper are simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until he realizes he’s falling in love with his housemate, and things take a turn for the complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Barrett knows about loss. After moving twice to stay in touch with his kids, he could only watch as his ex-wife whisked them away to California. Offering Ryan a room seems better than rattling around the empty house, but as casual friendship moves to something more, and a firestorm of emotions ignites, the big old house feels like tight quarters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s nothing they can’t learn to navigate, though. But when dead bodies start turning up on campus—and one of the guys is a suspect—their first taste of real love could go up in smoke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contains two hot men wrestling with a shift in their sexuality, as well as a few positions probably listed in the Gay Kama Sutra. But it’s not all about the hot and sweaty—especially when your previously straight life knocks on the door and comes back to visit.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[**4.5 stars**<br /><br />This was dangerously, <em>dangerously</em> close to being all time favorite read of mine. So close, Kaje!! I loved the first 60% or so of the book so much that I spend most of the night reading it. But the mystery that came to a head near the end just didn't work all that well for me. <br /><br />Let me...]]>

Back to visit his parents Nik meets Trooper Jurgen Dammerung, a blond, butch motorcycle cop who’s so hot he leaves a con trail wherever he goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jurgen is the epitome of everything Nik hated about growing up the lone Indian boy among a town of white people. But Jurgen surprises him rather (ahem) pleasantly, in spite of — or because of — Nik’s attempts to needle him. By the end of his visit, Nik realizes he likes Jurgen. But Jurgen’s so not the relationship type.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres/Tags:&lt;/strong&gt; Gay M/M / Contemporary / Cops / Interracial / HFN / Dirty Talk / College&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approx.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The bigger they come, the harder they fall... in love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cambridge art professor Larry Morton takes one, alcohol-glazed look at the huge, tattooed man looming in a dark alley, and assumes he’s done for. Moments later he finds himself disarmed—literally and figuratively. And, the next morning, he can’t rest until he offers an apology to the man who turned out to be more gentle than giant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larry's intrigued to find there's more to Al Fletcher than meets the eye; he possesses a natural artistic talent that shines through untutored technique. Unfortunately, no one else seems to see the sensitive soul beneath Al’s imposing, scarred, undeniably sexy exterior. Least of all Larry's class-conscious family, who would like nothing better than to split up this mismatched pair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it physical? Oh, yes, it’s deliciously physical, and so much more—which makes Larry’s next task so daunting. Not just convincing his colleagues, friends and family that their relationship is more than skin deep. It’s convincing Al. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product Warnings: Contains comic misunderstandings, misuse of art materials, and unexpected poignancy. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Kacey Cleary’s whole life imploded four years ago in a drunk-driving accident. Now she’s working hard to bury the pieces left behind—all but one. Her little sister, Livie. Kacey can swallow the constant disapproval from her born-again aunt Darla over her self-destructive lifestyle; she can stop herself from going kick-boxer crazy on Uncle Raymond when he loses the girls’ college funds at a blackjack table. She just needs to keep it together until Livie is no longer a minor, and then they can get the hell out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Uncle Raymond slides into bed next to Livie one night, Kacey decides it’s time to run. Armed with two bus tickets and dreams of living near the coast, Kacey and Livie start their new lives in a Miami apartment complex, complete with a grumpy landlord, a pervert upstairs, and a neighbor with a stage name perfectly matched to her chosen “profession.” But Kacey’s not worried. She can handle all of them. What she can’t handle is Trent Emerson in apartment 1D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kacey doesn’t want to feel. She doesn’t. It’s safer that way. For everyone. But sexy Trent finds a way into her numb heart, reigniting her ability to love again. She starts to believe that maybe she can leave the past where it belongs and start over. Maybe she’s not beyond repair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Kacey isn’t the only one who’s broken. Seemingly perfect Trent has an unforgiveable past of his own; one that, when discovered, will shatter Kacey’s newly constructed life and send her back into suffocating darkness.</description>

  <description>It's not so easy being young, gay, and in love for the first time at the average high school.  Senior Toren Grey cares more about his family and his grades than what brand of clothes he wears. He agrees with the majority consensus that he's a nerd. So he's quite surprised when resident bad boy Wesley Carroll speaks to him in the hall, stirring feelings that Toren has to hide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disconcerted by Wes's free and easy ways, Toren can't deny the attraction between them. As he relaxes and gets to know Wes better, he finds there's more to the sexy rebel than his public image. Before long the young men are exploring new territory and falling in love, but life just isn't that simple. After they graduate, obstacles block their relationship at every turn: Wes working versus Toren in college, the virulent disapproval of parents, and everyday trials faced by any struggling young couple. Wes and Toren have to believe in each other... and never doubt that their love can conquer all.</description>

  <description>Reading goes to the dogs in this timeless Beginner Book edited by Dr. Seuss. From big dogs and little dogs to red, green, and blue dogs, dogs going up and dogs going fast . . . who knew dogs were so busy? And laughter will ensue at the repeated question “Do you like my hat?” Like P. D. Eastman’s classic &lt;em&gt;Are You My Mother?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Go, Dog. Go!&lt;/em&gt; has been a go-to favorite for over fifty years, leaving audiences of all breeds wagging their tails with delight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "The canine cartoons make an elementary text funny and coherent and still one of the best around."--&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Jake Brenner has too many wild oats to sow to fall in love—or so he claims. Besides, he's much too busy with his band, the Wayward Sons, to go looking for romance. His reticence has nothing to do with his embarrassing crush on Chris, the band's lead singer and Jake's erstwhile best friend. But that was before enigmatic wanderer Parker McAvoy signed on as the band's new lead guitarist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can only deny his attraction to sweet, dorky Parker for so long before the urge to do something about it becomes impossible to ignore. The trouble is, Parker knows all about Jake's philandering ways—and oh, yeah, he's not gay. Or so Jake thinks until a string of related events provides encouraging new insight. Can he convince Parker to overlook his colorful past and give him a chance? Or will this love song fade out before it even begins?</description>

  <description>In a trendy San Francisco art gallery, out-of-towner Vin Vanbly witnesses an act of compassion that compels him to make investment banker Perry Mangin a mysterious offer: in exchange for a weekend of complete submission, Vin will restore Perry's "kingship" and transform him into the man he was always meant to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite intense reservations, Perry agrees, setting in motion a chain of events that will test the limits of his body, seduce his senses, and fray his every nerve, (perhaps occasionally breaking the law) while Vin guides him toward his destiny as "the one true king."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as Perry rediscovers old grief and new joys within himself, Vin and his shadowy motivations remain enigmas: who is this offbeat stranger guiding them from danger to hilarity to danger? To emerge triumphant, Perry must overcome the greatest challenge alone: embracing his devastating past. But can he succeed by Sunday's sunrise deadline? How can he possibly evolve from an ordinary man into King Perry?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Bittersweet Dreams title: It's an unfortunate truth: love doesn't always conquer all. Regardless of its strength, sometimes fate intervenes, tragedy strikes, or forces conspire against it. These stories of romance do not offer a traditional happy ending, but the strong and enduring love will still touch your heart and maybe move you to tears.</description>

  <description>Travis Miller has a machining job, a cat named Elwood, and a pathetic love life. The one bright spot in his existence is the handsome guitar player he sometimes passes on his way home from work. But when he finally gathers the courage to speak to the man, Travis learns that former novelist Drew Clifton suffers from aphasia: Drew can understand everything Travis says, but he is unable to speak or write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two lonely men form a friendship that soon blossoms into romance. But communication is only one of their challenges-there's also Travis's inexperience with love and his precarious financial situation. If words are the bridge between two people, what will keep them together?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Is there room for love in a heart full of secrets?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year ago, before Fate took a wrecking ball to his life, Nichol was happily working on his doctorate in linguistics. Now he’s hip deep in sheep, mud and collies. His late brother and mother had been well suited to life on Seacliff Farm. Nichol? Not so much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As lambing season progresses in the teeth of an icy north wind, the last straw is the intruder Nichol catches in the barn. He says his name is Cam, and he’s on the run from a Glasgow gang. Something about the young man’s tired resignation touches Nichol deeply, and instead of giving him the business end of a shotgun, he offers Cam a blanket and a place to stay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow, Cam quickly charms his way through Nichol’s defenses and into his heart. Even his grandfather takes to the cheeky city boy, whose hard work and good head for figures help set the farm back on its feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the cold Scottish springtime melts into summer, Nichol finds himself falling in love. When tragedy strikes, Cam’s resolutely held secret is finally revealed and Nichol must face the truth. He’s given his heart away, and it’s time to pay the price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains explicit M/M sex and the disruption of a quiet Scottish town by a fistfight and some tight designer jeans.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>After his big-shot life in New York tragically falls apart, James Montgomery returns to his small hometown in south Georgia a defeated and broken man. All he has left is his mother to help him heal and regain his confidence before he's ready to get back out and re-conquer the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But being big-city gay in a small southern town has its own challenges. In addition to coming to grips with what happened in New York, his hometown of Lawder throws its own curveballs at him. James is confronted with a bitter enemy from his school days, and frustratingly can't seem to avoid the guy. His mother suddenly wants to expand the family. The one guy James takes a liking to and starts dating has a lot of hang-ups about being gay. And he watches almost helplessly as a new young bully starts to repeat the kind of abuse he suffered during his own school days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here where he grew up, the one place he should feel safe, James feels maddeningly off-balance. He starts to think that maybe going home was a bad idea after all. Maybe he'd be better off moving on and really starting over, completely from scratch. Maybe he should walk away from Lawder, just like he walked away from his life in New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But maybe, if he'd give it a chance, he'd re-think everything he ever thought he wanted out of life. And maybe what he thought was important, isn't so important after all. Maybe he could have everything he never realized he wanted, if he just looked around himself for a moment.</description>

      <![CDATA[**4.5 Stars**<br /><br />I started this book around 10 pm last night, which was a very very bad idea indeed. Clocking in at over 400 pages, I <em>had</em> to stay up until 2 am to finish it. Late night= tired Heather today. But it was worth it. "Falling Off the Face of the Earth" was an excellent read.<br /><br />The story follo...]]>

  <description>HOW HARD CAN IT BE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One happy ending coming right up…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*************************************************&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;What happens when an accountant decides to grab life by the horns and try something new? Apparently a pirate named Dave, a lot of pastel fleece, and blackmail—just to start with…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visualize and succeed, Oprah said. I was sure as hell trying, even if my campaign to score a job as the local weather girl had ended in a restraining order. Okay, TV was not my strength. But a lack of talent has never stopped me before. Which is why I’ve embarked on a writing career. I mean, how hard can it be to come up with a sexy romance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leave it to me to wind up in a group of grandmotherly porno writers who discuss sex toys and apple cobbler in the same breath. Also leave it to me to leak an outlandish plot idea to a bestselling author with the morals of a rabid squirrel. And only I could get arrested for a jewelry heist I didn’t commit—by a hunky cop whose handcuffs just might tempt me to sign up for a life of crime. Maybe I’ve found my calling after all…</description>

It is like hanging out with your crazy best friend. Oh, and the plot was great too! It isn't a deep thinking book but it is wonderful for what it is, which...]]>

  <description>New York, 1799: the future looks bright for the charming young book dealer William Lacy, until a raucous night of drinking lands him in shackles. He narrowly avoids the brutal prison system thanks to his mother, who negotiates with the judge to secure him a five year apprenticeship in lieu of a prison sentence. And so William finds himself in a carriage bound for the remote woods upstate, where he'll spend the next years of his life learning a new trade under some old master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he first sees Merrick, William thinks he's been dropped into a medieval horror story. Tall and gruff, dressed in a hooded robe that completely conceals his features, and riding a black mare, Merrick might as well be the Grim Reaper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But appearances are deceiving. A skilled apothecary and healer, Merrick proves to be a generous host and a gentle teacher, and William soon finds himself surprisingly comfortable in his new surroundings. And yet troubling mysteries abound: Why does Merrick never show his face or hands? Why do his movements seem so young and sure beneath his robes? What lies within the cave behind the stone cottage? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something unnatural is afoot. But most alarming by far is William's own reaction to his new keeper. For Merrick's strange charms are bewitching enough by day; but by night, in the darkness of the room and the bed they share, William finds himself entirely overwhelmed by desires he never imagined...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;51561 words</description>

  <description>Victor Bayne, the psychic half of a PsyCop team, is a gay medium who’s more concerned with flying under the radar than in making waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He hooks up with handsome Jacob Marks, a non-psychic (or “Stiff”) from an adjacent precinct at his ex-partner’s retirement party and it seems like his dubious luck has taken a turn for the better. But then a serial killer surfaces who can change his appearance to match any witness’ idea of the world’s hottest guy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solving murders is a snap when you can ask the victims whodunit, but this killer’s not leaving any spirits behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 32081 (approx)</description>

  <description>This Omnibus Edition collects the five Wool books into a single volume. It is for those who arrived late to the party and who wish to save a dollar or two while picking up the same stories in a single package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first Wool story was released as a standalone short in July of 2011. Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. My thanks go out to those reviewers who clamored for more. Without you, none of this would exist. Your demand created this as much as I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.</description>

      <![CDATA[I read the entire "Wool Omnibus" this afternoon, which says a lot for how good it was considering it is nearly 600 pages long. It is an interesting, mature dystopian novel, which is refreshing in a genre overrun by YA books right now. I really enjoyed it, and if you are a character-driven sci-fi...]]>

  <description>Howie gets a job at Artie Kraft's Arts 'N Crafts hoping to score with his lady coworkers. After all, girls love a sensitive guy, and what's more sensitive than dedicating your life to selling yarn and ... stuff? (Okay, so maybe it'd be a good idea to actually learn what one sells at an arts 'n crafts store.) But things don't go exactly according to plan. Coworker #1 is Cora: tiny, much-pierced, and way too fierce to screw with in any sense. Coworker #2 is Kristy: blonde, bubbly, unattainable perfection. And Coworker #3 is, well, Arthur. It goes without saying that he’s not an option. Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;… Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, Howie’s life just got straight up confusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pun intended.</description>

  <description>College professor James Richards is in a rut and feeling his age. He moved to northern California to escape heartbreak and humiliation, but so far the only good thing to happen to him has been his Boston terrier, Marlowe.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then James’s toughest student sets him up with her best friend. Rafael Ochoa is worlds apart from James—chronologically, culturally, and philosophically—but he’s also beautiful, kind, and a shot of adrenaline to James’s not-quite-middle-aged heart. Together, the two of them forge a bridge between James’s East Coast sensibilities and Rafael’s West Coast casualness, but can their meeting of the hearts survive James’s lack of faith in happy-ever-after?</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />So this book cements it: I definitely have a preference for angsty Amy Lane and not lighter Amy Lane. Books of hers that are on the lighter side (for HER, mind you) I tend to be more "strongly like"  vs "love it". For example, I liked but didn't love <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17456421.Bolt_Hole" title="Bolt-Hole by Amy Lane">Bolt-Hole</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12393029.Clear_Water" title="Clear Water by Amy Lane">Clear Water</a> but I AD...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Where there's smoke there's fire. . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 9/11, Brooklyn firefighter Griff Muir has wrestled with impossible feelings for his best friend and partner at Ladder 181: Dante Anastagio. Unfortunately Dante is strictly a ladies' man and the FDNY isn’t exactly gay-friendly. For 10 years, Griff has hidden his heart in a half-life of public heroics and private anguish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Griff’s caution and Dante’s cockiness make them an unbeatable team. To protect his buddy, there’s nothing Griff wouldn’t do… until Dante is nearly bankrupt and proposes the worst possible solution: HotHead.com, a gay-porn website where uniformed hunks get down-n-dirty… Now Dante wants them to appear there— &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Griff may have to guard his heart and live out his darkest fantasies on camera. Can he rescue the man he loves without wrecking their careers, their families, or their friendship?</description>

  <description>Jay Walker has two wishes: to perform the play of his dreams alongside his best friend at Wellington’s Tory Street Theatre, and to meet that special someone. Someone he’d go to the ends of the earth for. Someone who might only exist in fairy tales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jay meets accordion busker Lethe Cross, it’s like living a dream come true. Lethe’s music captivates Jay, and he resolves to meet the man who plays so beautifully. But then he discovers Lethe’s life is more like a nightmare. The phrase “down on his luck” can’t begin to cover it. Determined to help, Jay does some snooping for answers—and winds up on the wrong end of a centuries-old curse. The good news is there’s a way to break it. The bad news is it might cost Jay his life.</description>

  <description>Come for the apocalypse. Stay for cupcakes. Die for love. Madeleine Cost is working to become the youngest person ever to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture. Her elusive cousin Tyler is the perfect subject: androgynous, beautiful, and famous. All she needs to do is pin him down for the sittings. None of her plans factored in the Spires: featureless, impossible, spearing into the hearts of cities across the world - and spraying clouds of sparkling dust into the wind. Is it an alien invasion? Germ warfare? They are questions everyone on Earth would like answered, but Madeleine has a more immediate problem. At Ground Zero of the Sydney Spire, beneath the collapsed ruin of St James Station, she must make it to the surface before she can hope to find out if the world is ending.</description>

  <description>The second volume in the Dark Soul series features the stories "Dark Whisper" and "Dark Night."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Dark Whisper," Gianbattista may have broken Silvio's heart and sent him off to the States, but he's still just a phone call away. When Silvio returns from a sex shop with a bag full of goodies, Gianbattista can't resist topping his boy one more time, even if they are 4,000 miles apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Dark Night," the Russian problem comes back to haunt Stefano, and when a dark encounter leaves him bloody and broken, Silvio knows just the right way to ease his pain.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars<br /><br />I liked this short read more than Dark Soul #1. I got into the groove of the characters and understood their vibe. I am just buzzing with excitment- I can't wait for the BIG HOOK UP! It just has to happen soon. This series is a money suck for me. I keep spending $2.99 every hour to read...]]>

  <description>Lou Clark knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her boyfriend Patrick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Lou doesn't know is she's about to lose her job or that knowing what's coming is what keeps her sane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Traynor knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of colour. And neither of them knows they're going to change the other for all time.</description>

  <description>33,000 PAGES &lt;br&gt; 44 MILLION WORDS &lt;br&gt; 10 BILLION YEARS OF HISTORY &lt;br&gt; 1 OBSESSED MAN &lt;br&gt; Part memoir and part education (or lack thereof), &lt;em&gt;The Know-It-All&lt;/em&gt; chronicles NPR contributor A.J. Jacobs's hilarious, enlightening, and seemingly impossible quest to read the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/em&gt; from A to Z. &lt;br&gt; To fill the ever-widening gaps in his Ivy League education, A.J. Jacobs sets for himself the daunting task of reading all thirty-two volumes of the &lt;em&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica.&lt;/em&gt; His wife, Julie, tells him it's a waste of time, his friends believe he is losing his mind, and his father, a brilliant attorney who had once attempted the same feat and quit somewhere around Borneo, is encouraging but unconvinced. &lt;br&gt; With self-deprecating wit and a disarming frankness, &lt;em&gt;The Know-It-All&lt;/em&gt; recounts the unexpected and comically disruptive effects Operation Encyclopedia has on every part of Jacobs's life -- from his newly minted marriage to his complicated relationship with his father and the rest of his charmingly eccentric New York family to his day job as an editor at &lt;em&gt;Esquire.&lt;/em&gt; Jacobs's project tests the outer limits of his stamina and forces him to explore the real meaning of intelligence as he endeavors to join Mensa, win a spot on &lt;em&gt;Jeopardy!,&lt;/em&gt; and absorb 33,000 pages of learning. On his journey he stumbles upon some of the strangest, funniest, and most profound facts about every topic under the sun, all while battling fatigue, ridicule, and the paralyzing fear that attends his first real-life responsibility -- the impending birth of his first child. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Know-It-All&lt;/em&gt; is an ingenious, mightily entertaining memoir of one man's intellect, neuroses, and obsessions, and a struggle between the all-consuming quest for factual knowledge and the undeniable gift of hard-won wisdom.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of "The Know-It-All" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire "Encyclopedia Britannica" for "The Know-It-All." His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, "The Year of Living Biblically" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into worlds unimaginable. Thou shalt not be able to put it down.</description>

      <![CDATA[I read this book a year or two ago and really enjoyed it. As someone who has many many orthodox Jewish friends, I liked the seeing A.J. Jacobs try to live basically as they do. It was an interesting book, that's for sure. I have a weakness for books like this!]]>

  <description>When suburban Claudia Kincaid decides to run away, she knows she doesn’t just want to run from somewhere, she wants to run to somewhere — to a place that is comfortable, beautiful, and, preferably, elegant. She chooses the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Knowing her younger brother Jamie has money and thus can help her with a serious cash-flow problem, she invites him along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once settled into the museum, Claudia and Jamie find themselves caught up in the mystery of an angel statue that the museum purchased at auction for a bargain price of $225. The statue is possibly an early work of the Renaissance master, Michelangelo, and therefore worth millions. Is it? Or isn’t it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claudia is determined to find out. Her quest leads her to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the remarkable old woman who sold the statue, and to some equally remarkable discoveries about herself.</description>

  <description>Brad is great at meeting other people's expectations. But his own? Not so much. Take the gay thing. Okay, so yeah. It took a morning meeting with a frat brother's hairy, naked ass for him to admit it, but he knows the truth about himself now. Let the gay life commence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, it's not that easy. He hasn't quite determined how to come out to anyone, even Sebastian, the geeky-hot TA in his history class. Sebastian is everything Brad is not. Intellectual, suave, hairy. Out. And he doesn't seem interested in Brad, even when Brad makes a fool of himself trying to catch his notice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Score one for foolery: Sebastian does more than notice Brad; he takes him to bed. Brad's been with plenty of girls, but with Sebastian, the sex is something else entirely-hot, mind-blowing, affirming, and a little domineering in a way that drives him wild. But when great sex turns into something more-dare he admit the "L" word?-Brad must face the crushing realization that Sebastian doesn't feel the same. Unless, of course, he does. After all, even grad students can be idiots about matters of the heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A studio executive leaves his family and travels the world giving free reign to the bipolar disorder he's been forced to hide for 20 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Juliann Garey writes with stark, lucid power about the tumbling journey into madness and the agonizing climb back out."--&lt;strong&gt;Brian Yorkey&lt;/strong&gt;, book and lyrics for &lt;em&gt;Next to Normal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her tour-de-force first novel, Juliann Garey takes us inside the restless mind, ravaged heart, and anguished soul of Greyson Todd—a successful Hollywood studio executive who leaves his wife and young daughter for a decade to travel the world, giving free reign to the bipolar disorder he’s been forced to keep hidden for almost 20 years. The novel intricately weaves together three timelines: the story of Greyson’s travels (Rome, Israel, Santiago, Thailand, Uganda); the progressive unraveling of his own father seen through Greyson’s childhood eyes; and the intricacies and estrangements of his marriage. The entire narrative unfolds in the time it takes him undergo twelve 30-second electroshock treatments in a New York psychiatric ward.</description>

  <description>A male prostitute, a mangy cat, a murder and a maniacal mix-up that threatens his career, his impending marriage and his life. Nothing is going as planned for Austin Glass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Austin — seems to have it all. At least on the surface. A loving fiancee. A future with the FBI and a healthy sized trust fund. He also has a grin and a wisecrack for every situation. But the smile he presents to everyone hides a painful past he’s buried too deeply to remember. And his quips mask bitterness and insecurity. Austin has himself and most of the whole world fooled. Until he meets someone who immediately sees him better than he sees himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As events unfold and Austin’s world unravels, he finds himself pushed into making quick life-changing decisions. But can he trust Peter or what’s happening between them when each meeting seems to be just a series of volatile reactions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word Count: approx. 122,787&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Weber Yates's dreams of stardom are about to be reduced to a ranch hand’s job in Texas, and his one relationship is with a guy so far out of his league he might as well be on the moon. Or at least in San Francisco, where Weber stops to see him one last time before settling down to the humble, lonely life he figures a frog like him has coming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cyrus Benning is a successful neurosurgeon, so details are never lost on him. He spotted the prince in a broken-down bull rider's clothing from day one. But watching Weber walk out on him keeps getting harder, and he’s not sure how much more his heart can take. Now Cyrus has one last chance to prove to Weber that it's not Weber's job that makes him Cyrus's perfect man, it's Weber himself. With the help of his sister's newly broken family, he’s ready to show Weber that the home the man’s been searching for has always been right there, with him. Cyrus might have laid down an ultimatum once, but now it's turned into a vow—he's never going to let Weber out of his life again.</description>

      <![CDATA[My first book by Mary Calmes and I was pleasantly surprised. This book was perfect for my current mood. It was sweet and sexy with very little conflict. Just a feel good straight up romance with some hot cowboys to boot (what can be wrong with that!). I will definitely be trying more Mary Calmes...]]>

  <description>Mindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck–impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence “Can I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I’ll shut up about it?” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Perhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages). If so, you’ve come to the right book, mostly!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, &lt;/em&gt;Mindy invites readers on a tour of her life and her unscientific observations on romance, friendship, and Hollywood, with several conveniently placed stopping points for you to run errands and make phone calls. Mindy Kaling really is just a Girl Next Door—not so much literally anywhere in the continental United States, but definitely if you live in India or Sri Lanka.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[4.5 stars<br /><br />This book was really funny. I love Mindy Kaling and I think she is hilarious and relatable. However, it wasn't as laugh out loud funny as Bossypants and I felt myself comparing the books as I was reading them. Still an amazing book- a must read for memoir lovers. ]]>

  <description>Read the first three chapters of &lt;em&gt;"Fifty-one Shades: A Parody"&lt;/em&gt;, a rough draft excerpt from the forthcoming full-length parody novel, &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14060249.Fifty_Shames_of_Earl_Grey" title="Fifty Shames of Earl Grey"&gt;Fifty Shames of Earl Grey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaffer turns the BDSM love story between CEO &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/characters/59680-christian-grey"&gt;Christian Grey&lt;/a&gt; and virginal college student &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/characters/59679-anastasia-steele"&gt;Anastasia Steele&lt;/a&gt; into a comedy of errors. In &lt;em&gt;"Fifty-One Shades: A Parody"&lt;/em&gt;, the unbelievably handsome Edward — er, “Chris Gray” — sweeps college student Bella — um, “Anna Steal” — off her feet and into his twisted world of kinky sex, dirty money, and board games (because every dark hero needs a lighter side). Will her best friend, the brony Jin, intervene to save her from her wealthy and perverted new boyfriend?</description>

  <description>Special Agents Ty Grady and Zane Garrett have managed the impossible: a few months of peace and quiet. After nearly a year of personal and professional turmoil, they're living together conflict-free, work is going smoothly, and they're both happy, healthy, and home every night before dark. But anyone who knows them knows that can’t possibly last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an emergency call from home upsets the balance of their carefully arranged world, Ty and Zane must juggle family drama with a perplexing crime to save a helpless victim before time runs out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the mountains of West Virginia to a remote Texas horse ranch harboring more than just livestock and childhood memories, Ty and Zane must face their fears—and their families—to overcome an unlikely enemy and bring peace back into their newly shared world.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Cut &amp;amp; Run Series Book Four - Sequel to Fish &amp;amp; Chips&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baltimore, Maryland, is a city in alarming distress. Rising violence is fanning the flames of public outrage, and all law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, are catching blame. Thus the FBI’s latest ideas to improve public relations: a municipal softball league and workshops for community leaders. But the new commitments just mean more time Special Agents Ty Grady and Zane Garrett have to spend apart when they’re happily exploring how to be more than by-the-book partners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the latest spate of crime explodes in their faces—literally—throwing the city, the Bureau, and Ty and Zane’s volatile partnership both in and out of the office into chaos. They’re hip-deep in trouble, trying to track down bombers and bank robbers in the dark with very few clues, and the only way to reach the light at the end of the tunnel together requires Ty and Zane to close their eyes and trust each other to the fiery end.</description>

      <![CDATA[Sigh. This book was middle of the road to me in many ways. I found myself growing annoyed with Zane and his reluctance to open up and the general lack of communication between them. I still adore them as a couple so that's why the book still gets 4 stars. ]]>

  <description>The time is 1981, and Sibyl Danforth has been a dedicated midwife in the rural community of Reddington, Vermont, for fifteen years. But one treacherous winter night, in a house isolated by icy roads and failed telephone lines, Sibyl takes desperate measures to save a baby's life. She performs an emergency Caesarean section on its mother, who appears to have died in labor. But what if—as Sibyl's assistant later charges—the patient wasn't already dead, and it was Sibyl who inadvertently killed her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As recounted by Sibyl's precocious fourteen-year-old daughter, Connie, the ensuing trial bears the earmarks of a witch hunt except for the fact that all its participants are acting from the highest motives—and the defendant increasingly appears to be guilty. As Sibyl Danforth faces the antagonism of the law, the hostility of traditional doctors, and the accusations of her own conscience, &lt;strong&gt;Midwives&lt;/strong&gt; engages, moves, and transfixes us as only the very best novels ever do.</description>

  <description>In May 2000, Joel Smith is a cocky, adventurous young man who sees the world as his playground. But when the college senior, days from graduation, enters an abandoned Montana mine, he discovers the price of reckless curiosity. He emerges in May 1941 with a cell phone he can't use, money he can't spend, and little but his wits to guide his way. Stuck in the age of Whirlaway, swing dancing, and a peacetime draft, Joel begins a new life as the nation drifts toward war. With the help of his 21-year-old trailblazing grandmother and her friends, he finds his place in a world he knew only from movies and books. But when an opportunity comes to return to the present, Joel must decide whether to leave his new love in the past or choose a course that will alter their lives forever. THE MINE is a love story that follows a humbled man through a critical time in history as he adjusts to new surroundings and wrestles with the knowledge of things to come.</description>

  <description>This unforgettable odyssey into the distant past carries us back to the awesome mysteries of the exotic, primeval world of The Clan of the Cave Bear, and to Ayla, now grown into a beautiful and courageous young woman. &lt;br&gt; Cruelly cast out by the new leader of the ancient Clan that adopted her as a child, Ayla leaves those she loves behind and travels alone through a stark, open land filled with dangerous animals but few people, searching for the Others, tall and fair like herself. The short summer gives her little time to look, and when she finds a sheltered valley with a herd of hardy steppe horses, she decides to stay and prepare for the long glacial winter ahead. Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don't fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain. She saves tall, handsome Jondalar, who brings her a language to speak and an awakening of love and desire, but Ayla is torn between her fear of leaving her valley and her hope of living with her own kind.</description>

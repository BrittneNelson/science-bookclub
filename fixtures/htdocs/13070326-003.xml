  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The short story that inspired Jennifer Weiner’s forthcoming novel &lt;em&gt;The Next Best Thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;Ruth has left her job writing for a hit television show for reasons she’d rather not discuss and is supplementing her increasingly dwindling savings with freelance writing projects—namely, helping anxious high school students craft a perfect college essay and lonely souls craft captivating online dating profiles. When she’s not working, she’s swimming—lap after lap at the local indoor pool, in a desperate attempt to wash away the sting of professional failure and heartbreak that she can’t seem to shake. It takes an unexpected client to show her that appearances can be deceiving, and that sometimes the bravest thing you can do is simply dive back in.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really liked this short story from Jennifer Weiner. This story, in fact, reminded me why I love reading her books. It was well written, contemplative, and very very enjoyable. It is super short but worth the 10-15 minutes it takes to read it. Don't miss this little gem. ]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark’s Eve,” Neeve said. “Either you’re his true love . . . or you killed him.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them—not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can’t entirely explain. He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she’s not so sure anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the &lt;em&gt;Shiver&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and &lt;em&gt;The Scorpio Races&lt;/em&gt;, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we’ve never been before.</description>

  <description>Rose Daziani is a sensitive—a powerful psychic who can read the hearts of those around her and see things no one else can. It’s a neat party trick, but doesn’t exactly pay the rent. That is, until a mysterious phone call summons her halfway around the world to the exotic city of St. Petersburg, Russia, and offers her a job using those psychic gifts she’s kept secret all her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it turns out there’s a reason Rose is worth so much to her employers. Her team—a vampire, a fae-blooded hunter, and a priest Templar—can’t stop fighting with each other, mired in centuries-old grudges. The supernatural community of St. Petersburg is on the brink of war, and Rose herself has drawn the attention of a killer who will stop at nothing to get the vengeance he seeks. Rose will have to dig deep to find the truths that lie beneath the surface if she wants to succeed…or survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Edge lies between worlds, on the border between the Broken, where people shop at Wal-Mart and magic is a fairy tale—and the Weird, where blueblood aristocrats rule, changelings roam, and the strength of your magic can change your destiny…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlotte de Ney is as noble as they come, a blueblood straight out of the Weird. But even though she possesses rare magical healing abilities, her life has brought her nothing but pain. After her marriage crumbles, she flees to the Edge to build a new home for herself. Until Richard Mar is brought to her for treatment, and Charlotte’s life is turned upside down once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard is a swordsman without peer, future head of his large and rambunctious Edger clan—and he’s on a clandestine quest to wipe out slavers trafficking humans in the Weird. So when his presence leads his very dangerous enemies to Charlotte, she vows to help Richard destroy them. The slavers’ operation, however, goes deeper than Richard knows, and even working together, Charlotte and Richard may not survive...</description>

  <description>From the authors of the breakout bestseller &lt;em&gt;All my friends are dead.&lt;/em&gt; (more than 175,000 copies sold) and in the humorous vein of &lt;em&gt;Go the F**k to Sleep&lt;/em&gt; comes a laugh-out-loud collection of bad advice that turns the children's alphabet book on its head. Adorable illustrated characters lead readers down a path of poor decision-making, and alphabetical, rhyming couplets offer terrible life lessons in which O is for opening things with your teeth, F is for setting Daddy's wallet on fire, and R is for Raccoon (but definitely not for rabies). With plenty of playfully disastrous choices lurking around every corner, this compendium of black humor may be terrible for actual children, but it's perfect for the common-senseless child in all adults.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was exactly what I needed. It is sweet, very romantic, and just a lovely read. I have a soft spot for first loves and Piper Vaughn did this concept justice. The story had a very nice almost soothing quality to it. It was a perfect, angst-free, pick-me-up kind of read. ]]>

  <description>If a hungry little traveler shows up at your house, you might want to give him a cookie. If you give him a cookie, he's going to ask for a glass of milk. He'll want to look in a mirror to make sure he doesn't have a milk mustache, and then he'll ask for a pair of scissors to give himself a trim....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consequences of giving a cookie to this energetic mouse run the young host ragged, but young readers will come away smiling at the antics that tumble like dominoes through the pages of this delightful picture book.</description>

  <description>The world is not the way it was. The dead have risen, and the living are under attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a future world under attack from the undead, the powerful Church of Real Truth, in charge since the government fell, has sworn to reimburse citizens being harassed by the deceased. Consequently, there are many false claims of hauntings from those hoping to profit. Enter Chess Putnam, a fully-tattooed witch and freewheeling ghost hunter. She's got a real talent for nailing human liars and banishing the wicked dead. But she's keeping a dark secret from the Church: a little drug problem that's landed her in hot water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chess owes a lot of money to a dangerous drug lord who wants immediate payback. All Chess has to do is dispatch a very nasty species of undead from an old airport. But the job involves black magic, human sacrifice, a nefarious demonic creature, and crossing swords with enough wicked energy to wipe out a city of souls. Toss in a dangerous attraction to the drug lord's ruthless enforcer, and Chess begins to wonder if the rush is really worth it. Hell, yeah.</description>

      <![CDATA[A good narrator can always make or break a book for me. In this case, I think my eventual affection for this story was due in a large part to Bahni Turpin, who managed to flawlessly execute both the male and female voices. She made these characters come alive, and I went from not feeling the book...]]>

  <description>Anna never knew werewolves existed until the night she survived a violent attack...and became one herself. After three years at the bottom of the pack, she'd learned to keep her head down and never, ever trust dominant males. But Anna is that rarest kind of werewolf: an Omega. And one of the most powerful werewolves in the country will recognize her value as a pack member - and as his mate.</description>

  <description>Devyn Kell spent his life in service to the League until he learned of the double dealing and backstabbing that was costing innocent people their lives. Refusing to play those politics, he became a Runner - someone who makes sure planets get the weapons, medicine and supplies they need to survive. May the gods have mercy on any who get in his way, because he definitely won't. Alix Garran is a woman on the run from a past she can't escape. Signing on to work for Devyn as a System's Engineer, she finds a cause she can fight for - and a man she can respect. But as Alix's past catches up to her, and Devyn's old enemies turn lethal, they have to fight together...or fall alone.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the creator of the #1 bestselling Dark-Hunter novels - the spellbinding League series continues!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a universe where assassins make the law, everyone lives in fear - except for Syn. Born of an illicit scandal that once rocked a dynasty, he always knew how to survive on the bloodthirsty streets. But that was then, and the future is now...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He takes no prisoners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syn was raised as a tech-thief until his livelihood uncovered a truth that could end his life. He tried to destroy the evidence, and has been on the run ever since. Now trained as an assassin, he allows no one to threaten him. Ever. He is the darkness that swallows his enemies whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She offers no escape.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shahara Dagan is the best bounty hunter in the universe. When Syn comes back on the radar, she’s the only one who can bring him to justice. There’s only one problem: Syn is a close family friend who’s helped out the Dagans countless times. But if she saves him, both of their lives will be on the line. Is Syn’s protection worth the risk? The only hope Shahara has is to find the evidence he buried long ago. Now it’s kill or be killed - and they, the predators, have just become the hunted...</description>

  <description>Ihmiskunnan rippeet elävät valtavassa maanalaisessa siilossa. Maailma on saastunut elinkelvottomaksi ja ulkoilma on myrkyllistä hengittää. Ihmiset elävät siilossa ankarien sääntöjen ja rajoitusten armoilla. Mutta jotkut uskaltavat kyseenalaistaa vallitsevan järjestyksen ja unelmoida. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yksi heistä on Jules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hän on valmis paljastamaan siilon salaisuudet.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;As an ancient Sumerian god, Sin was one of the most powerful among his pantheon.  . . Until the night Artemis brutally stole his godhood and left him for dead. For millennia, this ex-god turned Dark-Hunter has dreamed only of regaining his powers and seeking revenge on Artemis. If only life were that simple.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unfortunately he has bigger fish--or in Sin's case--demons, to fry. The lethal gallu that were buried by his pantheon are now stirring and they are hungry for human flesh. Their goal is to destroy mankind and anyone else who gets in their way.  Sin is the only one who can stop them--that is if a certain woman doesn't kill him first. Unfortunately, Sin discovers that now he must rely on her or witness an annihilation of biblical proportions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enemies have always made strange bedfellows, but never more so than when the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Now a man who knows only betrayal must trust the one person most likely to hand him to the demons. Artemis may have stolen his godhood, but this one has stolen his heart. The only question is will she keep it or feed it to the ones who want him dead? &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>2008 Printz Award Winner Melina Marchetta crafts an epic fantasy of ancient magic, exile, feudal intrigue, and romance that rivets from the first page. &lt;br&gt;Finnikin was only a child during the five days of the unspeakable, when the royal family of Lumatere were brutally murdered, and an imposter seized the throne. Now a curse binds all who remain inside Lumatere's walls, and those who escaped roam the surrounding lands as exiles, persecuted and despairing, dying by the thousands in fever camps. In a narrative crackling with the tension of an imminent storm, Finnikin, now on the cusp of manhood, is compelled to join forces with an arrogant and enigmatic young novice named Evanjalin, who claims that her dark dreams will lead the exiles to a surviving royal child and a way to pierce the cursed barrier and regain the land of Lumatere. But Evanjalin's unpredictable behavior suggests that she is not what she seems -- and the startling truth will test Finnikin's faith not only in her, but in all he knows to be true about himself and his destiny. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>As a teenager, Robert McKinnon left his native Scotland and moved to America. That was sixteen years ago, and Professor McKinnon has never quite settled in his new home or found his place this side of the pond. He might be prematurely old, but he has his cat, and his books, and that's all he needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Chris Ford explodes into Robert's life with a crash of cymbals. The younger man is the polar opposite of Robert's calm civility. Bright tattoos cover his skin, and he wears his hair in a Mohawk and plays drums for a rock band. But he's a shot of color in Robert's black-and-white world, and Robert turns out to be the one thing Chris can count on. Despite all the reasons it shouldn't work, somehow it does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if Robert wasn't looking for love—especially not with someone nearly ten years his junior—he can't deny being with Chris is fun. But sometimes Chris's free-spirited nature leaves Robert feeling vulnerable. If they can't find a balance between tattoos and teacups, their relationship won't survive—and neither will Robert's newfound lust for life.</description>

  <description>Fifty-seven year old Robert Malone is the CEO of a successful clothing store chain and married to a former model. When his doctor tells him he is dying of cancer, he refuses to go quietly.  Instead of death, Robert chooses cryonics. He knows it’s a long shot. His frozen body will be stored in liquid nitrogen for the next seventy-five years, and then he’ll wake up in the future. Maybe. If technology figures out a way to bring him back.&lt;br&gt; He’s willing to take that gamble.&lt;br&gt;What he doesn’t realize is that he won’t lie in some dreamless state all that time. His soul is very much awake, just like the others who were frozen before him. &lt;br&gt;He discovers that he can ride in the cockpit with the pilots, but he can’t turn the page of a magazine. He can sit in the oval office with the president, but he can’t prevent a child from dashing in front of a car. He doesn’t work, or eat, or sleep. These obstacles make it difficult to fall in love, and virtually impossible to reconcile with the living.&lt;br&gt;Over the next several decades, Robert Malone will have plenty of time to learn The Ups and Downs of Being Dead.</description>

  <description>Twenty-seven-year-old Josey  Cirrini is sure of three things: winter in her North Carolina hometown is her favorite  season, she’s a sorry excuse for a Southern belle, and sweets are best eaten in the  privacy of her hidden closet. For while Josey has settled into an uneventful life  in her mother’s house, her one consolation is the stockpile of sugary treats and  paperback romances she escapes to each night…. Until she finds it harboring none  other than local waitress Della Lee Baker, a tough-talking, tenderhearted woman who  is one part nemesis—and two parts fairy godmother…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing a life of bad luck and  big mistakes, Della Lee has decided Josey’s clandestine closet is the safest place  to crash. In return she’s going to change Josey’s life—because, clearly, it is not  the closet of a happy woman. With Della Lee’s tough love, Josey is soon forgoing  pecan rolls and caramels, tapping into her startlingly keen feminine instincts, and  finding her narrow existence quickly expanding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before long, Josey bonds with Chloe  Finley, a young woman who makes the best sandwiches in town, is hounded by books  that inexplicably appear whenever she needs them, and—most amazing of all—has a close  connection to Josey’s longtime crush. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As little by little Josey dares to step outside  herself, she discovers a world where the color red has astonishing power, passion  can make eggs fry in their cartons, and romance can blossom at any time—even for  her. It seems that Della Lee’s work is done, and it’s time for her to move on. But  the truth about where she’s going, why she showed up in the first place—and what  Chloe has to do with it all—is about to add one more unexpected chapter to Josey’ s fast-changing life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brimming with warmth, wit, and a sprinkling of magic, here  is a spellbinding tale of friendship, love—and the enchanting possibilities of every  new day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONUS: This edition contains excerpts from Sarah Addison Allen's &lt;em&gt;The Peach Keeper&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Chased the Moon.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In her latest enchanting novel, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Sarah Addison Allen invites you to a quirky little Southern town with more magic than a full Carolina moon. Here two very different women discover how to find their place in the world—no matter how out of place they feel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily Benedict came to Mullaby, North Carolina, hoping to solve at least some of the riddles surrounding her mother’s life. Such as, why did Dulcie Shelby leave her hometown so suddenly? And why did she vow never to return? But the moment Emily enters the house where her mother grew up and meets the grandfather she never knew—a reclusive, real-life gentle giant—she realizes that mysteries aren’t solved in Mullaby, they’re a way of life: Here are rooms where the wallpaper changes to suit your mood. Unexplained lights skip across the yard at midnight. And a neighbor bakes hope in the form of cakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone in Mullaby adores Julia Winterson’s cakes—which is a good thing, because Julia can’t seem to stop baking them. She offers them to satisfy the town’s sweet tooth but also in the hope of rekindling the love she fears might be lost forever. Flour, eggs, milk, and sugar . . . Baking is the only language the proud but vulnerable Julia has to communicate what is truly in her heart. But is it enough to call back to her those she’s hurt in the past?  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Can a hummingbird cake really bring back a lost love? Is there really a ghost dancing in Emily’s backyard? The answers are never what you expect. But in this town of lovable misfits, the unexpected fits right in.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Chased the Moon &lt;/em&gt;welcomes you to her newest locale: Walls of Water, North Carolina, where the secrets are thicker than the fog from the town’s famous waterfalls, and the stuff of superstition is just as real as you want it to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the dubious distinction of thirty-year-old Willa Jackson to hail from a fine old Southern family of means that met with financial ruin generations ago. The Blue Ridge Madam—built by Willa’s great-great-grandfather during Walls of Water’s heyday, and once the town’s grandest home—has stood for years as a lonely monument to misfortune and scandal. And Willa herself has long strived to build a life beyond the brooding Jackson family shadow. No easy task in a town shaped by years of tradition and the well-marked boundaries of the haves and have-nots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Willa has lately learned that an old classmate—socialite do-gooder Paxton Osgood—of the very prominent Osgood family, has restored the Blue Ridge Madam to her former glory, with plans to open a top-flight inn. Maybe, at last, the troubled past can be laid to rest while something new and wonderful rises from its ashes. But what rises instead is a skeleton, found buried beneath the property’s lone peach tree, and certain to drag up dire consequences along with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the bones—those of charismatic traveling salesman Tucker Devlin, who worked his dark charms on Walls of Water seventy-five years ago—are not all that lay hidden out of sight and mind. Long-kept secrets surrounding the troubling remains have also come to light, seemingly heralded by a spate of sudden strange occurrences throughout the town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, thrust together in an unlikely friendship, united by a full-blooded mystery, Willa and Paxton must confront the dangerous passions and tragic betrayals that once bound their families—and uncover truths of the long-dead that have transcended time and defied the grave to touch the hearts and souls of the living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resonant with insight into the deep and lasting power of friendship, love, and tradition, &lt;em&gt;The Peach Keeper&lt;/em&gt; is a portrait of the unshakable bonds that—in good times and bad, from one generation to the next—endure forever.</description>

  <description>In this next installment in the &lt;em&gt;Immortals After Dark Series&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; Bestselling author Kresley Cole delivers a scorching tale about a forbidding vampire who lives in the shadows and the beautiful assassin who hunts him there.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A vampire soldier weary of life...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centuries ago, Sebastian Wroth was turned into a vampire—a nightmare in his mind—against his will. Burdened with hatred and alone for ages, he sees little reason to live. Until an exquisite, fey creature comes to kill him, inadvertently saving him instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A valkyrie assassin dispatched to destroy him...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kaderin the Cold Hearted lost her two beloved sisters to a vampire attack long ago, a benevolent force deadened her sorrow—accidentally extinguishing all of her emotions. Yet whenever she encounters Sebastian, her feelings—particularly lust—emerge multiplied. For the first time, she's unable to complete a kill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competitors in a legendary hunt...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prize of the month-long contest is powerful enough to change history, and Kaderin will do anything to win it for her sisters. Wanting only to win her, forever, Sebastian competes as well, taking every opportunity—as they travel to ancient tombs and through catacombs, seeking relics around the world—to use her new feelings to seduce her. But when forced to choose between the vampire she's falling for and reuniting her family, how can Kaderin live without either?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Once a century, one person is chosen for greatness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elisa is the chosen one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she is also the younger of two princesses, the one who has never done anything remarkable. She can't see how she ever will. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, on her sixteenth birthday, she has become the secret wife of a handsome and worldly king—a king whose country is in turmoil. A king who needs the chosen one, not a failure of a princess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he's not the only one who seeks her. Savage enemies seething with dark magic are hunting her. A daring, determined revolutionary thinks she could be his people's savior. And he looks at her in a way that no man has ever looked at her before. Soon it is not just her life, but her very heart that is at stake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elisa could be everything to those who need her most. If the prophecy is fulfilled. If she finds the power deep within herself. If she doesn’t die young.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the chosen do.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, Sophie Mercer discovered that she was a witch. It's gotten her into a few scrapes. Her non-gifted mother has been as supportive as possible, consulting Sophie's estranged father-an elusive European warlock-only when necessary. But when Sophie attracts too much human attention for a prom-night spell gone horribly wrong, it's her dad who decides her punishment: exile to Hex Hall, an isolated reform school for wayward Prodigium, a.k.a. witches, faeries, and shapeshifters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the end of her first day among fellow freak-teens, Sophie has quite a scorecard: three powerful enemies who look like supermodels, a futile crush on a gorgeous warlock, a creepy tagalong ghost, and a new roommate who happens to be the most hated person and only vampire on campus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worse, Sophie soon learns that a mysterious predator has been attacking students, and her only friend is the number-one suspect. As a series of blood-curdling mysteries starts to converge, Sophie prepares for the biggest threat of all: an ancient secret society determined to destroy all Prodigium, especially her.</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />When my husband asked me what I was reading today, I summed this book up to him as, "Harry Potter chick lit". I meant that as a complement. "Hex Hall" is a really adorable and spunky YA paranormal read. It is what <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9439989.Mythos_Academy" title="Mythos Academy by Jennifer Estep">Mythos Academy</a> tried to be before it fell miserably short. I was shock...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;THE HOT NEW NAME IN PARANORMAL ROMANCE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nalini Singh dives into a world torn apart by a powerful race with phenomenal powers of the mind-and none of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world that denies emotions, where the ruling Psy punish any sign of desire, Sascha Duncan must conceal the feelings that brand her as flawed. To reveal them would be to sentence herself to the horror of "rehabilitation" - the complete psychic erasure of everything she ever was... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both human and animal, Lucas Hunter is a changeling hungry for the very sensations the Psy disdain. After centuries of uneasy coexistence, these two races are now on the verge of war over the brutal murders of several changeling women. Lucas is determined to find the Psy killer who butchered his packmate, and Sascha is his ticket into their closely guarded society. But he soon discovers that this ice-cold Psy is very capable of passion - and that the animal in him is fascinated by her. Caught between their conflicting worlds, Lucas and Sascha must remain bound to their identities - or sacrifice everything for a taste of darkest temptation...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Her wedding fast approaching, celebrated chef Kady Long knew she was the luckiest woman alive... until she slipped into a delicate satin wedding dress she found in and antique flour tin, and was overcome by an odd dizzy spell. When she came to, Kady was in the dusty western town of Legend, Colorado-- where a hanging was about to commence! With quick wits and more than a little moxie, Kady halts the proceedings, much to the relief of one Cole Jordan, a tall, thankful, and very appealing man. Now it's Kady's turn to enlist his help to find a way back home. But before long, Kady discovers a passion that she knows can only live in Legend-- until Cole reveals a secret that unites them in a way Kady never could have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Conversation with Kathy Griffin:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Q: State your name and profession.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;KG: My name is Kathy Griffin, and I am a teller of d**k jokes. And a plumber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: This is your first book. Had you ever considered writing anything before? A novel? Or a work of historical scholarship? Or a children's story?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;KG: I had not considered it, because I'd always been told by the nuns at St. Bernadine's that my cursive was poor. A children' s story is an interesting idea. How's this for a title: "Waterboarding Pre-Teens: The Debate is Back On." I have a political side as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: You seem fairly obsessed with Oprah. Is this something you'll ever outgrow?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;KG: I will never outgrow my obsession with Oprah. Just as she will never outgrow her cardigan sweaters. Oops, she already has. Now look, that sounds like a dig, but it's not. It's called a struggle, and I'm on it with her. I support her. (Not as much as she needs those underwire bras to support her, because she's got some serious ropes and pulleys going on there.) The point is, I worship her, and fear her at the same time. And believe me, that' s how she wants it. Don't be fooled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Did I miss something? Where's Celine Dion in this book?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;KG: I didn't write about Celine Dion, only because of my fear of her husband Rene Angelil. I have an unfounded but constant fear that he could be in the French-Canadian mafia. Or have French-Canadian mafia ties, and by ties I don't mean les cravats. And I fear that I may be abducted, whisked away and held prisoner at a charming little brasserie in Montreal, forced to eat multiple Croque Monsieur sandwiches until I confess to knowing the lyrics to every single one of her songs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you think gays should take away from reading this book?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;KG: I think the gays should be happy with this book. It talks a lot about being who you are, and I certainly mention a lot of gay people. I would say it definitely has strong gay themes, and the gay community should know that frankly it has been a moral struggle for me to even acknowledge the heterosexual community in this book at all. But I am slowly reaching out an olive branch to the heterosexual community, even though I believe everything they do goes against the teachings of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But I'm trying not to judge them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Describe your ideal, make-a-wish day of personal experiences with bats**t celebrities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;KG: Well, it would start with some sort of a fit in the hair-and-makeup trailer on a set. I heard a story that when Sharon Stone was working on "Casino," she got into such a fight with her hairdresser, that after he spent four hours doing this beautiful bouffant hairdo for her, she got up and walked in the sink and put her head underwater. I have no idea if that's true, but I hope it is, cause that's some awesome s**t I would love to see. Then it would go right to lunch, where I could witness an eating disorder. Maybe a Lohan is purging in a bush somewhere with her finger down her throat. Or perhaps there's an Olsen twin on a scale crying because she finally tipped 100. Any outburst over weight I would cherish. Also, it would be great to see an actress have a workload meltdown. So maybe at 2:00 some A-lister saying, "I can't handle this s**t anymore." Because I love when actors can't deal with a normal workday, and they think two in the afternoon is like midnight, so I would love to see somebody storming to their car, exhausted because they've put in a grueling four-hour workday of saying three lines and texting their nanny. Then it's maybe off to an illicit affair. At the top of my wish list would be following a rapper or a football player over to his baby mama's house where a screaming match ensues to the point where someone, maybe me, has to anonymously dial 911, and then I take a couple pictures, and I become an unannounced star witness later at the trial, entering Joan Collins-style in a smashing hat. And then at the end of the day it's a healthy round of clubbing with Janice Dickinson, and then on the way home we go to the Beverly Glen pharmacy and run into Paula Abdul. All three of us secretly take our small white-paper pharmacy bags and put them behind our backs and make uncomfortable small talk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Official Book Club Selection&lt;/strong&gt; is Kathy Griffin unplugged, uncensored, and unafraid to dish about what really happens on the road, away from the cameras, and at the star party after the show. (It's also her big chance to score that coveted book club endorsement she's always wanted. Are you there, Oprah? It's me, Kathy.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kathy Griffin has won Emmys for her reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, been nominated for a Grammy, worked and walked every red carpet known to man, and rung in the New Year with Anderson Cooper. But the legions of fans who pack Kathy's sold-out comedy shows have heard only part of her remarkable story. Writing with her trademark wit, the feisty comic settles a few old scores, celebrates the friends and mentors who helped her claw her way to the top, and shares insider gossip about celebrity behavior–the good, the bad, and the very ugly. She recounts the crazy ups and downs of her own career and introduces us to some of the supertalented people she encountered before they got famous (or, in some cases, after fame went to their heads). Word to the wise: If you've ever crossed Kathy Griffin at some point in your life, check the index for your name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, Kathy reveals intimate details about her life before and after she made the big time. She opens up about everything from growing up with a dysfunctional family in suburban Illinois to bombing as a young comedian in L.A., from her well-publicized plastic surgery disasters to her highly publicized divorce, and more. Only in this book will you learn how the dinner table is the best training ground for a career in stand-up, how speaking your mind can bite you on the ass and buy you a house, and which people in Kathy's life have taught her the most valuable lessons–both inside and outside the entertainment industry. And as if all that wasn't enough, there are also dozens of exclusive and somewhat embarrassing photos from Kathy's own collection–featuring the diva of the D List herself, with her old nose as well as her new one, plus celebrity friends, foes, frenemies, and hangers-on for you to gawk at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refreshingly candid, unflinchingly honest, and full of hilarious "Did she really say that?" moments, &lt;strong&gt;Official Book Club Selection&lt;/strong&gt; will make you laugh until you cry, or just puke up a little bit.</description>

  <description>The year is 1881. Meet the Mackenzie family--rich, powerful, dangerous, eccentric. A lady couldn't be seen with them without ruin. Rumors surround them--of tragic violence, of their mistresses, of their dark appetites, of scandals that set England and Scotland abuzz. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The youngest brother, Ian, known as the Mad Mackenzie, spent most of his young life in an asylum, and everyone agrees he is decidedly odd. He's also hard and handsome and has a penchant for Ming pottery and beautiful women. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Ackerley, widow, has recently come into a fortune. She has decided that she wants no more drama in her life. She was raised in drama--an alcoholic father who drove them into the workhouse, a frail mother she had to nurse until her death, a fussy old lady she became constant companion to. No, she wants to take her money and find peace, to travel, to learn art, to sit back and fondly remember her brief but happy marriage to her late husband. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Ian Mackenzie decides he wants her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first of a new historical series.</description>

      <![CDATA[I came into this book with very high hopes and I was not disappointed. I loved that the story featured an off-beat protagonist, which is a very nice change of pace from the typical historical romance novel. I liked the chemistry and the pacing of the story, so much so that I was up until 1:30 to...]]>

  <description>'Once there was a tree...and she loved a little boy.'&lt;br&gt;So begins a story of unforgettable perception, beautifully written and illustrated by the gifted and versatile Shel Silverstein.&lt;br&gt;Every day the boy would come to the tree to eat her apples, swing from her branches, or slide down her trunk...and the tree was happy. But as the boy grew older he began to want more from the tree, and the tree gave and gave and gave.&lt;br&gt;This is a tender story, touched with sadness, aglow with consolation. Shel Silverstein has created a moving parable for readers of all ages that offers an affecting interpretation of the gift of giving and a serene acceptance of another's capacity to love in return.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Sister's Keeper&lt;/em&gt; examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in &lt;em&gt;My Sister's Keeper,&lt;/em&gt; Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.  She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.  Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Seconds before the Earth is demolished to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect, a researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who, for the last fifteen years, has been posing as an out-of-work actor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together this dynamic pair begin a journey through space aided by quotes from The Hitchhiker's Guide ("A towel is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have") and a galaxy-full of fellow travelers: Zaphod Beeblebrox--the two-headed, three-armed ex-hippie and totally out-to-lunch president of the galaxy; Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend (formally Tricia McMillan), whom Arthur tried to pick up at a cocktail party once upon a time zone; Marvin, a paranoid, brilliant, and chronically depressed robot; Veet Voojagig, a former graduate student who is obsessed with the disappearance of all the ballpoint pens he bought over the years.</description>

  <description>When unattended environmental and economic crises lead to social chaos, not even gated communities are safe. In a night of fire and death Lauren Olamina, a minister's young daughter, loses her family and home and ventures out into the unprotected American landscape. But what begins as a flight for survival soon leads to something much more: a startling vision of human destiny... and the birth of a new faith.</description>

  <description>On the eve of wedding in 1978, Shay Garrett peers into the antique mirror in her family's longtime home, the famous Victorian Gingerbread House on Pearl Street in Boulder, Colorado, and falls unconscious only to wake in the body of her own grandmother Brandy on the eve of her wedding--in 1900. The virginal Brandy, in turn, awakes in Shay's body to discover herself pregnant. What follows is a fascinating look at how two women--and their families--cope with this strange situation.</description>

  <description>Dana, a modern black woman, is celebrating her twenty-sixth birthday with her new husband when she is snatched abruptly from her home in California and transported to the antebellum South. Rufus, the white son of a plantation owner, is drowning, and Dana has been summoned to save him. Dana is drawn back repeatedly through time to the slave quarters, and each time the stay grows longer, more arduous, and more dangerous until it is uncertain whether or not Dana's life will end, long before it has a chance to begin.</description>

  <description>Transported from the mid-twentieth century to New York City in the year 1882, Si Morley walks the fashionable "Ladies' Mile" of Broadway, is enchanted by the jingling sleigh bells in Central Park, and solves a 20th-century mystery by discovering its 19th-century roots. Falling in love with a beautiful young woman, he ultimately finds himself forced to choose between his lives in the present and the past. &lt;br&gt;A story that will remain in the listener's memory, "Time and Again" is a remarkable blending of the troubled present and a nostalgic past, made vivid and extraordinarily moving by the images of a time that was...and perhaps still is.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Blackout&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning author Connie Willis returned to the time-traveling future of 2060—the setting for several of her most celebrated works—and sent three Oxford historians to World War II England: Michael Davies, intent on observing heroism during the Miracle of Dunkirk; Merope Ward, studying children evacuated from London; and Polly Churchill, posing as a shopgirl in the middle of the Blitz. But when the three become unexpectedly trapped in 1940, they struggle not only to find their way home but to survive as Hitler’s bombers attempt to pummel London into submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now the situation has grown even more dire. Small discrepancies in the historical record seem to indicate that one or all of them have somehow affected the past, changing the outcome of the war. The belief that the past can be observed but never altered has always been a core belief of time-travel theory—but suddenly it seems that the theory is horribly, tragically wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Meanwhile, in 2060 Oxford, the historians’ supervisor, Mr. Dunworthy, and seventeen-year-old Colin Templer, who nurses a powerful crush on Polly, are engaged in a frantic and seemingly impossible struggle of their own—to find three missing needles in the haystack of history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Told with compassion, humor, and an artistry both uplifting and devastating, &lt;em&gt;All Clear&lt;/em&gt; is more than just the triumphant culmination of the adventure that began with Blackout. It’s Connie Willis’s most humane, heartfelt novel yet—a clear-eyed celebration of faith, love, and the quiet, ordinary acts of heroism and sacrifice too often overlooked by history.   </description>

  <description>In her first novel since 2002, Nebula and Hugo award-winning author Connie Willis returns with a stunning, enormously entertaining novel of time travel, war, and the deeds—great and small—of ordinary people who shape history. In the hands of this acclaimed storyteller, the past and future collide—and the result is at once intriguing, elusive, and frightening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oxford in 2060 is a chaotic place. Scores of time-traveling historians are being sent into the past, to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center. Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor. Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser, Mr. Dunworthy, into letting her go to VE Day. Polly Churchill’s next assignment will be as a shopgirl in the middle of London’s Blitz. And seventeen-year-old Colin Templer, who has a major crush on Polly, is determined to go to the Crusades so that he can “catch up” to her in age.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now the time-travel lab is suddenly canceling assignments for no apparent reason and switching around everyone’s schedules. And when Michael, Merope, and Polly finally get to World War II, things just get worse. For there they face air raids, blackouts, unexploded bombs, dive-bombing Stukas, rationing, shrapnel, V-1s, and two of the most incorrigible children in all of history—to say nothing of a growing feeling that not only their assignments but the war and history itself are spiraling out of control. Because suddenly the once-reliable mechanisms of time travel are showing significant glitches, and our heroes are beginning to question their most firmly held belief: that no historian can possibly change the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the people sheltering in the tube stations of London to the retired sailors who set off across the Channel to rescue the stranded British Army from Dunkirk, from shopgirls to ambulance drivers, from spies to hospital nurses to Shakespearean actors, &lt;strong&gt;Blackout &lt;/strong&gt;reveals a side of World War II seldom seen before: a dangerous, desperate world in which there are no civilians and in which everybody—from the Queen down to the lowliest barmaid—is determined to do their bit to help a beleaguered nation survive.</description>

  <description>Aspiring romance novelist Jane Sillee was completely in love with her fantasy man -- the hot and strapping dark-haired Highlander who d been coming to her in her dreams for years and inspired her sensual flights of literary fancy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was more than her imagination that conjured up the brilliantly woven tapestry sporting the spitting image of her magnificently arrogant warrior. It was more than a dream that transported her to medieval Scotland to break an evil spell. And it was more than she could handle when she found herself wrapped in the muscular arms of Aedan MacKinnon, who had his own fantasies to fulfill...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Karen Marie Moning comes the first book in her hotly anticipated new urban paranormal trilogy, set in the world of her blockbuster Fever series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1 AWC—After the Wall Crash. The Fae are free and hunting us. It’s a war zone out there, and no two days are alike. I’m Dani O’Malley, the chaos-filled streets of Dublin are my home, and there’s no place I’d rather be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dani “Mega” O’Malley plays by her own set of rules—and in a world overrun by Dark Fae, her biggest rule is: Do what it takes to survive. Possessing rare talents and the all-powerful Sword of Light, Dani is more than equipped for the task. In fact, she’s one of the rare humans who can defend themselves against the Unseelie. But now, amid the pandemonium, her greatest gifts have turned into serious liabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dani’s ex–best friend, MacKayla Lane, wants her dead, the terrifying Unseelie princes have put a price on her head, and Inspector Jayne, the head of the police force, is after her sword and will stop at nothing to get it. What’s more, people are being mysteriously frozen to death all over the city, encased on the spot in sub-zero, icy tableaux. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dublin’s most seductive nightclub gets blanketed in hoarfrost, Dani finds herself at the mercy of Ryodan, the club’s ruthless, immortal owner. He needs her quick wit and exceptional skill to figure out what’s freezing Fae and humans dead in their tracks—and Ryodan will do anything to ensure her compliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodging bullets, fangs, and fists, Dani must strike treacherous bargains and make desperate alliances to save her beloved Dublin—before everything and everyone in it gets iced.</description>

I was a bit worried about sexual content with a 14 year old MC. I have heard so, so much buzz surrounding this issue. Let me tell you, I was actu...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Woman's Tender Touch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was born to a clan of warriors of supernatural strength, but Gavrael McIllioch abandoned his name and his Highland castle, determined to escape the dark fate of his ancestors. Hiding his identity from the relentless rival clan that hunted him, he called himself Grimm to protect the people he cared for, vowing never to acknowledge his love for ravishing Jillian St. Clair. Yet even from afar he watched over her, and when her father sent an urgent summons, "Come for Jillian," he raced to her side—into a competition to win her hand in marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Warrior's Steely Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why had he run from her so many years before? And why return now to see her offered as a prize in her father's manipulative game? Furious, Jillian vowed never to wed. But Grimm was the man she loved, the one who urged her to marry another. He tried to pretend indifference as she tempted him, but he could not deny the fierce desires that compelled him to abduct her from the altar. She was the only woman who could tame the beast that raged within him—even as deadly enemies plotted to destroy them both....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unabridged recording in 9 parts (10 hours, 23 minutes).&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Who can guess what a woman will do when the unthinkable becomes her reality?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until now, Kathryn Lyons's life has been peaceful if unextraordinary: a satisfying job teaching high school in the New England mill town of her childhood; a picture-perfect home by the ocean; a precocious, independent-minded fifteen-year-old daughter; and a happy marriage whose occasional dull passages she attributes to the unavoidable deadening effect of time. As a pilot's wife, Kathryn has learned to expect both intense exhilaration and long periods alone—but nothing has prepared her for the late-night knock that lets her know her husband has died in a crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Kathryn struggles with her grief, she descends into a maelstrom of publicity stirred up by the modern hunger for the details of tragedy. Even before the plane is located in waters off the Irish coast, the relentless focus on her husband's life begins to bring a bizarre personal mystery into focus. Could there be any truth to the increasingly disturbing rumors that he had a secret? Fighting the impulse to protect herself and her daughter from the details of the crash and the mystery surrounding it, Kathryn sets out to learn who her husband really was—whatever that knowledge may cost. The search will lead her to shocking revelations, testing both the truth of her marriage and the limits of her ability to face it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the bestselling author of The Weight of Water, this taut, impassioned novel asks fundamental questions we all have about how well we can really know anyone—even those (or especially those) we love the most. Written with grace and controlled beauty, The Pilot's Wife definitively places Anita Shreve among the ranks of the best novelists writing today.</description>

  <description>The discovery of a dead infant in an Amish barn shakes Lancaster County to its core. But the police investigation leads to a more shocking disclosure: circumstantial evidence suggests that eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher, an unmarried Amish woman believed to be the newborn's mother, took the child's life. When Ellie Hathaway, a disillusioned big-city attorney, comes to Paradise, Pennsylvania, to defend Katie, two cultures collide -- and for the first time in her high-profile career, Ellie faces a system of justice very different from her own. Delving deep inside the world of those who live "plain," Ellie must find a way to reach Katie on her terms. And as she unravels a tangled murder case, Ellie also looks deep within -- to confront her own fears and desires when a man from her past reenters her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; For twenty-eight years, things have been tripping along nicely for Cannie Shapiro. Sure, her mother has come charging out of the closet, and her father has long since dropped out of her world. But she loves her friends, her rat terrier, Nifkin, and her job as pop culture reporter for The Philadelphia Examiner. She's even made a tenuous peace with her plus-size body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the day she opens up a national women's magazine and sees the words "Loving a Larger Woman" above her ex-boyfriend's byline, Cannie is plunged into misery...and the most amazing year of her life. From Philadelphia to Hollywood and back home again, she charts a new course for herself: mourning her losses, facing her past, and figuring out who she is and who she can become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: please see &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11813905-good-in-bed"&gt;this edition&lt;/a&gt; for an alternative cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Mr. Kapasi, the protagonist of Jhumpa Lahiri's title story, would  certainly have his work cut out for him if he were forced to interpret the maladies of all the characters in this eloquent debut collection. Take, for example, Shoba and Shukumar, the young couple in "A Temporary Matter" whose marriage is crumbling in the wake of a stillborn child. Or Miranda in "Sexy," who is involved in a hopeless affair with a married man. But Mr. Kapasi has problems enough of his own; in addition to his regular job working as an interpreter for a doctor who does not speak his patients' language, he also drives tourists to local sites of interest. His fare on this particular day is Mr. and Mrs. Das--first-generation Americans of Indian descent--and their children. During the course of the afternoon, Mr. Kapasi becomes enamored of Mrs. Das and then becomes her unwilling confidant when she reads too much into his profession. "I told you because of your talents," she informs him after divulging a startling secret.  &lt;blockquote&gt; I'm tired of feeling so terrible all the time. Eight years, Mr. Kapasi, I've been in pain eight years. I was hoping you could help me feel better; say the right thing. Suggest some kind of remedy. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Of course, Mr. Kapasi has no cure for what ails Mrs. Das--or himself. Lahiri's subtle, bittersweet ending is characteristic of the collection as a whole. Some of these nine tales are set in India, others in the United States, and most concern characters of Indian heritage. Yet the situations Lahiri's people face, from unhappy marriages to civil war, transcend ethnicity. As the narrator of the last story, "The Third and Final Continent," comments: "There are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept."  In that single line Jhumpa Lahiri sums up a universal experience, one that applies to all who have grown up, left home, fallen in or out of love, and, above all, experienced what it means to be a foreigner, even within one's own family.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I knew we were both in mortal danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in that instant I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella ever could have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Bride McTierney has had it with men. They're cheap, self-centered, and never love her for who she is. But though she prides herself on being independent, deep down she still yearns for a knight in shining armor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She just never expected her knight in shining armor to have a shiny coat of fur...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deadly and tortured, Vane Kattalakis isn't what he seems. Most women lament that their boyfriends are dogs. In Bride's case, hers is a wolf. A Were-Hunter wolf. Wanted dead by his enemies, Vane isn't looking for a mate. But the Fates have marked Bride as his. Now he has three weeks to either convince Bride that the supernatural is real or he will spend the rest of his life neutered--something no self-respecting wolf can accept...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how does a wolf convince a human to trust him with her life when his enemies are out to end his? In the world of the Were-Hunters, it really is dog-eat-dog. And only one alpha male can win.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>Hail Glorious Reader: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was born the noble son of a legendary Roman senator. I walked through the ancient world as a general, admired and supreme until a brutal betrayal caused me to bargain my soul. Now I'm an immortal Dark-Hunter, bound to protect mankind from the evil scourge that haunts it. Over the centuries, I've seen many frightening things: plagues, pestilence, disco music... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now Tabitha Devereaux. A human, she has trained herself to fight vampires every bit as capably as any Dark-Hunter. Idiosyncratic and off-beat, she is my personal bane-and yet she beguiles me. There are only two small problems. She happens to be the twin of my mortal enemy's wife. More than that, Tabitha and her sister are being stalked by a power that will not rest until everyone she holds dear is dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike my Dark-Hunter brethren, I rely on no one but myself. They spurned me and I turned my back on them. But the only way to save Tabitha and her family is to find some way to bridge a two thousand-year-old feud. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say opposites attract, but can they stay together when even the Fates conspire to keep them apart? Then again, the Fates have never dealt with the likes of Tabitha Devereaux before. They're going to be in for quite a fight...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--Valerius Magnus</description>

  <description>Wulf is an ancient Viking warrior with a useful but extremely aggravating power—amnesia. No one who meets him in person can remember him 5 minutes later. It makes it easy to have one-night stands, but hard to have a meaningful relationship, and without true love he can never regain his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he finally meets Cassandra, the one woman who can remember him, she turns out to be the princess of the cursed race he's sworn to hunt—and forbidden to him. The two of them must face ancient curses, prophecies, and the direct meddling of the Greek gods to find true happiness at last.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It's a predator-eat-predator world for the Were-Hunters. Danger haunts any given day. There is no one to trust. No one to love. Not if they want to live...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;An orphan with no clan that will claim him, Wren Tigarian grew to adulthood under the close scrutiny and mistrust of those around him. A forbidden blend of two animals - snow leopard and white tiger - Wren has never listened to anyone when there was something he wanted. Now he wants Marguerite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marguerite D'Aubert Goudeau is the daughter of a prominent U.S. senator who hates the socialite life she's forced to live. Like her mother before her, she has strong Cajun roots that her father doesn't understand. Still, she has no choice but to try and conform to a world where she feels like an outsider. But the world of rich and powerful humans is never to meet the world of the Were-Hunters who exist side by side with them, unseen, unknown, undetected. To break this law is to call down a wrath of the highest order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to have Marguerite, Wren must fight not just the humans who will never accept his animal nature, but the Were-Hunters who want him dead for endangering their world. It's a race against time and magic without boundary that could cost Marguerite and Wren not just their lives, but their very souls...</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be immortal? To journey through the night stalking the evil that preys on humans? To have unlimited wealth, unlimited power? That is my existence, and it is dark and dangerous. I play hero to thousands, but am known to none. And I love every minute of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so I thought until one night when I woke up handcuffed to my worst nightmare: a conservative woman in a button-down shirt. Or in Amanda's case, buttoned all the way up to her chin. She's smart, sexy, witty, and wants nothing to do with the paranormal-in other words, me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My attraction to Amanda Devereaux goes against everything I stand for. Not to mention the last time I fell in love it cost me not only my human life, but also my very soul. Yet every time I look at her, I find myself wanting to try again. Wanting to believe that love and loyalty do exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more disturbing, I find myself wondering if there's any way a woman like Amanda can love a man whose battle scars run deep, and whose heart was damaged by a betrayal so savage that he's not sure it will ever beat again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kyrian of Thrace&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Zarek's Point of View:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark-Hunter: A soulless guardian who stands between mankind and those who would see mankind destroyed. Yeah, right. The only part of that Code of Honor I got was eternity and solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insanity: A condition many say I suffer from after being alone for so long. But I don't suffer from my insanity-I enjoy every minute of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trust: I can't trust anyone...not even myself. The only thing I trust in is my ability to do the wrong thing in any situation and to hurt anyone who gets in my way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truth: I endured a lifetime as a Roman slave, and 900 years as an exiled Dark-Hunter. Now I'm tired of enduring. I want the truth about what happened the night I was exiled-I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astrid (Greek, meaning star): An exceptional woman who can see straight to the truth. Brave and strong, she is a point of light in the darkness. She touches me and I tremble. She smiles and my cold heart shatters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zarek: They say even the most damned man can be forgiven. I never believed that until the night Astrid opened her door to me and made this feral beast want to be human again. Made me want to love and be loved. But how can an ex-slave whose soul is owned by a Greek goddess ever dream of touching, let alone holding, a fiery star?&lt;br&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Includes a preview of the new novel in the Outlander series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This could be the worthy Lord John Grey’s breakout novel, as readers are treated to large dollops of Outlander hero Jamie Fraser. . . . The strong chemistry between these two stalwart, yet supremely dissimilar, protagonists crackles.”—&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; A captivating return to the world Diana Gabaldon created in her Outlander and Lord John series, &lt;em&gt;The Scottish Prisoner&lt;/em&gt; is a masterpiece of epic history, wicked deceit, and scores that can only be settled in blood.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; London, 1760. For Jamie Fraser, paroled prisoner-of-war, life is coming apart at the seams. In the remote Lake District, where he’s close enough to the son he cannot claim as his own, Jamie’s quiet existence is interrupted first by dreams of his lost wife, then by the appearance of an erstwhile comrade still fighting to rally the Irish. But Jamie has sworn off politics, fighting, and war. Until Lord John Grey shows up with a summons that will take him away from everything he loves—again. Lord John is in possession of explosive documents that expose a damning case of corruption against a British officer. But they also hint at a more insidious danger. Soon Lord John and Jamie are unwilling companions on the road to Ireland, a country whose dark castles hold dreadful secrets, and whose bogs hide the bones of the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Call it what you will—historical adventure, conspiracy thriller—it’s an engrossing story, masterfully paced, with exciting plot twists, swift reversals, and robust characterizations.”—&lt;em&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A spirited return to the world first created in Outlander . . . This novel is, ultimately, an authentically fashioned historical mystery that allows the author to do what she does best: chronicle the lives of her characters with impeccable detail. . . . Gabaldon fans, you’ll find much to delight in here.”—&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As always, Gabaldon goes above and beyond. . . . If you love historical fiction, this book could be a good entrance point into the Outlander world.”—Bookreporter&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Note: Previously included in the anthology &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6714177.Warriors" title="Warriors"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diana Gabaldon, bestselling author of the acclaimed Outlander series, weaves an engrossing tale of war, history, and suspense in this original novella—available exclusively as an eBook—featuring returning hero Lord John Grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;London, 1759. After a high society electric-eel party leads to a duel that ends badly, Lord John Grey feels the need to lie low for a while. Conveniently, before starting his new commission in His Majesty’s army, Lord John receives an urgent summons. An old friend from the military, Charlie Carruthers, is facing court-martial in Canada, and has called upon Lord John to serve as his character witness. Grey voyages to the New World—a land rife with savages (many of them on his own side) and cleft by war—where he soon finds that he must defend not only his friend’s life but his own.</description>

  <description>He would sell his warrior soul to possess her. . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alluring laird...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was known throughout the kingdom as Hawk, legendary predator of the battlefield and the boudoir. No woman could refuse his touch, but no woman ever stirred his heart—until a vengeful fairy tumbled Adrienne de Simone out of modern-day Seattle and into medieval Scotland. Captive in a century not her own, entirely too bold, too outspoken, she was an irresistible challenge to the sixteenth-century rogue. Coerced into a marriage with Hawk, Adrienne vowed to keep him at arm's length—but his sweet seduction played havoc with her resolve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A prisoner in time...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She had a perfect "no" on her perfect lips for the notorious laird, but Hawk swore she would whisper his name with desire, begging for the passion he longed to ignite within her. Not even the barriers of time and space would keep him from winning her love. Despite her uncertainty about following the promptings of her own passionate heart, Adrienne's reservations were no match for Hawk's determination to keep her by his side. . . .</description>

  <description>In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: &lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, &lt;em&gt;Bel Canto&lt;/em&gt; remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. &lt;em&gt;--Victoria Jenkins&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>IT BEGAN WITH A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historian Diana Bishop, descended from a line of powerful witches, and long-lived vampire Matthew Clairmont have broken the laws dividing creatures. When Diana discovered a significant alchemical manuscript in the Bodleian Library,she sparked a struggle in which she became bound to Matthew. Now the fragile coexistence of witches, daemons, vampires and humans is dangerously threatened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeking safety, Diana and Matthew travel back in time to London, 1590. But they soon realise that the past may not provide a haven. Reclaiming his former identity as poet and spy for Queen Elizabeth, the vampire falls back in with a group of radicals known as the School of Night. Many are unruly daemons, the creative minds of the age, including playwright Christopher Marlowe and mathematician Thomas Harriot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together Matthew and Diana scour Tudor London for the elusive manuscript Ashmole 782, and search for the witch who will teach Diana how to control her remarkable powers...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For readers of Amy Tan's bestselling novel, &lt;em&gt;The Valley of Amazement&lt;/em&gt;, revisit her classic tale of mothers and daughters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Four mothers, four daughters, four families whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who's "saying" the stories. In 1949 four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, begin meeting to eat dim sum, play mahjong, and talk. United in shared unspeakable loss and hope, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Rather than sink into tragedy, they choose to gather to raise their spirits and money. "To despair was to wish back for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable." Forty years later the stories and history continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.</description>

  <description>St. Vladimir’s Academy isn’t just any boarding school—it’s a hidden place where vampires are educated in the ways of magic and half-human teens train to protect them. Rose Hathaway is a Dhampir, a bodyguard for her best friend Lissa, a Moroi Vampire Princess. They’ve been on the run, but now they’re being dragged back to St. Vladimir’s—the very place where they’re most in danger...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose and Lissa become enmeshed in forbidden romance, the Academy’s ruthless social scene, and unspeakable nighttime rituals. But they must be careful lest the Strigoi—the world’s fiercest and most dangerous vampires—make Lissa one of them forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[**4.3 stars**<br /><br />I started this book thinking that this series was waaayyy over hyped. For the first 75 pages or so, I was feeling kind of blah about it. I mean, Lissa is pretty freaking annoying and I wasn't seeing much action. It was a tad boring. Then my opinion slowly started to change, and I rea...]]>

  <description>The day Preston Drake figured out that wealthy women paid well for a set of tight abs and a pretty face his life turned around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The run down rat-infested trailer he had shared with his alcoholic mother and three younger siblings was now only a place he visited to pay the bills and stock the pantry with food. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He no longer worried about his family starving or living without electricity. The money he made entertaining rich older women more than covered his family’s needs and his own. He had it all figured out.  Except…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was this girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was as innocent as he was tainted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amanda Hardy wished her knees didn’t get weak when Preston walked into a room. She hated the fact her heart raced when he flashed his smile in her direction. He had a different girl in his bed every night. He was the kind of boy a smart girl ran from. So, why was she coming up with ways to get close to him? Even when it was obvious he wanted to keep her at a distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe her heart knew something the world didn’t. Maybe Preston Drake was more than just a pretty face.</description>

  <description>Maybe driving home after a few (or more) shots of tequila had been a bad idea, but hell, he did it all the time. The cops had to have been freaking bored to have pulled him over. He wasn’t even swerving! That’s Cage York’s story and he’s sticking to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, his baseball coach isn’t buying it. Cage has a free ride to the local junior college for baseball -- or he did, until he’d gotten a DUI. Now, Cage has to decide: does he drop out and give up his dream of getting noticed by a college in the SEC, and possibly making it into the Major Leagues -- or does he give in to his coach’s demands and spend his summer baling hay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Brooks planned out her life step by step when she was eight years old. Not once over the years had she lost sight of her goals. Josh Beasley, her next door neighbor, had been the center of those goals. He’d been her first boyfriend at seven, her first kiss at ten, her first date at fifteen, and her first tragedy at eighteen. The moment she’d received the phone call from Josh’s mother saying he’d been killed along with four other soldiers just north of Baghdad, Eva’s carefully planned life imploded in the worst way possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cage isn’t real happy with his closet-sized bedroom in the back of a foul smelling barn, or his daily interactions with cows, but he knows that if he doesn’t make his coach happy then he can kiss his scholarship goodbye. Only a sick and twisted man would decide his punishment was to be working on a farm all summer. No hot babes in bikinis waiting to meet a Southern boy to make her vacation complete. Just him and the damned cows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh -- and an uptight, snarky brunette with the biggest blue eyes he’s every seen. But she doesn’t count, because as hard as he’s tried to charm her out of her panties - he’s pretty sure she’d rather see him hung from the rafters than let him get a taste of her pretty little lips.</description>

  <description>In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol' dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she's sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. &lt;br&gt;Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unabridged recording on 5 CDs (5.5 Hours).&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>From the winner of the Catherine Cookson Fiction Prize, this mesmerizing, suspenseful, and richly atmospheric tale of time travel draws us into the heart of a heroine we won't soon forget...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first time Julia Beckett saw Greywethers she was only five, but she knew at once that it was her house. Now, twenty-five years later, by some strange chance, she has just become the new owner of the sixteenth-century Wilshire farmhouse. But Julia soon begins to suspect that more than coincidence has brought her there. As if Greywethers were a portal between worlds, she finds herself abruptly transported back in time. Stepping into seventeenth-century England, Julia becomes Mariana, a beautiful young woman struggling against danger and treachery, and battling a forbidden love for Richard de Mornay, handsome forebear of the present squire of Crofton Hall. Each time Julia travels back, she becomes more enthralled with the past, falling ever deeper in love with Richard...until one day she realizes Mariana's life threatens to eclipse her own--and that she must find a way to lay the past to rest, or risk losing a chance for love in her own time.</description>

  <description>This tells the poignant tale of a Chinese farmer and his family in old agrarian China. The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family. Nearby, the nobles of the House of Hwang consider themselves above the land and its workers; but they will soon meet their own downfall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family when flood and drought force them to seek work in the city. The working people riot, breaking into the homes of the rich and forcing them to flee. When Wang Lung shows mercy to one noble and is rewarded, he begins to rise in the world, even as the House of Hwang falls.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch—and there's always a catch—is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The most anticipated story in the blockbuster Dark-Hunter series. The never-before-revealed story of the Dark-Hunter leader, Acheron.  He was made human in order to escape death, but in death he was reborn a god. . .&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Eleven thousand years ago a god was born. Cursed into the body of a human, Acheron spent a lifetime of shame. However, his human death unleashed an unspeakable horror that almost destroyed the earth. Then, brought back against his will, Acheron became the sole defender of mankind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only it was never that simple. For centuries, he has fought for our survival and hidden a past he’ll do anything to keep concealed. Until a lone woman who refuses to be intimidated by him threatens his very existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now his survival, and ours, hinges on hers and old enemies reawaken and unite to kill them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War has never been more deadly... or more fun.</description>

  <description>The Mortal War is over, and sixteen-year-old Clary Fray is back home in New York, excited about all the possibilities before her. She’s training to become a Shadowhunter and to use her unique power. Her mother is getting married to the love of her life. Downworlders and Shadowhunters are at peace at last. And—most importantly of all—she can finally call Jace her boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nothing comes without a price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone is murdering Shadowhunters, provoking tensions between Downworlders and Shadowhunters that could lead to a second, bloody war. Clary’s best friend, Simon, can’t help her—his mother just found out that he’s a vampire, and now he’s homeless. When Jace begins to pull away from her without explaining why, Clary is forced to delve into the heart of a mystery whose solution reveals her worst nightmare: she herself has set in motion a terrible chain of events that could lead to her losing everything she loves. Even Jace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stakes are higher than ever in the #1 New York Times bestselling fourth installment of the Mortal Instruments series.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.  Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it.  District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Don't be afraid," I murmured. "We belong together."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was abruptly overwhelmed by the truth of my own words. This moment was so perfect, so right, there was no way to doubt it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His arms wrapped around me, holding me against him... It felt like every nerve ending in my body was a live wire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Forever," he agreed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life-first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in New Moon and Eclipse-seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

  <description>"A fresh present-day story infused with an original take on popular history. Forget broomsticks and pointy hats; here are witches that could well be walking among us today. This debut novel flows with poetic charm and eloquence that achieves high literary merit while concocting a gripping supernatural puzzler. Katherine Howe's talent is spellbinding."&lt;br&gt;--Matthew Pearl, author of &lt;em&gt;The Poe Shadow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Dante Club&lt;/em&gt;A spellbinding, beautifully written novel that moves between contemporary times and one of the most fascinating and disturbing periods in American history-the Salem witch trials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harvard graduate student Connie Goodwin needs to spend her summer doing research for her doctoral dissertation. But when her mother asks her to handle the sale of Connie's grandmother's abandoned home near Salem, she can't refuse. As she is drawn deeper into the mysteries of the family house, Connie discovers an ancient key within a seventeenth-century Bible. The key contains a yellowing fragment of parchment with a name written upon it: Deliverance Dane. This discovery launches Connie on a quest--to find out who this woman was and to unearth a rare artifact of singular power: a physick book, its pages a secret repository for lost knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the pieces of Deliverance's harrowing story begin to fall into place, Connie is haunted by visions of the long-ago witch trials, and she begins to fear that she is more tied to Salem's dark past then she could have ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written with astonishing conviction and grace, &lt;em&gt;The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane&lt;/em&gt; travels seamlessly between the witch trials of the 1690s and a modern woman's story of mystery, intrigue, and revelation.</description>

  <description>The Poisonwood Bible is a story told by the wife and four daughters of Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist who takes his family and mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it -- from garden seeds to Scripture -- is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family's tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I was born twice: first, as a baby girl, on a remarkably smogless Detroit day of January 1960; and then again, as a teenage boy, in an emergency room near Petoskey, Michigan, in August of 1974. . . My birth certificate lists my name as Calliope Helen Stephanides. My most recent driver's license...records my first name simply as Cal."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins the breathtaking story of Calliope Stephanides and three generations of the Greek-American Stephanides family who travel from a tiny village overlooking Mount Olympus in Asia Minor to Prohibition-era Detroit, witnessing its glory days as the Motor City, and the race riots of 1967, before they move out to the tree-lined streets of suburban Grosse Pointe, Michigan. To understand why Calliope is not like other girls, she has to uncover a guilty family secret and the astonishing genetic history that turns Callie into Cal, one of the most audacious and wondrous narrators in contemporary fiction. Lyrical and thrilling, &lt;em&gt;Middlesex &lt;/em&gt;is an exhilarating reinvention of the American epic.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Charlie is a freshman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while he's not the biggest geek in the school, he is by no means popular. Shy, introspective, intelligent beyond his years yet socially awkward, he is a wallflower, caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie is attempting to navigate his way through uncharted territory: the world of first dates and mix tapes, family dramas and new friends; the world of sex, drugs, and &lt;em&gt;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&lt;/em&gt;, when all one requires is that perfect song on that perfect drive to feel infinite. But he can't stay on the sideline forever. Standing on the fringes of life offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply affecting coming-of-age story that will spirit you back to those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.</description>

  <description>INTENSE. DANGEROUS. ADDICTIVE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn’t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University’s Walking One-Night Stand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wants—and needs—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.</description>

  <description>Minerva Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man who asked her to dinner to win a bet. Even if he is gorgeous and successful Calvin Morrisey. Cal knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. Even if she does wear great shoes and keeps him on his toes. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Fate has other plans, and it's not long before Min and Cal meet again. Soon, they're dealing with a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kreme donuts, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a freakishly intelligent cat, Chicken Marsala, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of. Including the biggest gamble of all--true love.</description>

  <description>A laird trapped between centuries...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enchanted by a powerful spell, Highland laird Drustan MacKeltar slumbered for nearly five centuries hidden deep in a cave, until an unlikely savior awakened him. The enticing lass who dressed and spoke like no woman he'd ever known was from his distant future, where crumbled ruins were all that remained of his vanished world. Drustan knew he had to return to his own century if he was to save his people from a terrible fate. And he needed the bewitching woman by his side.... &lt;br&gt;A woman changed forever in his arms...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwen Cassidy had come to Scotland to shake up her humdrum life and, just maybe, meet a man. How could she have known that a tumble down a Highland ravine would send her plunging into an underground cavern -- to land atop the most devastatingly seductive man she'd ever seen? Or that once he'd kissed her, he wouldn't let her go? &lt;br&gt;Bound to Drustan by a passion stronger than time, Gwen is swept back to sixteenth-century Scotland, where a treacherous enemy plots against them ... and where a warrior with the power to change history will defy time itself for the woman he loves....</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being trapped in a bedroom with a woman is a grand thing. Being trapped in hundreds of bedrooms over two thousand years isn't. And being cursed into a book as a love-slave for eternity can ruin even a Spartan warrior's day.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a love-slave, I know everything about women. How to touch them, how to savor them, and most of all, how to pleasure them. But when I was summoned to fulfill Grace Alexander's sexual fantasies, I found the first woman in history who saw me as a man with a tormented past. She alone bothered to take me out of the bedroom and onto the world.  She taught me to love again.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I was not born to love. I was cursed to walk eternity alone. As a general, I had long ago accepted my sentence. Yet now I have found Grace--the one thing my wounded heart cannot survive without. Sure, love can heal all wounds, but can it break a two-thousand-year-old curse?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julian of Macedon&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See original cover edition: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5597761-fantasy-lover"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder -- much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bella Swan moves to the gloomy town of Forks and meets Edward Cullen, her life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. With his porcelain skin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now, he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Bella doesn't realize is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And it might be too late to turn back...</description>

He’s rescued by a man with beautiful green eyes who takes care of him until he’s put into an ambulance. Frankie curses himself as he realizes he doesn’t have the man’s phone number. Still in pain a few days later, he is dragged out to a club only to be saved by Green Eyes once more. This time, he isn’t letting the man go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately Frankie has to attend a team-building exercise, nicknamed Womb Weekend, organized by his company.

      <![CDATA[What can I say about this novella? I'll describe it in three words: <strong>Cute, British, rushed.</strong><br /><br />My first book by Sue Brown and it was a very pleasant experience. This was a fun story with tons of British lingo (<em>Manky</em> being my favorite), and a nice little relationship between the two MCs. <br /><br />Was it very me...]]>

  <description>The truth will set you free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Sayre joins the Interstellar Navy for the money—his only goal is to keep his little brother out of the colony mines that sent their father to an early grave. With concepts like duty and honor floating high over his head, he hardly expects to fall for the serious, idealistic Shane Cawley. Not to mention that Shane is his commanding officer . . . and his Resonance partner, a one-in-ten-thousand mental connection so profound that they can travel in each other’s mindscapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane Cawley is carrying on the family tradition by serving in the Interstellar Navy. He hardly expects to fall for the quirky, happy-go-lucky Mark Sayre. But as the Resonance between them grows, neither can deny what he feels for the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When war breaks out, Mark and Shane find their military training and their Resonance link tested to the edge of sanity. Shane is haunted by memories and flashbacks, and Mark becomes trapped in his own mindscape. But with help from an unlikely ally, they may be able to salvage their futures and the love they share.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed the majority of this book, despite the flipping back and forth between past and present time frames. The story had an interesting premise. I loved the concept of "Resonance", basically an empathetic connection between two people, and how it factored into the story. The connection...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Lost: one dog and two men in need of each other. Found: love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RV resort security chief Ringo never believed in love at first sight . . . until he saw Gavin playing his sax on the beach for the tourists. But their on-again, off-again affair—even counting all the great makeup sex—doesn’t come close to the relationship he wants. All he really wants for Christmas is a commitment from Gavin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead he discovers that Gavin has had surgery without telling him, so he lays down a relationship ultimatum while Gavin recuperates. Complicating matters even more, Gavin’s beloved dog Bird runs away, and Gavin blames Ringo for the disappearance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Ringo throws every resource he has into finding Bird, he learns deeper truths about Gavin—how hard it is for him to trust and how little faith he has in love. Maybe if Ringo can find Bird, he can salvage Gavin’s faith. Maybe this Christmas, they can all find each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% of all proceeds from this title are donated to the Ali Forney Center in New York, whose mission “is to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ) youth from the harm of homelessness, and to support them in becoming safe and independent as they move from adolescence to adulthood.” To learn more about this charity or to donate directly, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.aliforneycenter.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.aliforneycenter.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>London 1889.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Ira Adler, former rent-boy and present plaything of crime lord Cain Goddard, stealing back the statue from Goddard's blackmailer should have been a doddle. But inside the statue is evidence that could put Goddard away for a long time under the sodomy laws, and everyone's after it, including Ira's bitter ex, Dr. Timothy Lazarus. No sooner does Ira have the porcelain dog in his hot little hands, than he loses it to a nimble-fingered prostitute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Ira’s search for the dog drags him back to the mean East End streets where he grew up, he discovers secrets about his own past, and about Goddard's present business dealings, which make him question everything he thought he knew. An old friend turns up dead, and an old enemy proves himself a friend. Goddard is pressing Ira for a commitment, but every new discovery casts doubt on whether Ira can, in good conscience, remain with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, Ira must choose between his hard-won life of luxury and standing against a grievous wrong.</description>

      <![CDATA[Jess Faraday shows off her beautiful, skillful writing skills in this unique historical mystery. It is most certainly not a romance book, though, if you are interested solely in that. It reminded me a great deal of the Lord John series (starting with <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10990.Lord_John_and_the_Private_Matter" title="Lord John and the Private Matter by Diana Gabaldon">Lord John and the Private Matter</a>), which is wh...]]>

  <description>For Mike and Will, “No Flag” meant “come home alive”, but will their love survive what happens next? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Captain Mike Kelley does not ignore his intuition, so when sexy bartender Will Hayes captures his heart, Mike embarks on a mission to win him over to a Domestic Discipline relationship.  Will accepts with one caveat: Mike must promise not to renew his Army contract.  Mike agrees, and they spend a year building a life together, getting married, and starting a business.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Only days before their café’s grand opening, Mike receives news that threatens everything he and Will have built.  The Army invokes the Stop Loss military policy to involuntarily extend his commission and send him back overseas.  Will, left alone to cope with the café, must rely on the support of old friends who may no longer be trustworthy.  Through emails and Skype calls, Mike and Will keep their love and structure alive…until the day a horrific terrorist attack occurs on Mike’s outpost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Mike awakens in a hospital with a devastating injury and no memory of the attack. As the only survivor, Mike’s memory may be the key to national security. Mike struggles to cope with his injury and Will struggles to support the man who always held him up.  Both fear they have lost their previous relationship.  Will has Mike back rather than a folded flag, but in the aftermath of war, can they rebuild the life they had before?  Especially when those closest to them may not have their best interests at heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Contains BDSM elements in the context of a loving relationship.*</description>

  <description>Tracy Brandt considers himself a lucky man. He has a wonderful family, good friends, and a dependable job. His love life, however, features a cheating ex who, though out of the house, is not yet out of the picture—with a past that just might get Tracy killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homicide inspector Cord Nolan wants nothing more than to show his best friend’s little brother that he’s a reliable man, but to do that he’ll have to get Tracy to look past the player he used to be. It'll be a tough sell; reputation is everything, and Cord's is tarnished by his past indiscretions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tracy and Cord have spent five years trying to suffocate their fiery attraction under a blanket of grudging antagonism. When Tracy finds himself with a target on his back, Cord finally has the chance to ride to the rescue and break through the dam of Tracy's reserve. But he’d better be careful: if Cord is breaking the floodgates to wash away the past, he's going to have to hold tight to Tracy to make sure they're still standing when the tumult recedes.</description>

  <description>Love comes along when you least expect it. That’s what Duncan Taylor’s sister, Scout, tells him. Scout has everything Duncan wants—a happy life with a wonderful husband. Now that Seattle has made gay marriage legal, Duncan knows he can have the same thing. But when he proposes to his boyfriend Tucker, he doesn’t get the answer he hoped for. Tucker’s refusal is another misstep in a long line of failed romances. Despairing, Duncan thinks of all the loving unions in his life—and how every one of them is straight. Maybe he could be happy, if not sexually compatible, with a woman. When zany, gay-man-loving Marilyn Samples waltzes into his life, he thinks he may have found his answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to settle, Duncan forgets his sister’s wisdom about love and begins planning a wedding with Marilyn. But life throws Duncan a curveball. When he meets wedding planner Peter Dalrymple, unexpected sparks ignite. Neither man knows how long he can resist his powerful attraction to the other. For sure, there’s a wedding in the future. But whose?</description>

  <description>Valentine’s Day has always been one major suckfest for Andrew. He knows he is cursed and has resorted to avoiding everything even remotely related to the stupid “holiday.” Against his better judgment, Andrew lets his best friend talk him into attending a themed party one Valentine’s Day evening. Andrew spends the whole night cautiously waiting for his bad luck to kick in, nervous to see what disastrous situation he might find himself in. While at the party, Andrew meets Evan and is immediately attracted to him, but Andrew worries it will end in another Valentine’s debacle if he tries anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Evan convince Andrew he’s worth the risk or will this really be one more Valentine’s disaster?</description>

      <![CDATA[This might be my first M/M romance about a guy who is asexual. While Albert certainly has romantic love for Harry, he maintained a very low interest level in sex... huh. <br /><br />There was something very touching about this story.

  <description>One snowy evening, wounded WWI veteran Jasper Pritchard arrives at Valentine Nugent’s sweet shop with an unusual request. Jasper’s deceased great-aunt has left him a fortune, along with a box of indiscreet letters she wants returned to the writer, and the only clue is a tin sold in Valentine’s shop over twenty years ago. As they search the shop’s records and uncover a love story from long ago, they find far more than the answer to the mystery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A part of the "A Valentine Rainbow" set of 14 holiday stories. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Jez is on a mission of mercy: to replace a tragically deceased comic book for his injured best mate, Tel. Venturing into the Hidden Asteroid bookstore in London—the temple of geekdom itself—Jez is bowled over by the guy behind the counter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rhys is the poster boy for hot geeks: tall, gorgeous, and totally cool. Jez is desperate to impress him, so he bluffs his way through comic book jargon . . . and then dashes back to the hospital to beg Tel to teach him how to speak Geek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tel’s happy to oblige, and Jez is over the moon when Rhys asks him out. He’s even more thrilled when they discover a shared love of rugby, something he won’t have to fake for Rhys. The question is, how long can Jez keep up the deception, and what will happen when Rhys realizes he’s going out with a Fake Geek Guy?</description>

It was all awkward sputtering and clumsy romance, which I found to be pretty endearing.

  <description>Peru Cabral, the youngest of five brothers, has just come out to his family. Lawson Todd has returned to his small hometown in disgrace after losing his corporate advertising job. When Peru and Lawson spot each other at the family Laundromat where Lawson works, the attraction between them is undeniable. But the fears, insecurities, and false fronts both men are hiding behind might doom the relationship before it begins—unless the brothers Cabral step in.</description>

  <description>Dangerous women aren’t always the ones who carry guns and take down the bad guys. Sometimes, the most dangerous women are the ones we don’t even notice -- the sultry siren crooning in a smoky bar, the innocent young girl twirling in her summer dress, the soft-shoed nurse who helps the comatose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this collection, award-winning author Shanna Germain gathers seven of her darkest, lushest fantasy and horror stories about strong, smart women who know that danger is a matter of scale -- and of which side you happen to be standing on.</description>

  <description>The name’s Lio, and I’m a cupid working for the Gay Division of the Inter-Dimensional Association of Cupids. An Aztec god, whose modern name, Ethan, doesn't make him any less scary, just busted me shooting a closeted human with a gay lust arrow. I might find him sexy with all those tattoos and piercings, if I didn’t have a rule against getting it on with other supernaturals—especially ones working for the Straight Division. Now, to save my butt I'll have to strike a bargain with this tough god. But what I didn't see coming was my little wager not only risks my career, but places my broken heart completely in Ethan's hands.</description>

      <![CDATA[A nice story (sweet and hot) and a cute concept, but was I the only one who felt like something was missing? It seemed like it was the first part of a much longer story. A lot went unanswered at the end and I needed to know more. What was the deal with Ethan and Lio? Why did they have this intens...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“My plan: Get into the city. Get Nadia. Find a way out. Simple.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week ago, seventeen-year-old Lela Santos’s best friend, Nadia, killed herself. Today, thanks to a farewell ritual gone awry, Lela is standing in paradise, looking upon a vast gated city in the distance—hell. No one willingly walks through the Suicide Gates, into a place smothered in darkness and infested with depraved creatures. But Lela isn’t just anyone—she’s determined to save her best friend’s soul, even if it means sacrificing her eternal afterlife. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lela struggles to find Nadia, she’s captured by the Guards, enormous, not-quite-human creatures that patrol the dark city’s endless streets. Their all-too-human leader, Malachi, is unlike them in every way except one: his deadly efficiency. When he meets Lela, Malachi forms his own plan: get her out of the city, even if it means she must leave Nadia behind. Malachi knows something Lela doesn’t—the dark city isn’t the worst place Lela could end up, and he will stop at nothing to keep her from that fate.</description>

      <![CDATA[**Audible edition** <br /><br />I'm going to go against the grain here and give this book 3 stars. In this case, 3 stars means that I loved some parts, didn't like other parts, but I liked the book overall. It wasn't that the book was bland or middling, but that I had some issues with it. <br /><br />I'll start off with...]]>

  <description>Love comes in many shades, from the sparkling pink of a shared glass of champagne or the faded blue of an old paper heart to the shocking orange of a sports car, and everything in between. Whether they’re revisiting a missed opportunity, mustering the courage to take a chance, or simply playing Cupid from the sidelines, the men in this Valentine’s Day anthology celebrate romance in all its myriad hues. Sometimes soft and subdued, sometimes bright and outrageous, the color of love is different for everyone. Childhood sweethearts, unrequited crushes, friends trying to resist their feelings, strangers who see something in each other at first glance, and even beings from the realm of myth and legend explore every stripe on the rainbow in search of their perfect complement. From sweet to red hot, these stories span the spectrum and revel in the humor, happiness, and hope of the most romantic day of the year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stories included:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Colors of Romance by Ashavan Doyon&lt;br&gt;Love and an (Orange) Lamborghini by MA Ford&lt;br&gt;In Trouble with Angels by Felicitas Ivey&lt;br&gt;Under the Table and Into His Heart by Raine O'Tierney&lt;br&gt;Blue Valentine Blues by Ken Bachtold&lt;br&gt;The Accidental Cupid by Xavier Mayne&lt;br&gt;Aunt Adeline's Bequest by Amy Rae Durreson&lt;br&gt;Pretty Sally Couldn't Marry Albert by Jefferson Parrish&lt;br&gt;Orange You Glad I Said Kiss by David Connor&lt;br&gt;Come Clean by Dawn Kimberly Johnson&lt;br&gt;Campfire Confessions by Bru Baker&lt;br&gt;Valentine Shower by John C.

  <description>Two seasoned operatives finally meet their match: each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cillian works for the mysterious Special Branch 20: an organization that runs black ops commissioned by the British government. His specialty is deep undercover assignments with virtually no support. He’s been alone for so long that he no longer knows anything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mal’s also used to being alone. Wanted in several states and even more countries, he’s not allowed in the vicinity of any of his former Navy SEAL teammates. And his current assignment is to track Cillian in order to discover the spook’s endgame. Except he’s no longer sure which one of them is getting played.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cillian isn’t about to let the mission that’s consumed him for the past several years crumble because an outsider is poking around where he doesn’t belong. But Mal forces his way through Cillian’s defenses—and into his heart—exposing a devastating betrayal that could destroy them both.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When your deepest, darkest fantasy shows up, get on board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Keller knows he’ll never find the excitement he craves in Middleton, Iowa—not while he’s busting his ass in nursing school and paying rent by slaving away in a pharmacy stockroom. Then Sam meets Mitch Tedsoe, an independent, long-haul trucker who makes a delivery to a shop across the alley. Innocent flirting quickly leads to a fling, and when Mitch offers to take him on a road trip west, Sam jumps at the chance for adventure. Mitch is sexy, funny and friendly, but once they embark on their journey, something changes. One minute he’s the star of Sam’s every x-rated fantasy, the next he’s almost too much a perfect gentleman. And when they hit the Las Vegas city limit, Sam has a name to pin on Mitch’s malady: Randy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For better or for worse, Sam grapples with the meaning of friendship, letting go, growing up—even the meaning of love—because no matter how far he travels, eventually all roads lead home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This story contains trucker fantasies, threesomes and kinky consensual sex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book has been previously published and has been revised from its original release.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In a world with little hope and no rules, the only thing they have to lose is themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rhys Cooper is a dead man. Cut off from the world since childhood, he’s finally exposed to the lethal virus that wiped out most of the human race. Now his only hope for survival is infection by another strain that might confer immunity. But it’s sexually transmitted, and the degradation he feels at submitting to the entire squad of soldiers that rescued him eclipses any potential for pleasure—except with Darius, the squadron’s respected, capable leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sergeant Darius Murrell has seen too much death and too little humanity. He’s spent a decade putting plague victims out of their misery and escorting survivors to a safe haven he can never enjoy. He’d rather help Rhys live than put him down, so when Rhys can’t reconcile himself to doing what’s necessary to survive, Darius is forced to save Rhys in spite of himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with each passing day, it looks less and less likely that Rhys can be saved. Which means that soon Darius might have to put a bullet in the head of the one person in years who reminds him of what it means to be human.</description>

With all of that, I was expecting to have some issue...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A returning hero, a prisoner of his past&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Renad Amdarien’s daring escape from the brutal confines of a sorcerer’s dungeon has made him a legend throughout the land. Now trusted without question, Renad suffers the truth alone: his former master’s sorcery rules him still. Broken both in body and mind, he finds brief solace only in the Gardens, lush sanctuaries of sex and secrets staffed by willing, skilled companions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nemaran, a most unusual Garden servant, recognizes Renad’s pain and offers easy comfort. What begins as erotic exploration soon grows into more, with Nemaran’s gentle attentions inspiring Renad to cross the physical and emotional boundaries society had long ago set in place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When forces beyond his control compel Renad to commit the ultimate betrayal, the new lovers must band together outside of the Gardens’ walls...for only Nemaran can help Renad become his own man once more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20,000 words</description>

  <description>Dawson Barnes recognizes his world is very small and very charmed. Running his community college theater like a petty god, he and his best friend, Benji know they'll succeed as stage techs after graduation. His father adores him, Benji would die for him, and Dawson never doubted the safety net of his family, even when life hit him below the belt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nothing prepared him for falling on Jared Emory's head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aloof dance superstar Jared is a sweet, vulnerable man and Dawson's life suits him like a fitted ballet slipper. They forge a long-distance romance from their love of the theater and the magic of Denny's. At first it's perfect: Dawson gets periodic visits and nookie from a gorgeous man who “gets” him—and Jared gets respite from the ultra-competitive world of dancing that almost consumed him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is until Jared shows up sick and desperate and Dawson finally sees the distance between them concealed painful things Jared kept inside. If he doesn’t grow up—and fast—his "superstar" might not survive his own weaknesses. That would be a shame, because the real, fragile Jared that Dawson sees behind the curtain is the person he can see spending his life with.</description>

  <description>When paleontologist Nick Eisenberg learns that someone thinks they have found velociraptor bones in Alberta, his curiosity overrides his desire to stay in London. After all, he’s one of the world’s leading experts on prehistoric predators and has always wanted to look for the velociraptor’s North American cousins. There’s only one problem: eco-conservationist Hunter Joseph. While Nick supervises the dig, Hunter rallies support from the locals to oppose the way the team is destroying the landscape in their search for dinosaur bones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick and Hunter just cannot get along. Hunter is self-righteous and pouty. Nick is narrow-minded and geeky. But they have to figure out how to work on the same site without killing each other, especially since someone else out there seems determined to cause Nick more problems than he could have ever imagined.</description>

  <description>Thanson Nez thought his career as a Discretionary would take him to the stars, not strand him on a space station at the ass-end of the Empire. Thanks to his last client, he’s carrying a secret he can’t get rid of fast enough, but his oath to the guild means a swift, painful death if he shares it. Already desperate for help, he runs into yet more trouble: his ex, and an explosion that paralyzes the station moments after their uncomfortable reunion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kazra Ferdow, Station 43’s communications officer, is almost as blindsided by the return of his first love as he is by the sudden loss of power and life support. The station is a floating graveyard in the making, and something is turning its inhabitants into savage killers. Fighting human monsters and damaged tech, Kazra and Thanson must put aside their past long enough to  try to save everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more light they shine into dark corners, the more Thanson realizes how many people might die for the secrets locked in his head—and what he’s willing to sacrifice to make sure Kazra isn’t one of them.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sometimes taking control is what you need to do and sometimes the best thing you can do is give that control up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer between Logan's junior and senior years of college, these two will find out more about each other and themselves than they imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While unhappy to be missing four weeks of Christian's company, Logan is thrilled to spend a month with his father's relatives in New York.  A naturally gregarious individual, he is used to winning people over and getting things right. Unfortunately, the Mannettes are not what he expects and for the first time in his life, he finds himself seriously doubting who he is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian has regained some of his old self-esteem and is taking on new challenges. Besides growing in the relationship he has with Logan, he takes the time his boyfriend is away to learn more about domestic discipline. He learns a little online but it is actually Gregory, Logan's father, where he gains most of his information. Including the fact that his natural strength puts him in a leadership position he isn't expecting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Logan returns to a strong, self-assured Christian, it is with complete relief. As discussions turn to domestic discipline and they realize their true roles within their current and future relationship, both of them are able to let their inhibitions go and together their connection grows surprising Logan to an epiphany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Warning: Contains BDSM elements with M/M spanking scenes.*&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I don't know why I like these books, but I do. They are almost comically edited, it is so bad. I caught the brother's name spelled two different ways throughout the story (Bryan or Brian????? Get it straight!) and numerous other errors. It needs a serious editor. Like yesterday.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Deadly poison…or exquisite cure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah fell from an eighth story balcony as a toddler, cracking open his skull and shattering his body. The accident would’ve killed a human, but even shifter blood can’t heal some damage. After the pack recommended a mercy killing, Noah’s family ran. But there’s no outrunning the mating pact formed before Noah’s birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wade, the new alpha, chooses an adult Noah to fulfill the pact. Wade believes the previous alpha was a fool to reject Noah as a weak and inferior wolf, but Noah’s family was wrong to hide him and starve his wolf, too. Human doctors with human medicines are poison to shifter physiology. Now that Noah is fully grown, halting his shift to retain the pins, plates, and bars holding him together hurts rather than helps him, and for Wade, more than Noah’s recovery is at stake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah’s family sacrificed everything to keep him alive. Noah will do whatever it takes to save them—including mate with the alpha who is determined to correct past mistakes and defeat old prejudices contaminating the shifter community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad some still believe Noah is the true poison…and should be culled from the pack for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Warnings: Dubious consent, shifter knotting/tying, and Nerf gun assassination attempts. Ereaders (and you) may spontaneously combust–-Don’t say I didn’t warn you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;54,540 Words</description>

  <description>(Fantasy / Fantasy Romance) What would you do to win your freedom? This is the question that sets bondwoman, Martise of Asher, on a dangerous path. In exchange for her freedom, she bargains with her masters, the mage-priests of Conclave, to spy on the renegade sorcerer, Silhara of Neith. The priests want Martise to expose the sorcerer's treachery and turn him over to Conclave justice. A risky endeavor, but one she accepts without hesitation--until she falls in love with her intended target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silhara of Neith, Master of Crows, is a desperate man. The god called Corruption invades his mind, seducing him with promises of limitless power if he will help it gain dominion over the world. Silhara struggles against Corruption's influence and searches for ways to destroy the god. When Conclave sends Martise as an apprentice to help him, he knows she's a spy. Now he fights a war on two fronts--against the god who would possess him and the apprentice who would betray him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mage and spy search together for a ritual that will annihilate Corruption, but in doing so, they discover secrets about each other that may damn them both. Silhara must decide if his fate, and the fate of nations, is worth the soul of the woman he has come to love, and Martise must choose continued enslavement or freedom at the cost of a man's life. And love.</description>

  <description>For Christian Darringer, life isn’t worth living. Just back from the Middle East; scarred and with permanent damage to one leg, he does not think anyone will want him for anything. Meeting a gorgeous man he finds himself thinking about constantly is not in his plans. Pulled toward the startling younger man with striking blue eyes, he begins to question a lot of things – especially his sexuality. Not one to hide from a challenge, he plunges ahead only to find himself more than just attracted to Logan who is full of life and joy, he finds himself head over heels in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan Mannette has almost everything he ever wanted: loving parents, happiness, friends and security. The only thing missing is finding the love of his life, a love that is just like his parents’. When he meets Christian at a party, everything changes. Instantly attracted, he does his best to help this sad man and quickly finds himself feeling more than he has ever felt before. Raised in a domestic discipline household, he holds that ideal as what he wants but his interest in spanking became a fetish and when Christian admits that he wants to be spanked, Logan believes he might have found the perfect man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as everything begins for them, Christian’s past intercedes and one of his brothers makes waves about him dating a man. If it weren’t for Logan’s support, he might fold; but with the love of one amazing man, Christian finds that living his life rather than just existing is as natural as breathing.</description>

  <description>Professionally, Dr. Alec Johnson has almost reached his goals. As this year’s recipient of a humanitarian award with his ex, Dr. Tyler Hall, Alec’s work with the homeless is about to be recognized. Unfortunately, his personal life sucks because now he has to attend several events alongside Tyler—with his ex’s new boyfriend in tow. In an attempt to lift his mood and break out of his rut, Alec purchases a motorcycle he has no idea how to start. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Booth doesn't have time for Dr. Clueless and his fickle 1964 Harley, but the cocky mechanic can’t say no to the request for help. Having spent his teen years on the streets, and losing his best friend to HIV, Dylan decides teaching the do-gooder how to ride is the least he can do. But watching Alec flounder in his ex's company throws Dylan into protector mode, and the confirmed hetero introduces himself as Alec's new boyfriend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ex suspects Dylan is lying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alec claims Dylan’s plan is insane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Dylan’s not sure he can fake being gay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he’s a master bullshitter, and the phony PDA soon turns ultra-hot. Alec can’t afford to get attached, and Dylan’s learned everyone eventually leaves. Unfortunately, playing the backup boyfriend is starting to feel way too real… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CONTENT WARNING: This book contains Man-on-Man action, adult situations, and language. &lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />It is universally known among my GR friends that I LOVE a good GFY/OFY/Gay-virgin story. I loooove it. I'm just pervy like that. However, this story isn't quite what I expected from that genre. <br /><br />When I think of "gay for you", I usually think of the emotional journey that the guy goes...]]>

  <description>After two long, kink-free years apart, James Sheridan has reunited with his Professor: the sexy, dominant Evander Carson. But this time, things will be different. James is older, more sure of himself, and confident that he can draw the line between Carson’s demands and his own principles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of those lines is gorgeous menswear salesman Satish Malhotra. After their steamy dressing room encounter, James feels an unexpected connection to Satish, and he wants to explore it further. But Carson’s involvement—in James’s life, and in James and Satish’s budding relationship—complicates things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carson’s penchant for using other men in their sex games has always troubled James, and he’s adamant that Satish not be just another notch in their whipping post. But when Satish learns what prompted James to pursue him in the first place, will James’s new ability to draw the line even matter?</description>

  <description>Will Sutherland hasn't been home to see his parents in four years—not since they reacted badly when he came out. This Christmas, he’s finally worked up the courage to go home, where he's surprised to find they've taken in a boarder. Ryan Bennett is just a couple years younger than Will, cute, sweet... and openly gay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Will deals with his jealousy of the man who's been receiving the love and acceptance he was denied, Ryan finds himself falling for Will's brooding good looks. But Ryan also suspects the Sutherlands may be using him as a pawn in their long-standing conflict with their son. Will this Christmas finally tear the family apart, or is there a chance they can put their hurt and anger behind them?</description>

  <description>Is it possible to be a good Jew &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a gay man? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not for Jonah Stern. He can't reconcile his faith with his attraction to boys, so he turns his back on Judaism. A college scholarship is Jonah's ticket to freedom from his disapproving parents. Next step: losing his virginity to Christian, the blue-eyed blond man of his dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, Jonah has a fateful meeting with Aaron Blumberg and ends up celebrating Hanukkah. Aaron tells him they're bashert—meant to be. But Jonah has doubts. He believes his lack of faith will create a wedge between them. It's up to Aaron to bridge the gap and convince Jonah to take a leap of faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story from the Dreamspinner Press 2013 Advent Calendar package "Heartwarming".</description>

  <description>Eric is a popular beauty blogger, and hopes to use the momentum of that to start his own business selling makeup for men—but his first attempt to launch makes it painfully clear he has a lot to learn and a long way to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unexpected help comes in the form of Devon:  Gorgeous, successful, and far too smooth. He is everything Eric would like to be, all the things Eric is starting to fear he'll never achieve, and the success that Eric is striving for in both his professional and personal life is jeopardized by Devon's inability to understand that business and pleasure shouldn't mix, because they can have disastrous results for both</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sometimes it takes losing everything to find what you really need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Judah went to prison for insider trading, he lost everything he thought was important: his business, his money, his power. But when he gets out, homelessness strips him of the one thing he has left: his self-respect. When another homeless man saves him from a beating, he begins to learn to rely on the goodness of those around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Toby, life on the streets has become familiar. Comfortable. So comfortable he wonders if he’s given up on changing his life for the better. Then comes Judah. Formerly rich, newly homeless, all his pride and attitude gone along with his material possessions. Helping Judah feels good. Their unexpected connection—physical and beyond—feels even better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their shared situation nurtures a growing closeness that blossoms into something deeper. But when change comes knocking, it will take all their strength to keep fear and insecurity from tearing them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20% of all proceeds from this title are donated to the Ali Forney Center in New York, whose mission “is to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ) youth from the harm of homelessness, and to support them in becoming safe and independent as they move from adolescence to adulthood.” To learn more about this charity or to donate directly, please visit &lt;a href="http://www.aliforneycenter.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.aliforneycenter.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>When did save a life become change a life? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad in Baltimore, Book 3&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the openly gay middle son of the most powerful family between Manhattan and Miami, Gavin Montgomery knows his role—look good in a tuxedo and don’t make waves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waves are the least of his worries when he tries and fails to keep a friend from jumping off a high bridge. His last thought as he falls in too is that someone else will have to take over as family disappointment…until he’s pulled from the water by a man with an iron grip, a sexy mouth and a chip on his shoulder the size of the national deficit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police rescue diver Jamie Donnigan finally has life the way he wants it. Okay, he could have done without losing his father, quitting smoking and watching his friends drift into couplehood. At least he’s managed to escape that particular trap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gavin’s father turns Jamie’s routine rescue into a media circus, he figures if he’s going to suffer for his good deed, he might as well enjoy a roll in the sack. But Jamie’s not immune to Gavin’s cultivated charm…and all the risks that come along with giving in to it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Includes above the recommended daily allowance for snark, attitude, stubbornness and a variety of scorching hot sex (even for this author).</description>

  <description>Jamie Nolan is a young cop on his first undercover assignment, sent to investigate Dmitri Teplov, a suspected major player in the Russian mafia. Jamie knows better than to get involved with the gorgeous nightclub owner. But right from the start, the spark of attraction between the two of them is undeniable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything about Dmitri is just so unexpected. He’s sweet and shy, and has a nerdy side that Jamie finds irresistible. Can this man really be a criminal? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter if Dmitri is guilty or innocent, Jamie’s big Irish Catholic family of cops and his police captain are never going to accept this relationship. Dmitri’s dangerous and manipulative gangster uncle is also none too thrilled that these two are together, and wants Jamie out of the picture. On top of that, Jamie’s still reeling from a recent breakup, and Dmitri is unavailable anyway. Isn’t he? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No way should this thing between them be happening. Getting involved with Dmitri Teplov was never part of the plan. But sometimes, the best plan is the one you make up as you go along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is an erotic gay romance. It contains explicit language, a touch of kink, and lots of steamy sex between two hot guys. FOR ADULT READERS ONLY.  Available in paperback and for Kindle at Amazon.com and for other devices at Smashwords.com Word count: 79,310 (less)</description>

  <description>Book three of Agamemnon Frost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edgar Mason is losing Agamemnon Frost despite everything they've been through—the passion, the torture, the heat. Frost's fiancée, Theodora, is back, and Mason can feel his lover gravitating toward her. Every day he sees them together, it tears at his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frost feels raw himself. His brother and sister-in-law are missing, and his guilt about failing to save Theodora from Pandarus eats at him. His feelings for Mason, whom he has put through hell twice already, just twist the screws tighter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of that, Pandarus and the Martians are back to make their final push to Earth, and Frost and Mason are duty bound to fight them. People are vanishing. Bodies are turning up burned beyond recognition in the slums. The bleak, human-less future Frost and Mason saw in the hollow ships has nearly come to pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in order to prevent it, each man will have to make a final choice: lose his lover or doom the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out how it began in Agamemnon Frost and the House of Death.</description>

  <description>Robby Dalton is the perfect all-American boy. He played the sports his father chose for him in high school, attended the college his father selected, and has worked hard to conform to his father's macho views. But emotionally he doesn’t fit anywhere, and he can’t connect with a woman beyond a few uninspired dates. Robby’s not in the closet, because he’s never guessed he’s gay. Now he owns a small commercial construction company, and one night after work he runs into Savannah Meyers. He finds her fascinating and agrees to a date, thinking maybe this woman would be different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Savannah has her own agenda. She is looking for a love match for her roommate, Tristan Chartrand, whom she rescued from the streets years ago. He’s like a brother, and her only family, so she wants him safe and happy. Her plan seems to begin well, because when Robby meets Tristan, he’s surprised to find it’s Tristan he wants, not Savannah. But some people in Robby’s life don’t approve of Tristan’s lowly station in life, and some don’t approve of Robby being gay. Some people are full of hate and violence, and Robby and Tristan will need courage and strength if a loving future is to be part of the deal.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The devil covets more than his soul ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years ago, Logan Hart sold his soul to the devil to become the greatest bluesman of all time—and now the devil has come to collect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The irony is that Logan squandered his gift. High on fame, money, and drugs, he ignored his muse and neglected his music. And despite managing to escape showbiz in a moment of clarity, it’s too late to redeem himself. All that’s left is to try to go out with some dignity. Alas, the prospect of an eternity in Hell isn’t helping much with that goal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Farfarello, the devil who bought Logan’s soul, isn’t ready to drag him down to Hell quite yet. He’s just spent six years working his ass off to whip a bluesman into shape, and he refuses to let that—or the opportunity for more sinful pleasures with Logan—go to waste.</description>

  <description>Malibu, California-home to rock-and-roll gods and movie stars, the beautiful, the rich . . . and vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powerful and charismatic, Raphael is a Vampire Lord, one of the few who hold the power of life and death over every vampire in existence. Thousands call him Master and have pledged absolute loyalty on their very lives. But when, in a brazen and deadly daylight attack, a gang of human killers kidnaps the one female vampire he'd give his life for, Raphael turns to a human investigator to find his enemies before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cynthia Leighton is smart, tough and sexy, a private investigator and former cop who's tired of spying on cheating spouses and digging out old bank accounts. When Raphael asks for her help in tracking down the kidnappers, Cyn's happy to accept. But she soon realizes her greatest danger comes not from the humans, but from Raphael himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Battling Russian mobsters and treacherous vampires, and betrayed by those they trusted, Cyn and Raphael find themselves fighting for their lives while caught up in a passion of blood and violence that is destined to destroy them both.</description>

  <description>Nothing gives art fraud investigator Luke Morganstern a bigger rush than busting forgers, the low-life criminals who dare victimize true artists. But when his latest job sends him to a remote cabin in the Oregon Coast Range, he’s stunned to discover the alleged forger is his former lover, Stefan Cobbe, the most gifted painter Luke has ever known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stefan, left homeless and destitute after the death of his wealthy partner, doesn’t exactly deny the forgery -- he claims he doesn’t remember, an excuse Luke can’t accept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Luke’s elderly client suggests Stefan may be telling the truth and presents another possibility – a dark presence in the woods, a supernatural fury simmering for decades. Luke must face down his fear of the uncanny – and admit his feelings for Stefan – if either of them is to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Book two of Agamemnon Frost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edgar Mason is ready to embark upon his new life at Agamemnon Frost's side. But all is not perfect. His Martian overlord, Pandarus, has implanted a dark voice in his mind, a voice that urges betrayal. And though Mason can keep close to Frost, there's little room for romance under the watchful gaze of the engineers from Station X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That changes when Mason and Frost reopen their investigation into their old enemy's whereabouts. Posing as double agents and investigating cryptic rumors of "hollow ships," they find him impersonating a London banker and worm their way into his confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their success brings them trouble in spades. Pandarus takes them into the belly of his ships, where he plans to transfigure them into mindless automata. And with Earth on the brink of invasion, Frost's old flame Theodora reappearing and Pandarus's brainwashing growing more effective, Mason and Frost will find their bond tested as never before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See how it all began in Agamemnon Frost and the House of Death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And how the trilogy ends with Agamemnon Frost and the Crown of Towers.</description>

  <description>Just-graduated David has been brightening up his gray Surrey, England days with the porn collection hidden in his parents' shed, but when he finds that their American foreign exchange student, Dawn, has discovered his magazines, things really begin to heat up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David’s parents insist that he look for a job, but Dawn has the week off and is determined to work on her tan. Distracted David finds himself increasingly tempted by their seductive, older foreign exchange student, who makes it very clear what she wants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of the Study Abroad program’s policy that no “relations” are allowed between a student and anyone in their host family—not to mention David’s mother’s insistence that they treat each other as “brother and sister,”—Dawn’s teasing ways slowly break down the barrier between them until they both give in to their lust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what are they going to do about the feelings that have developed between them in the meantime?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warnings: This title contains erotic situations, graphic language, anal sex, and makes mention of pornography, hammers, interesting uses for rubber bands, dungarees, bikinis, and lots of Britishisms you may or may not have to look up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note to readers: This story appeared in another, now rather infamous book of mine titled&lt;/em&gt; Naughty Bits. Yank, &lt;em&gt;previously titled&lt;/em&gt; Foreign Exchange, &lt;em&gt;is a slightly less naughty, but no less sexy re-telling of those events--updated and redressed for your reading pleasure.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Not Sure Boys features three gay young adult stories about growing up on Massachusetts' North Shore. The stories stand alone yet overlap to culminate in one steamy ending. There’s plenty to laugh about with these characters, but their stories also prove genuine and touching as the characters try to make their way in this confusing world. Whether you're gay or straight, you'll find something to relate to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three Gay Coming of Age Shorts That Read as Individual Stories Yet Overlap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stories include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wacky Packages, a gay young adult story (1970s style)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's he supposed to do when his mom tells him it's wrong to think his best friend is handsome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the 1970s when summers should just be about trading Wacky Pack cards, playing baseball, and wondering what you're going to be when you grow up, and not about lusting after your best friend's older brother. Singing a bastardized version of ABBA’s latest hit into a hairbrush while standing in front of the mirror may get Robby just what he’s been asking, "Can I see your bum Fernando?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where Derek Van Lies, gay boys or not so gay boys?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At nineteen she is the biggest fan of the rising country singer in her sleepy affluent town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Susan, a developmentally-challenged teen living with her parents and bagging groceries at Market Basket. Her life revolves around everything associated with her idol, Derek Van, but when he takes her to the Topsfield Fair and she tries to seduce him, Susan suspects something is wrong. Could he be a "homosapien"?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Livin’ on the Not Sure, a gay young adult story that grows into a hot gay romance m/m tale&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the gay guy really get the hot, straight jock into bed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robby’s done just that, but Jamie is hopelessly straight. Still, during the sultry summer of 1984 they’re hooking up, and not just once in a while but until Robby goes away to college in September. Decades pass before they meet up again. Despite Jamie’s having lived the straight-life, is there still a spark? Is it too late for him to change?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gay Romance M/M Has Never Seen Such Quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not Sure Boys is a funny yet tender collection of interrelated shorts about coming to terms with love under some not-so-accepting circumstances. The conflicts and dilemmas that arise in these stories are something every reader will find familiar and relatable.</description>

  <description>Book one of Agamemnon Frost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liverpool, 1891&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decorated artilleryman Edgar Mason was forced to find new work when the British Empire replaced its foot soldiers with monstrous machines. Now he waits on the Liverpool elite as a personal servant. He has just one rule: he won’t work for fashion-addled dandies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agamemnon Frost, however, is far from the foppish man-about-town he appears to be. He’s working to protect the Earth from an alien invasion being planned by a face-changing creature known as Pandarus. And on the night he plans to confront the aliens, he enlists Mason to assist him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a man to love a man is a serious crime in Victorian England. But when Mason meets Frost, his heart thunders and his blood catches fire. And when Pandarus drags the two men into the torture cellars beneath his house of death to brainwash them, Mason’s new passion may be all that stands between him and insanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trilogy continues with Agamemnon Frost and the Hollow Ships.</description>

  <description>Try – verb: to make an attempt or effort to do something or in this case…someone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sex. Logan Mitchell loves it, and ever since he realized his raw sexual appeal at a young age, he has had no problem using it to his advantage. Men and women alike fall into his bed—after all, Logan is not one to discriminate. He lives by one motto—if something interests you, why not just take a chance and try?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he wants to try Tate Morrison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just coming out of a four-year marriage with an ex-wife from hell, a relationship is the last thing on Tate’s mind. He’s starting fresh and trying to get back on his feet with a new job at an upscale bar in downtown Chicago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem is, Tate has caught the unwavering and unwelcome attention of  Mr. Logan Mitchell – a regular at the bar and a man who always gets what he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Night after night Tate fends off the persistent advances of the undeniably charismatic man, but after an explosive moment in the bar, all bets are off as he finds his body stirring with a different desire than his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As arrogance, stubbornness and sexual tension sizzles between the two, it threatens to change the very course of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan doesn’t do relationships. Tate doesn’t do men. But what would happen if they both just gave in and…tried?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GENRE: M/M</description>

  <description>The summer you turn sixteen is supposed to be unforgettable. It's the stuff of John Hughes movies and classic songs, of heart-stopping kisses and sudden revelations. But life isn't always like the movies. . .&lt;br&gt;For Sean Jackson, sixteen is off to an inauspicious start. His options: take a landscaping job in Georgia with his father, or stay in his small New Hampshire hometown, where the only place hiring is the local ice cream shop. Donning a pink t-shirt to scoop sundaes for tourists and seniors promises to be a colder, stickier version of hell. Still, he opts to stay home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On his first day at work, Sean meets Becky, a wickedly funny New York transplant. The store manager, Jay, is eighteen, effortlessly cool, and according to Becky, "likes" Sean the way Sean's starting to like him. But before he can clear a path to the world that's waiting, Sean will have to deal with his overprotective mother, his sweet, popular girlfriend, Lisa, his absentee father, and all his own uncertainties and budding confusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tender and achingly funny, this coming-of-age story will resonate with anyone who is--or has ever been--a teenager, when the only thing you can count on is how little you really know, and the next glance, or touch, or breathless night can be the one that changes everything. . .</description>

  <description>Michael feels trapped. In his conservative, poor hometown where he has to keep his sexuality hidden. In his dead-end job. In caring for his alcoholic grandfather. Everything changes when he meets Eric, the new curator for the railroad museum. His curiosity about the passionate man quickly gives way to an intense attraction—one that Eric happily returns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carefree and refreshingly confident, Eric guides Michael to places he's forgotten, reminding him that it may not be too late to follow his dreams for something more in life. But the truth is, Eric knows exactly how it feels to be stuck in a bad situation. A failed relationship has left him with personal demons that may hurt his connection with Michael.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To give their future a chance, they both must fight being trapped in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;40,000 words</description>

  <description>Tyler Coil doesn't do men. But it’s harder to remember that each time he visits his best friend, gorgeous Landon Burke. As a political reporter, Ty is good at reading people, and he can tell the lust is mutual. But giving in to it could mean alienating his ultra-conservative family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Landon never desired a man badly enough to explore that side of his sexuality—until he met Ty. He’s waited four long years for a sign that Ty wants him too, and he can’t deny his needs much longer. So when a career opportunity arises out-of-state, Landon wonders if maybe it’s time to move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then Ty crashes at Landon’s while working on a story—and a searing kiss ignites a night of mind-blowing sex that’s better than their most erotic fantasies. Forced to face his feelings, Ty must decide if love is worth the risk after all—before he loses Landon forever.</description>

  <description>Consoling a sobbing dragon and serving pig buffets are just part of the job for Myrna Banks. Working for a mediation firm, it’s her job to get humans compensated for damages caused by the dragons who now rule. But her “typical” day is interrupted by Trian Chobardan, an old flame who sneaked out of her bed two years ago, taking her heart and a handful of classified documents with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Myrna would love to show Trian the door, but he’s been sent by North America’s reigning dragon lord for help negotiating a truce with a powerful rival to avert war. Myrna agrees to help, even though she’ll be stuck with Trian as a partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two work together, Myrna finds Trian to be surprisingly supportive—and still irresistibly attractive. Though her brain tells her not to forget his betrayal, her body feels differently. When they learn the enemy dragon lord is planning something no one could have imagined, Myrna has to learn who she can trust before she loses not only her heart, but her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;84,000 words</description>

  <description>Dustin Davis spent years wishing for a prince but kissing frog after slimy frog. When he sees Archer Kyriakides for the first time, Dusty thinks his luck has finally changed. Archer could be &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. The One. But their hot and cold romance leaves Dusty confused: why does it feel right one moment and wrong the next? It doesn’t make sense—until the day Dusty meets Archer’s identical twin, Asher, and realizes he’s been seeing them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asher Kyriakides dreams of being a fashion photographer, but he’s stuck with a job he hates and an irresponsible playboy brother whose habits drive him absolutely insane, especially when he finds out Archer is dating the cute little blond Asher can’t seem to forget. Torn between loyalty and desire, Asher does nothing but try to warn Dusty away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Archer finally goes too far, Dusty turns to Asher for comfort, and Asher knows he can’t refuse. It isn’t long before they realize they’re falling fast, but more than one thing stands in their way, not the least of which is Archer, who isn’t quite ready to stop being a thorn in his brother’s side.</description>

  <description>Werewolf Natalya Stravinsky's outspoken sidekick, Aggie McClure, is featured in this prequel novella. Before Agatha set foot in South Toms River, New Jersey, she had the fight of her life to face. Destined to be the alpha female over her Manhattan pack, Aggie was fully prepared to take on her role until her father arranges a marriage without her consent. She wants out–but the only way is with money–something her new controlling husband won’t give her to escape. But such odds never kept a wolf like Aggie down. To sever the twisted tie, she finds herself pitted against raging wood nymphs and backstabbing brownies in an underground supernatural fighting ring. With every victory, the sweet taste of freedom is closer, but her husband isn't willing to let her go that easily. Until the very end, Aggie must fight for the one thing she's never had: a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONUS SHORT STORY: NEVER BET ON A SUCCUBUS&lt;br&gt;Follow Heidi the mermaid and Abby the Muse as they try to help Lilith, a soul-sucking succubus and fellow supernatural therapy group member, find a date.</description>

  <description>Book two of Skybound&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crux Ansata second-in-command Killian O'Neal has a plan. The governor's son, Neith, has been enslaved in a high-end brothel. Killian's going to break him out, take him home and collect a reward. It's a daring mercenary rescue. What could go wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot, as it turns out. The governor doesn't want his son back, the ship and crew are on the run from the slavers, and Neith is in withdrawal from a drug that instills in him a desperate lust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A passionate heat flares between Killian and Neith—but is it just the effects of the drugs still in Neith's system, or could it be something more permanent? They both need time to figure out if what they have is real—but Neith has taken a valuable item from his old masters and they're not going to let him go easily. When the slavers catch up with the Ansata, Killian will have to choose between the safety of his ship and its crew, or life with the man he's falling in love with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;51,000 words</description>

  <description>Jeret hasn’t looked back since running away from life as a crown prince and joining the Crux Ansata’s crew, but when the Ansata returns to his home system, he finds his father ill and a traitor maneuvering for control. Now that he’s a full-grown man, he can’t just walk away again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Letting Jeret escape was the biggest black mark on bounty hunter Dagan Nu’aim’s otherwise distinguished years as a royal guard. When he catches Jeret back in-system, Dagan seizes the chance to regain his lost honor and bring the wayward prince home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeret’s not so sure he wants to go, but the reignition of his old crush on Dagan complicates the issue. As the two unravel a tangled plot against the crown, their old friendship lights up with a fiery new desire. And when the traitor strikes and the two men must choose between duty and freedom, neither is certain which to pick.</description>

Thrown together by chance, the two men form a wary partnership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torin has every intention of dumping Rain at the next moon, despite his intense attraction to the hotshot. In his line of work he can’t afford to trust anyone, especially someone as infuriatingly charming and naïve as Rain. But first, he’s got a mission to complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Rain wants, Rain gets. And what he wants is Torin, any way he can get him. The gorgeous captain isn’t making it easy, and the two are quickly embroiled in an erotic battle for supremacy. But when Rain discovers that he’s not the only one in pursuit of Torin, he demands to know exactly what sort of “job” he’s signed on for…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book One in the Skybound series</description>

  <description>Tucker Gray is a Baltimore, MD waiter, hailing from the deep south, whose mental health issues and past relationships have made it hard to trust more than the cut. After he hits what he thought was rock bottom Tucker decides to keep close to the ones who stood by him and keep his head down, until he finds something to prove it can get better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse Bauer is unsure what his future holds after an injury forces him to retire from the marines. With all of the decisions he has to make in his civilian life with all of its freedoms and possibilities, he feels staying closeted and keeping the people in his life happy will keep down the chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the night he met Tucker Gray at a party he thought that’d be possible, but both of them are instantly and strongly in lust. As their relationship grows Jesse has to prove himself and Tucker has to learn to trust more than the cut.</description>

  <description>Book one of London Undead&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Few people walk the streets of London since the zombie outbreak, but that's not an issue for Seth. As a werewolf, he can handle himself and save humans reckless enough to take a nighttime stroll. While on patrol he comes across a group of people under attack. The one woman brave enough to take a stand against the zombies catches his eye—and not just because of her way with a gun. Learning the beautiful woman is homeless and fends for herself only intensifies his urge to protect and care for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maisie can't help but admit that she's attracted to her werewolf rescuer. She's drawn to Seth's strength and ferocity, and finds herself opening up to him in ways she never imagined, even though she's determined to not rely on Seth or anyone else. She doesn't want another person to get hurt—or die—for her sake. She has enough scars, physical and emotional, from the last time…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Seth realizes something is drawing the zombies to Maisie, there may be nothing he can do to save her…</description>

  <description>After two years together, Alex has been dreading the inevitable moment when Damon learns the truth: that Alex is a shifter, part of a small percentage of the population able to switch genders at will. Thanks to a forced implant, though, Alex is suddenly static—unable to shift—and male. Overnight, he’s out to a world that neither understands nor tolerates shifters . . . and to his heterosexual boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damon is stunned to discover his girlfriend is a shifter, and scared to death of the dangers the implant poses to Alex’s health. He refuses to abandon Alex, but what about their relationship? Damon is straight, and with the implant both costly and dangerous to remove, Alex is stuck as a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stripped of half his identity and facing serious physical and social ramifications, Alex needs Damon more than ever, but he doesn’t see how they can get through this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially if he’s static forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This gamer geek has a lacy little secret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art student and MMORPG addict Robert Ng has always been a loner, but he's recently made it his goal to make more (IRL) friends. Which is how he winds up working nights at Rear Entrance Video, shilling sketchy porn and blowup dolls as a favor to his roommate. The longer he works there, though, the more he realizes he’ll never be truly happy until he becomes the person he is online: his female persona, Bobby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby is cuter and funnier than Rob is, and a thousand times more popular with boys. Becoming Bobby IRL presents its own set of challenges, though . . . especially when you're sitting on the fence between two genders, only one of which has caught the attention of your seriously cute customer/classmate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Ford is a six-foot Inuit comic book artist who always says what’s on his mind, and screw anyone who doesn't like it. As rough as he appears, though, Dylan has a soft spot for Rob. But will out-and-proud Dylan still want Rob if he's not all man?</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />Wow! Heidi Belleau produced such a super hot, interesting, out-of-the box story! Very nicely done, Heidi. I really enjoyed this but I had some issues that prevented this from being a home run for me. <br /><br />Let's start with the positives about this story. I love that this book has both a mi...]]>

  <description>Matt is a junior at MIT. He’s geeky, he's witty, he's brilliant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he’s also very, very stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful, cool, insightful Julie moves in with Matt’s family, why (oh why!) does he pretend to be his absent brother Finn for her alleged benefit? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems harmless enough until her short-term stay becomes permanent. And until it snowballs into heart-squeezing insanity. And until he falls in love with Julie, and Julie falls in love with Finn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But … Matt is the right one for her. If only he can make Julie see it. Without telling her the truth, without shattering them all. Particularly his fragile sister Celeste, who may need Julie the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You saw Matt through Julie’s eyes in FLAT-OUT LOVE. Now go deeper into Matt’s world in this FLAT-OUT MATT novella. Live his side of the story, break when his heart breaks, and fall for the unlikely hero all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take an emotional skydive for two prequel chapters and seven Flat-Out Love chapters retold from his perspective, and then land with a brand-new steamy finale chapter from Julie.</description>

I always end up thinking the same thing- "I already read this when I read the ORIGINAL story!" This book is basically no different. The prequel stuff way okay (though too...]]>

  <description>One year ago on a mission gone wrong, Tanner James failed to save the life of Jesse, his Army Ranger teammate. Before dying in that South American jungle, Jesse extracted a promise that won’t let Tanner rest until it’s fulfilled—no matter what it costs him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damon Price loved Jesse, but problems in their relationship had come to a head right before Jesse left on his final mission. Now a reluctant Dom and a man still in mourning, he’s not happy when Tanner appears at his BDSM club. And even less happy with Jesse’s last request—that Tanner sub for him for one night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a rough start, Damon realizes that the tough soldier, despite his protests, aches for someone to take control. And Tanner senses a hesitance, an insecurity in Damon that makes him wonder if he’s simply a placeholder for Jesse, or if their tentative connection could grow into something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Jesse’s sake, they agree to try one weekend together. Then duty calls, and a series of attacks that have been happening near the club hits too close to home, making both men wonder if giving their hearts is a maneuver fraught with too much risk…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains rough language, rougher sex and warriors who fall hard for each other</description>

  <description>After his lover dies trying to lend him aid at Salamanca, hopelessness becomes Preston Meacham's only way of life. Despite his best efforts and with no pride left, he sells himself for a pittance at a molly house, the mindless sex giving him his only respite from the horrors he witnessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Napoleonic War left Benedict Wilmot haunted by the horrific acts he's forced to commit, as well as torture at the hands of a homophobic superior. As the battle rages around him, a weak and beaten Ben is ordered to kill a fellow redcoat, else face a ghastly death himself. Even in his dreams, he can't escape the memory of the man he killed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their paths cross, Ben feels an overwhelming need to protect Preston from his dangerous profession, because, as he explains, "The streets are dangerous for men like us."</description>

  <description>It takes a pissed-off Brahma bull named Shockwave to show rodeo pickup man Marty Fairgrave the cold hard truth about champion bull rider Tripp Colby: Tripp will never leave the safety of his closet or acknowledge Marty in public. Sometimes loving someone just isn’t enough, and after a year of hiding what they are, Marty finally sees the light—and it’s no longer shining on Tripp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tripp Colby would do anything for Marty. Well . . . almost. He’s never loved anyone before, and isn’t quite sure how to handle it now. But he knows Marty is his everything, and in order to win him back, Tripp will have to overcome his darkest fears and step into the light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But no matter Tripp’s intentions, the cost might be too high and the effort too late for these two cowboys to ride off into the sunset.</description>

  <description>Since childhood, Jake, Adam, Kyle, and Brendan have been teammates, best friends, brothers. Then one day, when they were twenty-five, Adam disappeared without a word, devastating his friends-none more so than Jake, who had secretly loved Adam since they were teenagers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, five years later, Adam is back, and he has his mind set on Jake. But those years of anger, hurt, and confusion are a lot to overcome, and Jake doesn't find it easy to forgive. He isn't sure they'll ever fit together the way they did. Jake, Kyle, and Brendan have moved on with their lives, but Adam's high-profile career keeps him in the closet-the same place he's been for years. Still, his apologies seem sincere, and the attraction is still there. Jake desperately wants to give him a chance. But first he has to find out why Adam left and if he's really back for good.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Sequel to &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6430659-tigers-and-devils"&gt;Tigers and Devils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an eventful and sometimes uncomfortably public courtship, Simon Murray and Declan Tyler settled into a comfortable life together. Now retired from the AFL, Declan works as a football commentator; Simon develops programs with queer content for a community television station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite their public professional lives, Simon and Declan manage to keep their private life out of the spotlight. Their major concerns revolve around supporting their friends through infertility and relationship problems—until Greg Heyward, Declan’s ex-partner, outs himself in a transparent bid for attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Simon and Declan are furious with Greg and his media antics, they can’t agree on what to do about it. Declan insists they should maintain a dignified silence, but both he and Simon keep getting drawn into Heyward’s games. Simon and Declan will once again have to ride out the media storm before they can return their attention to what really matters: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;I saw him at my local corner store when I stopped in for some soda after work. He was wearing that damn T-shirt and now I can't get it out of my head. I'm thirty-two years old and have never topped in my life. Guys seem to think I have a sign on my forehead that says “bottom only”. The one time I asked, it didn't go well. But now it seems I see this kid, he's twenty if he's a day, everywhere, and that T-shirt text is burned in my brain. I wonder...&lt;br&gt;Can be any genre you like, and as explicit as you like. I'm not too fussy, but a first time top should be fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;The slim, taut torso of a young man from neck to hips wearing a T-shirt that says “I Would Bottom You So Hard”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genre:contemporary&lt;br&gt;Tags:first time top, age gap, gaining self-worth, bottom you so hard, younger teacher/older student, beautiful boy&lt;br&gt;Word count:20,237&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Unburdened by the pain of loss and heartbreak, Mikhail is content with his life of solitude. But everything began to change the day he realised he has a psychic ability — the power to alter the emotions of those around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ushered into the Military Academy with others like him — other Daevas — Mikhail does his part to help tip the scales of war against the vampires that destroyed the world and plague what remains of humanity. But after going up against his first vampire, Mikhail starts to question everything he thought to be true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To discover the truth and expose the lies he once believed, Mikhail will set out on a journey of discovery, and learn some things about himself in the process.</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fairy Tate. Twinklefingers. Lucy Liu.&lt;/em&gt; Will the taunting ever end? Lucas Tate suffers ridicule because of his appearance and sensitive nature. When he’s not teased, he’s ignored, and he doesn’t know which is worse. He feels unloved by everyone, but the one comfort in life is his music. What he wants more than anything is to find a friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to his dismay, both his mom and a schoolmate are determined to find him a boyfriend, despite the fact Lucas hasn’t come out to them. His mom chooses a football player who redefines the term “heartthrob,” while Trish pushes him toward the only openly gay boy at Providence High. But Lucas is harboring a crush on another boy, one who writes such romantic poetry to his girlfriend that hearing it melts Lucas into a puddle of goo. All three prospects seem so far out of his league. Lucas is sure he doesn’t stand a chance with any of them—until sharing his gift for music brings him the courage to let people into his heart.</description>

  <description>Supernatural Branch of Law Enforcement empath Ella Walsh sucks memories from people’s heads. The job fills her mind with others’ nightmares and leaves her with little time for love, but if she doesn’t pair off with a mate of the government’s choosing soon, the psychic blowback will destroy her powers and her sanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time shapeshifting SBLE superstar Vadim Morosov worked with an empath, he got her killed and himself assigned to a desk. He worries about taking on another partner, but helping Ella track down an empath killer might be his only chance to save his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naturally, the government decides to throw them together…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They resist at first, but they can’t deny the simmering heat between them. As the killer’s strikes grow closer to home, their bond gets tighter. And when the murderer finally traps Ella, her developing link with Vadim might be the only thing that can save her.</description>

  <description>Squire William Raven has only one goal: to finally receive his spurs and become a knight. When his lord, Sir Robert de Cantilou, returns from a five-year crusade in the Holy Land, William wants nothing more than to impress him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Sir Robert's return, noble guests arrive from France, bringing intrigue to the castle. William is oblivious to the politics, as he's distracted by nightly visits from a faceless lover, a man who pleasures him in the dark and then leaves, a man he soon discovers is none other than his master, Sir Robert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But William can't ignore the scheming around him when he overhears a plot to murder Robert. He becomes intent on saving his lord and lover from those who would see him killed....&lt;br&gt;©2010 Aleksandr Voinov &amp;amp; Kate Cotoner (P)2010 Harlequin</description>

      <![CDATA[This was an enjoyable audiobook listen. I that thought the historical setting was a nice change of pace and the writing seemed polished, as Voinov always does. However, I didn't like the insta-love and I thought the characters fell a little flat. Still good, just didn't blow me away.   ]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A delightful eNovella from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Sabrina Jeffries about a young woman who learns that you can’t learn about love from a textbook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Ten Reasons to Stay," previously published in the anthology &lt;em&gt;The School for Heiresses&lt;/em&gt;, lessons go far beyond etiquette and needlepoint. Eliza Crenshawe’s lesson is to look before she leaps. But when she discovers that her new guardian plans to marry her off without so much as a Season, she forgets all that. She flees—on a horse she unwittingly steals (oops!)—from Colin Hunt, a newly minted earl who wants nothing more than for her to go home…or stay forever.</description>

  <description>British Agent Nathaniel Bradley is tasked with bringing home a stolen heirloom. After tracking the Faberge egg all the way to a group of criminals in New York, Bradley infiltrates a ring of con artists and gets sucked into the role of a high priced prostitute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While hoping for a chance to take back what is rightfully his, Bradley's sole mission becomes to seduce Tony Terranova, Jr, the heir to a notorious mafia dynasty. Though Tony is strikingly handsome, the usually dominant Bradley is hesitant to submit to the sexual whims of a dangerous Mafioso.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Bradley doesn't expect is for Tony to fall to his knees so eagerly for him, leaving him blindsided by how intensely their dark tastes complement each other. Now Bradley is caught up in a deadly game of lies and desire, where what he truly wants may not be what duty requires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM elements, male/male sexual practices, spanking.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Dante Rivers just lost the rodeo by two one hundredths of a point: he’s frustrated as hell, needs to get laid, and he knows just where to go. That night he meets Ryan Abbott and catches his eye—Ryan watched the rodeo and is still riding high on the rush. The chemistry between them ignites, but Dante, unable to deal with complications, leaves while Ryan’s asleep. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan figures he’ll never see Dante again, but they’re fatefully reunited when Dante’s grandfather, Hy, hires Ryan to help straighten out some old investments. The attraction between Ryan and Dante still sizzles. Sex slowly turns to more, but obstacles abound: Hy’s failing health, Dante’s homophobic sponsor, an attack on Ryan, and Dante’s own struggle with his identity. Any one thing would be enough to separate them permanently… unless they both decide to hang on for the wild ride.</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />This was a very sweet romance by new-to-me author Andrew Grey. It has a lot of stuff in it that I usually enjoy. Cowboys? Check! BDSM? Check! Believable romance? Check? So why didn't I adore this one? I think it comes down to the fact that it felt sort of wishy-washy to me at times....]]>

      <![CDATA[A nice, quick friends-to-lovers story. I have a military men weakness so this should have been right up my alley. However, something about the way the story was written didn't fully work for me, and put this one squarely in the "good but nothing special zone". ]]>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Sophie Bloom wishes she’d been taught the following:&lt;br&gt;a) Bad boy’s presence (TrOuBlE) + teen girl’s brain (DraMa) = TrAuMa (Highly unstable and very volatile.)&lt;br&gt;b) The Genus &lt;em&gt;Greekulum Godissimus&lt;/em&gt; is notable for three traits: 1) awesome abilities, 2) grudges, and 3) hook-ups, break-ups, and in-fighting that puts cable to shame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to the Halloween dance, Sophie figures her worst problems involve adolescent theatrics, bitchy teen yoga girls, and being on probation at her boarding school for mouthy behaviour. Then she meets bad boy Kai and gets the kiss that rocks her world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This breath stealing lip lock reawakens Sophie’s true identity: Persephone, Goddess of Spring. She’s key to saving humanity in the war between the Underworld and Olympus, target numero uno of Hades and Zeus, and totally screwed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus there’s also the little issue that Sophie’s last memory as Persephone was just before someone tried to murder her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big picture: master her powers, get her memories back, defeat Persephone’s would be assassin, and save the world. Also, sneak into the Underworld to retrieve stolen property, battle the minions of Hades and Zeus, outwit psycho nymphs, slay a dragon, rescue a classmate, keep from getting her butt expelled from the one place designed to keep her safe …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;… and stop kissing Kai, Prince of the Underworld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Ex From Hell&lt;/em&gt; is a YA romantic comedy/Greek mythology smackdown. Love meets comedy with a whole lot of sass in book one of this teen fantasy romance series. Compared to Kai and Sophie, Romeo and Juliet had it easy.</description>

  <description>In a future where the United States has split along party lines, Agent Matt Tennimore’s job is to get people out of the Confederated Red States, whether they’re captured special ops agents from his own country or gay CRS citizens who’ve petitioned for asylum. He never expected to have to retrieve his high school crush, aka the guy who ostracized him for being gay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rescuing James Ayala isn’t going to be easy: he’s crawling with tracking nanos and has a cybernetic brain implant that’s granted him psychic power he isn’t sure how to control. That’s the good news. The bad? The implant is compromising James’s mental stability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So they’re on the run, avoiding surveillance by AI aircraft and hiding from enemy militia. Then James confesses he tormented Matt in high school because James wanted him. Matt can’t resist the temptation James offers, but he wants so much more than sex, assuming they ever make it home alive. Is James really a good bet when he’s got a ticking time bomb in his brain and there’s the question of how much he’s actually changed?</description>

  <description>Insomnia does things to a girl’s head, drives her to perform acts she would have scoffed at if not for a bad case of desperation. Yoga. Meditation. Getting in touch with her inner Lune via witchy rituals she doesn’t even realize she’s enacting until she’s naked in the dark with an aggressive dragon…or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cora Phillips has spent her life denying the Lune tradition but with two dragons--and their masters--hounding her with mating claims, her denying days have come to an end. Like it or not, the dragons have come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she doesn’t like it one bit.</description>

      <![CDATA[**2.5 stars** <br /><br />I agree with my friend Jill when I say that this story <em>could</em> have been great. It had many elements that drew me in. I loved the character of Cora. She was sexy and self confident, something I don't always see in paranormal books. What I really <em>really</em> dug was that Cora casually menti...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Without trust, common ground can get pretty shaky…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I believe you have something of mine, Zach.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zach Owens doesn’t even know who this angry stranger is, let alone what the man is talking about—until he learns what they have in common. Their boyfriend, Jake. Once Jake’s out of the picture, Zach’s apology to Nathan Forrester leads to a long conversation, a kiss, and a chemistry that goes far beyond revenge sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan can’t help but fall for the sexy movie theater owner, but it’s a long way from sheet-tearing sex to mutual trust. And a series of “coincidences” that throws Zach into Jake’s company leaves him unconvinced Zach was the complete innocent in their previous love triangle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zach can’t seem to make Nathan believe that Jake is up to something. But protesting his innocence isn’t working, and Jake’s carefully orchestrated campaign to destroy their love could leave them both with nothing…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product Warnings: Contains explicit male/male revenge sex, sweet sex, angry sex, and make-up sex. Author is not responsible for clothing damage that may result from reading this book.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />I actually loved how this book started. It was something I haven't seen before and I didn't see it coming. I try not to read many reviews before starting a book so I was totally <em>in it</em> with Zach in that bar. However, by the end of the book I just felt worn down. The majority of the bo...]]>

  <description>As often as he can possibly manage, Cole slips away from the parties and teas inflicted upon him by his mother to visit Harlowe, the brilliant, mercurial novelty maker he met several months ago when commissioning a piece for his mother. Overwhelmed with work, and preferring to avoid people, Harlowe is not an easy person to know, and Cole values too much their hard-won friendship to ever risk it by telling Harlowe of his true feelings. Then Harlowe begins to receive letters from a secret admirer …</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />This was a sweet read. It had aspects that I really liked, but I didn't really connect with the characters until the last 15% or so. I think if this was a longer story I would have gotten into a groove and ended up really enjoying it. ]]>

  <description>On the island where they first met two lovers from opposite sides of the tracks are reunited. Now jaded and broken, Alex and Matt still can’t deny their sizzling connection or the memories of one perfect, uninhibited year together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At twenty-two, Matt Tarrington is rich, good-looking and destined to be powerful, but behind that confident exterior lurks a man who resents the life his family thrust upon him. Desperate for an escape, Matt heads to Mirabella Island off the coast of Florida for a year of relaxation and some wild nights with vacationing party-girls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt never expected to find real passion in the arms of Alex Hunter, a handsome, laid-back local. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex is gay, but closeted. Matt should be completely off limits, but Alex finds the deeply in denial rich boy too tempting to ignore. Especially when a bet has them working together, fighting the heat in the rundown, beachside cafe where Alex sweats for every dollar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their love felt inevitable until youth left them vulnerable to hatred and greed. Now after six years of hating the lies they live, Alex and Matt will have to risk it all for the second chance they both desperately need.</description>

  <description>After getting hurt in college by a gorgeous man, Nicole Magette vowed never to risk losing her heart again. Now she lives a structured and satisfying life. Her work is easy, her friends are her family, and the only consistent men in her life are her two cats, Winchester and Huntington Peabody the Third. She doesn't date, and she hooks up only with losers—men she has absolutely no risk of falling for. But if she finds herself in danger, she has her old fail-safe in place—the Code Red.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In college, she and her four best friends came up with the system as a way to keep away the good-looking bastards that might worm their way past their carefully constructed walls. Seven years later, three of her friends have succumbed to their last Code Reds and are happily married. Now it’s just Nicole and her closest friend, Jen, who are still on their own, and Nic is just fine with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until Joshua Daniels is transferred to Nicole’s office from New York and assigned to work with her on a special project. He's everything she's avoided and everything she claims she doesn't want, so why can’t she get him out of her mind? He's persistent, dangerously handsome, and sexy as sin. In other words, he’s her worst nightmare. She turns to her friends to help her resist Josh’s considerable charms and the inescapable draw she feels every time she gets near him. Can the Code Red save her this time, or will Josh send her perfectly balanced life into chaos?</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars** <br /><br />Here is my take on this one, to summarize: It is sweet, it is humorous, it doesn't really bring anything new to the table.  <br /><br />Now let me back up a bit. "Code Red" is a funny, low angst romance about a 26 year old girl, Nicole, who has sworn off relationships after getting burned by a p...]]>

  <description>Women have been known to lament, "Always a bridesmaid, never a bride." For Johnny Smith, the problem is, "Always a Best Man, never a groom." At age 33, housepainter Johnny has been Best Man eight times. The ultimate man's man, Johnny loves the Mets, the Jets, his weekly poker game, and the hula girl lamp that hangs over his basement pool table. Johnny has the instant affection of nearly every man he meets, but one thing he doesn't have is a woman to share his life with, and he wants that desperately. When Johnny meets District Attorney Helen Troy, he decides to renounce his bro-magnet ways in order to impress her. With the aid and advice of his friends and family, soon he's transforming his wardrobe, buying throw pillows, ditching the hula girl lamp, getting a cat and even changing his name to the more mature-sounding John. And through it all, he's pretending to have no interest in sports, which Helen claims to abhor. As things heat up with Helen, the questions arise: Will Johnny finally get the girl? And, if he's successful in that pursuit, who will he be now that he's no longer really himself? THE BRO-MAGNET is a rollicking comedic novel about what one man is willing to give up for the sake of love.</description>

      <![CDATA[Very cute chick lit with a twist- because it is told from a male POV. It was sweet and fluffy, though it felt really dated at times. I couldn't relate to many of the references (no one I know watches General Hospital... period) and it seemed pretty obvious to me that this was actually written by...]]>

  <description>A modern day M/M, BDSM retelling of The Ugly Ducking Fairy Tale using avian shifters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raised among humans, Ori Jones only discovered he was an avian shifter six months ago. Unable to complete a full shift until he reaches his avian maturity, he still can’t be sure of his exact species. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with species comes rank, and rank is everything to the avians. When a partial shift allows the elders to announce that they believe Ori to be a rather ugly little duckling, he drops straight to the bottom rung of their hierarchy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life isn’t easy for Ori until he comes to the attention of a high ranking hawk shifter. Then the only question is, is Ori really a duck—and what will his new master think when the truth eventually comes out?</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />I'm not sure what to think about my first full length Kim Dare book. On one hand, I think she did a good job with the psyche of someone who craves and requires a full time D/S relationship. This book was a hard core BDSM book but not in the way you might think. It isn't that there is...]]>

  <description>There are reasons we fear the night. He isn't one of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Bill Ryder: programmer, gamer geek, and hopeless dweeb when it comes to women. All he ever asked for out of life was to collect his paycheck, hang out with his buds, and eventually (someday) ask out the girl of his dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, then Bill met Sally.  She was mysterious, aggressive, and best of all...smoking hot.  Bill never stood a chance.  Before he knew what was happening Sally had lead him to his death, and that was only the beginning of his troubles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Bill awakes to find himself an undead predator of the night.  The only problem is he’s still at the bottom of the food chain.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s in way over his head, surrounded by creatures more dangerous, better looking, and a whole lot cooler than he is. Worst of all is the dreaded Night Razor, a master vampire who just can’t stand him.  He gives Bill a 90-day deadline to either prove himself or meet a more permanent kind of death, and the deck is definitely stacked against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bill isn’t exactly average.  A vampire like him hasn’t been seen in over five centuries.  He's got a few tricks up his sleeve, unlikely allies to help him out, and an attitude problem that makes him just too damn obnoxious to quit.  He may just pull it off... if he doesn't get his teeth kicked in first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill the Vampire&lt;/em&gt; is an 80,000 word horror comedy adventure by Rick Gualtieri.</description>

  <description>Caden DeSarro is what they call a chubby chaser. He likes his guys with a few extra pounds on them. So when he meets Kevin Dodge in a bar bathroom, he can’t help but stare, even if he does make an ass of himself. As far as Caden is concerned, Kevin is physically perfect: a stocky bearded blond with a dick that’s just right. (They met in the bathroom—of course he looked!) But Caden gets tongue-tied and misses his chance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Caden runs into Kevin one night on the El train, he figures it’s fate offering him a second shot. Caden manages to get invited back to Kevin's place for a one-night stand that turns into the kind of relationship he’s dreamed about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the course of true love never did run smooth, and Kevin and Caden’s romance is no exception. When Caden returns from a few weeks away on business, Kevin surprises him with a new and “improved” body—one that fits Caden’s shallow friend Bobby’s ideal, not Caden’s. Caden doesn’t know what to do, and his hesitation is just the opportunity Bobby was looking for. This isn’t the same Kevin he fell in love with… is it?</description>

  <description>"A Mates Series Story"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zev Hassick is surprised and confused when he finds himself attracted to his best friend. His very human, very male best friend. Zev is the son of the pack Alpha, regarded as the strongest wolf in generations, born to lead. And everyone knows a male shifter has to mate with a female of his own kind to keep his humanity. So shifters can't be gay, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah Marvel wants a relationship with Zev, his best friend, the man he has loved since childhood. It wasn't easy to maintain that relationship over years spent living apart while Jonah studied to become a doctor. And then things grow more difficult when Jonah becomes his own patient. Before he can make a life with Zev, he has to understand his past and cure the unexplained ailments that plague him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zev and Jonah know they're destined for each other, but they're facing traditions ingrained over generations and long-buried secrets that may threaten any future together.</description>

  <description>Skinny, quiet hipster Dylan Warner was the kind of guy other men barely glanced at until an evening’s indiscretion with a handsome stranger turned him into a werewolf. Now, despite a slightly hairy handicap, he just wants to live an ordinary—if lonely—life as an architect. He tries to keep his wild impulses in check, but after one too many close calls, Dylan gives up his urban life and moves to the country, where he will be less likely to harm someone else. His new home is a dilapidated but promising house that comes with a former Christmas tree farm and a solitary neighbor: sexy, rustic Chris Nock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan hires Chris to help him renovate the farmhouse and quickly discovers his assumptions about his neighbor are inaccurate—and that he’d very much like Chris to become a permanent fixture in his life as well as his home. Between proving himself to his boss, coping with the seductive lure of his dangerous ex-lover, and his limited romantic experience, Dylan finds it hard enough to express himself—how can he bring up his monthly urge to howl at the moon?</description>

  <description>Boots McHenry and his boyfriend Ryan are young superstars in the North American Paintball League, a high-stakes sport where losers face exile -- five full years of it, on an island so secret no one can be sure it even exists. After Ryan has a tragic collision with an opposing team's paintball, the rules of the game force the boyfriends apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boots is shattered without Ryan, so when his best friend Clemente Santiago suggests a daring, high-seas mission to find the island and reunite the pair, Boots jumps at the chance. They assemble a crack team to join them, including fashion model and mixed-martial-arts champ Colby Kroft, hunky-but-shy sea-captain Marcus Tumble, and Piper Pernfors, the ex who's aching to make Boots forget Ryan ever existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOMO ACTION LOVE STORY! is a lighthearted, sexy adventure from the author of THE CRANBERRY HUSH and THE PAINTING OF PORCUPINE CITY. It's a perfect storm of beautiful fishermen, murderous pirates, blossoming romances, and secrets that call almost everyone's motives into question. Land, ho! This page-turner is sure to float your boat.</description>

  <description>Magical species must never mix. According to the rules, Simon Osborne should ignore the children’s cries for help. After all, they’re werewolf cubs, and he’s an apprentice mage. But for once in his life, Simon breaks the rules and rescues the cubs, saving them from a demon intent on draining them of their magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, all actions have consequences, and Simon’s bold move earns him the displeasure of his peers and the attention of the cubs’ alpha, a man named Gray Townsend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Gray needs is a mage in his life, but Simon did save his son. Since Simon is now a friend of the pack, Gray doesn’t have much choice about it—or the forbidden attraction that goes along with it. Unfortunately for the alpha, he needs Simon’s help to track down the demon behind the kidnappings—before it strikes again. Simon and Gray must join forces to protect the pack, even as they struggle to resist the temptation that threatens to destroy them both.</description>

  <description>Seattle hairstylist Violet Murphy always knew the day would come when her best friend Gabe Parker would want to settle down. She’d secretly wished it would be with her, but now that he’s chosen someone else—the prim, perfect Alicia—he wants Vi to be his best man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healing her broken heart isn’t easy, but when Violet meets Landon Harlow, a man who isn’t fazed by her funky style and less-than-delicate attitude, she takes a step in the right direction. Until Gabe’s fiancé’s gorgeous façade begins to crack, and Violet’s disturbing past comes back to haunt her, that is. Vi now finds herself armed with a series of lies that would break Gabe’s heart—and his engagement—if he knew their truth, and a secret from their childhood that could change everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the wedding looming, her relationships unraveling, and the bachelor party of the century to plan, Violet must choose between a fresh start with Landon, or confronting her painful past and risking it all for a chance at a future with Gabe.</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.25 stars** <br /><br />"Keeping Secrets in Seattle" was a surprisingly good clean romance. It is about a girl, Violet, who is in love with her childhood best friend, Gabe. Gabe, of course, is engaged to marry another woman. Think "My Best Friend's Wedding"... sort of. Violet tries to get over Gabe by dat...]]>

      <![CDATA[This was a cute short set in the "Student Prince" world. Since I just finished the main book a few minutes ago I enjoyed seeing Arthur and Merlin a few years down the road. Still, I really don't remember all of the details on the opening ceremony that well so some of this one was lost on me. ]]>

      <![CDATA[I think this short from Aggy Bird had a lot of potential but it didn't really deliver for me. My main gripe is that Frank went from denying he had any feelings at all for Drake to readily confessing his love for him.

  <description>In the first book of the acclaimed Henry Rios series, a lawyer doggedly pursues a murder investigation into the lion’s den of San Francisco’s moneyed elite&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry Rios meets Hugh Paris when Paris is arrested for drug possession and being high on PCP. A burnt-out public defender battling alcoholism, Rios has reached a crossroads in his life. While interviewing Paris in jail, Rios goes through the motions, but notices that Paris is far more polished and well-off than the usual drug suspects. Paris is mysteriously bailed out—but a few weeks later, he turns up on Rios’s doorstep. Skittish and paranoid, he admits to using heroin and says he’s afraid that his wealthy grandfather wants to murder him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rios tries to help Paris get clean, but when Paris is found dead of an apparent heroin overdose, Rios is the only one who considers foul play. Determined to find Paris’s killer, Rios knocks on San Francisco’s most gilded doors, where he discovers a family tainted by jealousy, greed, and hate. They’ve been warped by a fortune someone’s willing to kill—and kill again—to possess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At once an atmospheric noir mystery and a scathing indictment of a legal system caught in the maws of escalating corruption, The Little Death chronicles one man’s struggle to achieve true justice for all.</description>

  <description>Mace Llewellyn. Brendon Shaw. Two tall, gorgeous, sexy alpha heroes who are 100% male―with a little something extra. Lion-shifters, to be exact, who can unleash every woman's animal side and still look good―make that spectacular―in a suit... and even better out of it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NYPD cop Desiree "Dez" MacDermot knows she's changed a lot since she palled around with her childhood buddy, Mace. But it's fair to say that Mace has changed even more. It isn't just those too-sexy gold eyes, or the six-four, built-like-a-Navy Seal body. It's something in the way he sniffs her neck and purrs, making her entire body tingle...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, for Tennessean Ronnie Lee Reed, New York City is the place where any girl―even one who runs with a Pack―can redefine herself. First order of business: find a mate, settle down, and stop using men for sex. Even big, gorgeous, lion shifter men like Brendon Shaw. But she needn't worry, because now that Brendon's set his sights on her, the predator in him is ready to pounce and never let go...</description>

  <description>Imagine having almost everything you want: a place of your own, mountains to climb, woods to roam, lakes for swimming, and, above all, privacy. It's Axton's definition of paradise, because a werewolf needs his space and his secrets. He's the resident recluse of a sleepy, far flung town hours away from his cabin in the woods, but there's more than one hidden truth in Axton's life. The lycanthropy's enough to make a hermit out of him, but it's the fact that Axton's gay and closeted that keeps him shy. Friendship--let alone romance--isn't an option. Without a pack for support, Axton has to protect his secrets himself. And that means being careful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All's well in the shapeshifter's life until the day a well meaning human decides to vacation in the cabin next door. At first Axton wants nothing to do with his new neighbor, but Leander Avilez is a dream: young, strapping, masculine. As if it's not enough that Leander's gorgeous, he's also charming, and Axton finds himself falling hard. But visions of sweet romance aren't in the realistic picture: Leander's thoroughly human. Axton's terrified of intimacy with someone who doesn't know his secret, because his change isn't forced by the full moon. Whenever Axton's hurt or surprised or on edge, he goes wolf--and he can't stop it. How is he supposed to keep his lycanthropy a secret from his new neighbor? And how is he going to hide his growing and undeniable attraction?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why does Leander have to be straight, with a long list of ex girlfriends? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Leander goes back to his life in Los Angeles, Axton can breathe a sigh of relief. There's moose to hunt and chores to do, and Axton doesn't have the time for a whirlwind werewolf romance, no matter how compelling the fiction of his erotic daydreams might be. But just when Axton's settled back into the werewolf bachelor groove, Leander comes back for another vacation--and then another, and another. They grow closer in time, but as drunken confessional conversations show, Leander's still straight and, oh, yeah, still totally human. Leander is two types of forbidden temptation at once, and Axton doesn't know how long he can stand it. What's a gay werewolf to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Leander stumbles across what looks like a big bad wolf in the woods one day, he's understandingly a little panicked. Axton feels fifty shades of irrationally rejected by Leander's fear, and it's what finally makes him kiss his gay bromance-turned-romance dreams goodbye. Still, they get along so well, and Leander is the only person he's been close to in years, so Axton resigns himself to being just friends. There's some tension and some tender yearning--and maybe even some awkward almosts--but mostly, Axton's content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stakes are upped when Leander visits during a brutal winter, just before the blizzard of the decade hits. The cabins aren't winter proofed, because Axton spends all winter comfortably in his werewolf skin. For a human, the cabins are uncomfortable at best, and skittering towards dangerous as the storm worsens. It's Leander who decides they need to share a cabin and tough out the storm together--and if it was hard to keep his lycanthropy a secret before, Axton's got no idea how to keep Leander from waking up to a face full of fur and teeth now, with temperatures plummeting and emotions running high. But it's when skies clear and a hike goes wrong that things really go deadly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alone in the snow and hurt, how long can Leander survive? Will Axton find him in time? And when face to face with a wolf, will Leander be struck silent with wonder, or will he fight for his life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treat yourself to this exciting new book!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending romance and humor into a struggle for survival, Winter Wolf is a sweet, hot story that's sure to please. Curl up with Axton and Leander this winter and let this shapeshifter romance take you away.</description>

  <description>Quent Jackson has followed Jason Spade's every move in business and in poker since their first day as college freshmen.  Eight years later, when Jace finally decides Quint is the one man he can't live without, he sees no reason for that to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as much as Jace believes that poker is life, no one gave Quent the same playbook. After their first passionate night, the real game of love and trust begins, and Jace has been playing alone too long to make teaching the rules easy.  Jace only speaks two languages: one of them is sex, and the other one is poker. Between the two, he needs to find a way to convince himself to take a chance on love—and Quent to take a chance on him.  It's a lucky thing they’re good at reading the odds, because they’re playing for keeps, and this is one high-stakes relationship that's definitely worth the gamble.</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />This book is definitely in the category of "Amy Lane lite". Though I enjoyed the fact that these two guys had a low angst story, I shamefully prefer the more gruesome Amy Lane reads. I like her books when her men are torn to shreds and then put back together again. <em>Rip those boys up!...</em>]]>

  <description>Bertie is just the king's foolish, poetry loving, sometimes crossdressing brother. useless in times of crisis, or so he tells himself. He is completely beneath the notice of someone like the country's most famous general, Godric of the South. It's too bad that he happens to be in love with Godric... and that with the entire country at stake, Bertie might be the only one who can save it.</description>

      <![CDATA["My Man Godric" is a quirky fantasy novel that takes place in a world where a cross-dressing lord is considered to be off-beat yet adorable and homosexuality is a non-issue. Though this novella was written very well, I just couldn't get into the story like I wanted to. For the length of the story...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For every rule, there’s an exception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ardan Boyle has spent the majority of his life as a freelance assassin. Working throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East, he only accepts contracts for the most vile of criminals, for those who have made themselves 'above the law'. His success can be measured in the reduction of criminal filth in the Old World but even this service to the world has a price: the total detachment from his humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Brad Myles, an aspiring actor and businessman. Their chance meeting at an airport awakens something Ardan thought long dead and even as they become acquainted, it becomes obvious that maybe there's a cure for a lifetime of apathy. Nothing comes for free though and while Ardan may be on the road to recovery, his past is not quite so easily shed.</description>

  <description>France, 1915&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lieutenant Tom Donald envies everything about fellow officer Frank Foden—his confidence, his easy manner with the men in the trenches, the affectionate letters from his wife. Frank shares these letters happily, drawing Tom into a vicarious friendship with a woman he's never met. Although the bonds of friendship forged under fire are strong, Tom can't be so open with Frank—he's attracted to men and could never confess that to anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Frank is killed in no-man's-land, he leaves behind a mysterious request for Tom: to deliver a sealed letter to a man named Palmer. Tom undertakes the commission while on leave—and discovers that almost everything he thought he knew about Frank is a lie…</description>

  <description>In the Arctic, before winter gives way to buds and flowers, breakup occurs—the moment when the ice of a frozen river suddenly breaks apart in a spectacular sight-and-sound show. Massive chunks of ice crunch and pound against one another, pushing their way down river towards the sea. ‘“That river will come to visit us today,” said Kumak. The water starts rising. It spills out of the river banks, up over the sandy beach, and begins flowing up past the fish racks and boats. As the waters sweep through his village, Kumak and his family take refuge on the roof of his house. “Look!” said Kumak’s wife, “There goes Uncle Aglu’s oil drum.” “Look!” said Kumak’s wife’s mother, “There goes Aana Lulu’s fish tubs and net floats!” “Look!” said Kumak’s sons and daughters, “There goes Little Nate’s basketball!”’ Just as Kumak and his family are feeling all is lost, “just like someone pulled a plug in a bathtub”, the water recedes. “Just in time!” shout the villagers. “What has the river done with our things!”’In an effort to recover as many of their belonging as possible, Kumak and the village practice the value of community and working together. In this light-hearted, playful adventure, the villagers show respect for nature’s immense power as Kumak brings them together to rescue their supplies, toys, household goods, and, finally, Kumak’s dogs. Through lively art, humorous text, and informative endnotes, author Michael Bania conveys authentic details on Inupiat village life and provides young readers with a fascinating window into another culture as the life of hapless, yet lovable Kumak continues. Bania’s first book, KUMAK'S HOUSE was a 2003 Children's Book Council Notable Trade Book in Social Studies. Her second book, KUMAK’S FISH was a Notable Social Studies Trade Book, 2005 Children’s Book Council. Both books were chosen for the Alaska Association of School Libraries “Battle of the Books” for First Grade.  KUMAK’S FISH was an honor book for the first Wanda Gág Read Aloud Book Award.</description>

      <![CDATA[I wish I liked this book more because it was a Goodreads win, and I'm always looking for new and different books to read to my kids. This, however, did not hold their attention at all. My almost 4 year old wouldn't sit still for the story, and I tried on a few occasions. This from a girl who love...]]>

  <description>In his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novel, David Levithan introduces readers to what &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt; calls a "wise, wildly unique" love story about A, a teen who wakes up every morning in a different body, living a different life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day a different body. Every day a different life. Every day in love with the same girl. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s never any warning about where it will be or who it will be. A has made peace with that, even established guidelines by which to live: Never get too attached. Avoid being noticed. Do not interfere.&lt;br&gt;It’s all fine until the morning that A wakes up in the body of Justin and meets Justin’s girlfriend, Rhiannon. From that moment, the rules by which A has been living no longer apply. Because finally A has found someone he wants to be with—day in, day out, day after day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his new novel, David Levithan, bestselling co-author of &lt;em&gt;Will Grayson, Will Grayson&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist&lt;/em&gt;, has pushed himself to new creative heights. He has written a captivating story that will fascinate readers as they begin to comprehend the complexities of life and love in A’s world, as A and Rhiannon seek to discover if you can truly love someone who is destined to change every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>It's easy to become cynical when life never goes your way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole Reid has been a social recluse since he was fifteen, when he was outed by his high school baseball team. Since then, his obsessive-compulsive behavior and sarcastic nature have driven away most of the population, and everyone else hates him because he's gay. As he sees it, he's bound to repulse any prospective friends, let alone boyfriends, so why bother?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time Cole enters college, he's become an anal-retentive loner—but it's not a problem until his roommate graduates and the housing department assigns Ellis Montgomery to move in with Cole. Ellis is messy, gorgeous, straight, and worst of all, a "jock"!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During a school year filled with frat buddies, camping expeditions, and meddling parents, Cole and Ellis develop a friendship that turns Cole's glass-half-empty outlook on its head. There must be more to Ellis than a fun-loving jock—and maybe Cole's reawakening libido has rekindled his hope for more than camaraderie.</description>

  <description>The war that won the country its independence also lost many of the men who fought to achieve it, including Brom’s lover. Years later, he still feels as if he left half of himself on the battlefield. When a new schoolmaster comes to Sleepy Hollow, a spark and a whiskey-flavored kiss ignite feelings he thought were long dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prequel to the novel Haunted Passions.</description>

  <description>Devin Salvo has always remained three steps ahead: in chess, on the pitch, and in his love life. His every desire is within arm's reach, except the one person Devin has always wished would be his in the end. All it takes is one conversation to open his eyes to a new possibility, one moment to change what Devin believes about friendship and love and one person to change the rules of the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Marshall has been fighting his feelings for his friend and roommate for two years. When an opportunity presents itself, he makes his move, only to be faced with the very real fear that what he sees in Devin, the potential waiting to be realized, may be more than their friendship can handle.</description>

  <description>Brian couldn’t resist playboy executive Leland Whitacre in spite of their employer’s strict no fraternization policy. Leland isn’t just his boss, though. He’s the son of the company’s CEO. And Brian has fallen in love. Hurt by too many stolen kisses and nooners at seedy hotels, Brian finally broke off their secret affair two weeks ago. Leland isn’t ready to let Brian go and he isn’t above seducing Brian — again — to give them both what they really want for Christmas: each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This free short story was originally written for the Goodreads M/M Romance Group's 2010 holiday event and appears in the event's &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10104297.Stuff_My_Stocking__M_M_Romance_Stories_that_are_Nice_and__Naughty" title="Stuff My Stocking: M/M Romance Stories that are Nice and… Naughty"&gt;Stuff My Stocking: M/M Romance Stories that are Nice and… Naughty&lt;/a&gt; anthology.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling erotic enovella trilogy, a buttoned-up businesswoman takes her friend’s advice and has a fling with a stranger on a trip to Vegas—only to find herself under his mysterious, sexy power both in the boardroom and the bedroom. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kasie Fitzgerald knows who she’s supposed to be. She’s a rising-star-workaholic at a global consulting firm. She’s the fiancée of a well-connected man who’s won the approval of her parents. People know that she’s reliable, serious, proper, cautious, pragmatic, and yes, a little predictable. She’s who Dave and her family &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; her to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as her thirtieth birthday looms, buried feelings begin to resurrect. Her friend takes her to Vegas for one last wild and crazy night. In a dress much shorter and sexier than anything she has ever dared to wear before, she hits the blackjack tables. And meets &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt; Under the tailored clothes it’s clear that this is a man who is intense, powerful, and maybe even a little dangerous. With a touch of trepidation she accepts his invitation to get a drink, and before long, she’s in his hotel room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She never gets his full name. Perhaps his anonymity is one of the reasons she’s able to give herself over to him and to the moment so completely&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps it’s why she’s just had the most exquisite and passionate sex of her life. Shaken by her own behavior, Kasie tries to chalk it up to one crazy night. But when the mysterious gentleman she’s just had a fling with shows up in her office—as the CEO of a firm her company does a billion dollars of business with a year, demanding that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; handle his account, and so much more—things will never be the same again. And there’s no telling where this will go…</description>

  <description>As an anthropologist, Holly McCartney is more comfortable in a museum than shopping on Rodeo Drive. She isn’t prepared for the media frenzy on her arrival in L.A. to accept a posthumous acting award for her late sister….or for her sister’s gorgeous friend Nate Devlin to come to her rescue. Though he resents her for some reason, she can’t fight their irresistible chemistry—especially when the paparazzi force her to stay at his mansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photographer Nate only agrees to help Holly survive Hollywood for her sister’s sake, but she soon gets under his skin in a way no other woman has. The more time he spends with her, the more his attraction grows and he finds himself opening up to her in ways he never expected. But will ghosts of the past stand in the way of their perfect Hollywood ending?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A woman’s search for enduring romance leads her to a television dating show, and into the arms of a man who seems just a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; perfect . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sydney Wiesman is looking for an electric, passionate love—and she’s willing to do anything, even go on a television dating show, to make it happen. Tom Ghorman seems to have it all; he’s smart, sexy, and funny. But, even though he was the best of the three suitors &lt;em&gt;Electra-Love &lt;/em&gt;offered her, their first date was a monumental disaster—and now she has rehash it for everyone to see. As she faces a public display of complicated emotions, Sydney must decide if Tom is the guy of her dreams or her worst nightmare . . . and she is far from knowing all of his secrets. Will she give in to the unpredictable romance Tom offers, or will she return to a life of waiting for boundless love? This ebook features an extended biography of Mary Kay McComas.</description>

  <description>When he falls in love with a contestant on a reality TV show, Peter "Praline" Palmetier decides to leave his home in rural Georgia and, failing to realize this might be considered stalking, travels to Hollywood to find his soul mate, Dave G. Once in tinsel-town he meets a collection of startling, and often horny, characters in his quest. They include a studly steward, a conservative talk show host, the Godfather of the Gay Mafia, and casting assistant Jason Friedman, who always manages to be there in time to save Praline from total disaster. Will Praline find love with the illusive Dave G., or will he recognize the charms of appealing but untelegenic Jason?</description>

  <description>He thinks he’s just a wallflower. Little does he know he’s the guest of honor…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the last night of a week-long house party in remote northern England. Every sensual delight imaginable is right at Henry Shaw’s fingertips. Yet all he wants is to be with his host, the deliciously handsome and enigmatic Arsen Grey, Marquis of Somerville. Henry’s certain it’s love, not mere infatuation. He’s also sure it’s hopeless. After all, the party’s purpose is to find Arsen a new mistress. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arsen longs to leave the glittering, jaded world of the ton behind and find someone who will value him for himself, not his wealth and his title. He suspects that someone could be the strapping country gentleman he’s caught staring at him. Henry is loyal and dependable, nothing like his other acquaintances. Arsen sets a plan into motion, one designed to get Henry into his bed. One that includes a test of devotion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arsen never expected that in winning Henry, he risks losing his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free short sequel &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9260473.Pleasures_of_Somerville_Park" title="Pleasures of Somerville Park"&gt;Pleasures of Somerville Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This title contains a m/m romance between an obscenely wealthy marquis and a strong, silent country gentleman.</description>

  <description>Stefan Joss just can't win. Not only does he have to go to Texas in the middle of summer to be the man of honor in his best friend Charlotte's wedding, but he's expected to negotiate a million-dollar business deal at the same time. Worst of all, he's thrown for a loop when he arrives to see the one man Charlotte promised wouldn't be there: her brother, Rand Holloway. Stefan and Rand have been mortal enemies since the day they met, so Stefan is shocked when a temporary cease-fire sees the usual hostility replaced by instant chemistry. Though leery of the unexpected feelings, Stefan is swayed by a sincere revelation from Rand, and he decides to give Rand a chance. But their budding romance is threatened when Stefan's business deal goes wrong: the owner of the last ranch he needs to secure for the company is murdered. Stefan's in for the surprise of his life as he finds himself in danger as well.</description>

  <description>Lukas Blacque is a deeply closeted werewolf, and almost more than anything in life, he desires his neighbor, Oliver Bleu. Oliver is a vampire who is slowly dying from insomnia. More than anything, he needs Lukas Blacque and the rich blood that flows through his veins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the day that Blacque makes an important commitment to his family and pack, he also succumbs to temptation and agrees to a passionate weekend with the alluring vampire. At sunset on Friday, it's all about urgent lust and the drive to lose his virginity. When the sun rises on Monday, lust has shifted to love and devotion. He's not sure he can walk away, even for the commitment he's made. He's even less sure Bleu will let him go.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Blacque's world, vampires and werewolves make uneasy bedfellows, and a gay werewolf is an impossibility. In Bleu's world, all living creatures are little more than vessels for food and sex. But in the mysterious and magical town of Arcada, the unexpected is always waiting right around the corner. Now Blacque and Bleu just need to survive long enough for Arcada's magic to work for them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note:&lt;/em&gt; Blacque/Bleu &lt;em&gt;is related to&lt;/em&gt; Chrysalis &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Mad at the Moon, &lt;em&gt;which were published by Changeling Press. This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Bondage, domination, male/male sexual practices, violence.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Castaway Planet fans Brandon and Abel hate bad fan fiction—especially when it pairs their number-one TV crushes of all time, dashing space captain Cadmus and dapper android Sim. As co-runners of the Internet’s third most popular Castaway Planet vlog, they love to spar with the “Cadsim” fangirls who think Cadmus will melt Sim’s mechanical heart by the Season 5 finale. This summer, Brandon and Abel have a mission: hit the road in an RV to follow the traveling Castaway Planet convention, interview the actors and showrunner, and uncover proof that a legit Cadsim romance will NEVER, EVER HAPPEN.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Brandon and Abel romance: also not happening. Brandon’s sick of his struggle to make “gay and Catholic” compute, so it’s safer to love a TV android. Plus Abel’s got a hot new boyfriend with a phoenix tattoo, and how can Brandon compete with that? But when mysterious messages about them start popping up in the fan community, they make a shocking discovery that slowly forces their real feelings to the surface. Before they get to the last Castaway Planet convention, Brandon’s going to find out the truth: can a mechanical heart be reprogrammed, or will his first shot at love be a full system failure?</description>

Trouble is, Matt’s firefighter outfit is pretty convincing, and the longer he keeps up the pretence the harder it will be to reveal the naked truth: that there’s nothing underneath his costume but a sequinned thong!</description>

  <description>Free novelette written for the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/20149.M_M_Romance"&gt;M/M Romance&lt;/a&gt; group's "Hot Summer Days" event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt appears on Denny's doorstep four years after Matt's mother -- Denny's stepmother -- put Denny on the first bus out of California.

      <![CDATA[This was a short, hot, free novella that fulfilled my smutty desires. The downside is that there wasn't much in the way of substance. I would have liked to know the characters more and get a real feel for them. It felt one- dimensional to me. However, it was nicely written and got my heart racing]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Romance, velvet, sequins, and &lt;em&gt;murder...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hale Ferrer is the rising star of the hottest cabaret in New Orleans. And her one goal is escape. Escape from the lies, from the crime, and from her growing fear that one day she'll have to earn her living in the secret back rooms, where the dancers do more than dance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she won't leave behind Teeny, the orphan-girl she promised to protect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freddie Lovel is rich, handsome, and in love with Hale, and he's ready to sweep her away with him to Paris. But her heart is captured by Beau, the poor stagehand with eyes as blue as Louisiana iris flowers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denying her fears, Hale is ready to choose love and a life with Beau, until a predator hidden in the wings launches a chain of events that could cost her everything--Teeny, their one hope of escape, and possibly even her life.</description>

      <![CDATA["Rouge" is a hard book for me to rate. On one hand, it was well written. The scenes were rich with detail and I was really feeling the late 1800s New Orleans vibe. The story is well-plotted and interesting. On the other hand, it was so angsty that it was hard for me to read at times. <br /><br />The book is...]]>

  <description>A lover from another time&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ted Ennis steps out the doors of the Criterion Theatre for a cigarette and finds himself in Victorian London, he begins to doubt his sanity. At first he thinks it's all a film set, and is sure that the strikingly handsome young man leaning against a lamppost must be the leading man…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as a sordid transaction with a beautiful rent boy quickly turns into something much deeper, drawing him back again and again as he gets to know Jem and craves meaningful encounters with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Ted doesn't understand the exact conditions necessary for his trips through time—and for Jem, time may actually be running out. Now Ted has one last shot to get back to Jem and save their relationship, before it's too late…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;27,000 words</description>

  <description>When business mogul Jordan Hill inherits half of Bendura Island Resort, a posh vacation destination in the Fiji Islands, the will demands he release his  half uncle's ashes somewhere on the island and that he indulge in a real vacation before he sells. As Jordan is reeling with grief and under good circumstances doesn't do vacations, especially if they include horses and looming volcanoes, he finds himself on uneven footing. The footing turns treacherous as Jordan realizes, for the first time in his life, he's attracted to a man--his new business partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For resort entrepreneur Ryan McCale, Bendura Island is a dream come true as well as his livelihood. He was warned Jordan would try to sell sight unseen, and after meeting him, there's no doubt the business shark has dollar signs in his eyes. But there's also vulnerability and desire in that chocolate gaze. Suddenly, Ryan's looking forward to showing Jordan the delights of the island and hoping to convince his new partner Bendura could be his dream, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is an erotic romance. It contains explicit language, hot m/m lovin', light kink, two gorgeous guys, horses, and an impending insurance nightmare of a volcano. Enjoy!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;To want what you’re not supposed to have…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is only nineteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is his new stepfather’s daughter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits. His famous father’s guilt money, his mother’s desperation to win his love, and his charm are the three reasons he has never been told no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaire Wynn left her small farmhouse in Alabama, after her mother passed away, to move in with her father and his new wife in their sprawling beach house along the Florida gulf coast. She isn’t prepared for the lifestyle change and she knows she’ll never fit into this world. Then there is her sexy stepbrother who her father leaves her with for the summer while he runs off to Paris with his wife. Rush is as spoiled as he is gorgeous. He is also getting under her skin. She knows he is anything but good for her and that he’ll never be faithful to anyone. He is jaded and has secrets Blaire knows she may never uncover but even knowing all of that…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaire just may have fallen too far.</description>

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />If this was my first Abbi Glines book it would have been a 5 star rating. Alas, this is not my first time at this rodeo...<br /><br />I am a self-professed Abbi Glines fan-girl but even I am getting a bit sick of the typical formula. Innocent girl (usually a virgin) with a smoking body falls for...]]>

  <description>Tim Macbeth, a seventeen-year-old albino and a recent transfer to the prestigious Irving School, where the motto is “Enter here to be and find a friend.” A friend is the last thing Tim expects or wants—he just hopes to get through his senior year unnoticed. Yet, despite his efforts to blend into the background, he finds himself falling for the quintessential “It” girl, Vanessa Sheller, girlfriend of Irving’s most popular boy. To Tim's surprise, Vanessa is into him, too, but she can kiss her social status goodbye if anyone ever finds out. Tim and Vanessa begin a clandestine romance, but looming over them is the Tragedy Paper, Irving’s version of a senior year thesis, assigned by the school’s least forgiving teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jumping between viewpoints of the love-struck Tim and Duncan, a current senior about to uncover the truth of Tim and Vanessa, The Tragedy Paper is a compelling tale of forbidden love and the lengths people will go to keep their love.</description>

  <description>Operation Danny… that's all bartender and recent college graduate, Julian Hallowell has had on his mind the past year.  Julian may have no idea what he wants to do with his life, but he definitely knows he's in love with the boy next door: the one in the next room to be exact, his roommate Danny Wallace.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danny owns a used text book store just off campus and while Julian has done his level best to make Danny fall for him, all his hard work appears to have been in vain.  Danny doesn't seem to view Julian as anything other than that… a roommate and friend.  So when new guy in town Andy Baker asks him out on a date, Julian can't seem to think of a good reason to say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julian has already instituted a Reverse Operation Danny plan, which he's positive will purge all thoughts of love and lust for his roomie out of his head.  He's ready to move on and start looking for his next Mr. Right, and Andy just might fit the bill. But has he given up too soon?</description>

  <description>Boone Daniels seems to have trouble finishing things.  Along with the half dozen or so novels he's started, only to abandon mid-way through, his love life could be best described as a series of drive-bys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boone has spent the past week staying at a ski lodge in the tiny mountain town of Summit City.  He's been using his time alone to write while waiting for his boyfriend to join him for their anniversary.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens to Boone when he winds up dumped on the eve of his one-year anniversary and ends up at a bar having one too many cocktails?  Wade Walker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;previously published in the anthology &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7312589.Melting_the_Slopes" title="Melting the Slopes"&gt;Melting the Slopes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Too embarrassed to be seen with the school's biggest social outcast (who is also rumored to be gay), Joey agrees to go over to Jimmy's house to work on the project. Away from the scrutiny of their peers, Joey finds that he actually enjoys Jimmy's company.

  <description>How far would you dare to go...to win it all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maverick Holms and Duke Warren share almost everything--a college soccer team, an apartment and the same extremely competitive nature. Thanks to that never-back-down spirit, they're about to share more than they bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game is "gay chicken." The rule: get as close as possible without kissing, and the one that pulls away first is the loser. The problem: neither of them likes to lose. It isn't long before the game becomes an excuse to touch and kiss in every possible forbidden way. And after they pose for a gay website to earn extra money, things really heat up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly Duke is talking lifetime commitment, and Mav is backpedaling as hard as he can, not sure if he's ready to accept all his best friend is offering him. Or the truth about what he is.</description>

To me, it was like an underdeveloped version of "Hot Head," taking place in college instead of a firehouse. It could have used another 50 or so pages of buildup and depth. I'd still read this again.

  <description>The most important things in Simon Murray’s life are football, friends, and film—in that order. His friends despair of him ever meeting someone, but despite his loneliness, Simon is cautious about looking for more. Then his best friends drag him to a party, where he barges into a football conversation and ends up defending the honour of star forward Declan Tyler—unaware that the athlete is present. In that first awkward meeting, neither man has any idea they will change each other's lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like his entire family, Simon revels in living in Melbourne, the home of Australian Rules football and mecca for serious fans. There, players are treated like gods—until they do something to fall out of public favour. This year, the public is taking Declan to task for suffering injuries outside his control, so Simon's support is a bright spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Simon and Declan fumble toward a relationship, keeping Declan's homosexuality a secret from well-meaning friends and an increasingly suspicious media becomes difficult. Nothing can stay hidden forever. Soon Declan will have to choose between the career he loves and the man he wants, and Simon has never been known to make things easy—for himself or for others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Edition published by Dreamspinner Press (March 2009)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Some people spend their whole lives looking for the right partner. Nate Schaper found his in high school. In the eight months since their cautious flirting became a real, heart-pounding, tell-the-parents relationship, Nate and Adam have been inseparable. Even when local kids take their homophobia to brutal levels, Nate is undaunted. He and Adam are rock solid. Two parts of a whole. Yin and yang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Adam graduates and takes an off-Broadway job in New York--at Nate's insistence--that certainty begins to flicker. Nate's friends can't keep his insecurities at bay, especially when he catches Skyped glimpses of Adam's shirtless roommate. Nate starts a blog to vent his frustrations and becomes the center of a school controversy, drawing ire and support in equal amounts. But it's the attention of a new boy who is looking for more than guidance that forces him to confront who and what he really wants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tender, thoughtful, and unflinchingly real, &lt;em&gt;Don't Let Me Go &lt;/em&gt; is a witty and beautifully written account of young love, long-distance relationships, and learning to follow your heart.</description>

      <![CDATA[3.5 stars<br /><br />I read this free online book while I was sick with a stomach virus, and it was the perfect thing to cheer me up. It is a nice, hot read and a great free book.

  <description>Getting drunk homecoming night your senior year is never a good idea, but Jake Hayes never expected it all to end with a car crash and a t-post embedded in his throat. His biggest regret about it all? What he never said to Samantha Shay. He's been in love with her for years and never had the guts to tell her. Now it's too late. Because after that night, Jake will never be able to talk again. When Jake returns to his small island home, population 5,000, he'll have to learn how to deal with being mute. He also finds that his family isn't limited to his six brothers and sisters, that sometimes an entire island is watching out for you. And when he gets the chance to spend more time with Samantha, she'll help him learn that not being able to talk isn't the worst thing that could ever happen to you. Maybe, if she'll let him, Jake will finally tell her what he didn't say before, even if he can't actually say it.</description>

  <description>Joe wakes up in a barley field with no clothes, no memories, and no idea how he got there. Before he knows it, he's off on the last great journey of his life. With his soul guide Baker and a charge to have courage from a mysterious, alluring, and somehow familiar Stranger, Joe sets off through a fantastical changing landscape to confront his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The quest is not without challenges. Joe's past is not always an easy thing to relive, but if he wants to find peace—and reunite with the Stranger he is so strongly drawn to—he must continue on until the end, no matter how tempted he is to stop along the way.</description>

  <description>Meet Annie Choi. She fears cable cars and refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow. Her brother thinks chicken is a vegetable. Her father occasionally starts fires at work. Her mother collects Jesus trading cards and wears plaid like it's a job. No matter how hard Annie and her family try to understand one another, they often come up hilariously short.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the midst of a family crisis, Annie comes to realize that the only way to survive one another is to stick together . . . as difficult as that might be. Annie Choi's &lt;em&gt;Happy Birthday or Whatever&lt;/em&gt; is a sidesplitting, eye-opening, and transcendent tale of coping with an infuriating, demanding, but ultimately loving Korean family.</description>

  <description>In "Dark Lady I," as Silvio Spadaro plans to take on the Russian hit squad that kidnapped his boss, he decides the best way to deal with four extremely dangerous men is to become an even more dangerous woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In “Dark Lady II,” Stefano discovers yet another disturbing – and arousing – truth about Silvio and how easily Silvio uses a man’s weakness for his own ends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Dark Brother” brings another player to Stefano Marino’s household. Franco Spadaro has just been released from the French Foreign Legion and is catching up with his little brother. In the middle of a war, a skilled sniper comes in right on time – but two Spadaros might be more than Stefano can handle.</description>

  <description>When Connor wakes up in a hospital bed, he realises that the accident that broke his leg has also wiped his memory. His wife is a stranger, his dead parents just a photograph, and his home an unfamiliar, shabby place that smells of dog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a local support group for amnesiacs, Connor meets Nate, a fellow sufferer of retrograde amnesia. Nate has no memory, and no idea how he came to lose it, but he remains easy going, and Connor quickly considers the foulmouthed, chain-smoking Nate a friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, when Nate makes a pass at him, Connor starts to question everything he’s learnt about himself. Is he really a happily married 32 year old, or are secrets being kept from him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who is the mysterious ‘Coop’ whose cryptic emails are still in his inbox? And why, on the day of his accident, was he driving with another man in his car? A man whose life, and death, are still a touchy subject at home.</description>

  <description>Stefano Marino is a made man, a happily married west coast mafia boss who travels east to await the death of a family patriarch. All the old hands have gathered—of course sharks will circle when there’s blood in the water—but it’s a new hand that draws Stefano’s eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silvio “the Barracuda” Spadaro is &lt;em&gt;protetto&lt;/em&gt; and heir to retired &lt;em&gt;consigliere&lt;/em&gt; Gianbattista Falchi, and a made man in his own right. Among his underworld family, being gay is a capital crime, but the hypersexual—and pansexual—young killer has never much cared for rules. The only orders he follows are Battista’s, whether on the killing field or on his knees, eagerly submissive at Battista’s feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Silvio has needs Battista can’t fill, and he’s cast his black-eyed gaze on Stefano. A fake break-in, an even faker attack, and Silvio is exactly where he wants to be: strung up at Stefano’s mercy, driving the older Mafioso toward urges he’s spent his whole life repressing. Stefano resists, but when the Russian mob invades his territory and forces him to seek aid, Gianbattista’s price brings Stefano face to face once more with Silvio—and his darkest desires.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Rayna sees angels, and has the medication and weekly therapy sessions to prove it. Now, in remission, Rayna starts fresh at a new school, lands a new job, and desperately tries for normalcy. She ignores signs that she may be slipping into the world she has tried so hard to climb out of. But these days, it’s more than just hallucinations that keep Rayna up at night. Students are dying, and she may be the only one who can stop it. Can she keep her job, her sanity, and her friends from dying at the hands of angels she can't admit to seeing?</description>

  <description>Ryan Gracin had a good life until he told his parents he was gay. Since they yanked their support for college he had to find a way to pay for it. Little did he know that joining the Army was going to change his life forever. Especially when he was introduced to a Drill Sergeant who was nicknamed 'Big Daddy'. Phillip Grabowski had joined the Army to follow in his father's footsteps; by the time Ryan entered, he had already made a name for himself. He was a soldier's soldier, but Ryan was making it really hard for him to remember that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;69,653 words.</description>

  <description>Book one in the G-A-Y Series Find a gay man in a gay bar. Matt's sure that should be a lot easier than it actually is. Matt's having a run of bad luck - one that's lasted ever since he stepped out of the closet. An uncanny ability to home in on the only straight guy in a bar room full of gay men really isn't doing his sex life any favours. A knack for picking complete jerks whenever he does stumble upon a genuinely gay man isn't helping either. But, this time everything is going to be different. This time Matt's absolutely sure his gaydar has guided him towards a completely sane, entirely gay man - which is why he's arranged to meet him in the gents' room in five minutes. What could possibly go wrong?</description>

I think for many readers, it is one of their intro books into the genre of M/M romance and I can see why that is. It is angsty yet easy to relate to, an...]]>

  <description>This is the exuberant memoir of a man named James who became a woman named Jenny. A Colby College professor and author of four books of fiction, Boylan has a good comic ear, and that humor keeps the book on track.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE YOUNGEST OF SIX&lt;/strong&gt; daughters raised by a widowed mother, Meena is a young woman struggling to find her place in the world. Originally from India, her family still holds on to many old-world customs and traditions that seem stifling to a young North American woman. She knows that the freedom experienced by others is beyond her reach. But unlike her older sisters, Meena refuses to accept a life dictated by tradition. Against her mother’s wishes, she falls for a young man named Liam who asks her to run away with him. Meena must then make a painful choice—one that will lead to stunning and irrevocable consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Heartbreaking and beautiful, &lt;em&gt;Everything Was Good-bye&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable story about family, love, and loss, and the struggle to live in two different cultural worlds.</description>

  <description>Reid Alexander is used to getting what he wants – and what he wants next is his newest costar, Emma Pierce. The universe is lining up nicely to grant his wish, until he’s confronted with two unexpected obstacles on location: a bitter ex-girlfriend and a rival for Emma’s affections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma Pierce just got her big break after years of filming commercials and made-for-TV movies. Winning the lead role in a wide-release film – opposite the very hot Reid Alexander – should be a dream come true. But Emma’s heart is hiding a secret fantasy: she wants to be a normal girl.</description>

  <description>Cameron Jacobs is an open book. He considers himself a common waiter with normal friends, boring hobbies, harmless dogs, and nothing even resembling a secret... except a crush on a tall, dark, devastatingly handsome man who dines alone at his restaurant on Tuesday nights. All it takes is one passionate night with Julian Cross to turn Cameron’s world on its head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julian's love and devotion are all Cameron could have hoped for and more. But when his ordinary life meets and clashes with Julian's extraordinary lifestyle, Cameron discovers that trust and fear can go hand in hand, and love is just a step away from danger.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THERON - Dark haired, duty bound and deceptively deadly. He's the leader of the Argonauts, an elite group of guardians that defends the immortal realm from threats of the Underworld.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment he walked into the club, Casey knew this guy was different. Men like that just didn't exist in real life--silky shoulder-length hair, chest impossibly broad, and a predatory manner that just screamed dark and dangerous. He was looking for something. Her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was the one. She had the mark. Casey had to die so his kind could live, and it was Theron's duty to bring her in. But even as a 200-year-old descendant of Hercules, he wasn't strong enough to resist the pull in her fathomless eyes, to tear himself away from the heat of her body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As war with the Underworld nears, someone will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>Krista Owens is an attorney who works too much and plays too little. When her colleague, Mikaela, requests her assistance for a month on the Woods estate, hinting that her brothers-in-law are all hot with commitment phobias, Krista agrees to tell the guys she has a boyfriend, hoping to finally lose her virginity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toby Woods doesn’t want anything to do with Krista, but watching his brothers fight over her ignites his feral side. He wants her, and he’ll stop at nothing to have her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows it’s temporary, but will he be able to let her go when it’s time?</description>

      <![CDATA[This was a pretty good follow up for Surrounded by Woods. Again, a nice romantic, hot story. However, like the first, it lacked development in the plot. I felt the chemistry between the characters but it left me wanting more. Still a nice read though!]]>

  <description>When Mikaela Patterson must take on a client with specific requirements that no single women be allowed on his property, she keeps her broken engagement a secret. She doesn’t realize her client and his sons are mountain lion shifters whose instinct to mate with any available woman turns deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh Woods is her client's eldest son, and he is immediately drawn to Mikaela. Knowing his father would never allow an available woman on the property, Josh doesn't understand his fascination with her. Josh and Mikaela fight their attraction because of their own secrets, but when the truth comes out about Mikaela's true availability and Josh's animal instincts, they must be prepared to face the consequences.</description>

For what it was, I really liked it. However, on the negative side, it didn't have that much substance to it. It could have used 100 more pages to...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;LENGTH -- 9 hrs and 46 mins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eve Dallas is a New York police lieutenant hunting for a ruthless killer. In over 10 years on the force, she's seen it all - and knows that her survival depends on her instincts. And she's going against every warning telling her not to get involved with Roarke, an Irish billionaire - and suspect in Eve's murder investigation. But passion and seduction have rules of their own, and it's up to Eve to take a chance in the arms of a man she knows nothing about - except the addictive hunger of needing his touch.</description>

  <description>Enter a world of fierce wolves, stunning magic and romance...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s bad enough feeling different among the human crowd, but feeling different among wolves? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one said returning to her pack would be easy, especially after ten years without them, but seventeen year old Caia Ribeiro is unprepared for the realities of the transition. Raised in a world where kids aren’t scared by bedtime tales of the bogeyman but by the real life threat of enemy supernaturals who might come creeping into their community to kill them in their sleep, Caia is used to the darkness; she’s used to the mystery and the intrigue of the ancient underworld war she’s bound to by chance of birth. What she’s having trouble with are pack members treating her with wary suspicion, the Elders tucking secrets behind their backs out of her sightline, and her young Alpha, Lucien, distracting her, with a dangerous attraction, from her decision to uncover the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the saying goes ‘the truth will out’ and when it does, Caia will only have so long to prepare herself before the war comes pounding on their door threatening to destroy the safe, secret lives of the wolves… and the girl they protect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YA Paranormal Romance recommended for ages 16 and up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moon Spell the Second Edition: Revised and Re-edited. Published 10th October 2011.

  <description>"Coming home from work to find my boyfriend banging our hairy, married landlord - in our bed - was bad enough. Discovering Jamie had also cleaned out my bank accounts made it officially the worst day of my life. I think I can be forgiven for wanting revenge, even if a few little laws (and possibly Jamie's nose) got bent in the process.&lt;br&gt;"Fortunately, the law is on my side in the form of my oldest friend, Tony Gervase. I've tried to deny my attraction to the sexy trooper for years. After all, he made it clear long ago that he wasn't interested in me that way. But if the hot encounter in his kitchen is any indication, he is now. At least the day is ending a whole lot better than it began....&lt;br&gt;"But the morning after, the Jamie situation goes from bad to seriously messed up. The jerk's in more trouble than I could have imagined. And as it turns out, I don't know Tony as well as I thought I did, either."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2012 L.B.

      <![CDATA[**3.5 stars**<br /><br />I think I would have liked this better on my Kindle and rated it a solid 4 stars instead of 3.5 stars. This was my first audiobook and I'm not completely sold on it. Most of my friends loved this narration. I think the narrator did a great job except for the voice of Tony, which kiii...]]>

  <description>When the Mayflower set sail in 1620, it carried on board the men and women who would shape America: Miles Standish; John Alden; Constance Hopkins. But some among the Pilgrims were not pure of heart; they were not escaping religious persecution. Indeed, they were not even human. They were vampires.The vampires assimilated quickly into the New World. Rising to levels of enormous power, wealth, and influence, they were the celebrated blue bloods of American society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Blue Bloods&lt;/em&gt; vowed that their immortal status would remain a closely guarded secret. And they kept that secret for centuries. But now, in New York City, the secret is seeping out. Schuyler Van Alen is a sophomore at a prestigious private school. She prefers baggy, vintage clothes instead of the Prada and pearls worn by her classmates, and she lives with her reclusive grandmother in a dilapated mansion. Schuyler is a loner...and happy that way. Suddenly, when she turns fifteen, there is a visible mosaic of blue veins on her arm. She starts to crave raw food and she is having flashbacks to ancient times. Then a popular girl from her school is found dead... drained of all her blood. Schuyler doesn't know what to think, but she wants to find out the secrets the Blue Bloods are keeping.  But is she herself in danger?</description>

  <description>This is the story of how a haughty former sorority girl went from having a household income of almost a quarter-million dollars to being evicted from a ghetto apartment... It's a modern Greek tragedy, as defined by Roger Dunkle in &lt;em&gt;The Classical Origins of Western Culture&lt;/em&gt;: a story in which "the central character, called a tragic protagonist or hero, suffers some serious misfortune which is not accidental and therefore meaningless, but is significant in that the misfortune is logically connected."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words? The bitch had it coming.</description>

  <description>If your inner wolf and your body react rather enthusiastically to a psychotic Alpha male who’s own wolf has a tendency to turn feral, it can’t be a good thing, can it? Entering into a bargain with him wouldn’t be good either. Unfortunately, Taryn Warner, a latent wolf shifter, doesn’t have many options open to her right now. Okay, she has no options. Basically it comes down to whether she’ll do what it takes to escape the arranged mating with the sick SOB that her father set up. As the answer in this case is yes, it looks as though she’ll have to agree to Trey Coleman’s deal…she’ll have to mate with him instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having always disliked shifter politics, Trey Coleman hadn’t bothered trying to form alliances with other packs. Now that his uncle – a wolf with many alliances – means to take Trey’s territory and his pack, he has no option but to form some alliances of his own very quickly or he’ll be easily outnumbered in the upcoming battle. He figures that the easiest way to do that would be to mate with a female whose Alpha is powerful and influential. There’s only one problem with that – he would then be stuck with her, and the last thing Trey wants is a mate. When he hears of Taryn’s situation, he offers her a deal – if she falsely claims he’s her true mate and allows him to claim her, he’ll save her from her arranged mating and then let her leave after the battle with his uncle is over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds like a pretty straightforward deal...but soon Taryn and Trey realize they got more than they bargained for. Their mating instincts to protect and possess are weighing on them, they crave each other’s touch and company, and their inner wolves don’t like it whenever they’re apart. Add in that they’ll have to deal with this for an entire three months until the day of the battle finally arrives, and they’ve got themselves a recipe for disaster – or maybe for something quite the opposite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: This novel contains an extremely sarcastic Alpha female, a broody possessive Alpha male, bitter in-laws, voyeuristic enforcers, a whole lot of dirty talk, and steamy bedroom battles for dominance. &lt;strong&gt;Reader Advisory:&lt;/strong&gt; This book also contains a graphic ménage scene - not for the faint-hearted.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A timeless tale from the first name in romantic comedy - Jennifer Crusie!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBJECTIVE: Find Man&lt;br&gt;Must be Rich, Handsome, and Successful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate Svenson is attractive, successful, a brilliant businesswoman - and miserable.  After three failed engagements, she realises it's time for a &lt;strong&gt;PLAN&lt;/strong&gt;...and organised, detailed agenda with a clear goal: finding &lt;strong&gt;Mr. Right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cabins resort is ripe with eligible bachelors, all rich, distinguished and ambitious - just her type.  And they're dropping like flies around her...at least, that's how Jake Templeton views the situation.  After he's stuck pulling her latest reject out of the swimming pool, Jake's convinced this femme fatale is trouble.  Especially for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can a man who's sworn off ambition for good and a woman hanging from the top of the corporate ladder find common ground in the unpredictable territory called the heart, where the word &lt;em&gt;proposal&lt;/em&gt; takes on a very different meaning...?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Take one food writer named Cranky Agnes, add a hitman named Shane, mix them together with a Southern mob wedding, a missing necklace, two annoyed flamingos, and a dog named Rhett and you've got a recipe for a sexy, hilarious novel about the disastrous side of true love…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agnes Crandall's life goes awry when a dognapper invades her kitchen one night, seriously hampering her attempts to put on a wedding that she's staked her entire net worth on.  Then a hero climbs through her bedroom window.  His name is Shane, no last name, just Shane, and he has his own problems:  he's got a big hit scheduled, a rival trying to take him out, and an ex-mobster uncle asking him to protect some little kid named Agnes.  When he finds out that Agnes isn't so little, his uncle has forgotten to mention a missing five million bucks he might have lost in Agnes's house, and his last hit was a miss, Shane's life isn't looking so good, either.  Then a bunch of lowlifes come looking for the money, a string of hit men show up for Agnes, and some wedding guests gather with intent to throw more than rice.  Agnes and Shane have their hands full with greed, florists, treachery, flamingos, mayhem, mothers of the bride, and--most dangerous of all--each other.  &lt;em&gt;Agnes and the Hitman&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect combination of sugar and spice, sweet and salty--a novel of delicious proportions.</description>

  <description>Sophie Dempsey is content living a quiet life filming wedding videos until an assignment brings her to Temptation, Ohio. From the moment she drive into town, she gets a bad feeling; Sophie is from the wrong side of the tracks and everything in Temptation is a little too right. And when she has a run-in with the town's unnervingly sexy mayor, Phineas Tucker, making a little movie turns out to be more than a little dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yield to oncoming desire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Sophie wants to do is film the video and head home. All Phin wants to do is play pool with the police chief and keep things peaceful. They both get more than they bargained for when Sophie's video causes an uproar and the proper citizens of Temptation set out to shut them down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to temptation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As events spiral out of control, Sophie and Phin find themselves caught in a web of gossip, blackmail, adultery, murder, and really excellent sex. All hell breaks loose in Temptation as Sophie and Phin fall deeper and deeper in trouble...and in love.</description>

  <description>According to The Waiter, eighty percent of customers are nice people just looking for something to eat. The remaining twenty percent, however, are socially maladjusted psychopaths. Waiter Rant offers the server's unique point of view, replete with tales of customer stupidity, arrogant misbehavior, and unseen bits of human grace transpiring in the most unlikely places. Through outrageous stories, The Waiter reveals the secrets to getting good service, proper tipping etiquette, and how to keep him from spitting in your food. The Waiter also shares his ongoing struggle, at age thirty-eight, to figure out if he can finally leave the first job at which he's truly thrived.</description>

  <description>It's 1990. Apartheid is crumbling. Nelson Mandela has just been released from prison. And Spud Milton - thirteen-year-old, prepubescent choirboy extraordinaire - is about to start his first year at an elite boys-only boarding school in South Africa. Cursed with embarrassingly dysfunctional parents, a senile granny named Wombat, and a wild obsession for Julia Roberts, Spud has his hands full trying to adapt to his new home.&lt;br&gt;Armed with only his wits and his diary, Spud takes readers of all ages on a rowdy boarding school romp full of illegal midnight swims, raging hormones, and catastrophic holidays that will leave the entire family in total hysterics and thirsty for more.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was free on my Kindle. I liked it, I read it pretty consistently since I started it, but it never really grabbed me. I found the relationship between Cayne and Sam to be weirdly introduced, rushed, and poorly explained. The premise was nice, it was an interesting story, but I don't thin...]]>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Something Borrowed,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Something Blue,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Baby Proof&lt;/em&gt; delivers another captivating novel about women and the choices that define them. This is the story for anyone who has ever wondered: How can I truly love the one I'm with when I can't forget the one who got away?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellen and Andy's first year of marriage doesn't just seem perfect, it is perfect. There is no question how deep their devotion is, and how naturally they bring out the best in each other. But one fateful afternoon, Ellen runs into Leo for the first time in eight years. Leo, the one who brought out the worst in her. Leo, the one who left her heartbroken with no explanation. Leo, the one she could never quite forget. When his reappearance ignites long-dormant emotions, Ellen begins to question whether the life she's living is the one she's meant to live. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love the One You're With&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful story about one woman at the crossroads of true love and real life.</description>

  <description>From the author of the smash hits &lt;em&gt;Something Borrowed&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Something Blue&lt;/em&gt; comes a novel that explores the question: is there ever a deal-breaker when it comes to true love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes . . . a baby carriage? Isn't that what all women want?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not so for Claudia Parr. And just as she gives up on finding a man who feels the same way, she meets warm, wonderful Ben. Things seem too good to be true when they fall in love and agree to buck tradition with a satisfying, child-free marriage. Then the unexpected occurs: one of them has a change of heart. One of them wants children after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the witty, heartfelt story about what happens to the perfect couple when they suddenly want different things. It's about feeling that your life is set and then realizing that nothing is as you thought it was--and that there is no possible compromise. It's about deciding what is most important in life, and taking chances to get it. But most of all, it's about the things we will do--and won't do--for love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nominated for QPB's 2010 New Voices Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longlisted for 2011 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of Bees and Mist&lt;/em&gt; is an engrossing fable that chronicles three generations of women under one family tree and places them in a mythical town where spirits and spells, witchcraft and demons, and prophets and clairvoyance are an everyday reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meridia grows up in a lonely home until she falls in love with Daniel at age sixteen. Soon, they marry, and Meridia can finally escape to live with her charming husband’s family—unaware that they harbor dark mysteries of their own. As Meridia struggles to embrace her life as a young bride, she discovers long-kept secrets about her own past as well as shocking truths about her new family that push her love, courage, and sanity to the brink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erick Setiawan’s astonishing debut is a richly atmospheric and tumultuous ride of hope and heartbreak that is altogether touching, truthful, and memorable.</description>

  <description>Nina Sheridan’s on a timeout adventure in the Colorado Mountains. She needs distance from her clueless fiancé, distance to decide whether she wants to spend the rest of her life with a man who doesn’t care enough to learn how she takes her coffee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arriving in a blinding snowstorm at the A-Frame she rented, she comes face to face with the most amazing man she’s ever seen. Minutes later, when he kicks her out of his house, she goes head to head with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond angry because she’s flown half a world away to start her timeout adventure, not to mention her sinuses hurt, she heads back down the mountain and ends up in a ditch. Unable to extricate herself, she gives up, hopes for rescue and falls asleep in the backseat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next morning she wakes up in the amazing man’s bed and she’s sick as a dog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holden Maxwell spends days nursing her back to health and then he spends the next two weeks trying to convince her to take her Colorado adventure further, in other words, make it permanent and take a gamble on him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nina has a tough time fighting her attraction to Max, especially when it seems all Max’s friends, her mother and stepdad and the whole town want them together and both she and Max get embroiled in the murder of Max’s ex-friend and the town of Gnaw Bone’s most detested resident – a man everyone has motive to kill, especially Max.</description>

  <description>Bestselling romance writer Hayden Lane has found her soul mate - or rather, created him: he's her latest fictional hero. And she's totally obsessed with him. Barely noticing when her real-life fiance breaks their engagement, she visits a psychic to learn more about &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; - and is told that in a past life Hayden was Lady de Grey, a promiscuous woman of Edwardian England. Hayden can't resist submitting to a hypnotist's magic. But the trick goes wrong, and instead of merely remembering her past as Lady de Grey, Hayden is &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; it. Now she will discover quite a different story about a woman history considered a trollop, a spectacular, brooding man, and the rapturous love that would be hers if she dared open her heart to the most mysterious adventure of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;No woman in the three-hundred-year history of the karyukai has ever come forward in public to tell her story -- until now.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; "Many say I was the best geisha of my generation," writes Mineko Iwasaki. "And yet, it was a life that I found too constricting to continue. And one that I ultimately had to leave." Trained to become a geisha from the age of five, Iwasaki would live among the other "women of art" in Kyoto's Gion Kobu district and practice the ancient customs of Japanese entertainment. She was loved by kings, princes, military heroes, and wealthy statesmen alike. But even though she became one of the most prized geishas in Japan's history, Iwasaki wanted more: her own life. And by the time she retired at age twenty-nine, Iwasaki was finally on her way toward a new beginning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geisha, a Life&lt;/em&gt; is her story -- at times heartbreaking, always awe-inspiring, and totally true.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Wanted:&lt;br&gt;One young woman to take care of four-year-old boy.&lt;br&gt;Must be cheerful, enthusiastic and selfless-bordering on masochistic&lt;br&gt;Must relish sixteen-hour shifts with a deliberately nap-deprived pre-schooler&lt;br&gt;Must love getting thrown up on, literally and figuratively, by everyone in his family&lt;br&gt;Must enjoy the delicious anticipation of ridiculously erratic pay&lt;br&gt;Mostly, must love being treated like fungus found growing out of employers Hermes bag. &lt;br&gt;Those who take it personally need not apply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who wouldn't want this job?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling to graduate from NYU and afford her microscopic studio apartment, Nanny takes a position caring for the only son of the wealthy X family. She rapidly learns the insane amount of juggling involved to ensure that a Park Avenue wife who doesn't work, cook, clean, or raise her own child has a smooth day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Xs marriage begins to disintegrate, Nanny ends up involved way beyond the bounds of human decency or good taste. Her tenure with the X family becomes a nearly impossible mission to maintain the mental health of their four-year-old, her own integrity and, most importantly, her sense of humor. Over nine tense months Mrs. X and Nanny perform the age-old dance of decorum and power as they test the limits of modern-day servitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nanny Diaries&lt;/em&gt; deftly skewers the manner in which America's over-privileged raise les petites over-privileged-as if grooming them for a Best in Show competition. Written by two former nannies, this alternately comic and poignant satire punctures the glamour of Manhattan's upper class.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>Rose is a thirty-year-old attorney with a secret passion for romance novels. She's going to start exercising next week, and she dreams of a man who will slide off her glasses and tell her she's beautiful. Maggie is twenty-eight and drop-dead gorgeous. Although her stardom hasn't progressed past her hip's appearance in a music video, she dreams of fame and fortune. These two sisters claim to have nothing in common but DNA, a childhood tragedy, and a shoe size, but when they're forced into cohabitation, they may just learn that they're more alike than they thought.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;What's an American girl with a big mouth, but an equally big heart, to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzie Nichols has a problem, and it isn't that she doesn't have the slightest idea what she's going to do with her life, or that she's blowing what should be her down payment on a cute little Manhattan apartment on a trip to London to visit her long-distance boyfriend, Andrew. But what's the point of planning for the future when she's done it again? See, Lizzie can't keep her mouth shut. And it's not just that she can't keep her own secrets, she can't keep &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time when she opens her big mouth, her good intentions get Andrew in major hot water. So now Lizzie's stuck in London with no boyfriend and no place to stay until the departure date written on her non-refundable airline ticket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's Shari, Lizzie's best friend and college roommate, who's spending her summer in southern France, catering weddings with her boyfriend, Chaz, in a sixteenth-century château. One call and Lizzie's on a train to Souillac. Who cares if she's never traveled alone in her life and only speaks rudimentary French? One glimpse of gorgeous Château Mirac - not to mention gorgeous Luke, the son of Château Mirac's owner - and she's smitten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while most caterers can be trusted to keep a secret, Lizzie's the exception. And no sooner has the first cork been popped than Luke hates her, the bride is in tears, and it looks like Château Mirac is in danger of becoming a lipo-recovery spa. As if things aren't bad enough, her ex-boyfriend Andrew shows up looking for "closure" (or at least a loan), threatening to ruin everything, especially Lizzie's chance at ever finding real love...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless she can figure out a way to use that big mouth of hers to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Darkly funny and gleefully mean-spirited, &lt;em&gt;Sellevision &lt;/em&gt;explores greed, obsession and third tier celebrity, in the world of a fictional home shopping network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the troubled world of Sellevision, America's premier retail broadcasting network. When Max Andrews, the much-loved and handsome (lonely and gay) host of "Slumber Sunday Sundown" accidentally exposes himself in front of twenty million kids and their parents during a "Toys for Tots" segment, Sellevision faces its first big scandal. As Max fails to find a job in television, another host, the popular and perky Peggy Jean Smythe is receiving sinister emails about her appearance from a stalker. Popping pills and drinking heavily, she fails to notice that her husband is spending a lot of time with the very young babysitter who lives next door. Then there's Leigh, whose affair with Sellevision boss Howard Toast is going nowhere, until she exposes him on air; and Bebe, Sellevision's star host, who finds Mr. Right through the Internet--if she can just stop her shopping addiction from taking over.</description>

  <description>From the #1 bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Running with Scissors &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dry&lt;/em&gt;--a contagiously funny, heartwarming, shocking, twisted, and absolutely magical collection. True stories that give voice to the thoughts we all have but dare not mention. It begins with a Tang Instant Breakfast Drink television commercial when Augusten was seven. Then there is the contest of wills with the deranged cleaning lady. The execution of a rodent carried out with military precision and utter horror. Telemarketing revenge. Dating an undertaker and much more. A collection of true stories that are universal in their appeal yet unabashedly intimate and very funny.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The true story of a boy whose mother (a poet with delusions of Anne Sexton) gave him away to be raised by her unorthodox psychiatrist who bore a striking resemblance to Santa Claus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So at the age of twelve, Burroughs found himself amidst Victorian squalor living with the doctor's bizarre family, and befriending a paedophile who resided in the backyard shed. The story of an outlaw childhood where rules were unheard of, and the Christmas tree stayed up all year round, where Valium was consumed like candy, and if things got dull an electroshock-therapy machine could provide entertainment. The funny, harrowing and bestselling account of an ordinary boy's survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.</description>

  <description>In this raucous collection of true-life stories, actress and comedian Chelsea Handler recounts her time spent in the social trenches with that wild, strange, irresistible, and often gratifying beast: the one-night stand. &lt;br&gt;You've either done it or know someone who has: the one-night stand, the familiar outcome of a night spent at a bar, sometimes the sole payoff for your friend's irritating wedding, or the only relief from a disastrous vacation. Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool. &lt;br&gt;Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details. My Horizontal Life is one guilty pleasure you won't be ashamed to talk about in the morning.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>David Sedaris's fourth book mines poignant comedy from his peculiar childhood in North Carolina, his bizarre career path, and his move with his lover to France. Though his anarchic inclination to digress is his glory, Sedaris does have a theme in these reminiscences: the inability of humans to communicate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title is his rendition in transliterated English of how he and his fellow students of French in Paris mangle the Gallic language. In the essay "Jesus Shaves," he and his classmates from many nations try to convey the concept of Easter to a Moroccan Muslim. "It is a party for the little boy of God," says one. "Then he be die one day on two... morsels of... lumber," says another. Sedaris muses on the disputes between his Protestant mother and his father, a Greek Orthodox guy whose Easter fell on a different day. Other essays explicate his deep kinship with his eccentric mom and absurd alienation from his IBM-exec dad: "To me, the greatest mystery of science continues to be that a man could father six children who shared absolutely none of his interests."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every glimpse we get of Sedaris's family and acquaintances delivers laughs and insights. He thwarts his North Carolina speech therapist ("for whom the word &lt;em&gt;pen&lt;/em&gt; had two syllables") by cleverly avoiding all words with &lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; sounds, which reveal the lisp she sought to correct. His midget guitar teacher, Mister Mancini, is unaware that Sedaris doesn't share his obsession with breasts, and sings "Light My Fire" all wrong--"as if he were a Webelo scout demanding a match." As a remarkably unqualified teacher at the Art Institute of Chicago, Sedaris had his class watch soap operas and assign "guessays" on what would happen in the next day's episode. &lt;p&gt;  It all adds up to the most distinctively skewed autobiography since Spalding Gray's &lt;em&gt;Swimming to Cambodia&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;--Tim Appelo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the hilarious, strange, elegiac, outrageous world of David Sedaris. In Naked, Sedaris turns the mania for memoir on its ear, mining the exceedingly rich terrain of his life, his family, and his unique worldview-a sensibility at once take-no-prisoners sharp and deeply charitable. A tart-tongued mother does dead-on imitations of her young son's nervous tics, to the great amusement of his teachers; a stint of Kerouackian wandering is undertaken (of course!) with a quadriplegic companion; a family gathers for a wedding in the face of imminent death. Through it all is Sedaris's unmistakable voice, without doubt one of the freshest in American writing.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did You Know?-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Landon is the name of his third son?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Nicholas Sparks recorded his own reading for the audio version of the novel?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“I’ve had a most amazing time....”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins the Time Traveller’s astonishing firsthand account of his journey 800,000 years beyond his own era—and the story that launched H.G. Wells’s successful career and earned him the reputation as the father of science fiction. With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century. Thanks to Wells’s expert storytelling and provocative insight, &lt;strong&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/strong&gt; will continue to enthrall readers for generations to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>When Siddalee Walker, oldest daughter of Vivi Abbott Walker, Ya-Ya extraordinaire, is interviewed in the New York Times about a hit play she's directed, her mother gets described as a "tap-dancing child abuser." Enraged, Vivi disowns Sidda. Devastated, Sidda begs forgiveness, and postpones her upcoming wedding. All looks bleak until the Ya-Yas step in and convince Vivi to send Sidda a scrapbook of their girlhood mementos, called "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood." As Sidda struggles to analyze her mother, she comes face to face with the tangled beauty of imperfect love, and the fact that forgiveness, more than understanding, is often what the heart longs for.</description>

  <description>Jhumpa Lahiri's &lt;em&gt;Interpreter of Maladies&lt;/em&gt; established this young writer as one the most brilliant of her generation. Her stories are one of the very few debut works -- and only a handful of collections -- to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Among the many other awards and honors it received were the New Yorker Debut of the Year award, the PEN/Hemingway Award, and the highest critical praise for its grace, acuity, and compassion in detailing lives transported from India to America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Namesake&lt;/em&gt;, Lahiri enriches the themes that made her collection an international bestseller: the immigrant experience, the clash of cultures, the conflicts of assimilation, and, most poignantly, the tangled ties between generations. Here again Lahiri displays her deft touch for the perfect detail — the fleeting moment, the turn of phrase — that opens whole worlds of emotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Namesake&lt;/em&gt; takes the Ganguli family from their tradition-bound life in Calcutta through their fraught transformation into Americans. On the heels of their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. An engineer by training, Ashoke adapts far less warily than his wife, who resists all things American and pines for her family. When their son is born, the task of naming him betrays the vexed results of bringing old ways to the new world. Named for a Russian writer by his Indian parents in memory of a catastrophe years before, Gogol Ganguli knows only that he suffers the burden of his heritage as well as his odd, antic name. Lahiri brings great empathy to Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path, strewn with conflicting loyalties, comic detours, and wrenching love affairs. With penetrating insight, she reveals not only the defining power of the names and expectations bestowed upon us by our parents, but also the means by which we slowly, sometimes painfully, come to define ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; has praised Lahiri as "a writer of uncommon elegance and poise." &lt;em&gt;The Namesake&lt;/em&gt; is a fine-tuned, intimate, and deeply felt novel of identity.</description>

  <description>For Kate Klein, a semi-accidental mother of three, suburbia has been full of unpleasant surprises. Her once-loving husband is hardly ever home. The supermommies on the playground routinely snub her. Her days are spent carpooling and enduring endless games of Candy Land, and at night, most of her orgasms are of the do-it-yourself variety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When a fellow mother is murdered, Kate finds that the unsolved mystery is the most exciting thing to happen in Upchurch, Connecticut, since her neighbors broke ground for a guesthouse and cracked their septic tank. Even though the local police chief warns her that crime-fighting's a job best left to the professionals, Kate launches an unofficial investigation -- from 8:45 to 11:30 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, when her kids are in nursery school. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As Kate is drawn deeper into the murdered woman's past, she begins to uncover the secrets and lies behind Upchurch's picket-fence facade -- and considers the choices and compromises all modern women make as they navigate between marriage and independence, small towns and big cities, being a mother and having a life of one's own.</description>

  <description>MEET BECKY BLOOMWOOD, AN IRRESISTIBLE HEROINE WITH A BIG HEART, BIG DREAMS --- AND JUST ONE LITTLE WEAKNESS ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becky Bloomwood has what most twenty-five-year-olds only dream of: a flat in London's trendiest neighborhood, a troupe of glamorous socialite friends, and a closet brimming with the season's must-haves. The only trouble is, she can't actually afford it --- not any of it. Her job writing at &lt;em&gt;Successful Saving&lt;/em&gt; magazine not only bores her to tears, it doesn't pay much at all. Still, how can she resist that perfect pair of shoes? Or the divine silk blouse in the window of that ultra-trendy boutique? But lately Becky's been chased by dismal letters from Visa and the Endwich Bank --- letters with large red sums she can't bear to read --- and they're getting ever harder to ignore. She tries cutting back; she even tries making &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money. But none of her efforts succeeds. Her only consolation is to buy herself something ... just a little something ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, a story arises that Becky actually &lt;em&gt;cares&lt;/em&gt; about, and her front-page article catalyzes a chain of events that will transform her life --- and the lives of those around her --- forever.</description>

  <description>Daunted by the singular tastes and dark secrets of the beautiful, tormented young entrepreneur Christian Grey, Anastasia Steele has broken off their relationship to start a new career with a Seattle publishing house. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, Anastasia cannot resist. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and Anastasia learns more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven and demanding Fifty Shades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront the anger and envy of the women who came before her, and make the most important decision of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.</description>

To save me, Ethan Sullivan converted me. The Lord of the Hyde Park manor is tall, green-eyed, full of four centuries worth of charm. Suddenly I am handy with serious weaponry, and pursued by an unknown enemy.</description>

  <description>The birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth birthday. But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years -- except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work "reminiscent of Vonnegut and Douglas Adams" (Philadelphia Inquirer).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more -- except maybe "Maggie," Mary of Magdala -- and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.</description>

  <description>In this extraordinary coming-of-age odyssey, Wally Lamb invites us to hitch a wild ride on a journey of love, pain, and renewal with the most heartbreakingly comical heroine to come along in years. &lt;p&gt; Meet Dolores Price. She's 13, wise-mouthed but wounded, having bid her childhood goodbye. Stranded in front of her bedroom TV, she spends the next few years nourishing herself with the Mallomars, potato chips, and Pepsi her anxious mother supplies. When she finally orbits into young womanhood at 257 pounds, Dolores is no stronger and life is no kinder. But this time she's determined to rise to the occasion and give herself one more chance before she &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; goes under.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>William Golding's compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behaviour collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket and homework and adventure stories—and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible. &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/strong&gt; remains as provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's &lt;strong&gt;The Catcher in the Rye&lt;/strong&gt; in its influence on modern thought and literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, &lt;strong&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/strong&gt; has established itself as a true classic.</description>

  <description>Margaret Simon, almost twelve, has just moved from New York City to the suburbs, and she's anxious to fit in with her new friends. When she's asked to join a secret club she jumps at the chance. But when the girls start talking about boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret starts to wonder if she's normal. There are some things about growing up that are hard for her to talk about, even with her friends. Lucky for Margaret, she's got someone else to confide in... someone who always listens.</description>

  <description>It’s been ten years since Mitch Albom first shared the wisdom of Morrie Schwartz with the world. Now–twelve million copies later–in a new afterword, Mitch Albom reflects again on the meaning of Morrie’s life lessons and the gentle, irrevocable impact of their Tuesday sessions all those years ago. . . &lt;br&gt;_____&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final “class”: lessons in how to live.</description>

  <description>Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school... again. And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus' master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus' stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.</description>

  <description>Since his debut in 1951 as The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,&lt;br&gt;"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.</description>

  <description>In the novel, Siddhartha, a young man, leaves his family for a contemplative life, then, restless, discards it for one of the flesh. He conceives a son, but bored and sickened by lust and greed, moves on again. Near despair, Siddhartha comes to a river where he hears a unique sound. This sound signals the true beginning of his life -- the beginning of suffering, rejection, peace, and, finally, wisdom.</description>

  <description>This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world—and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators? Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor—and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life—from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy—to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction—to the philosopher who becomes a pirate—to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph—to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad—to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions. This is a mystery story, not about the murder of a man’s body, but about the murder—and rebirth—of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the first of your premises to check.</description>

I enjoy her character, but she simply doesn't hold my interest like Kate does. I'm riveted when I read all of the other...]]>

  <description>In her early thirties, Elizabeth Gilbert had everything a modern American woman was supposed to want--husband, country home, successful career--but instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she felt consumed by panic and confusion. This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and of what she found in their place. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.</description>

  <description>A delightfully dishy novel about the all-time most impossible boss in the history of impossible bosses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrea Sachs, a small-town girl fresh out of college, lands the job “a million girls would die for.” Hired as the assistant to Miranda Priestly, the high-profile, fabulously successful editor of "Runway "magazine, Andrea finds herself in an office that shouts "Prada! Armani! Versace!" at every turn, a world populated by impossibly thin, heart-wrenchingly stylish women and beautiful men clad in fine-ribbed turtlenecks and tight leather pants that show off their lifelong dedication to the gym. With breathtaking ease, Miranda can turn each and every one of these hip sophisticates into a scared, whimpering child. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA gives a rich and hilarious new meaning to complaints about “The Boss from Hell.” Narrated in Andrea’s smart, refreshingly disarming voice, it traces a deep, dark, devilish view of life at the top only hinted at in gossip columns and over Cosmopolitans at the trendiest cocktail parties. From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone. She puts up with it all by keeping her eyes on the prize: a recommendation from Miranda that will get Andrea a top job at any magazine of her choosing. As things escalate from the merely unacceptable to the downright outrageous, however, Andrea begins to realize that the job a million girls would die for may just kill her. And even if she survives, she has to decide whether or not the job is worth the price of her soul.</description>

  <description>When world-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a mysterious symbol—seared into the chest of a murdered physicist—he discovers evidence of the unimaginable: the resurgence of an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati ... the most powerful underground organization ever to walk the earth. The Illuminati has now surfaced to carry out the final phase of its legendary vendetta against its most hated enemy—the Catholic Church. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Langdon’s worst fears are confirmed on the eve of the holy conclave, when a messenger of the Illuminati announces they have hidden an unstoppable time bomb at the very heart of Vatican City. With the countdown under way, Langdon jets to Rome to join forces with Vittoria Vetra, a beautiful and mysterious Italian scientist, to assist the Vatican in a desperate bid for survival. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Embarking on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and even the most secretive vault on earth, Langdon and Vetra follow a 400-year-old trail of ancient symbols that snakes across Rome toward the long-forgotten Illuminati lair ... a clandestine location that contains the only hope for Vatican salvation.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;This richly imagined novel, set in Hawai'i more than a century ago, is an extraordinary epic of a little-known time and place---and a deeply moving testament to the resiliency of the human spirit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Rachel Kalama, a spirited seven-year-old Hawaiian girl, dreams of visiting far-off lands like her father, a merchant seaman. Then one day a rose-colored mark appears on her skin, and those dreams are stolen from her. Taken from her home and family, Rachel is sent to Kalaupapa, the quarantined leprosy settlement on the island of Moloka'i. Here her life is supposed to end---but instead she discovers it is only just beginning. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;With a vibrant cast of vividly realized characters, &lt;em&gt;Moloka'i&lt;/em&gt; is the true-to-life chronicle of a people who embraced life in the face of death. Such is the warmth, humor, and compassion of this novel that "few readers will remain unchanged by Rachel's story" (mostlyfiction.com).&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;--New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller--&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;What boundaries would you cross for true love?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the question a grieving mother must answer when she takes in a young street musician she believes can shed light on her daughter's death—only to find herself falling for him. A sexy but touching love story that will leave you both tantalized and in tears, Jane's Melody follows a forty-year-old woman on a romantic journey of rediscovery after years of struggling alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes our greatest gifts come from our greatest pain. And now Jane must decide if it's too late for her to start over, or if true love really knows no limits.</description>

  <description>The severe bullying he suffered as a teenager left Jack Flemming scarred both physically and emotionally. Now an adult, he has carved out a life for himself as co-owner of the Mechanic Shop. He enjoys his volunteer work with the throwaway boys and has a supportive best friend. When the past resurfaces in a phone call from Zachariah Durban, Jack discovers that while living is easy, forgiveness is much harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zachariah Durban did a bad thing when he was a young punk of a teenager. But right after he did it, he knew it wasn’t right. Still, he ran away and made something of himself as a big shot author. Now, living in the south of France with writer’s block hitting him hard, Zachariah knows something has to change—starting with earning Jack Flemming’s forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Graham and Jeremy's first meeting sparks an explosive and passionate relationship that proves opposites attract. However, as time wears on, their differences cause a lot of strain between them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy, a first grade teacher and softball coach, is deeply closeted and sees no way out of the darkness. Graham is out and proud and doesn’t understand Jeremy’s fear at revealing his sexuality. After four years of trying to balance the differences, Graham leaves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy is heartbroken, knowing that the love they feel is the real thing. He knows he’s the one who needs to change, but old habits are hard to break. He'll need support from friends and family to make things right with Graham, but most of all he'll need to find strength within himself to be honest about who he really is.</description>

      <![CDATA[**2.5 stars**<br /><br />Sometimes the Goodreads ratings are a tricky thing because, while 2.5 might look bad to some people, I'm really and truly saying that this book was somewhere between "It was okay" and "I liked it". It was pleasant enough and, though I had some issues with it, I think many readers wou...]]>

  <description>hompson and Caroline Gray were living their dream until Caroline's untimely death just two years after they’d bought the Thundercloud Marina. When Caroline died, she left Thompson alone and emotionally disconnected—until Thompson’s longtime friend and towboat owner Hank Charming tows Garner Holt, a recently retired psychiatrist, and his boat into the marina for repair. Thompson and Hank are both drawn to the sailboat captain, but for very different reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since high school, Hank has secretly carried a torch for Thompson, even though Thompson remained committed to Caroline, even after her death. Hank is totally caught off guard when his initial attraction to Garner makes him realize this stranger might be the one to help him move on with his life. Thompson establishes a platonic friendship with Garner and starts to see the psychiatrist as his only lifeline to sanity. Life improves until Thompson sees Hank and Garner together, and old feelings Thompson thought were long buried begin to resurface. Garner quickly identifies the unresolved feelings between Hank and Thompson and decides to tap his professional skills and work behind the scenes to help Thompson and Hank see what has been right in front of them all along.</description>

  <description>With the increasing commercialization of Valentine’s Day in the 1950s, the Pagan deities of Love, led by Eros, gather to make sure everything runs smoothly. Shy, quiet angel Shateiel offers help, and Eros is quite taken with the cute angel, though he keeps his lust to himself. When the higher-level angels discover Shateiel’s little rebellious streak and how he’s been spending his time, they intervene to keep him from falling from grace. Now, Eros may wish he’d admitted his feeling before it was too late.</description>

  <description>Elijah Wentworth works in a research lab, teaching sign language to an orange-loving chimp named Eddie. Eli enjoys his friends-with-benefits relationship with Casey, but being a believer in fate and true love, he’s unsure whether to settle or to hold out for something more. When Eddie starts signing poetry to Eli, Eli thinks Casey has trained the chimp to propose. It’s time to make a decision: marry fun but flaky Casey or wait for the soul mate who might be closer than he thinks.</description>

  <description>In the distant future, humans wage war against the alien planet Caeorleia, with no tactic off-limits if it will help the humans get their hands on Caeorleia’s resources. Ask Ryker. He thought he volunteered for a simple experiment that would help his government in the war. He didn't realize sadistic doctors would turn him into the experiment—by injecting him with blood from a captured Caeorleian, Seral Iorflas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor did Ryker realize he’d be sent to sabotage a planet full of the very beings his world is battling, beings who kill humans on sight. But then, thanks to the experiment that irrevocably changed him, he isn’t exactly human any longer—and with each passing day, as his blood bond with Seral strengthens, he’s less and less sure as to whose side he's on.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book will have wildly different ratings depending on the reader. Some people will love this one, unfortunately, I didn't. <br /><br />From the blurb, I anticipated a gritty alien-torture sci-fi with a slow-burn romance. That isn't what this book is like at all, so be forewarned. It is much more similar...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the New Adult debut from beloved contemporary romance author Ruthie Knox, writing under the pseudonym Robin York, a college student is attacked online and must restore her name—and stay clear of a guy who’s wrong for her, but feels so right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Caroline Piasecki’s ex-boyfriend posts their sex pictures on the Internet, it destroys her reputation as a nice college girl. Suddenly her once-promising future doesn’t look so bright. Caroline tries to make the pictures disappear, hoping time will bury her shame. Then a guy she barely knows rises to her defense and punches her ex to the ground.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; West Leavitt is the last person Caroline needs in her life. Everyone knows he’s shady. Still, Caroline is drawn to his confidence and swagger—even after promising her dad she’ll keep her distance. On late, sleepless nights, Caroline starts wandering into the bakery where West works.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; They hang out, they talk, they listen. Though Caroline and West tell each other they’re “just friends,” their feelings intensify until it becomes impossible to pretend. The more complicated her relationship with West gets, the harder Caroline has to struggle to discover what she wants for herself—and the easier it becomes to find the courage she needs to fight back against the people who would judge her.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; When all seems lost, sometimes the only place to go is deeper.</description>

  <description>When an unexpected package is delivered on December 14th, Martin is more than a little intrigued by the contents—especially as they're from his boyfriend, Dennis, and come with instructions to wear them when they go to dinner with Dennis' parents the following night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's only the beginning of Dennis' suggestive gifts.</description>

  <description>The Eskimos may have over a hundred words for snow, but that doesn’t even come close to how many words the English language has for “slut”—and Lindsey has been called them all. “Hussy” is Lindsey’s personal favorite, given to her by her own grandmother, who likes to pat her on the hand and whisper, “Don’t worry, dear—a hussy is just a woman with the morals of a man.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lindsey’s not ashamed of her reputation. She knows she’s earned it—and she’s proud of it. After all, you only live once, right? In fact, she goes out of her way to make it known to every guy she comes in contact with, she’s available for the taking—the rougher, the better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is until Lindsey meets Lieutenant Zachary Davis, a man who refuses to treat her like the trash she believes she really is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can Lindsey change her impulsive ways and learn to value herself the way the Zach does? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warnings: This title contains graphic language and extreme sexual situations as well as a girl with a slutty attitude bigger than Texas covering a haunted past, and a sweet, hot man in uniform dead set on rescuing her from herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note to Readers: This novel was previously released as “Falling Down.”</description>

      <![CDATA[**2.5 stars**<br /><br />I went on quite a journey with this book today.<br /><br />It is a sex-filled, crazy hot story but with a very dark undercurrent. It features abuse and some really intense situations, not for readers who shy away from stories about intense trauma. I was alternatively horrified and enticed by the...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two worlds. Two enemies. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Haunted by loss, Cascadian assassin Rickert D’Angelus is on a mission of vengeance. Determined to stop the Pacifican army from finding a portal to his world, he leads a group of warriors into New Seattle with one goal—to kill all Pacifican soldiers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neyla Trihorn had the perfect life until a deadly accident revealed her latent para-abilities. Now, the former fashion designer is the Pacifican army’s hottest commodity in their fight against the invaders. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When Rickert discovers a beautiful, unconscious soldier on a cold mountain ledge near the portal, he realizes she’s a Protection-Talent and cannot be killed. To prevent the army from using her skills again, he takes her as his prisoner instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One fated touch…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when he pulls her into his arms, a sexy and compelling vision appears, awakening something inside him. Something he can’t ignore.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Torn between duty and passion, Rickert must decide if the vision is a Talent trick designed to foil the enemy or the answer to his deepest desires...</description>

It is an alternate world sort of fantasy book, which is my cuppa, but the execution just wasn't there.  <br /><br />I'll start with the world-building.

  <description>There’s something different about Noah….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zack Parker met his best friend Noah at his lake cabin when they were only five years old. He realized he felt more than friendship for him by the time they were in junior high school. One fateful night when they were eighteen Zack couldn’t take it anymore. Fueled by love and lust and need, he finally kissed Noah like he’d wanted to for years…and Noah kissed him back, returning every drop of Zack’s passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next morning, Noah ended their friendship for what Zack believed was forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now twenty-one, Zack resents being dragged by his guilt-tripping mother every summer back to the lake cabin where every leaf and rock and turn in the road reminds him of Noah and the love he felt for him three long years before. He hates being reminded of what he lost and more than anything he wants his best friend back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this year things are different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah has returned, apologetic and more gorgeous than ever. Amazingly, he seems to want Zack as much as Zack wants him. He’s sweet and attentive, sexy enough to make Zack’s thighs quiver, but there’s something not quite right…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What secret is Noah hiding?</description>

  <description>Life is a chariot race for Marc Angelo and Tarquin Navona. Friends, rivals and rock stars of Circus Maximus in ancient Rome, they wow the fans with their daring driving and take their choice of lovers. A fine life indeed—if Marc weren’t harboring feelings for Tarquin. It’s difficult to behave normally when he craves physical contact with his friend’s muscular body, but Marc resists, too afraid of losing Tarquin entirely.&lt;br&gt;He needn’t have worried. Fate has plans for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very long-term plans…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a powerful sorcerer catches Marc and Tarquin with his wife, he curses them to imprisonment in stone. Centuries pass, and Marc’s love and lust for Tarquin only increase. His friend doesn’t have a clue, but that’s the least of their problems. They have no idea how to escape their predicament—and may be doomed to spend eternity Stoned.</description>

  <description>After fifteen years playing pro hockey, Aaron Buckley screws up, and his mistake and his attitude get him sent down to the minor leagues. His new team is in his old city, where he started his career in hockey, and also where he left his boyfriend behind. His luck hasn't improved since joining a team of rookies and kids, but he has discovered that Zach—the ex-boyfriend who could never compete with hockey for Aaron’s love—is still in town. Aaron has a second chance to answer the same question: Zach or hockey? But maybe it's time for a new question.</description>

  <description>Death is the family business, and Brendan Connolly is about to come into his legacy. Nobody warned Bren that Dad was a death god, or that someday he’d inherit his powers. So far, falling in love with the angel sent to protect him has been the only good thing to come out of this whole mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bren’s guardian angel, Lorygdarain, knows the aura of a ticking supernatural time bomb when he sees one. Add to that the angel’s first taste of the human emotion called love, and protecting Bren from the god who killed his father could be Dar’s hardest job in an eon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snakes, amnesia, and a mysterious god named Bob might not be much of a rescue plan, but one guardian angel can only do so much. With a veritable pantheon on his heels, and the universe hanging in the balance, Bren must learn to lock and load the most dangerous weapon of all: himself.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was a struggle for me. It was a struggle for me to get into it, it was a struggle for me to stick with it, and now it will be a struggle for me to review it. <br /><br />I was expecting to really like this book because I have heard nothing but great things about her "Infected" series.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;First rule in this line of business: don’t sleep with the client.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name’s Kate Kane, and when an eight-hundred-year-old vampire prince came to me with a case, I should have told her no. But I’ve always been a sucker for a femme fatale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It always goes the same way. You move too fast, you get in too deep, and before you know it, someone winds up dead. Last time it was my partner. This time it could be me. Yesterday a werewolf was murdered outside the Velvet, the night-time playground of one of the most powerful vampires in England. Now half the monsters in London are at each other’s throats, and the other half are trying to get in my pants. The Witch Queen will protect her own, the wolves are out for vengeance, and the vampires are out for, y’know, blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve got a killer on the loose, a war on the horizon, and a scotch on the rocks. It’s going to be an interesting day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This title is #1 of the Kate Kane, Paranormal Investigator series.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[**1.5 stars**<br /><br />I had a lot of issues with this book, which bums me out because I was actually excited to try a F/F. I'll try to list them all out for you guys but, honestly, this will probably be a quicky review because this book didn't inspire much emotion in me. <br /><br /><strong>1) It was boring.</strong> I'm sorry but it...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sparks fly between virgin teenage demon hunters when the Chosen One turns out to be the Chosen . . . Two?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apprentice warrior Blake St. Blake is the Chosen One, raised by an ancient order to defend the world against evil. Well, maybe not the whole world, but at least his neighborhood in downtown Detroit.  When a dreaded reflux demon is sighted in a local cemetery, Blake is sent off to his very first battle, armed with his sword, his super-senses, his black leather duster, and a few well-rehearsed one-liners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But another Chosen One gets in Blake’s way—an apprentice wizard named Shadow. While the boys argue about who’s the more chosen of the two, the demon escapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blake wants to be angry, but it turns out he and Shadow have a lot in common. Besides, Shadow’s pretty cute, and Blake can’t help but think that the wizard’s skills (and hands and lips and other bits) might make the perfect complement to his. Blake and Shadow are brave enough to challenge the reflux demon in a second battle, but will they have the courage to tell each other how they feel?</description>

  <description>Sophie Mercer thought she was a witch. That was the whole reason she was sent to Hex Hall, a reform school for delinquent Prodigium (a.k.a. witches, shape-shifters, and faeries). But then she discovered the family secret, and the fact that her hot crush, Archer Cross, is an agent for The Eye, a group bent on wiping Prodigium off the face of the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, Sophie's a demon, one of only two in the world-the other being her father. What's worse, she has powers that threaten the lives of everyone she loves. Which is precisely why Sophie decides she must go to London for the Removal, a dangerous procedure that will either destroy her powers for good-or kill her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once Sophie arrives, she makes a shocking discovery. Her new housemates? They're demons too. Meaning, someone is raising demons in secret, with creepy plans to use their powers, and probably not for good. Meanwhile, The Eye is set on hunting Sophie down, and they're using Archer to do it. But it's not like she has feelings for him anymore. Does she?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Note: Alternate/new cover edition for ASIN# B00CLY1H0A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning - This book is intended for mature audience. Excessive language and sexual situations may not be suitable for younger teens. This story also includes m/m romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keller Witmore is a bang ‘em and leave ‘em kind of guy. Seeing that he is an incubus, so you can hardly blame him. In all his seventeen years, he’s never had anyone, a mom nor a dad to show him what love means. No one except for Hudson, his best friend, his brother in every sense of the word except blood. Growing up in the boarding school for demon and angel Halves, he’s known no other life. But when a war brews and the campus is closed, he will find out a lot of things about himself, what he is, who he is and who he wants to become. When it’s all said and done, can he ever go back to the way things were?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hudson Yarde’s life revolves around being Keller’s wingman, it’s a full time job with both it’s perks and drawbacks. Drawn into the Keller’s antics since a young age, Hudson stays to protect Keller from himself. He stays to hide in his shadows, away from the spotlight. But most of all, he stays to keep his secret. For years he’s been waiting for his incubus nature to kick in but it hasn't happened yet. A chance meeting, the impending war and being freed from the judgment and rules, gives him the opportunity to be what he wants to be, himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together they leave for the human domain. Neither of them aware of the others secrets or of those around them. And for the first time, a gap could wedge between them, carved by the sharp knife of distrust. Lies of omission will draw a line between them at the dawn of the war over humanity.</description>

My track record with YA paranormals and M/M paranormals isn't stellar, so I was really hoping to find a book that changed that for me. <br /><br />This book started out very strong. I loved the world that these two authors created....]]>

  <description>One of the fiercest soldiers the Phrixians have ever produced, Maris Sulle has been an outsider the whole of his life. He grew up with a secret that cost him everything- His birthright, his family and his military career. In all his life, he’s only had one love and he has sacrificed his own happiness to see his best friend reunited with the woman he loves. But now that his good deed is done, he feels lost and adrift. Even though they do their best to include him in their new family, he’s once again on the outside looking in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ture has spent his life hiding from everyone around him while trying desperately to fit in. His family, the world, you name it. Badly hurt by everyone he’s ever known, he trusts no one except his own best friend. And honestly, he can’t understand why he trusts her. Nor can he believe her when she describes a loyalty between friends the likes of which he’s never seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when he is in his darkest hour, he’s saved by a hero he thought only existed in novels. A man who is every bit as scarred and mistrusting as he is. One who has no interest in being dragged into another relationship with anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having spent his life as a living study of doomed relationships, Maris is well aware of the courtship and fiasco that invariably follows. Still, there is something about Ture he can’t resist. Something that won’t let him walk away when he knows he should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when old enemies return to threaten them both, they either have to stand together or die alone.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm pissed about this book. Thoroughly pissed. <br /><br />I have a weakness for Sherrilyn Kenyon's book. They are kind of angsty, melodramatic guilty pleasures of mine, and I had yet to find a story of hers that didn't win me over in the end. It figures that her M/M story is the one to fail for me.

  <description>This book is related to &lt;strong&gt;The Sweetest Tattoo&lt;/strong&gt; but can be read as a stand alone title.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greyson Cole needs to get out of Raleigh. Everywhere he turns, he sees people falling in love, getting married, and starting families. It’s enough to make a grown man want to rip out his own hair. And for a cynic like Grey, one more employee getting engaged signals the need for a long overdue vacation. Grey owns a cabin in the mountains that he has never even used, and he figures that’s just the ticket out of this nightmare of happily paired up couples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grey doesn’t expect to be greeted by a belligerent, half-naked man the minute he opens his cabin door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sirus Wilder has known Grey’s twin sister for years, and she has given him permission to stay in the cabin while his residence across the lake is under repair. Sirus has never met Greyson Cole before, but he is thankful when the man lets him share the cabin for a few days. There is plenty enough room for them each to keep to themselves. Sirus has had his heart broken and isn’t interested in a hook-up, let alone something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even so, Grey is, hands-down, one of the sexiest men Sirus has ever seen. Too bad he’s an arrogant ass and his eyes are so damn cold. Every once in a while, though, Sirus thinks he sees a hint of fiery passion in the controlled man sleeping one room away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Grey, one look at the roughly handsome Sirus puts Grey’s celibacy pact in serious jeopardy. One problem: Grey doesn’t believe in love, has even less patience for relationships, and he refuses to get mixed up in another messy romantic partnership that can only end badly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two weeks. Two hard men. Both running like hell from love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look out. Something’s gotta give.</description>

  <description>Lanie Heron isn’t looking for love—no surprise, considering her last serious relationship nearly got her killed. So when Lanie propositions Hop Kincaid, all she wants is one wild night with the hot-as-hell biker who patrols with the Chaos Motorcycle Club...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Hop, Lanie has always been untouchable. She’s too polished and too classy for his tastes. But when she gives Hop the once-over with her bedroom eyes and offers him a night in paradise, he can’t say no. And he doesn’t regret it when he finds that Lanie is the best thing that’s ever happened to him—in or out of bed. Now the trick will be to convince her of that.</description>

  <description>Jude Deveraux, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of unforgettable romance, returns with a breathtaking first book in a fantastic new series—the Nantucket Brides trilogy. Set on the magical Massachusetts island, &lt;em&gt;True Love&lt;/em&gt; introduces characters from a new generation of Montgomery-Taggerts, the beloved family from Deveraux’s classic novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Alix Madsen is finishing up architectural school, Adelaide Kingsley dies and wills her, for one year, the use of a charming nineteenth-century Nantucket house. The elderly woman’s relationship to the Madsen family is a mystery to the spirited Alix—fresh from a romantic breakup—but for reasons of her own Alix accepts the quirky bequest, in part because it gives her time to plan her best friend’s storybook wedding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But unseen forces move behind the scenes, creaking Kingsley House’s ancient floorboards. It seems that Adelaide Kingsley had a rather specific task for Alix: to solve the strange disappearance of one of the Kingsley women, Valentina, more than two hundred years ago. If that wasn’t troubling enough, Alix must deal with the arrogant (and extremely good-looking) architect Jared Montgomery, who is living in the property’s guesthouse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unbeknown to Alix, Jared has been charged with looking after her while she lives on the island—an easy task for him, considering the undeniable chemistry between the two. But Jared harbors secrets of his own, which, if revealed, may drive a wedge between the pair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a glorious Nantucket wedding on the horizon, sparks fly, and the ghosts of the past begin to reveal themselves—some of them literally. Finding their lives inextricably entwined with the turbulent fortunes of their ancestors, Alix and Jared discover that only by righting the wrongs of the past can they hope to be together.</description>

  <description>Livie has always been the stable one of the two Cleary sisters, handling her parents' tragic death and Kacey's self-destructive phase with strength and maturity. But underneath that exterior is a little girl hanging onto the last words her father ever spoke to her. “Make me proud,” he had said. She promised she would...and she’s done her best over the past seven years with every choice, with every word, with every action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Livie walks into Princeton with a solid plan, and she’s dead set on delivering on it: Rock her classes, set herself up for medical school, and meet a good, respectable guy that she’s going to someday marry. What isn’t part of her plan are Jell-O shots, a lovable, party animal roommate she can’t say ‘no’ to, and Ashton, the gorgeous captain of the men’s rowing team. Definitely him. He’s an arrogant ass who makes Livie’s usually non-existent temper flare and everything she doesn’t want in a guy. Worse, he’s best friends and roommates with Connor, who happens to fits Livie’s criteria perfectly. So why does she keep thinking about Ashton?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Livie finds herself facing mediocre grades, career aspirations she no longer thinks she can handle, and feelings for Ashton that she shouldn’t have, she’s forced to let go of her last promise to her father and, with it, the only identity that she knows.</description>

  <description>There’s something different about Noah….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zack Parker met his best friend Noah at his lake cabin when they were only five years old. He realized he felt more than friendship for him by the time they were in junior high school. One fateful night when they were eighteen Zack couldn’t take it anymore. Fueled by love and lust and need, he finally kissed Noah like he’d wanted to for years…and Noah kissed him back, returning every drop of Zack’s passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next morning, Noah ended their friendship for what Zack believed was forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now twenty-one, Zack resents being dragged by his guilt-tripping mother every summer back to the lake cabin where every leaf and rock and turn in the road reminds him of Noah and the love he felt for him three long years before. He hates being reminded of what he lost and more than anything he wants his best friend back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this year things are different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah has returned, apologetic and more gorgeous than ever. Amazingly, he seems to want Zack as much as Zack wants him. He’s sweet and attentive, sexy enough to make Zack’s thighs quiver, but there’s something not quite right…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What secret is Noah hiding?</description>

  <description>Reno Detective Cristian Flesh lives his life by a strict set of personal rules, preferring one-time flings and anonymous encounters to committed relationships. His rules work for him... until his life is turned upside down when first, a former lover, a famous televangelist, is attacked, and then one of his one-night stands is murdered, making Cristian the prime suspect. When handsome lawyer Colby Maddox takes his case, Cristian finds himself wanting to break all his rules about relationships. The instant attraction between them is undeniable. But before they can contemplate any kind of future together, they'll have to clear Cristian's name by finding the real murderer.</description>

  <description>Eternal Life is To Die For.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen year old Zoe Vanderveen is a GAP—a genetically altered person. She lives in the security of a walled city on prime water-front property along-side other equally beautiful people with extended life spans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her brother Liam is missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah Brody is a natural who lives on the outside. He leads protests against the GAPs and detests the widening chasm they’ve created between those who have and those who don’t. He doesn’t like girls like Zoe and he has good reason not to like her specifically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoe’s carefree life takes a traumatic turn. She’s in trouble and it turns out that Noah, the last guy on earth she should trust, is the only one who can help her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PERCEPTION is a (SF/mystery/romance) Young Adult novel that takes place in the not-too-distant future in a world changed by climate extremes, natural disasters and impending wars, and where scientific breakthroughs cause class divisions—both financially and philosophically. It explores the clash between faith and science and how differences can separate us as enemies or ally us together. And in some cases, even in the midst of betrayal and personal crisis, there’s room to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first book in a series.</description>

  <description>Sometimes love just catches you by the tail. Chayton Winston is a veterinarian. He is also a werewolf. Much to his Native American parent's chagrin, he has always dreamed of a fair-haired, Caucasian mate. However, he never imagined his mate would be male. As a heterosexual man, he's not quite sure what to do with a male mate, but more than willing to find out. Keaton Reynolds wakes up, in wolf form, and finds himself with a mate. He's instantly attracted, but not so thrilled to find out the man is straight. Having been in a relationship once before where his partner professed to be "Not gay" left a bad taste in his mouth. Keaton wants to make a break for it and pretend he never set eyes on Chay-but Chay is not ready to let him go. Together the two work to solidify their shaky relationship and battle the prejudices against homosexuals. Chay must deal with not only his mother's prejudices against gay men but also her hatred of white people. When a power struggle in Keaton's pack threatens Keaton's life, the two men learn to depend on one another and their relationship to get them through it. Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language, violence and hot man-love.</description>

  <description>When his flight home for his brother’s birthday is canceled due to a Category 5 hurricane on the Eastern seaboard, art major Evan McGrath places an ad on Craigslist for a rideshare from Colorado to South Carolina. He hadn’t expected an immediate reply, nor had he expected to fall head-over-heels for the handsome and mysterious driver, Lucas Briscoe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the miles disappear behind them Evan grows more and more attracted to the enigmatic Lucas, and the desire is mutual. The only problem is that a serial killer dubbed “The Domino Slasher” has just escaped a federal prison transfer, and funny little coincidences keep pointing toward Lucas – who looks like Heaven incarnate, but who could be the Devil in disguise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LGBT Suspense/Romance &lt;br&gt;Short Novel</description>

  <description>HORN GATE: Open at your own risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Librarian Isaac Stein spends his lumpy, lonely days restoring forgotten books, until the night he steals an invitation to a scandalous club steeped in sin. Descending into its bowels, he accidentally discovers Scratch, a wounded demon who feeds on lust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consorting with a mortal is a bad idea, but Scratch can't resist the man who knows how to open the portal that will free him and his kind. After centuries of possessing mortals, he finds himself longing to surrender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be together, Isaac and Scratch must flirt with damnation and escape an inhuman trafficking ring—and they have to open their hearts or they will never unlock the Horn Gate.</description>

      <![CDATA[**2.5 stars**<br /><br />This book is very difficult for me to rate. On one hand, it was interesting and certainly unique. I admire Damon Suede for taking some serious risks on this book. However, when I ask myself "did you <em>like</em> it?", the answer is "not really". <br /><br />"Horn Gate" is a mix of Jewish occult-lore and...]]>

  <description>Before you push your Grumpy off the next bridge, look no further!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is your Grumpy Old Man getting under your feet? Is he wrestling with retirement? Are you wondering if you should bundle him up and entrust him to basket-weaving classes? Then this book could be the answer to your prayers. This light hearted guide is packed full of lively ideas, anecdotes and quips. Not only does it set out to provide laughs, but offers over 700 ideas and ways to keep a Grumpy Old Man occupied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From collecting airline sick bags to zorbing, you will be sure to find an absorbing pastime for your beloved curmudgeon. There are examples of those who have faced extraordinary challenges in older age, fascinating facts to interest a reluctant partner and innovative ideas drizzled, of course, with a large dollop of humour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written tongue-in-cheek, this book succeeds in proving that getting older doesn't mean the end of life or having fun. It provides amusing answers to the question, "How on Earth will my husband fill in his time in his retirement?" It offers suggestions on what might, or most certainly might not, amuse him. Ideal for trivia buffs, those approaching retirement, (or just at a loose end) and frustrated women who have an irritable male on their hands, this book will lighten any mood and may even prevent the odd murder.</description>

  <description>Candace Brown had a past, one that she kept well hidden. Now that she had snagged a promotion at work, she was feeling pretty good about herself - that is until Ryan enters the pictures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan Gentry knows Candy's past. In fact, she's the one who took his virginity ten years ago. Only seeing her unexpectedly throws him off of his game, and he finds himself attracted to the girl he once knew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avoiding Ryan becomes Candace's goal, until he lands smack in her office. Can she continue to push him away when chemistry starts to brew? Accepting Ryan into her world means accepting her past, and that's one thing she's still running from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How far would you run to escape your past, and what would you sacrifice to keep a firm grip on your future? Candace Brown is about to find out.</description>

  <description>Leave it to Maryah Woodsen to break the one rule that will screw up eternity: Never erase your memories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before entering this life, Maryah did the unthinkable—she erased. Now, at seventeen years old, she’s clueless that her new adoptive family has known her for centuries, that they are perpetually reincarnated souls, and that they have supernatural abilities. Oh, and she's supposed to love (not despise) Nathan, the green-eyed daredevil who saved her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan is convinced his family’s plan to spark Maryah's memory is hopeless, but his love for her is undying. After spending (and remembering) so many lifetimes together, being around an empty version of his soulmate is heart shattering. He hates acting like a stalker, but has no choice because the evil outcast who murdered Maryah in their last lifetime is still after her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Maryah’s hunter inches closer, she and Nathan make assumptions and hide secrets that rip them further apart. Maryah has to believe in the magic within her, Nathan must have faith in the power of their love, and both need to grasp onto the truth before they lose each other forever—and discover just how lonely eternity can be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;X-MEN meets MY NAME IS MEMORY in Karen Amanda Hooper’s latest young adult release.</description>

      <![CDATA[Ugh.<br /><br />"Grasping at Eternity" has a 4.22 average rating on GR right now. Keep that in mind. Maybe my annoyance with this book is just my personal taste and everyone else will love it. That being said, this book didn't work for me. <br /><br />I read a LOT of YA paranormal romance.

  <description>Just before his last year in high school, Will's best friend Julie inadvertently outs him at an end-of-summer party. Now Will feels lost and alienated at Chilliwack high school and strangely distant from his friends. The only other gay kid at school is so not his type, so Will looks online for more meaningful connections. There he meets Riley, a twenty-three-year-old living in Vancouver, and they develop a relationship that seems almost too good to be true. It isn't until after Will loses his virginity to Riley that he discovers Riley is HIV positive.</description>

  <description>When post-grad Rachael Hamilton accidentally gatecrashes a pro-athlete party, she ends up face-to-face with Ryan Carter, the NFL’s most beloved quarterback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While most girls would be thrilled to meet the attractive young millionaire, Rachael would rather spend time with books than at sporting events, and she has more important things to worry about than romance. Like her parents pressuring her to leave her unpaid publishing internship for law school. Or her brother, who’s obliviously dating Rachael’s high school bully. Or that same high school’s upcoming reunion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, when Ryan’s rookie teammate attaches himself to Rachael, she ends up cohosting Friday night dinners for half a dozen football players.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over pancake brunches, charity galas, and Alexander the Great Rachael realizes all the judgments she’d made about Ryan are wrong. But how can a Midwestern Irish-Catholic jock with commitment problems and an artsy, gun-shy Jewish New Englander ever forge a partnership? Rachael must let down her barriers if she wants real love–even if that opens her up to pain that could send her back into her emotional shell forever.</description>

  <description>General John Mitchel and his favorite pilot, Gabriel Sanchez, served together as comrades and brothers-in-arms for more than twenty-five years. They followed the warrior’s path: honor first, and service, and the safety of the tribe. Their own needs for love and companionship were secondary to the mission. Retirement from the army, however, proves challenging in ways neither expected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When old warriors retire, their armor starts falling away, and the noise of the world crowds in. That changing world sets up longings in both men for the life they might have had. After years of loving on the down-low, the idea of living together in the light seems like pure sweet oxygen to men who have been underwater a little too long. But what will it cost them to turn their dreams into truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Too hot to handle...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabitha Allen grew up in the thick of Chaos--the Chaos Motorcycle Club, that is. Her father is Chaos' leader, and the club has always had her back. But one rider was different from the start. When Tabby was running wild, Shy Cage was there. When tragedy tore her life apart, he helped her piece it back together. And now, Tabby's thinking about much more than friendship...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabby is everything Shy's ever wanted, but everything he thinks he can't have. She's beautiful, smart, and as his friend's daughter, untouchable. Shy never expected more than friendship, so when Tabby indicates she wants more--&lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;more&lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt;he feels like the luckiest man alive. But even lucky men can crash and burn...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What he’s been taught to fear could be his destiny…and his only hope.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam Yuga, a rising young star in the imperialist Terran Protectorate, is on the verge of a massive promotion…until a routine physical exam reveals something less than perfection. Genetic flaws are taboo, and Adam soon discovers there’s a thin line between rising star and starving outcast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stripped of wealth and position, stricken with a mysterious, worsening illness, Adam resorts to stealing credits to survive. Moments from capture by the Protectorate, help arrives in the form of Lochlan, a brash, cocksure Bideshi fighter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the Bideshi, a people long shunned by the Protectorate, are the only ones who will offer him shelter. As Adam learns the truth about the mysterious, nomadic people he was taught to fear, Lochlan offers him not just shelter—but a temptation Adam can only resist for so long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling to adapt to his new life, Adam discovers his illness hides a terrible secret, one that the Protectorate will stop at nothing to conceal. Time is growing short, and he must find the strength to close a centuries-old rift, accept a new identity—and hold on to a love that could cost him everything.&lt;br&gt;________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"[A] deliciously fulfilling gay sci-fi romance...Readers will fall for the engaging dialogue, wonderfully fleshed-out characters, a sexy and realistic romance, fully realized world-building, and a genuinely interesting science fictional core issue to work through. This phenomenal novel marks Moraine and Soem as authors to watch." - &lt;em&gt;Publisher's Weekly, starred review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"[A] delightful romance with a brilliantly clever science fiction twist...A truly innovative story that will even reward after multiple reads." - &lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is the perfect read for the sci-fi lovers out there." - &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Noah Forman wakes up in a hospital and can’t remember how he got there. He holds it together, taking comfort in the fact that the man he has loved since childhood, his partner, Clark Lehman, is on his way. But when Clark finally arrives, Noah is horrified to discover that he doesn’t remember anything from the past three years, and he simply can’t understand why. It will take some painful confrontations if Noah’s going to figure out why he’s lost all memories of his recent past... and secure the future he’s dreamed of having with Clark.</description>

  <description>Abbey Miller and her friend Jennifer have been picked from a live audience to take part in reality television show Makeover Miracle. This is Abbey’s worst nightmare, bringing back painful memories of being teased, bullied and the brunt of cruel jokes. The last thing Abbey wants is her soul to be laid bare for all Australians to see, but being the true friend she is,she agrees to help Jennifer, who desperately wants to change her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn Campbell, the producer of Makeover Miracle can see Abbey crumbling live on stage,and after she vomits into a waste paper basket, goes to her aid, not expecting to see such a sad, haunted look in her eyes. There’s something about Abbey that reaches out to him. The look in her eyes brings back long‐buried memories of his sister and his failure to help her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story about one woman’s journey through emotional turmoil and the man who is able to make her believe in herself. Set against the beautiful Dandenong Ranges, Makeover Miracle is a story about forgiveness, understanding, personal growth and, of course, falling in love with that one special person.</description>

  <description>Paranormal journalists Chris Mullins and Jo Perry are sent to Ireland's remote west coast to investigate tales of hauntings at a ruined church. Chris, who has an inbuilt sensor for ghosts, is drawn to the old priest’s house next door, where he faces an otherworldly encounter so strong it leaves him reeling. Their research leads to a tangled web of forbidden love, family rows, and even, possibly, murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris jumps at the chance not only to solve the mystery, but also to aim for the coveted Moondust Award, a prize for the first journalist who proves that ghosts exist. Jo, though, is less enthusiastic, both about the award and her on-off relationship with Chris. Things become even more confused when Chris finds himself falling for Paulie, one half of a gay couple on holiday in the same village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the wild, haunted landscape of Ireland can give Chris the answers he so craves, but to find them, he may have to choose between the Moondust Award and the matters of his heart.</description>

  <description>When struggling waitress Melody Dylan gives a handsome, lonely stranger a simple gift she has no clue her life is about to take a drastic turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stranger ends up being Clay Powers, a famous UFC heavyweight fighter. Clay’s large build and dangerous fists have always intimidated. People in his hometown keep their distance and Clay is fine with that. Everything changes when a new waitress at the local diner buys him a piece of pie on Thanksgiving. Touched by the gesture when it’s obvious she can barely afford to survive, her warm smile and lush body churn up powerful feelings that leave Clay wanting more from her than pie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melody is running from her past and the small, country town of Garnet is the perfect hiding place. With an ex-husband after her and scars from her abusive marriage etched deep, the last thing she expects is to fall for a man who makes a living with his fists, but she can’t resist Clay or the tender connection they share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding love in the most unlikely of places, the passion is undeniable, but Clay and Melody know their haunted pasts and unpredictable futures leave the odds stacked against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: violence.</description>

  <description>How much is too much to love?&lt;br&gt;Travis Maddox learned two things from his mother before she died: Love hard. Fight harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Walking Disaster, the life of Travis is full of fast women, underground gambling, and violence.

It was my first YA angsty read and it got me hooked on the genre.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He’ll bend for them. But they may break over him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twelve years, Dom lovers Ryan “Angel” Morgan and Dante James have run a successful photography business, and satisfied their need for a submissive with the occasional sizzling three-way. On a wedding job, they both zero in on the bride’s beautiful brother, but as professionals, they keep their attraction on the down-low—for now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jordan Steele has no trouble establishing mastery over his stallions. When he hires Angel and Dante to shoot promotional photos for his stable, though, there’s something about them that calls to his inner submissive. After a little flirtation and a photo session that gets almost too hot to handle, Angel and Dante are happy to show him the ropes. And the whip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once they break the ice, their sexual chemistry burns hotter than a macro flash. Everyone gets what they need…until emotions come into play. Their power could develop into something permanent, throw everything off balance—leaving one of them the odd man out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains lots of sarcasm, a double helping of steamy erotic photography, and two dominants having their way with one very enthusiastic submissive. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Police &lt;em&gt;teniente&lt;/em&gt; Alex Rukow has spent his life trapped on Santuario, his people’s isolated home-slash-prison-island. They’ve been living in poverty under the tyrannical regime of their own elite &lt;em&gt;familias&lt;/em&gt; for the last two-hundred years, ever since their generation ship landed on the planet and found it already populated by earlier Earth settlers, the Skanians, who banished them to the inhospitable south.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Increasingly shamed by the decisions of their ancestors, the Skanians seek to open their borders. But dissent exists on both sides, and in the midst of this explosive political situation, a dead body appears on the island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bengt, a Skanian investigator, is shipped to Santuario to lead the murder investigation—which, he quickly realizes, the local &lt;em&gt;teniente&lt;/em&gt; wants nothing to do with. As far as Bengt is concerned, things can’t get worse than the brutal climate, his own memories, and a growing attraction to a partner who will barely say two words to him. But then he and Alex run afoul of the local &lt;em&gt;familias&lt;/em&gt;, and the problems with their investigation and their budding relationship seem like nothing compared to just getting out of this whole mess alive.</description>

  <description>Jordan has his hands full running the publishing firm he saved from going under at the cost of his personal life. He doesn’t have time to date, but that’s not to say he doesn’t have needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of trying to find a date, Jordan makes an appointment with a prostitute—something he’s never done before—and his companion turns out to be his high school crush, Gabe! Panic would ruin everything, including the chance at something real that Jordan suddenly craves.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old "Hank" has found himself at Penn Station in New York City with no memory of anything --who he is, where he came from, why he's running away. His only possession is a worn copy of Walden, by Henry David Thoreau. And so he becomes Henry David-or "Hank" and takes first to the streets, and then to the only destination he can think of--Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. Cal Armistead's remarkable debut novel is about a teen in search of himself. Hank begins to piece together recollections from his past. The only way Hank can discover his present is to face up to the realities of his grievous memories. He must come to terms with the tragedy of his past, to stop running, and to find his way home.</description>

  <description>The first time it happened was the full moon after I let Randy, a boy I sucked off a few times, come over for "old time’s sake"...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a month, I turn into a f****** beast. I mean, that’s what I do. I f*** like a beast until I’ve f***** my way through everything in my path. You’re probably not seeing the downside yet. Fair enough. I’m sure Randy didn’t see the downside, either. Sometimes I wonder though, why me? Did he choose me special? Anyway, he split town before Halloween. That was the night it happened. Fortunately, I wasn’t alone when the pain between my legs drove me to the floor...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The dynamite blockbuster that started it all—now a major motion picture starring Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE FINE MESS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to Trenton, New Jersey, home to wiseguys, average Joes, and Stephanie Plum, who sports a big attitude and even bigger money problems (since losing her job as a lingerie buyer for a department store). Stephanie needs cash—fast—but times are tough, and soon she’s forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE FALSE MOVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie’s bail bonding company. She’s got no experience. But that doesn’t matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice cop Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants, to the time Steph hit him with her father’s Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot water—wanted for murder...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ONE FOR THE MONEY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prizefighter Benito Ramirez isn’t. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she’ll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight—and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Althea Grant's Charleston gallery might be suffering from the bad economy, and her artistic aspirations have gone nowhere, but she's doing just fine, thank you. When bad-boy sculptor Steel rides up on his motorcycle looking to rent studio space, his infusion of cash is more than welcome. But his art is raw, visceral, sexual—and completely inappropriate for her pastel world of watercolor landscapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steel, fascinated by Althea's rare albino coloring, sees in her the key to his next piece: a metal satyr designed for bondage games. Moving into her gallery basement is the first step; seducing the cool Southern belle into modeling for him is the second.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Steel peels away her careful manners and tasteful outfits, Althea begins to realize her life isn't just fine at all—it's as pale and washed-out as the watercolor paintings she's failing to sell. Can she transform her life and accept her most secret desires?</description>

  <description>I'm writing this because you begged. You know how I love the begging. In fact, you probably know too many things and know them far too well. Who am I? Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. I was a whore in my youth, a killer since my adolescence, and a monster as a man. I am the man who kidnapped Livvie. I am the man who held her in a dark room for weeks. But, most importantly, I am the man she loves. She loves me. It's quite sick, isn't it? Of course, there's more to our story than can be surmised in a few short sentences, but I'm at a loss for justifying my behavior back then. I assume if you're reading this, I don't need to make those justifications. You've already made your own. You're reading this because you want to know about the rest of the story. You want to know what happened that warm summer night in September of 2010, the night I met Livvie at The Paseo. It was the night my life changed all over again. It didn't happen exactly as Livvie said. She's been very kind to me in the retelling of our story. The truth is far more...complicated.</description>

  <description>Caring for a loved one with cancer is tough. Doing it alone is overwhelming—especially when that loved one is a child. But ever since Ken Brighton’s partner left him, Ken has spent his days at the hospital with his daughter, Hanna, hoping for a miracle. Maybe the mysterious care packages that appear for Hanna don’t qualify, but they bring a spark of hope into his and Hanna’s tired life—and so does Ken’s neighbor, former singer Patrick Flaherty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For two years Patrick hasn’t been able to focus on anything but the life he should have had. An injury robbed him of his voice, and the idea of introducing himself to new people intimidates him. But over the past months, he’s watched as his neighbor nursed his sick child, and once he meets Ken, Patrick starts to crave a life with him—a life he isn't sure he can have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ken doesn’t realize he’s fallen in love until the doctors send Hanna home, saying there’s nothing more they can do: Hanna will either recover or succumb. Ken’s heart is set on a new beginning—with both Patrick and Hanna. But Patrick's silence leaves Ken wondering what Patrick wants.</description>

      <![CDATA[**2.5 stars**<br /><br />Audiobooks are extremely subjective. When you read a book yourself, you have your own idea of how the character sounds, but when you have an audiobook, the will of the narrator is forced upon you. This can be hit or miss, and I have really visceral reactions to some narrators. A few...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sometimes the adventure chooses you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lover of fine poetry and lousy choose-your-own-adventure novels, Professor Sebastian Swift was once the bad-boy darling of the literati. The only lines he does these days are Browning, Frost and Cummings. Even his relationship with the hot, handsome Wolfe Neck Police Chief Max Prescott is healthy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one of his most talented students comes to him bruised and begging for help, Swift hands over the keys to his Orson Island cabin—only to find out that the boy’s father is dead and the police are suspicious. In an instant, the stable life Swift has built for himself hangs on finding the boy and convincing him to give himself up before Max figures out Swift’s involvement in the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max enjoys splitting an infinitive or two with his favorite nutty professor, but he’s not much for sonnets or Shakespeare. He likes being lied to even less. Yet his instincts—and his heart—tell him his lover is being played. Max can forgive lies and deception, but a dangerous enemy may not stop until Swift is heading up his own dead poet’s society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that Josh Lanyon’s smart, sexy, sophisticated stories may prove hazardous to your heart. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[**2.5 stars**<br /><br />Welcome to what is apparently opposite day on Goodreads, Heather edition. I started off the day by loving a book that most of my friends told me to skip, they disliked it so much (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10804074.Bad_Company" title="Bad Company by K.A. Mitchell">Bad Company</a>) and ended it with feeling "meh" about a book that my GR friends love almost unanimously. I'...]]>

  <description>Mania - A gay erotic adventure with a manic twist that stings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This short story (7400 words) covers a morning in the life of a manic depressive as seen through his eyes. In the early stages of mania — the sex drive increases significantly and inhibitions are lowered. That can be a recipe for trouble. But throw into the mix a boyfriend who won’t entertain the idea of a morning fuck, and the boyfriend’s handyman father calling round to measure up the bathroom when his son’s at work. Mr. Adams hates his son’s partner with a passion that’s verging on the certifiable, and has no sympathy for his condition. He also has a volatile nature which explodes in a most unexpected way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that this story contains scenes of violence and anal sex.</description>

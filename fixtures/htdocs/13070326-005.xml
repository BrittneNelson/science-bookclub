  <description>Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?</description>

  <description>Guild-trained weaver Ily is furious her rival Kal, a smug yet wickedly sexy rug merchant, outsells her at every turn. She knows her magically crafted rugs are far superior to anything he can produce, but can't compete with his charming personality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kal fixes his lusty attentions on Ily, she is reluctantly aroused by his interest. She knows he desires her and against her better judgment, she wants him too. A chance encounter leads her to make him a scandalous offer: her body in exchange for enough money to leave the city. She sees their time together as a temporary erotic adventure…until Kal reveals that what he truly wants from Ily is more personal—and more dangerous—than bed play. And she must choose between taking her chance at a new life or risking it all for a man she never meant to love.</description>

  <description>Navy SEAL Reid Galvin is back from hell and eager to find comfort in Becca Anderson's arms. He knows he hurt her when he cut contact during his deployment, so when his call interrupts her date with another man, he has only himself to blame. But he can't forget what she means to him—or the sexy email she sent him—and he won't miss this chance to claim her as his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been weeks since Becca heard from the man she thought she was involved with. So when Reid wants to take up where they left off as if nothing happened, she refuses. Then he rescues her from a first date gone very wrong, and she realizes she's not quite ready to let him go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reid and Becca have a lot to talk about, but since she's not listening, he's going to have to regain her trust another way—by bringing her most erotic fantasies to life. Making her surrender to pleasure just might be his most important mission.</description>

  <description>An ambitious intern. A perfectionist executive. And a whole lot of name calling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whip-smart, hardworking, and on her way to an MBA, Chloe Mills has only one problem: her boss, Bennett Ryan. He's exacting, blunt, inconsiderate--and completely irresistible. A Beautiful Bastard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bennett has returned to Chicago from France to take a vital role in his family's massive media business. He never expected that the assistant who'd been helping him from abroad was the gorgeous, innocently provocative--completely infuriating--creature he now has to see every day. Despite the rumors, he's never been one for a workplace hookup. But Chloe's so tempting he's willing to bend the rules--or outright smash them--if it means he can have her. All over the office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their appetites for one another increase to a breaking point, Bennett and Chloe must decide exactly what they're willing to lose in order to win each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally only available online as The Office by tby789--and garnering over 2 million reads on fanfiction sites--Beautiful Bastard has been extensively updated for re-release.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Daisy has an electrifying secret that could save her life—or kill her&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;High school sophomore Daisy Jones is just trying to get by unnoticed. It doesn’t help that she’s the new girl at school, lives in a trailer park, and doesn’t even own a cell phone. But there’s a good reason for all that: Daisy has a secret, unpredictable power—one only her best friend, Danielle, knows about.  Despite her “gift” (or is it a curse?), Daisy’s doing a good job of fitting in, and a gorgeous senior named Kevin even seems interested in her! But when Daisy tries to help Vivi, a mysterious classmate in a crisis, she soon discovers that her new friend has a secret of her own. Now Daisy and her friends must deal with chilling dreams and messages from the beyond. Can Daisy channel the power she’s always tried to hide, before it’s too late? Extra features include:•   A short graphic novel telling Vivi’s story•   Danielle’s journal, revealing her deepest thoughts •   Lyrics and video links for Kevin's music (songs composed by Fredrik Larsson, otherwise known as YouTube sensation FreddeGredde)</description>

  <description>In the dual-gendered realm of Ylandre, the great divide between the high-born True Bloods and the lower-ranked Half Bloods is deemed impassable by most. Rohyr Essendri dared to cross it when he took young Lassen Idana from his provincial town and made him his paramour. Lassen perforce learned how to navigate the intricate byways of life at court. What he never expected, however, was to fall in love with Rohyr, a most inadvisable and impractical thing to do when one’s lover is sovereign ruler of the land. But anything worth having is worth fighting for, both figuratively and, as Lassen discovers, literally speaking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains hermaphroditism and explicit homoerotic sexual encounters.</description>

  <description>In her high-velocity memoir, Ex-Rich Girl Tells All, Kami Corban lays bare the high life and dark times of a Los Angeles girl who had every possible advantage, only to see it ripped from her in record time. What was left in the place of privilege and promise takes her on a journey of survival, resilience and mystery. It’s a must-read for anyone who thinks money may be the answer—or who is having a hard time mustering up the necessary reserve of hope to truly enjoy life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Kami sets out to graduate from Duke University and live happily ever after with her college boyfriend Tucker, she finds herself instead at the receiving end of a letter from her mother declaring divorce, and her own prospective husband decamping to England. This quickly propels the author into an onslaught of misadventures that span the resorts of England, the mountains of North Carolina, and her lavish hometown of San Marino, California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, the bodies accumulate as her spirit wanes, from a brutish Brit named Philip to the scholarly Rhodesian Chitsaka and the tormented Cherokee Chane. When events evolve that force Kami to take a more somber look at her life’s lot, what emerges from the chaos is another chance at peace and enrichment. However hard-won her serenity is, it’s lasting, deep, and real. It’s also ballast enough for her to take on her own confusion, as well as that of the family members around her who reel from their own psychological poverty. With the onset of her parents’ divorce, Kami must cope with the fallout financially and emotionally, while she learns the tools to forge a new sense of self that brings with it a brand of happiness that she had not previously envisioned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As this refreshingly frank heroine hones in on the unvarnished truth of her life circumstances, readers experience the unlimited resources of hope that can shore up the most spiritually destitute, and discover a rewarding, new road to personal fulfillment. With its fast-paced litany of dashed expectations and dazzling surprises, Ex-Rich Girl Tells All is a searing, redemptive story that demonstrates how a full heart is entirely independent of a full wallet. This story will resonate with anyone who may question whether money is really the answer.</description>

  <description>Tristan's got issues; he knows he does. So when his most recent girlfriend dumps him via messenger, and he can't stop staring at the messenger's cock while he's breaking the news, Tristan figures it's about time he makes some changes. He formulates a foolproof plan to get himself someone who can show him what he's been missing -- until who should crash his little adventure but Officer Michael Truax, the man who gave him a really expensive ticket for boarding without a helmet back when he was in high school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael has been trying to catch Tristan for years...to give him a second ticket. Suddenly he's faced with his 'Sparky', all grown up -- and looking to get laid. The habit of protecting him isn't gone completely, but the opportunity is too much to resist. He figures the kid must know what he's getting into, so he takes him home. There, they carry on a cautious dance, only to find out that neither is what the other expected, and that together, they're hot enough to melt glass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices, violence.</description>

With a simple touch, she knows when someone will die. It’s her curse and the reason she secludes herself from the world. The only person who knows her secret is her best friend Raven. Then she meets Asher Morgan. He’s gorgeous, mysterious, and is the only person Ember can't sense death from. So when he pushes into her life, she doesn’t mind.

  <description>Some humans can see the fae. McKenzie Lewis can track them, reading the shadows they leave behind. But some shadows lead to danger. Others lead to lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Houston college student trying to finish her degree, McKenzie has been working for the fae king for years, tracking vicious rebels who would claim the Realm. Her job isn’t her only secret. For just as long, she’s been in love with Kyol, the king’s sword-master—and relationships between humans and fae are forbidden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But any hope for a normal life is shattered when she’s captured by Aren, the fierce and uncompromising rebel leader. He teaches her the forbidden fae language and tells her dark truths about the Court, all to persuade her to turn against the king. Time is running out, and as the fight starts to claim human lives, McKenzie has no choice but to decide once and for all whom to trust and where she ultimately stands in the face of a cataclysmic civil war.</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Camryn Bennett had always been one to think out-of-the-box, who knew she wanted something more in life than following the same repetitive patterns and growing old with the same repetitive life story. And she thought that her life was going in the right direction until everything fell apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined not to dwell on the negative and push forward, Camryn is set to move in with her best friend and plans to start a new job. But after an unexpected night at the hottest club in downtown North Carolina, she makes the ultimate decision to leave the only life she’s ever known, far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a purse, a cell phone and a small bag with a few necessities, Camryn, with absolutely no direction or purpose boards a Greyhound bus alone and sets out to find herself. What she finds is a guy named Andrew Parrish, someone not so very different from her and who harbors his own dark secrets. But Camryn swore never to let down her walls again. And she vowed never to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with Andrew, Camryn finds herself doing a lot of things she never thought she’d do. He shows her what it’s really like to live out-of-the-box and to give in to her deepest, darkest desires. On their sporadic road-trip he becomes the center of her exciting and daring new life, pulling love and lust and emotion out of her in ways she never imagined possible. But will Andrew’s dark secret push them inseparably together, or tear them completely apart?</description>

  <description>When reserved flight attendant Bianca gets one look at billionaire hotel owner James Cavendish, she loses all of her hard-won composure. For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions. But what tempts her like never before is the dominant pull he seems to have over her from the moment they meet, and the promise of pleasure, and pain, that she reads in his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>Inspired by the story of the iconic Bettie Page, Logan Belle’s sizzling erotic novel explores the transformation of Regina Finch from shy librarian to the object of one powerful man’s all-consuming desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regina Finch, brilliant and bookish, has worked her way up to her dream job as a librarian at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. But her discovery of the sordid sexual adventures of a rakish, young billionaire among the hallowed halls and sacred stacks of the library unleashes a confusing blend of repulsion and desire that threatens to consume her. It is only through her introduction to the work of Bettie Page—the world’s most popular ingÉnue-turned-fetish-model—and Page’s own sexual awakening that Regina can hope to discover her sexual prowess and seduce the man she loves.</description>

  <description>Riley Hayes, the playboy of the Hayes family,  is a young man who seems to have it all:  money, a career he loves, and his pick of beautiful women. His father, CEO of HayesOil, passes control of the corporation to his two sons; but a stipulation is attached to Riley's portion.  Concerned about Riley's lack of maturity, his father requires that Riley &lt;em&gt;'marry and stay married for one year to someone he loves'.&lt;/em&gt; Angered by the requirement, Riley seeks a means of bypassing his father's stipulation. Blackmailing Jack Campbell into marrying him "for love" suits Riley's purpose.  There is no mention in his father's documents that the marriage had to be with a woman and Jack Campbell is the son of Riley Senior's arch rival. Win win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley marries Jack and abruptly his entire world is turned inside out. Riley hadn't counted on the fact that Jack Campbell, quiet and unassuming rancher, is a force of nature in his own right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story of murder, deceit, the struggle for power, lust and love, the sprawling life of a rancher and the whirlwind existence of a playboy.  But under and through it all, as Riley learns over the months, this is a tale about family and everything that that word means.</description>

  <description>The story of man who confronted home foreclosure, depression and addiction by living in his car for 9 months at a truck stop. After hearing an retired Orthodox minister talk about giving gratitude for the good and bad things in life he decided he would try it. That first night in his car he gave thanks for the roof over his head, even though it was a sun roof. From there he tells of experiences and frustrations while learning to be thankful for all that life has to offer, good and bad.</description>

  <description>Author Barbara Kingsolver and her family abandoned the industrial-food pipeline to live a rural life—vowing that, for one year, they'd only buy food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, &lt;em&gt;Animal, Vegetable, Miracle&lt;/em&gt; is an enthralling narrative that will open your eyes in a hundred new ways to an old truth: You are what you eat.</description>

  <description>Do not adjust your set. That really was Casey Greene being jilted by her fiance on live TV! And that really was Memphis's most eligible bachelor who stepped in to marry her instead. Millionaire businessman Adam Carmichael wanted only to help Casey save face. He isn't prepared for the news that their "fake" wedding is legal and binding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they secretly wait for an annulment, media and family scrutiny forces them to put on their best loving-couple act. Except by now, neither one is quite sure who's acting....</description>

  <description>At the age of 23, James Frey woke up on a plane to find his front teeth knocked out and his nose broken. He had no idea where the plane was headed nor any recollection of the past two weeks. An alcoholic for ten years and a crack addict for three, he checked into a treatment facility shortly after landing. There he was told he could either stop using or die before he reached age 24. This is Frey's acclaimed account of his six weeks in rehab.</description>

  <description>The bestselling author of The Dirty Girls Social Club returns with a provocative and controversial memoir about how a sexy cowboy turned her feminist beliefs upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feminism was a religion in Alisa Valdes's childhood home, and her hippie Marxist parents raised her to believe that she was meant for better things than playing with Barbies. Instead, she read Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. At twenty-two Valdes was named one of the top feminist writers under thirty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet despite her professional success, Valdes hit forty-two bitter, divorced, and a serial dater of inadequate men in tweed jackets. Realizing that her upbringing had sabotaged her personal happiness, she embarks on a soul-searching journey and ends up falling head over spurs in love with the Cowboy, a conservative rancher who drives a pickup with a pistol under the front seat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From their first date the Cowboy makes her pulse race, and she discovers that “when men . . . act like men rather than like emasculated boys, you as a woman will find not only great pleasure in submitting to them but also great growth as a person.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This controversial book will spark heated national debate, but Learning to Submit will also delight the many readers who made The Pioneer Woman a bestseller—not to mention every woman who dreams of being swept away by a rugged cowboy.</description>

  <description>Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he's asleep) toddler a better life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Carter's undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire's panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.</description>

  <description>Jocelyn Butler has been hiding from her past for years. But all her secrets are about to be laid bare…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four years ago, Jocelyn left her tragic past behind in the States and started over in Scotland, burying her grief, ignoring her demons, and forging ahead without attachments. Her solitary life is working well—until she moves into a new apartment on Dublin Street where she meets a man who shakes her carefully guarded world to its core.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Braden Carmichael is used to getting what he wants, and he’s determined to get Jocelyn into his bed. Knowing how skittish she is about entering a relationship, Braden proposes an arrangement that will satisfy their intense attraction without any strings attached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after an intrigued Jocelyn accepts, she realizes that Braden won’t be satisfied with just mind-blowing passion. The stubborn Scotsman is intent on truly knowing her… down to the very soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What do you do when your knight in shining armor lives, literally, in a different world?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most American teenagers want a vacation in Italy, but the Betarrini sisters have spent every summer of their lives among the romantic hills with their archaelogist parents.  Stuck among the rubble of the medieval castles in rural Tuscany, on yet another hot, dusty archaeological site, Gabi and Lia are bored out of their minds...until Gabi places her hand atop a handprint in an ancient tomb and finds herself in fourteenth-century Italy.  And worse yet, in the middle of a fierce battle between knights of two opposing forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly Gabi's summer in Italy is much, much more interesting.</description>

  <description>Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong. Even after months of painful physical therapy, Maggie walks with a limp. Her social life is nil and a scholarship to study abroad—her chance to escape everyone and their pitying stares—has been canceled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a year in juvenile jail, Caleb’s free . . . if freedom means endless nagging from a transition coach and the prying eyes of the entire town. Coming home should feel good, but his family and ex-girlfriend seem like strangers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb and Maggie are outsiders, pigeon-holed as "criminal" and "freak." Then the truth emerges about what really happened the night of the accident and, once again, everything changes. It’s a bleak and tortuous journey for Caleb and Maggie, yet they end up finding comfort and strength from a surprising source: each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Lisa Kleypas creates a beguiling story, set in a world where appearance means everything, passion simmers just below the surface, and a respectable Englishwoman is willing to risk scandal for one night of love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was unmarried, untouched and almost thirty, but novelist Amanda Briars wasn't about to greet her next birthday without making love to a man. When he appeared at her door, she believed he was her gift to herself, hired for one night of passion. Unforgettably handsome, irresistibly virile, he tempted her in ways she never thought possible, but something stopped him from completely fulfilling her dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Devlin's determination to possess Amanda became greater when she discovered his true identity. But gently bred Amanda craved respectability more than she admitted, while Jack, the cast-off son of a nobleman and London's most notorious businessman, refused to live by society's rules. Yet when fate conspired for them to marry, their worlds collided with a passionate force neither had expected. . . but both soon craved.</description>

  <description>Sookie Stackhouse is a small-time cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana. She's quiet, keeps to herself, and doesn't get out much. Not because she's not pretty. She is. It's just that, well, Sookie has this sort of "disability." She can read minds. And that doesn't make her too dateable.  And then along comes Bill. He's tall, dark, handsome--and Sookie can't hear a word he's thinking. He's exactly the type of guy she's been waiting for all her life....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bill has a disability of his own: He's a vampire with a bad reputation. He hangs with a seriously creepy crowd, all suspected of--big surprise--murder. And when one of Sookie's coworkers is killed, she fears she's next....</description>

  <description>La peste 23.000 de ani[9] în viitor, rasa umană s-a împrăștiat în universul cunoscut, populând nenumărate sisteme planetare, conduse de casele regale aristocratice care se supun Împăratului Padișah Shaddam Corrino IV. Știința și tehnologia au evoluat dincolo de limitele timpurilor actuale. Din cauza unui incident petrecut cu 10.000 de ani în urmă, cunoscut ca Jihadul butlerian, calculatoarele și inteligențele artificiale sunt interzise. În absența acestor dispozitive, funcția lor este preluată de oameni cu minți foarte dezvoltate, numiți mentați.&lt;br&gt;În afara acestora, au apărut diverse organizații menite să umple locul ocupat anterior de "mașinile gânditoare". Doar două dintre ele au supraviețuit: Ghilda Spațială, specializată în matematică, care a monopolizat călătoriile spațiale realizate cu ajutorul navigatorilor, și puternicul ordin matriarhal numit Bene Gesserit, al cărei obiectiv principal îl constituie protejarea și evoluția rasei umane. Sursa abilităților lor este substanța numită mirodenia melanj, care se găsește doar pe planeta deșertică Arrakis. Mirodenia prelungește viața celor care o consumă și permite anumite capacități preștiente.&lt;br&gt;Corporația CHOAM este principala pârghie a economiei imperiale, stabilind veniturile și obligațiile financiare ale fiecărei Case. Cheia puterii lor este controlul Arrakis-ului. Mirodenia este crucială pentru navigatorii Ghildei Spațiale, care depind de ea pentru a stabili un traseu sigur al navelor Ghildei, folosind preștiința și tehnologia "plierii spațiului" care le permite călătoria instantanee în orice colț al universului.&lt;br&gt;Mirodenia le dă acolitelor Bene Gesserit, denumite deseori "vrăjitoare", abilități mentale și fizice, dezvoltate în parte prin condiționarea antrenamentului prana-bindu. O acolită Bene Gesserit devine Cucernică Maică după ce trece printr-un ritual primejdios numit agonia mirodeniei, în cadrul căruia ingerează o doză în mod normal letală dintr-un narcotic al preștiinței, fiind obligată să îl neutralizeze în interiorul ei. Supraviețuirea acestui ritual îi descătușează ego-ul și amintirile tuturor strămoșilor ei pe linie feminină. O Cucernică Maică este sfătuită să evite locul din conștiința ei ocupa de memoria genetică a strămoșilor ei pe linie masculină. Bene Gesserit conduc un program genetic secret, vechi de milenii, al cărui scop îl reprezintă producerea unui mascul echivalent unei Bene Gesserit, pe care îl numesc Kwisatz Haderach. Acest bărbat nu ar fi capabil doar să supraviețuiască agoniei mirodeniei și să acceseze amintirile strămoșilor pe linie masculină, ci se așteaptă să posede "puteri mentale organice (care pot) uni spațiul și timpul".[10] Bene Gesserit vor ca acest Kwisatz Haderach să le ofere posibilitatea de a controla problemele omenirii mult mai eficient.&lt;br&gt;Planeta Arrakis este acoperită de un ecosistem deșertic, ostil majorității formelor de viață. Ea este casa fremenilor, luptători feroce care călăresc giganticii viermi de nisip ai deșertului și ai căror conducători sunt aleși prin luptă. Fremenii au ritualuri complexe și un sistem bazat pe păstrarea apei de pe planeta lor aridă; ei păstrează apa distilată a morților, consideră scuipatul un gest de respect, iar lacrimile cel mai prețios dar care poate fi oferit unui mort. Romanul sugerează că fremenii s-au adaptat fiziologic mediului lor, sângele lor coagulându-se aproape instantaneu pentru a preveni pierderea apei.[11] Și cultura fremenă se învârte în jurul mirodeniei care se găsește în deșert și se recoltează sub riscul atacului viermilor de nisip. La fel ca și în cazul altor planete superstițioase, eforturile misionare ale Bene Gesserit au reușit să aducă religia și profețiile pe Arrakis, dându-le fremenilor credința într-un mântuitor, Lisan al-Gaib (Vocea din altă lume), care va veni într-o zi de pe altă lume pentru a transforma Arrakisul într-o lume mai ospitalieră.</description>

  <description>For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house. One yellow-eyed wolf—her wolf—is a chilling presence she can't seem to live without. Meanwhile, Sam has lived two lives: In winter, the frozen woods, the protection of the pack, and the silent company of a fearless girl. In summer, a few precious months of being human ... until the cold makes him shift back again.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Grace meets a yellow-eyed boy whose familiarity takes her breath away. It's her wolf. It has to be. But as winter nears, Sam must fight to stay human—or risk losing himself, and Grace, forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Duration: 10 hours, 43 minutes</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year old Selena Fallon is a dreamer. Not a day-dreamer, but an I-see-the-future kind of dreamer. Normally this is not a problem as she has gotten pretty good at keeping her weird card hidden from everyone in her small town. Except from her best friend Kyle and her grandparents, of course. But when Selena dreams of her own rather bloody death, things get a little too freaky even for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Dillan Sloan. Selena has seen the new guy in a different dream, and he is even more droolworthy in person. Beyond the piercing blue eyes and tousled dark hair, there is something else that draws her to him. Something…electric. Unfortunately, Dillan makes it more than clear that he does not feel the same. They just met, so why would he act like he hates her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dillan and Selena are forced together one weekend to work on a school project, Selena prepares to be ignored as usual. But when she stumbles across a few undead in the backyard, Dillan comes to her rescue and reveals a whole lot more. Not only is he part of a society that hunts otherworldly creatures…she is too. And she is being targeted by a force bigger and darker than anything she ever imagined. Despite her death dream, Selena is not going to give up easy, especially when she discovers that Dillan might not actually hate her after all.</description>

  <description>When Josh put a blue valentine in the class box for Bobby Prentice in fifth grade, he just wanted to show how much he appreciated his best friend. Years later, both the ridicule he suffered and his unrequited feelings for Bobby have followed him to the university where they both teach. Bobby would like to say many things to his friend, but he doesn’t know if he can find the courage in himself that he admires in Josh.</description>

      <![CDATA[The worst in the collection for me so far. This book was hard to finish, which is saying a lot because it was only 37 pages. <br /><br />Where do I start?

  <description>Scotty Fuller is a man who demands order. His job as a librarian gives him the solace he needs, and a BDSM club provides him with the kind of entertainment he craves. That is until a cute young college student threatens to unglue his carefully pieced-together life and rip open old wounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wesley Reese is a shy college student with a problem: he’s crushing on the librarian. On a dare he asks the handsome older man on a date, but dating Scotty requires more from Wesley than he can give. When the bondage restraints come out, Wesley knows he’s in too deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will he change for love? Will he lose himself forever? Or will each man finally be… Cherished?</description>

  <description>*Re-released with a new cover and minor copy edits after original publisher closed*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcy Margate has it all: she's young, rich, and built like Barbie. She isn't the brightest bulb in the chandelier, but the girl's got sass and spunk to spare. Plus, she's sizzling hot. When her marriage to a real live genius starts to dim and grow cool, however, she's puzzled. What went wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcy loves her husband, even if Jess Margate is from the planet of the nerds. She decides to play it smart for a change. Using spyware and creative strategy, she plots to find out why her geek has been interruptus. Armed with miniature technology, Marcy plans to uncover the cause for the downtime in their love life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A modern romantic comedy of hot errors and hotter apologies, Geekus Interruptus is a story for our time. Because these days, nerds rule. And geeks have guilty pleasures too, some quite different than our own.</description>

  <description>Born the son of a preacher man, Elijah Deacon always conformed to his father’s strict religious teachings. He worked hard, devoting his time and energy to the family owned construction firm, leaving little time to focus on the deplorable state of his private life. Small town America was no place to be when all a man craved was the touch of another man. Elijah hid his sexuality and tried in vain to convince himself he could be happy with a woman. Urged on by the dream of having the family he craved, Elijah couldn’t know a drunken one night stand would see him pay the ultimate price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving the bright lights of Atlanta and placing his own life on hold, paralegal, Seth Jacobs, moved to Alabama hopeful that with a baby on the way, his twin sister Bethany would settle down. His older sister by five minutes, she gave him the confidence he needed while growing to come out and be proud of who he was. It was his turn to return the support. On arrival in Headland, Seth endeavored to make her see the dangers her behavior presented to her and her unborn child. But, to no avail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When destiny deals a cruel blow, and the life of a newborn baby hangs by a thread, Seth and Elijah are flung together to deal with the tragic circumstances. The grief threatens to consume them, while joy and fear work to unite them. Jealousy, love, lies and bitter truths rise to the surface and threaten to tear them apart. Can the powers of love and life bring them together and heal the loneliness that death leaves behind? Or will circumstance prevail and fuel the embers of love that draw them together?</description>

  <description>Austin Huntley and Cameron Nash are like night and day. One is a family man, works in a nice office, drives an expensive car, and is content to be content. The other one is an antisocial car mechanic with a short fuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some things don’t change. Others definitely do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After surviving a five-months long kidnapping together, they struggle to return to normalcy, all while realizing that they're more drawn to each other than they ever could've imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I know I'm not normal, but I'm not fucking stupid."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Define normal," Austin countered quietly, meeting Cam in the doorway. "And for not being normal, you're the only person in the world who makes sense right now. What does that say about me?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This story contains violence and scenes of an explicit, erotic nature between two men and is intended for adults, 18+.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Word count: 60 000 (novel)</description>

  <description>*****Currently unpublished. Will re-publish once the series is complete.******&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Miller is known as a dreamer in her stifling Mennonite community, but she's hiding something from them all. A simple wish to avoid the strictly enforced life path expected of her...early marriage, babies, and work on the farm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wants more, so much more. Education, travel, love...sex...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance at university hundreds of miles away is too much to pass up, so she follows her best friend Naomi and decides to take her future into her own hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She had no idea this decision would change her in ways she never imagined, will the one person she falls in love with hold her back from everything she ever wanted?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***As with all my work, this novel is intended for those 18+. It is New Adult, but contains depictions of graphic sex, drug use and underage drinking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;****This is not a stand alone, it is a cliffhanger, the first of three books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------- &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feel free to stalk me for updates on book release dates, and of course to follow along on the serial soap opera &lt;a href="http://www.smutlandia.com/#!slutburbia/c1iri" rel="nofollow"&gt;Slutburbia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/AuthorJadenWilkes" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AuthorJadenWilkes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JWilkesAuthor" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://twitter.com/JWilkesAuthor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smutlandia.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.smutlandia.com/&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Don't miss the next sexy installment in the entity series, Love Your Entity, coming January 2014!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Daniella Delaney. She’s all ready to open her shop, Heavenly Cupcakes, in one of Chicago’s sleepier districts. But she’s having a hard time convincing the local business association—namely Nick St. George—that she’s a good addition to the neighborhood. Daniella hopes that her famous red velvet cupcakes will be enough to melt any man’s heart. But Nick is no ordinary man. &lt;em&gt;He’s got fangs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;As leader of the Vamptown clan, Nick has no intention of letting Daniella breathe new life into his old haunts. But something about her leaves Nick hungry…&lt;em&gt;for more. &lt;/em&gt;He can’t control her mind like other humans, a trait that makes Daniella irresistible. Could it be that, for the first time in centuries, Nick has met his match? Love is always a force to be reckoned with. But can this vampire have his cake and eat it too?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Gwen Frost, and I go to Mythos Academy — a school of myths, magic and warrior whiz kids, where even the lowliest geek knows how to chop off somebody's head with a sword and Logan Quinn, the hottest Spartan guy in school, also happens to be the deadliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But lately, things have been weird, even for Mythos. First, mean girl Jasmine Ashton was murdered in the Library of Antiquities. Then, someone stole the Bowl of Tears, a magical artifact that can be used to bring about the second Chaos War. You know, death, destruction and lots of other bad, bad things. Freaky stuff like this goes on all the time at Mythos, but I'm determined to find out who killed Jasmine and why—especially since I should have been the one who died.  .  .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>My stomach knotted tighter, winding so hard it hurt.&lt;br&gt;Kate watched me, rubbing a piece of her hair between two fingers.&lt;br&gt;I bit my tongue, trying to work the words out.&lt;br&gt;"The boat …we're going under.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possessing powers that are feared and shunned, eighteen-year-old Alexandra “Attie” Hotep is no virgin to attacks. Her ancestors, the Zarconians-- mixed-blood inhabitants of Atlantis--were rumored to be the English fairies who kidnapped children, the Caribbean sirens that sunk ships, and the dream-like apparitions who broke into psyches. By the 1850s, they were hunted to near-extinction, leaving the existence of Atlantis and Zarconians little more than myth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a class trip turns deadly, Attie and her friends become stranded on an uncharted tropical island in the middle of the Pacific, and Attie finds herself targeted once more. With a jungle full of extinct and prowling animals, she struggles to find a compromise between keeping her friends safe and keeping her family's secret. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Doug Hutchinson—the school’s soccer star, and a handsome boy with his own secrets. But Attie and Doug soon realize the animals aren't the only threat. There is a traitor amidst the group, one that plans to turn all Zarconians into permanent myths. And Attie is next on the list.</description>

  <description>A fallen boxer.&lt;br&gt;A woman with a broken dream.&lt;br&gt;A competition…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He even makes me forget my name. One night was all it took, and I forgot everything and anything except the sexy fighter in the ring who sets my mind ablaze and my body on fire with wanting…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remington Tate is the strongest, most confusing man I’ve ever met in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s the star of the dangerous underground fighting circuit, and I’m drawn to him as I’ve never been drawn to anything in my life. I forget who I am, what I want, with just one look from him. When he’s near, I need to remind myself that I am strong–but he is stronger. And now it’s my job to keep his body working like a perfect machine, his taut muscles primed and ready to break the bones of his next opponents . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the one he’s most threatening to, now, is me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want him. I want him without fear. Without reservations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only I knew for sure what it is that he wants from me?</description>

  <description>When Janni, a young salvager, boards a space wreck, she is caught for daring to steal Darkon tech by a patroller and the one man she had thought never to see again. Several months ago she had allowed him to slip past her defences for a brief and wonderful interlude. But with both of them on either sides of the law, they had walked away. Now they are trapped on a wreck and with an alien life-force hunting them. Will the patroller save her or abandon Janni to her fate?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From a red-hot erotica writer comes an original eBook—a sensual romp across the playgrounds of the unbelievably rich and extremely sexy.&lt;/strong&gt;Elisabeth Anderson has seen Trevor and his friends at the infamous Manhattan BDSM club WhipperSnapper, where everyone calls them the BAD Boys, for “Billionaire Arrogant Doms.” The BAD Boys—Trevor Brooks, Marc Wilde, and Roman Chase—are aptly named; they’ve made money hand over fist due to their aggressive investing at the Brooks Wilde Chase Fund. These guys are so rich they can get away with anything, or so the rumors go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trevor gives Elisabeth full reign of his estate in Westchester, letting her do as she pleases. He has only two rules. Rule One: she must obey and submit to him while she is living in his house. Rule Two: always answer the blue cell phone. She’s happy to oblige, because being with Trevor makes her want to obey, to love him the way he seems to be falling for her. But Elisabeth’s never been good at being the quiet sub; she's feisty and gets off on the punishments more than she does by pleasing Trevor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth can’t submit to Trevor the way he needs her to, so his friend and business partner (and fellow BAD Boy) Roman takes her in hand. But love triangles can have sharp edges...and somebody’s bound to get hurt.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was another fail for me. <br /><br />I was intrigued by the concept, to be honest. I have no problem reading about people who are into hard-core BDSM lifestyles, people who want to live in a master-slave type of relationship. I find those types of arrangements interesting, and I was looking forward...]]>

  <description>A short story by Justin David &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie likes knitting and gender-bending: it's the 1980s, the West Midlands, he's on the cusp of adolescence and he cannot understand the gulf between the lives of the pop stars in his scrapbook and his own humdrum existence. He's always sought the approval of the grown-ups around him but now he's starting to question them: Why is Uncle Freddy so mean? And what is Grandad's problem? A story for anyone who's ever felt different.</description>

  <description>LEAVE IT TO CHANCE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor “Elle” Chance, that is—a high-flying dirigible pilot with a taste for adventure and the heroine of this edgy new series that transforms elements of urban fantasy, steampunk, and paranormal romance into pure storytelling gold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is 1903, and the world is divided between light and shadow. On the side of light is a wondrous science that has transformed everyday life by harnessing magical energies to ingenious new technologies. But each advance of science has come at the expense of shadow—the traditional realm of the supernatural.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now two ancient powers are preparing to strike back. Blood-sucking immortal Nightwalkers and their spellcasting Alchemist allies have a plan to cover the whole world in shadow. All they require is the sacrifice of a certain young woman whose past conceals a dangerous secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when they come after Elle, they get more than they bargained for. This enterprising young woman, the daughter of a scientific genius, has reserves of bravery and determination that even she scarcely suspects. Now she is about to meet her match in more ways than one: a handsome yet infuriating Warlock named Hugh Marsh, whose agenda is as suspect as his charms are annoyingly irresistible.</description>

  <description>Two months after dying, seventeen-year-old witch Graylee Perez wakes up in her twin sister Charlene’s body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Gray finds a way back inside her own body, she’s stuck being Charlene every twenty-hour hours. Her sister has left precise instructions on how Gray should dress and behave. Looking like a prep isn’t half as bad as hanging out with Charlene’s snotty friends and gropey boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The “normals” of McKinley High might be quick to write her behavior off as post-traumatic stress, but warlock Raj McKenna is the only person who suspects Gray has returned from the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Gray has to solve the mystery of her death and resurrection and disentangle herself from Charlene’s body before she disappears for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Entangled is a young adult paranormal fantasy romance suitable for ages 15 and up.***</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An enchanting eBook debut about a world where your fantasies come true and nothing is quite what it seems. Come on in to realize your heart’s darkest desire...&lt;/strong&gt;Virginal twenty-two-year-old Mary has just inherited a sex shop in Florida from her mother. After a long drive from California, she arrives at her deceased mother’s house only to be confronted immediately with two equally sexy strangers: the strong, silent John and the irreverent, taunting Max. She’s innocent, almost completely untouched, but feels a completely uncharacteristic pull to each man. Shocking even herself, she realizes it’s not an unwelcome desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max is a playboy who knows how to give women what they want, but John… John might just be able to give Mary something even she doesn’t know she needs…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Just because you’re large, doesn’t mean you want to be in charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High schooler Alex Johnson suddenly finds himself a muscle teen titan, thanks to a strange genetic treatment his late father gave him to save his life as an infant.

What  Alex and Ryan don’t know is that their lives are about to take an ominous turn. Will Alex be able to take the bull by the horns?</description>

  <description>Stephen Spear is blond, blue-eyed and blessed with countless talents. In matters of the heart, he assumed it would be no different. It is quite a shock when he falls in love for the first time, to find his desire is unrequited. But he will have his way — even if he has to cheat, lie and plot.</description>

  <description>Ella Stevens never knew a mother’s love. Her fierce independence was always seen as the keystone of her whole identity—unfettered by romantic involvements or family demands—until the day she moved to Heidelberg, Germany and her world began to unravel. There, she discovered the terrible secret her mother died to protect. There, she stumbled onto a hidden time portal that took her to 1620 Heidelberg where the brutal realities of life were not restricted to just the poor and the infirm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fighting to survive in a world she’s ill-equipped to understand let alone function, Ella is befriended by a convent of nuns who stand on the executioner’s block of one of the bloodiest butchers in all of Europe: the Warlord Krüger. Determined to help her new friends, Ella, with the aid of a very sexy United States Marshal, learns the hard way that when it comes to the things that really matter in life—love, trust and friendship—sometimes the truth is the least important thing of all.</description>

  <description>James Killian learns the hard way that smaller towns are full of bigots. When he comes out to his father he is not only kicked out of his home but off the Quadruple J where he works as the ranch foreman. With nowhere to go and little money, his savior comes in the unlikely form of his older brother’s best friend, the man he’s been in love with for over half his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ethan Whitehall is a successful rancher and a well respected man in his community. His ranch the Tin Star has been in Ethan’s family for generations and affords him a certain prestige and power in the small town he calls home.  Ethan knows without a doubt that all of that could shatter if his sexual orientation were to ever become public. But when he learns his best friend’s younger brother’s banishment and the reasons behind it, Ethan can’t help but get involved. He’s always had a soft spot where Jamie Killian was concerned, and it may very well be his downfall.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"Sex is the answer to death."—Charlotte Roche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her controversial first novel, &lt;em&gt;Wetlands&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; called "a cri de coeur against the oppression of a waxed, shaved, douched and otherwise sanitized women’s world”, Roche wrote about sex and the female body in an unprecedentedly frank and intimate way. Roche's second novel, &lt;em&gt;Wrecked&lt;/em&gt; is just as raw and powerful as her debut, but is a more mature and impressive work that deals with sex, death, fidelity, and the question of what is expected from a twenty-first century wife and mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It's easier to give a blow job than to make coffee." That's what Elizabeth Kiehl, mother of seven-year-old Liza thinks to herself, after a particularly lengthy and inventive bout of sex with her husband Georg—recounted in detail over the book's first twenty pages. Elizabeth goes to great efforts to pleasure her husband in the bedroom, and also is an extremely thoughtful and caring mother to her daughter. But the perfect mother and wife act she puts on hides a painful past and a tragic rift in her psyche, which she is working through in weekly sessions with her therapist. Sex is the other tool that she uses to relax herself. Elizabeth and Georg watch porn together, and even go off on joint trips to a local brothel for threesomes with prostitutes while their daughter is at school. But is their relationship unhealthy, even tragic, or just a very modern marriage?</description>

      <![CDATA[Ugh. I hate not finishing a book that I started, even more so when it is a read-to-review book (a Goodreads win). However, I just couldn't push myself to read this book past 1/4 of the way through. I knew from the first page that this book wasn't for me. I didn't connect with the 3rd person writi...]]>

  <description>Struggling with her father's death, Nina meets Jared Ryel, presumably by chance. However it soon becomes clear that he knows more about her than even close friends. When her father's former associates begin following her in the dark, Nina learns that her father was not the man she thought he was, but a thief who stole from demons. In searching for the truth behind her father's death, she stumbles upon something she never expected, and something Hell wants, that only she holds the key for. Jared risks everything to keep the women he was born to save, by sharing the secret he was sworn to protect.</description>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Chloe witnesses her mother’s murder at the hands of a vampire. Before the vampire can kidnap her, there is an unexpected rescue by a group of vampire hunters. Overwhelmed by the feeling of safety, Chloe passes out and they whisk her away to their small community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Chloe wakes, she comes face to face with the only other living relative, besides her mother, whom she has ever met: her grandfather. Chloe’s mother kept her hidden from the family; now, Chloe tries to unveil the family secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through her grandfather, she learns her mother was a vampire hunter. In fact, her entire family is descended from the powerful bloodlines of vampire hunters. Chloe agrees to join the family she has never known for one reason only: Chloe vows to kill the vampire responsible for her mother’s murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With vengeance in her soul, Chloe is even more determined to follow through on her vow when she discovers the true identity of her enemy and how he is connected to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Vampire Hunter's Daughter is the first in a series of short stories by Jennifer Malone Wright.</description>

  <description>Billionaire Shane Trant is used to getting what he wants. What he can't buy, he takes. When he sees Bristol Deatrich for the first time in over ten years, he knows he wants her. But there's a problem. Only complete possession of her mind and body will satisfy him. He's not sure the sweet little Bristol is ready for his brand of extreme carnal play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that's not going to stop him from trying. After all, he learned a long time ago, nobody wins if they don't take risks. If this risk pays off, they'll both win.</description>

  <description>The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In the violent country of Ludania, the classes are strictly divided by the language they speak. The smallest transgression, like looking a member of a higher class in the eye while they are speaking their native tongue, results in immediate execution. Seventeen-year-old Charlaina has always been able to understand the languages of all classes, and she's spent her life trying to hide her secret. The only place she can really be free is the drug-fueled underground clubs where people go to shake off the oppressive rules of the world they live in. It's there that she meets a beautiful and mysterious boy named Max who speaks a language she's never heard before . . . and her secret is almost exposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie is intensely attracted to Max, even though she can't be sure where his real loyalties lie. As the emergency drills give way to real crisis and the violence escalates, it becomes clear that Charlie is the key to something much bigger: her country's only chance for freedom from the terrible power of a deadly regime.</description>

  <description>A witch's ancient curse propels talented flutist Gigi Perrin back to A.D. 408, to the court of the depraved Roman Emperor Honorius and his admirable sister, Princess Galla Placidia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There, Gigi grapples with her disbelief about what has happened, and with the strange, new world of violent politics, social upheaval, and Visigoth barbarians straining at the very gates of an empire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through it all, she must struggle with her powerful attraction to a pagan senator and military commander, Quintus Magnus, a man exotically different from anyone she has ever known. On the brink of a dark and war-torn age, Gigi joins forces with Magnus, battling to save a princess and her people, and ultimately finding love amid the chaos, before the fall of Rome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sensuality Level: Sensual"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan O'Neill: Two authors writing as one, Cary Morgan Frates and Deborah O'Neill Cordes invite the reader on a journey to worlds of ancient splendor and abiding love.</description>

  <description>In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war going on between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Yet none of them relishes killing more than Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only purebred vampire left on earth, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who murdered his parents centuries ago. But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed-leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate-Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead-a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.</description>

  <description>The scorching tale of one girl, two brothers and a love triangle…that’s not. Olivia Townsend is nothing special. She’s just a girl working her way through college so she can return home to help her father run his business. She’s determined not to be the second woman in his life to abandon him, even if it means putting her own life on hold. To Olivia, it’s clear what she must do. Plain and simple. Black and white. But clear becomes complicated when she meets Cash and Nash Davenport. They’re brothers. Twins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cash is everything she’s always wanted in a guy. He’s a dangerous, sexy bad boy who wants her in his bed at any cost. He turns her insides to mush and, with just one kiss, makes her forget why he’s no good for her. Nash is everything she’s ever needed in a guy. He’s successful, responsible and intensely passionate. But he’s taken. Very taken, by none other than Marissa, Liv’s rich, beautiful cousin. That doesn’t stop Olivia from melting every time he looks at her, though. With just one touch, he makes her forget why they can never be together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black and white turns to shades of gray when Olivia discovers the boys are hiding something, something that should make her run as far and as fast as she can. But it’s too late to run. Olivia’s already involved. And in love. With both of them. Both brothers make her heart tremble. Both brothers set her body on fire. She wants them both. And they want her. How will she ever choose between them?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;She doesn’t want to deal with the past...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, Ashley Fitzgerald witnessed the death of her parents in a tragic fire and blocked the memory.  She pretends to have moved on, is a successful artist and photographer, until the morning she opens her door to a stranger she assumes is a model and asks him to strip to his briefs .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;He wants to expose the truth....&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wealthy businessman Ron Noble has the body, the jet, the fast cars and the women, but he hides a deadly secret.  His father started the fire that killed Ashley’s parents.  Now someone is leaving him clues that could exonerate his father and they lead to Ashley’s door.  Blindsided by the blazing attraction between them and a merciless killer silencing anyone who was there the night of the fire, Ron dare not tell Ashley the truth.  Yet the answer he seeks may very well tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;While a demented arsonist...SLOW BURN(s)...and plots his ultimate revenge.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A smart, unexpected romance from an award-winning author.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Salvador Resendez--Salva to his friends--appears to have it all. His Mexican immigrant family has high expectations, and Salva intends to fulfill them. He's student body president, quarterback of the football team, and has a near-perfect GPA. Everyone loves him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Especially Beth Courant, AKA the walking disaster area. Dreamy and shy, Beth is used to blending into the background. But she's also smart, and she has serious plans for her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Popular guy and bookish girl--the two have almost nothing in common. Until fate throws them together and the attraction is irresistible. Soon Beth is pushing Salva to set his sights higher than ever--because she knows he has more to offer, more than even he realizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then tragedy strikes--and threatens to destroy everything that Salva has worked for. Will Beth's love be enough to save him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thoughtful and romantic, this is a beautifully written story about following your heart and fulfilling your potential.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It's a night like any other on board the Icarus. Then, catastrophe strikes: the massive luxury spaceliner is yanked out of hyperspace and plummets into the nearest planet. Lilac LaRoux and Tarver Merendsen survive. And they seem to be alone.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilac is the daughter of the richest man in the universe. Tarver comes from nothing, a young war hero who learned long ago that girls like Lilac are more trouble than they’re worth. But with only each other to rely on, Lilac and Tarver must work together, making a tortuous journey across the eerie, deserted terrain to seek help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, against all odds, Lilac and Tarver find a strange blessing in the tragedy that has thrown them into each other’s arms. Without the hope of a future together in their own world, they begin to wonder—would they be better off staying here forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes when they uncover the truth behind the chilling whispers that haunt their every step. Lilac and Tarver may find a way off this planet. But they won’t be the same people who landed on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A timeless love story, THESE BROKEN STARS sets into motion a sweeping science fiction series of companion novels. The Starbound Trilogy: Three worlds. Three love stories. One enemy.</description>

  <description>Emma Walters didn't choose to be a spy, but when her crazy father was caught selling bombs to the wrong people, she was given a choice--become a spy or rot in jail. Her exciting new life as agent Kate Wells becomes more so when she discovers her new boss is the agent--undercover and investigating her father at the time--who took her to third base. Emma is already half in love with the dark and dangerous Chase Sanders. Kate wants nothing more than for him to finish what he started, but he's the devil incarnate. And one doesn't make deals or fall in love with the devil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If someone had told Chase he'd fall in love with a certain virgin when he was on his last mission, he would have shot them dead, sniper style. She was nothing more than collateral damage, damn it. But watching the sexy new spy morph into a bombshell killing machine is too much to bear. So when the powers that be command him to train her in the art of seduction for her first--and possibly last--mission, he's scared witless. Making love to Kate means preparing her for sex with another man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow, Chase has to find a way to get Kate in--and out--of her mission without dying. And without falling in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book Contains: Explicit and graphic sex, light bondage, light BDSM, anal sex, sex toys, m/f/m, a hot, dominating spy boss and a spunky, bomb-making heroine.</description>

  <description>Harry Crewe is an orphan girl who comes to live in Damar, the desert country shared by the Homelanders and the secretive, magical Free Hillfolk. When Corlath, the Hillfolk King, sees her for the first time, he is shaken -- for he can tell that she is something more than she appears to be. He will soon realize what Harry has never guessed: she is to become Harimad-sol, King's Rider, and carry the Blue Sword, Gonturan, which no woman has wielded since the legendary Lady Aerin bore it into battle, generations past.</description>

  <description>Cassidy Monarch had dreams to sing, to be famous, to tour the world at the head of his own rock band. Then his parents were killed in a tragic accident, leaving him to raise his two siblings. Determined to hold on to what remained of his family, Cassidy settled into an ordinary life, his dreams of fame reduced to occasional nights of singing at karaoke dives. But his careful, ordinary life began to fray with his new job, and the beautiful, charming boss who reminds him of all the things he tried to stop wanting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malcolm Osborne is a classic rags to riches story, a foster child who wound up with the perfect family and more money than he knows what to do with. He's wealthy, beautiful, successful, and completely miserable. Then he hires a new worker for his office, a young, hard-working man with a sadness in his eyes that Malcolm aches to banish, hoping that in doing so he will be rid of his own loneliness as well.</description>

  <description>Brooke Hart was beautiful, smart, and groomed from birth to deal with adversity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her widowed father did his best to raise his baby girl to be a strong-minded business woman. Then she found Tanner. Just when her world seemed perfect, everything turned upside down.&lt;br&gt;Following Tanner’s tragic death, Brooke joins a start-up company that is developing a cure for the disease that killed the love of her life. Just before the treatment is ready to market, the company is gobbled up by a giant conglomerate. She moves to the acquiring company as its youngest VP and becomes enamored with CEO Chase Allman—only to be betrayed by him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke rebounds again and sets out on a personal journey to discover what will truly make her happy. Sparks fly when she and Chase cross paths again in an unlikely way. Now, they need each other to find an abducted child and save thousands of people.</description>

  <description>To survive, they must embrace what they most despise . . . in themselves and each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Turner is everything women want most in a man—charismatic, successful, drop-dead gorgeous. Except he’s not a man—he’s a monster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way Mitch can protect others from his monstrous side is to stop them from getting too close…that and a 7x7 foot cage. Isolated by his genetic curse, he spends his life hurting people emotionally, driving them away before Hyde can harm them physically. But, after a night of the best sex Mitch has ever had, he realizes that might be impossible. Except the woman he wakes up with claims she doesn’t remember any of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden Colfax is everything men want most, men other than Mitch, that is. She’s kind, honest to a fault and sickeningly sweet. To rid herself of the monsters that haunted her broken childhood, Eden doesn’t lie, doesn’t curse, and definitely never wakes up naked in strangers’ beds…until the day she does. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the flashbacks start—places she’s never been, people she’s never met, blood she’s never spilled. She discovers she’s split into two parts—the woman she thought she knew and another who is capable of anything. And the only person with any answers is the one man she never wants to see again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What neither of them know is that someone is watching them both, manipulating them, determined to see just how evil the two of them really are. And when the truth begins to seep through the cracks, leaving them nowhere to turn but each other, they will be forced into a partnership neither had expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because in life, who you trust is as important as who you are. And when you can’t even trust yourself, sometimes the only person you can rely on is the last person on Earth you should be falling for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** This novel is intended for adults only, as it includes lots of cursing, descriptive sex, biting sarcasm, and themes similar to those in Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, from which this story was inspired.</description>

  <description>If you’re looking for a story about a good, humble girl, who’s been hurt by someone she thought she could trust, only to find out she’s not as vulnerable as she thought she was and discovers an empowering side of herself that falls in love with the guy who helps her find that self, blah, blah, blah...then you’re gonna’ hate my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because mine is not the story you read every time you bend back the cover of the latest trend novel. It’s not the “I can do anything, now that I’ve found you/I’m misunderstood but one day you’ll find me irresistible because of it” tale. Why? Because, if I was being honest with you, I’m a complete witch. There’s nothing redeeming about me. I’m a friend using, drug abusing, sex addict from Los Angeles. I’m every girlfriend’s worst nightmare and every boy’s fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Sophie Price... And this is the story about how I went from the world’s most envied girl to the girl no one wanted around and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</description>

  <description>A man abused and discarded is left to rebuild himself with naught but vengeance in his heart. A youth cruelly torn from all he knew and loved is cast adrift with no hope for the future. What will happen when Fate thrusts them together?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is known as Ruaidhri and his extraordinary strengths and stamina are said to be born of the Devil. His ferocity is matched solely by his ruthlessness. For seven years, he has sailed his ship the Taibhse with one goal in mind: to avenge the years of torment he suffered at the hands of a depraved Danish lord. He has one final plan to succeed, but he searches yet for the implement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His family destroyed by violence and his body enslaved to a brutal master, Andrew’s future promises only misery. He is saved from this desolate fate by a pirate captain with fiery hair and an ultimatum; help him achieve his revenge and go free, or be sent to a horrific, painful death. As Andrew struggles with the choice of slave or assassin, he finds that all is not as it seems aboard the corsair’s ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pain is tempered by pleasure and loss consumed by love in the flames stoked by&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…The Red King.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this is an erotic m/m romance intended for mature audiences. It contains explicit sexual situations, frank language, torture, and non-graphic descriptions of abuse of a minor.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Being confronted on the beach by a sexy stranger wasn't part of Natalie Conner's plans for a peaceful morning taking photos. And why on earth would he think she's taking pictures of him, anyway? Who is he? One thing’s for sure, he’s hot, and incredibly romantic, feeding Natalie’s wounded soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke Williams just wants the world to give him a break, so seeing yet another camera aimed at his face has him ready to pounce on the beauty behind the lens. When he finds out she has no idea who he is, he's intrigued and more than a little tempted by her. Natalie has a body made for sex, a sassy mouth and Luke can’t get enough of her, but he’s not ready to tell her who he really his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Natalie is a no nonsense girl who doesn’t do well with lies and secrets. What will happen to this new relationship when she discovers what Luke’s hiding?</description>

  <description>Sometimes life doesn’t go according to plan. Sometimes it’s better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sienna Compton has it all figured out. Her life’s goals are set and it is all systems go. At least, it was. Until her long-time boyfriend Josh threw a ringer into the master plan, requesting a “break” from their relationship. Now she’s left alone during the long, cold Wyoming winter, questioning what her heart has always believed to be true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Lennon is facing an uncertain future. When a tragic accident leaves him unable to pursue his career as a professional bull rider, he finds himself at Compass Ranch, working to help Sienna’s father, Seth, build his horse breeding business. One look at Sienna has Daniel envisioning things he never imagined wanting—a permanent home, love, marriage—and he’s willing to use all the red hot tricks in his sexual arsenal to melt the ice surrounding Sienna’s broken heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When lust turns to genuine emotion, can Daniel convince Sienna to take a chance on something different and unexpected? Can he persuade her to consider a new path, one that will lead her directly to his arms…forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Roping and riding, past and future, cold winter and fiery desire, lust and love all come together in this new Compass series. Saddle up and hang on. The Comptons are back!</description>

  <description>"Smart, savvy, sexy and a slammin' great read. I LOVE Jackie Mercer!" ~Cindy Gerard, NYT bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DECEPTION&lt;br&gt;Jackie Mercer can’t abide deception. Hey, a woman who single-handedly built the Mercer Detective Agency from the ground up has a right to expect honesty in a relationship. Tell that to the creep who, only this morning, she thought might be Mr. Right. Wrong! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DANGER&lt;br&gt;Her day only gets worse from there. An ominous message arrives accompanied by the photo of a man she hasn’t seen in ten years: You were the last one to see him alive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DESIRE&lt;br&gt;Jackie's own first rule is simple: never mix business with pleasure. Unfortunately the only applicant for the investigator position she badly needs filled is a hunky younger man. Derrick Dawson has pleasure written all over his rock-hard body and soon both her business and her world quickly spin way out of control. Time for chocolate and a shot of Old No. 7—not necessarily in that order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISASTER&lt;br&gt;She’s in real trouble when a second message, this one including a dead body, drops into the mix. Jackie does what any smart Texas woman would do: she kicks butt and takes names, while the mystery spiraling around her long lost lover and her attraction to Derrick Dawson plunge her into a tangled web of shocking secrets and deadly deceptions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackie has her hands full and her heart on the line—time to play DIRTY.</description>

  <description>The first time Travis North lays eyes on Liana McDermott, she’s wearing the most hideous bridesmaid dress he’s ever seen. He doesn't immediately recognize the world-famous super model who is attending her cousin Enid's wedding at the country club he owns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to Enid's shameless matchmaking, Travis and Liana become acquainted and later embark on a two-week fling intended to be free of emotion and entanglement. As Liana's return to work gets closer, however, Travis wonders how he'll ever let her go when the time comes while Liana considers whether he might be her true north.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two high-powered careers, two amazing weeks and a love that comes along just once in a lifetime. Is she ready to give up her career for a different kind of life? Does he want the same things she does? After insisting on an emotionless affair, she can't very well ask him. Or can she?</description>

  <description>In the span of a single tumultuous evening, Amal calls off his arranged marriage, comes out to his conservative parents, gets disowned, goes on a bender... and wakes up the next morning to find a lanky, dread-locked vagrant names TJ in his kitchen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TJ claims that the two have made a drunken pact to travel from Berkeley, California to Providence, Rhode Island. As it happens, Amal promised his sister he'd be in Providence for her graduation the following week. As for TJ... well, he's got his own reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agreement is simple: Amal does the driving, TJ pays the way - but a 3500 mile journey leaves plenty of time for things to get complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Volume 1 collects the first 13 chapters of EK Weaver's free online graphic novel.</description>

  <description>It's like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethan and Brice and Parker and Dylan get off the bus. They've pretended this whole time, just as they've pretended for the last three years, not to notice that Rylan has his arm draped casually over the blue plastic bar at the back of my seat. They pretend not to know that the second the get off the bus (scratch that, he's not even going to wait for that second, it happens before the bus has even come to a complete stop) he'll lower that arm over my shoulders, or drop his hand forward to fuck with my hair and knuckle my neck a little. He's like that; likes touching me in public, holding hands, kissing. Though, in truth, hand holding has always struck me as...more intimate somehow. And he does it in that easy way of his, in the way that makes people around us almost forget to look twice. That's what he is. He's casual and easy and confident. Convinces spectators that this is as perfectly normal as it should be. He knows, at all times, as far as I can tell, what the fuck is going on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is the difference between us. He knows. I don't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Status: Complete&lt;br&gt;Word count: approx. 50,197&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>I didn't know. How could I? All through high school, I was beaten up and teased for being gay. But I wasn't gay. Or didn't think I was. Now Wes, the guy across the street who's taken me under his wing and been the best friend I've ever had, won't stop invading my dreams, hell, my every waking thought. Am I gay? Because I'm thinking I'd like to kiss him. Actually, I'm thinking there's a lot more I'd like to do with his mouth and the rest of that tall, confident, muscular body. Ah, man... I'm so gay!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what if he doesn't feel the same way about me? And, Jesus, what about my parents? And those bastards from school are still around. And I'm supposed to go to college this fall... Shit, I need to sit down. I can't breathe and I'm about to shake apart. Then Wes puts his hand on the back of my neck, gives me one of those encouraging squeezes and his bright smile, and everything's okay again. Yeah, I'm hooked. Oh, boy...</description>

  <description>Cade’s always taken risks…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cade takes cares of his sick younger sister by doing what he does best--cage fighting and starring in adult movies, his newest harebrained moneymaking scheme designed to pay for his sister’s growing medical bills. But when his latest gig finds him admitted to the ER sporting an erection from hell, thanks to the little pill given to him by the director, he can’t get the pretty little nurse who treated him out of his head, even though he knows she’s so far out of his league it should be illegal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexa’s always played it safe…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tired of being pigeonholed as the sweet, innocent one, hardworking nursing student Alexa has been looking for ways to break out of her Goody Two-shoes image. When her friend suggests the outlandish idea of losing her virginity to the sexy and sure-to-be-skilled porn star, Alexa is mortified. But then when Cade refuses her proposition, she finds herself pissed off and embarrassed.  When she tracks him down to give him a piece of her mind, she isn’t prepared for what she finds. Watching him care for his little sister tugs at her heart, and suddenly it’s no longer just about losing her virginity, but about helping Cade. Because Lord help her, she might actually be falling for a porn star…</description>

But when Zara’s boyfriend is accused of insider trading, her perfect world implodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrown out of work by security and stalked by the press, Zara’s life can’t get any worse. Or can it? A snap decision (and a few wines too many) sees Zara fleeing to Africa to work as a temporary wildlife volunteer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just when things start to cool down at home, Zara realizes her troubles have only just begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Zara’s designer wardrobe survive?&lt;br&gt;Will a supermodel ruin her only chance at happiness?&lt;br&gt;Can a Birkin bag really solve her problems?&lt;br&gt;And will Zara want her old life back at the end of it all…&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In the harrowing prequel to The Lost and Found series, three embattled Marines must deal with their devastating physical and emotional injuries in a world that seems to have turned against them. &lt;br&gt;When the rescue helicopter crashes into his convoy in Iraq, Marine First Sergeant Duncan Wilde struggles with the loss of men, his career and the use of his body. Things can't get much worse. Until his fiancée decides she has to move on with her life, and that of her unborn child by another man.&lt;br&gt;Sergeant Chad Lowell knew when he went to war that it would come with a price. And it did. A young Marine under his command is killed by a landmine. Chad's left with one less leg and a mountain of recriminations. That doesn't mean he wants to be a pitied by every female he comes in contact with.&lt;br&gt;Gunnery Sergeant John Palmer is furious at the hand he's been dealt. He's served his country faithfully, if not without antagonism, for many years. Now they're turning him out like a relative who has overstayed his welcome. And, since he's not even a real man anymore, maybe it is time to move on permanently. &lt;br&gt;Can these wounded warriors use a friendship borne out of adversity to form a partnership rescuing others? And can they find real love in spite of their challenges?</description>

  <description>Can the love of a lifetime be forever changed by one pink line? Dina Silver’s tender, absorbing novel, One Pink Line, is the warmhearted, wry story of love, loss and family, as seen through the prism of one singular, spirited young couple who find themselves in a predicament that changes the course of their lives, and those closest to them. With heart, humor and compassion, this debut work of women’s fiction is certain to stir anyone who relishes a good laugh, can stand a good cry, and, above all believes in the redemptive power of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unique, contemporary story gives readers a dual perspective. Sydney Shephard, a sweet-tempered, strong-natured college senior is young, in love with an exceptional man, and unexpectedly pregnant. Faced with a child she never planned for, she is forced to relay this news to her neurotic mother, relinquish her youth, and risk losing the love of her life. Then there’s Grace, a daughter, who believed she was a product of this great love, grows to realize her existence is not what she assumed, and is left with profound and puzzling questions about who she really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spanning generations and every imaginable emotion, One Pink Line reveals how two points of view can be dramatically at odds, and perhaps ultimately reconciled. Simultaneously deeply felt and lighthearted, One Pink Line deftly mines how the choices we make are able to alter so many lives, and how doing the right thing and living honestly can bring unexpected, hard-won happiness. It’s a must-read for anyone who relishes a great love story, absorbing characters, and plenty of laughs along the way.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Opposites in every way . . . except the one that matters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaw Landon loved Rule Archer from the moment she laid eyes on him. Rule is everything a straight--A pre-med student like Shaw shouldn’t want--and the only person she’s never tried to please. She isn’t afraid of his scary piercings and tattoos or his wild attitude. Though she knows that Rule is wrong for her, her heart just won’t listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a rebel like Rule Archer, Shaw Landon is a stuck-up, perfect princess-and his dead twin brother’s girl. She lives by other people’s rules; he makes his own. He doesn’t have time for a good girl like Shaw-even if she’s the only one who can see the person he truly is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a short skirt, too many birthday cocktails, and spilled secrets lead to a night neither can forget. Now, Shaw and Rule have to figure out how a girl like her and a guy like him are supposed to be together without destroying their love . . . or each other.</description>

  <description>Atticus O’Sullivan, last of the Druids, doesn’t care much for witches. Still, he’s about to “make nice” with the local coven by signing a mutually beneficial non-aggression treaty—when suddenly the witch population in modern day Tempe, Arizona, quadruples overnight. The new girls are not just bad, they’re badasses with a dark history on the German side of WWII.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a fallen angel feasting on local high school students, a horde of Bacchants blowing in from Vegas with their special brand of deadly decadence, and a dangerously sexy Celtic goddess of fire vying for his attention, Atticus is having trouble scheduling the witch-hunt. But aided by his magical sword, his neighbor’s rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and his vampire attorney, Atticus is ready to sweep the town and show the witchy women they picked the wrong Druid to hex.</description>

  <description>When Ryan meets Sara, his new next-door neighbor in a rickety old San Francisco apartment building, both are in a state of emotional turmoil. Ryan, a high-priced prostitute, is trying to break free of his old life, but his handler, Catherine, won't let him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara's medieval mystery series has just been terminated by her publisher, and she is now trying to write a historical thriller. Sara doesn't dare make the first move toward deepening their relationship because she is older than Ryan, not as physically attractive, and halfway convinced he is gay and that if she pushes him she will lose his friendship, which she values. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this realistically gritty, sometimes violent, and gripping tale, Leone reveals the seamier side of society's maneuvering while she spins an unconventional romance between two unhappy people who find that love, like respect, can grow out of friendship and shared experiences and that new beginnings are indeed possible for those with the determination and courage to pursue them.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A funny, honest novel about being out, being proud . . . and being ready for something else.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rafe is a normal teenager from Boulder, Colorado. He plays soccer. He's won skiing prizes. He likes to write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, oh yeah, he's gay. He's been out since 8th grade, and he isn't teased, and he goes to other high schools and talks about tolerance and stuff. And while that's important, all Rafe really wants is to just be a regular guy. Not that GAY guy. To have it be a part of who he is, but not the headline, every single time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when he transfers to an all-boys' boarding school in New England, he decides to keep his sexuality a secret -- not so much going back in the closet as starting over with a clean slate. But then he sees a classmate breaking down. He meets a teacher who challenges him to write his story. And most of all, he falls in love with Ben . . . who doesn't even know that love is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This witty, smart, coming-out-again story will appeal to gay and straight kids alike as they watch Rafe navigate being different, fitting in, and what it means to be himself.</description>

  <description>William Drake’s living an ordinary life—he's got a job, a dog, and a house near Lake Superior—when a frantic call for help from his ne'er-do-well sister, Katrina, throws a big rancher-shaped kink in the works. Proving that no good deed goes unpunished, Will’s arrival at the Montana ranch belonging to Katrina's fiancé, Martin, is marked by a flat tire and unexpected help from a tall, dark, and handsome Good Samaritan who turns out to be Elijah Hunter, Martin's brother, and the most unsettling man Will has ever met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli’s fury over Katrina’s misdeeds boils over onto Will, and he demands that Will remain on the ranch until the matter is resolved. While Will can take Katrina's place, Eli doesn’t make it easy, testing Will at every turn, but Will’s uncompromising morals exceed even Eli’s exacting standards. The attraction growing between them is further complicated by Eli’s ultimatum: he's still holding Katrina to the pre-nup she signed... unless Will agrees to marry Eli instead.</description>

  <description>A memorable and moving page-turner about two very different women, each yearning to create a family of her own&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if the thing you most longed for was resting on a two week wait? From the author of the international bestselling &lt;em&gt;One Moment, One Morning&lt;/em&gt;, comes a moving portrait about what it truly means to be a family. After a health scare, Brighton-based Lou is forced to confront the fact that her time to have a baby is running out. She can't imagine a future without children, but her partner doesn't seem to feel the same way, and she's not sure whether she could go it alone. Meanwhile, in Yorkshire, Cath is longing to start a family with her husband, Rich. No one would be happier to have children than Rich, but Cath is infertile. Could these strangers help one another? With her deft exploration of raw emotions and her celebration of the joy and resilience of friendship, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Two Week Wait&lt;/em&gt; is Sarah Rayner at her best. </description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Snow Wolf: Reincarnation&lt;/em&gt; is a fast-paced, sweeping tale of epic fiction in the Wuxia (martial arts) tradition. Warriors, battles, supernatural powers, prophecy, and destiny collide in a whirlwind of action, intrigue, and romance that links past and present. On the plains of the China/Mongolia border in legendary times, wolves and men fight for domination of the steppe. Suthachai, a young warrior, finds himself mysteriously poisoned. He will die a slow death unless an antidote is found, and all the clues as to who poisoned him point to the legend of Snow Wolf: once revered as a goddess, a great heroine, a master strategist, and savior of her people. Snow Wolf may provide the answers he needs to save his own life, but at what cost?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Embarking on a desperate quest to discover the secret of Snow Wolf, Suthachai becomes embroiled with the Dragon Lodges, secret and mysterious, who rule the land as enemies of Snow Wolf and stand in the way of his quest. Little does Suthachai know that Snow Wolf has already devised a plan—using him—to rid the world of the Dragon Lodges forever: if he can survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Lit Yu&lt;/strong&gt; lives in New York City. This is his first novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>How does a man like Paddy McGuire, a natural top who’s never had so much as a finger up his ass, let alone another man’s cock, end up training to be a submissive slave, prepared to give his cherry to some ruthless master? A convoluted path is the answer and a story in itself, involving an unfortunate debt, stage managed sex, a threat to his mother, and a voyeuristic gangster called Vinnie the Vandal!&lt;br&gt;Irishman Paddy is big and butch, painfully handsome and in his early twenties. He’s a natural top with the devil’s own temper and lethal fighting skills; a hell of a stud who can fuck like the best... and most importantly of all, he’s an anal virgin prepared to give up his cherry as the only means he can settle the debt. Because as luck would have it - that makes him a perfect match for an Arab Sheik who’s after a new slave.&lt;br&gt;Coerced into agreeing, Paddy is introduced to Angus McCloud who has been commissioned to source this odd requirement, which is explained to Paddy in the starkest terms...</description>

  <description>Sammy, a 14-year-old fugitive, accidentally discovers he has the powers of a Psion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plucked off the streets, he is thrust into the rigorously-disciplined environment of Psion Beta headquarters. As a new Beta, Sammy must hone his newfound abilities using holographic fighting simulations, stealth training missions, and complex war games. His fellow trainees are other kids competing to prove their worth so they can graduate and contribute to the war effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the stifling competition at headquarters isolates Sammy from his peers. Learning to use his incredible abilities powers is difficult enough, but when things go horribly wrong on a routine training mission, he must rely on the other Betas to stay alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Silent War is at a tipping point; even one boy can be the difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to do so, he must survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Strictly business? Try telling that to her heart…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worth It&lt;/em&gt;, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexander Worth, President and CEO of Worth Luxury Goods, is a man never to be crossed. His unwavering sense of responsibility to the family business requires him to always be in complete and utter control. Until it comes to Tessa Crawford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s quietly professional, shy, voluptuous…and she works for him. Which means she is the one woman he must never touch, no matter how hard his gut twists with need for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After rising above her disadvantaged childhood, Tessa knows the last thing she should do is risk throwing it all away by falling into bed with her sexy boss. But on an extended European business trip, all self-imposed barriers burn away in the heat of their sizzling chemistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once back home, though, whispers of corporate espionage turn into full-blown scandal—and Tessa finds out the hard way where Alex’s loyalties lie. Determined to soldier on, she picks herself up and carries on with a secret, yet welcomed burden. Never guessing that Alex will make a reappearance in her life, ready to show her once and for all that family does, indeed, come first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Contains a sweet-yet-strong woman, and a bossy alpha male brought to his knees by the woman he desperately loves. Involves enough begging and groveling that the reader may be tempted to “accidentally” leave it for her significant other to “find”. For instructional purposes only, of course!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s Christmas Eve, and the boys from The Wild Side are seriously partying. First they’re at home, where Paddy gets a festive treat - his master and two slaves working him over in a torrent of bondage sex. Then they move on to the club where Sven and Marco get to play, enjoying an old friend and an old enemy as well! Finally in his office, the owner of the The Wild Side, Big Bad Angus McCloud, takes mighty offence with a treacherous master – it’s another Christmas treat as Angus and Paddy give the man a lesson he’ll never forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three seasonal scenes from The Wild Side.</description>

  <description>For his first book, The Know-It-All, A. J. Jacobs read the entire Encyclopædia Britannica from cover to cover in a quest to learn everything in the world. In The Year of Living Biblically, he followed every single rule of the Bible -- from the Ten Commandments right on down to stoning adulterers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now comes a collection of his most hilarious and thought-provoking experiments yet. In his role as human guinea pig, Jacobs fearlessly takes on a series of life-altering challenges that provides readers with equal parts insight and humor. (And which drives A.J.'s patient wife, Julie, to the brink of insanity.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the many adventures:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• He outsources his life. A.J. hires a team of people in Bangalore, India, to take care of everything in his life from answering his e-mails to arguing with his spouse.&lt;br&gt;• He spends a month practicing Radical Honesty -- a movement that encourages us to remove the filters between our brains and mouths. (To give you an idea of what happened, the name of the chapter is "I Think You're Fat.")&lt;br&gt;• He goes to the Academy Awards disguised as a movie star to understand the strange and warping effects of fame.&lt;br&gt;• He commits himself to ultimate rationality, using cutting-edge science to make the best decisions possible. It changes the way he makes choices big and small, from what to buy at the grocery store to how to talk to his kids. And his revelations will change how you make decisions, too.&lt;br&gt;• He attempts to follow George Washington's rules of life, uncovering surprising truths about leadership and politics in the twenty-first century. He also spends a lot of time bowing and doffing his hat.&lt;br&gt;• And then there's the month when he followed his wife's every whim -- foot massages, Kate Hudson movies, and all. Depending on your point of view, it's either the best or worst idea in the history of American marriage.&lt;br&gt;A mix of Bill Bryson, George Plimpton, and Malcolm Gladwell, A.J. explores the big issues of our time -- happiness, dating, morality, marriage -- by immersing himself in eye-opening situations. You'll be entertained by these stories -- some of which are new, some of which had their start in Esquire magazine. But you'll also learn to look at life in new ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Guinea Pig Diaries is a book packed with both laughs and enlightenment -- and that's a promise we can make with Radical Honesty.</description>

  <description>Donate Body to Science. Check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When seventeen-year-old Kaitlyn checked the box, she never suspected she’d have her life–and her body–stolen from her. She awakens one day in a secret laboratory to discover that her body is now half-robot and is forced to hide her own secret: that she still has human emotions and a human mind. If the scientists who made her find out, they’ll erase what remains of who she was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaitlyn finds an unlikely ally in Lucas, a handsome, brilliant scientist who can’t get over the guilt he feels knowing she was once a vibrant, beautiful young woman. He never expected a science project to affect him the way she does. As he tries to help her rediscover her past, he finds himself falling for the brave girl struggling to find her place and acceptance between the human and computer worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*For mature teens due to some sexual content.</description>

  <description>Wickedly sexy James Bowen is a bad boy of the highest order -- tattoos and attitude included -- which unfortunately ranks way up on Tate's not-a-chance-in-hell list, right there along with skydiving naked over Teheran and juggling Ebola vials just for kicks. But what the heck, she's on holiday, the guy is absolutely irresistible, and she needs to unplug from her life. With her dad and brother gone, Tate is left to deal with the family restaurant, which is fast going down the drain. Her employees are acting out, her boyfriend has bailed out, and her very own private stalker is emailing her to death with lovely threats of doom, fire, and dismemberment. So yeah, maybe a little holiday fling is in order. Strictly sex though, and no follow-up whatsoever once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She hadn't counted on her take-charge holiday fling having an opinion of his own and stubbornly sticking around, before &lt;em&gt;and after&lt;/em&gt; the sex, making himself at home in her life. There is definitely more to James than meets her prejudiced eye, and even if she's not ready to look deeper, James isn't prepared to permit her not to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content and graphic language.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Being(s) in Love Story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arthur MacArthur needs a job, and not just for the money. Before he dropped out of school to support his younger sister, he loved being a research assistant at the university. But working for a dragon, one of the rarest and least understood magical beings, has unforeseen complications. While Arthur may be the only applicant who isn’t afraid of Philbert Jones in his dragon form, the instant attraction he feels for his new employer is beyond disconcerting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bertie is a brilliant historian, but he can’t find his own notes without help—his house is a hoard of books and antiques, hence the need for an assistant. Setting the mess to rights is a dream come true for Arthur, who once aspired to be an archivist. But making sense of Bertie’s interest in him is another matter. After all, dragons collect treasure, and Arthur is anything but extraordinary.</description>

  <description>Apparently, my twin and I are two of York’s most notorious criminals. We’ve been Nightwalkers in the blue-light district since the vamps took over the world. Don’t know how many years it’s been. Long enough that a stream of fellow ’walkers have come and gone. Most don’t last long selling their chi. End up face-down in the gutter, or worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For us, one night and one sale change everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monsieur Garthelle is the first john to hunt me down. He calls me a chi thief in one breath and offers absolution—&lt;em&gt;servitude&lt;/em&gt;—in the next. Maybe I’m a sucker, but I like living and breathing. Strange that such a powerful vamp would show leniency to a mere human. And something’s not right with the chi I took from him. It won’t go away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither will he, and he’s forcing us to spy on his peers. Then a vamp turns up dead, and we go from playing eyes and ears to investigating a murder. This isn’t what I signed up for. All I ever wanted was to sell a little chi, maybe steal some in return. I should’ve kept my damn hands to myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my story. Look through my eyes.</description>

  <description>Three years after her husband Max's death, Shelley feels no more adjusted to being a widow than she did that first terrible day. That is, until the doorbell rings. Standing on her front step is a young man who looks so much like Max; same smile, same eyes, same age, same adorable bump in his nose; he could be Max's long-lost relation. He introduces himself as Paolo, an Italian editor of American coffee table books, and shows Shelley some childhood photos. Paolo tells her that the man in the photos, the bearded man who Paolo says is his grandfather though he never seems to age, is Max. &lt;em&gt;Her&lt;/em&gt; Max. And he is alive and well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As outrageous as Paolo's claims seem; how could her husband be alive? And if he is, why hasn't he looked her up? Shelley desperately wants to know the truth. She and Paolo jet across the globe to track Max down; if it is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; Max and along the way, Shelley recounts the European package tour where they had met. As she relives Max's stories of bloody Parisian barricades, medieval Austrian kitchens, and buried Roman boathouses, Shelley begins to piece together the story of who her husband was and what these new revelations mean for her "happily ever after." And as she and Paolo get closer to the truth, Shelley discovers that not all stories end where they are supposed to.</description>

  <description>City slicker Ami Jordan was just dumped by her back-stabbing boyfriend, has no job prospects, and can't find a decent cup of coffee in the entire state of Vermont. The last thing she needs is a sexy, bearded lumberjack complicating her life. Even if he’s smart, talented, and has the hottest ass she’s ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tree house builder, environmental champion, and Bulldog owner Marcus Anderson has no patience for flatlanders with an attitude. But when landscape designer Ami Jordan shows up at his log cabin,  he suddenly develops a hankering for a high-maintenance city gal. Now his house looks like a jungle, his recycling is in disarray, and his libido's on fire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's a lumberjack in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Adrien English Mystery Series #1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone's out to get Los Angeles bookseller Adrien English. His best friend has been viciously murdered, now he's getting weird phone calls and sinister gifts from a mysterious "admirer". The cops think he's trying to divert suspicion from himself—with the exception of sexy and homophobic homicide detective Jake Riordan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Riordan really such a great detective—or does he have a few secrets of his own? Is his offer to help Adrien on the level or is he out to nail his favorite suspect—to the wall?</description>

  <description>That Boy is a contemporary romance about falling in love with the boys next door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, being friends with two cute boys does have its benefits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's Danny. Danny is a golden boy in every way. He has dreamy blue eyes and blonde hair that always looks perfect, even when it’s windblown or been stuck under a football helmet. He’s the boy every girl crushes on. The boy I get into trouble with, the boy I fight with, the hot quarterback no girl can resist, not even me. Being with Danny is like being on an adventure. He has a bright, contagious smile and abs to die for. He’s pretty much irresistible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equally crush worthy is Phillip. Adorable, sweet Phillip, who I have known since birth.  Phillip has dark hair, a perfect smile, brown eyes, and the sexiest voice I have ever heard. He’s the boy I talk to every night before I go to sleep. The boy who rescues me, the boy who can read my mind, the boy who is always there for me, the boy who tries to keep me out of trouble, the boy who irritatingly keeps getting hotter, and whose strong arms always seem to find their way around me.  And when he gives me that grin, I can never say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One boy will give me my very first kiss.&lt;br&gt;One boy will teach me to make out.&lt;br&gt;One boy will take me to prom.&lt;br&gt;And finally, one boy will ask me to marry him.&lt;br&gt;They will both be my best friends.&lt;br&gt;But only one of them will be the boy I fall in love with.&lt;br&gt;Only one of them is That Boy.</description>

  <description>When Sterling Baker discovers the wonderful world of BDSM, he's ready to literally throw himself at the feet of the spectacular Owen Sawyer, but Owen is unwilling to take on someone so new to the scene—or so he says. Determined to get what he wants, Sterling sets out to convince the doubting Owen that he can be the best sub in the world, the fastest learning, the most obedient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not as easy as he thinks it will be, and things get even more complicated when Sterling realizes that he's fallen in love with Owen. With the stakes that much higher, Sterling's more determined than ever to win Owen over. But now he'll have to convince Owen they can have more than a teacher / student relationship, more than just good kink.</description>

  <description>John McCann, a man who judges life by the tally of an accounts ledger, has a supreme goal in life: To achieve, live, and enjoy the rarified executive lifestyle. But he's encountered one problem: The migraines are going to continue to get worse unless you make some major changes in your lifestyle. What you need is a 'sea change'… Perhaps buy a nice little business in the country, settle down, something easier to occupy your time…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While John knows the doctor is right, he just can't resign from the job he's fought so hard for. He decides the sacrifice of taking a year's leave of absence won't interfere too much with his plans, and so he finds himself running Margins, a cozy little bookstore, with the help of the former owner's son, Jamie. John expects to put in his year, get his stress under control, and then get back to business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What John doesn't expect is how Margins and its denizens draw him in, particularly the quiet, disheveled man who takes refuge in the old leather chair in the second-hand book section. John's plans for an unattached year of simple business crumble when he meets David and is forced to reevaluate life, love and what he really wants from both. John and David are forced to come to terms with their pasts as they struggle to determine what possible future they might build together.</description>

  <description>At the height of the Cold War, vampires came out of the closet and staged a coup to save humans from destroying themselves. All the Vampire protectors wanted in return was a simple monetary tithe and, of course, blood. But not George Handle's blood. He tastes foul. Maybe. Possibly. Okay, that might be a lie. Shit. Getting home from a business trip becomes very hard when every vampire around is suddenly after your skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;This story is COMPLETE&lt;br&gt;Approx. Word Count: 198,067&lt;br&gt;32 Chapters, plus Prologue and Epilogue</description>

  <description>Mark and Sandy hate each other with a passion, and not in a harmless way. They actually have fist fights every couple of days that often end up bloody. Everything Sandy does rubs Mark the wrong way; the way he looks, the way he speaks, how he successfully ignores him, and most of the time he just wants to kill him. But once he accidentally hits him with his car, things start to change, and while he still hates him - with a passion - he doesn't really want to kill him anymore, much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Completed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word count:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;approx. 84,888&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“I would gladly trade places with Casper, given the chance. I lifted my head to see Casper’s best friend standing on the other side of the grave.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jordan is a golden child — wealthy, popular, the self-professed ruler of the senior class. Jordan is also a bully, a bully whose group of friends mercilessly tormented seventeen-year-old Casper for being different, for being poor, for suffering silently. Random acts of abuse from his classmates were par for the course in Casper’s life, until one night, the bullying evolved into a hate crime and he, unable to endure, longing for peace, finally took his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Never Cared&lt;/em&gt; is the heartbreaking tale, told in Jordan’s words, of a life stolen, of love lost, and of a soul compromised. But ultimately, it is a story of forgiveness and redemption. As Sammy, Casper’s friend and lover, attempts to cope with the anguish of his boyfriend’s loss, Jordan attempts to own his part in the crime, trying to make amends but knowing his only hope is to carry on Casper’s legacy, to work to build a better future for boys and girls who, like Casper, just need a strong voice to encourage and stand up for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(re-edited and added content)</description>

  <description>In the slave city of Spire, Ellis has been discarded. His former master, a man who was supposed to teach him and take care of him, passed away, leaving Ellis alone and in danger of being taken to the Facility. Ellis is desperate to avoid that fate. He seeks a master to take him on, guiding him into adulthood as well as a profession. Ellis has had desire stolen from him—he’s been trained to blush, to submit, to give in. He doesn’t know how to cope with William, a man who wants the real Ellis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William is a Master, a man born in a neighbour city that does not deal in slavery. He has had bad experiences with slaves in the past, but all that changes when he rescues Harte, a young slave whose abusive master had all but destroyed him. Together, they are content in their mutual roles, not looking for anything more. But when Ellis catches the eye of Harte, and by extension, William, their relationship changes in ways for which they are unprepared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harte is a born submissive, a young man who lives for his role. He’s bratty but genuine. William, his master, is his entire life. Harte never expected to have room in his heart for another, but Ellis is beautiful and different and fills a place in his life that he hadn’t known was empty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only Ellis could learn to ask for what he desired, what he needed, then maybe William and Harte could help him. But Ellis is trapped inside himself, insecure and afraid. To stay with William, he only has to ask...but that’s the one thing Ellis cannot do...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisory: This book contains some non-consensual sex, hardcore bondage and punishment, torture and abuse. May not be suitable for the more sensitive reader.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It's just another day at the candy shop for Sherlock: a quiet afternoon spent more on reading his latest fantasy novel than on selling candy. The kind of day he loves, even if the looming New Year's Eve leaves him feeling nostalgic and a little lonely. But then the last person he ever expected to see walks through the door of his shop, and Sherlock realizes that some things don't fade with time, but grow stronger.</description>

  <description>Other worlds, other planes of existence, other places where humans are not the only type of creature to walk and talk. Human-like animals populate the pages of Wild Passions! These are not shifters, but humanoid animals that experience love and lust in their sometimes wild, sometimes civilized worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Liam, a half-fox in a world where 'urban jungle' isn't a metaphor. When trouble comes in the form of an organized militia looking to experiment, Liam must put his trust where he never expected -- in the hands of a human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Koit is a Shterpi, a reptilian alien with a reputation for womanizing. A dare from a friend has Koit changing his target to other men, and he finds that variety really is the spice of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alec and Nahale are feral-Maith, genetic offshoots from a fantastic race. Under pressure, Alec challenges Nahale for leadership of their clan, threatening to destroy the relationship they'd been building for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Panos only wants to live a normal life, free from the secret that's kept him isolated from others. However, he still needs a roommate, and his attraction to the other man has him wondering if opening up might not be so bad after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ferran is making his last trip away from his home planet of Perelan before duty calls him back. But a rakish spaceship captain tosses a wrench into his finely crafted plans, and his world may never be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gordon and Arthur work in the freak-show at a traveling carnival, wowing audiences with their half-animal physiques. But when animal constructs are second-class citizens and legal property of others, falling in love is the most dangerous act of all.</description>

  <description>Her family, her friends and her conscience all say it's wrong to fall for the hustler she rescued from the streets. How come it feels so right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Megan first meets Mouth, a homeless teenage hustler, on the streets of L.A., he's the perfect subject for the street life expose she hopes will help her break into journalism. She doesn't expect to be drawn into his life and become his friend--or to take him in after he's been beaten and robbed by thugs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they learn to live together, a powerful attraction flourishes between Megan and the young man. Although he's street smart, tough and mature, he's also a youth in transition. When they finally give in to the sexual heat between them, Megan fears she's taking advantage of her position as his mentor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their relationship challenges every aspect of her life. Megan must make difficult choices between the conflicting demands of her friends and family, her career and love.</description>

  <description>Charming rascal Tristan Northwood seems to have it all: an ancient name, a noble inheritance, a lovely wife, and a son he adores. Women love him, men admire him, and it seems there is nothing he can’t do, whether it’s seducing a society wife or winning a carriage race. Little does Society suspect that the name means nothing to him, the fortune is in his father’s controlling hands, and he has no interest in his wife except a very distant friendship. Society bores him, and he takes dares because he only feels alive when he’s dancing on the edge... until his wife’s brother comes home from the wars.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decorated war hero Major Charles Mountjoy jerks Tris out of his despair by inspiring feelings of passion Tris had never suspected himself capable of. Almost as terrifying as those feelings for Charles are the signs Charles might return his affection—or, even worse, that Charles sees the man Tristan has been trying so valiantly to hide from the world.</description>

  <description>When his friend's death is ruled a suicide, Kevin Connor—a hustler by trade, sleuth by default—sets out to prove a case of murder. It doesn't help matters that the victim's grown children, who disapproved of their father's gay lifestyle, are only concerned about their inheritance. But they are not Kevin's only problem. His high-strung mother has moved in with him—and she knows nothing about his questionable . . . job.</description>

  <description>A new romantic crime series from the combined talents of popular award winning authors Laura Baumbach and Josh Lanyon. Tough, street-smart SFPD Detective Gabriel Sandalini is willing to do whatever it takes to bring down West Coast crime boss Ricco Botelli -- including a dangerous, deep undercover gig as one of Botelli's hired guns. But Gabriel's best laid plans may come crashing down around him when he falls hard for the sexy, suave lieutenant of a rival Mexican drug lord. Turns out his new love interest may have a few secrets of his own: secrets that could destroy both men and the fragile bond between them.</description>

  <description>There are three good reasons why dashing Civil War hero and New York lawyer William Teague cannot tell artist Mae Kendrick he's in love with her. One, she told him he was dull. Two, she is the niece of an important client. Three, she just hired him to find the man she doesn't remember marrying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Will manages this peculiar case, the search for Mae's husband unveils a shocking discovery about her childhood, one that shifts the investigation to the place of her birth--Ireland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on the voyage overseas, circumstances become increasingly bizarre. Mae suffers ghost-like visions and further memory loss, and Will is seduced by a beautiful stranger who just might be trying to kill him. When Mae suddenly vanishes like her husband, Will is forced to enter a thin place, an ancient monastic ruin leading to Ireland's Celtic otherworld, in what becomes a race against time to find her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But are Will's war-honed instincts any match for the alluring forces of Irish legend? Can he distinguish friend from foe? Can he protect Mae from the apparitions of her past? And how far beyond the breaking point can his secret love be tested?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Thorn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years after the Scot's bloody defeat at the killing fields of Culloden, Rolf St. James was sent by the king to apprehend the Black Wolf, powerful leader of the Scottish resistance and laird of the MacLeod clan. When he captured a dark-haired beauty on one of his raids, he thought she would be the perfect weapon, his key to the Wolf's secrets. But instead he found the most proud and spirited lass he had ever met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thistle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Megan MacLeod would do anything to protect her clan. That was why she could never reveal her true identity as the Wolf to her ruthless captor. The Englishman was not to be trusted, as evidenced by the disfigured hand he tried to hide from the world. But although he was a thorn in her side, with each passing day, Megan sensed a tenderness beneath his dark exterior, and felt her resistance melt under the heat of his kisses. In order to prove his intentions were noble, she would have to risk family, country—and her heart—before peace could ever be restored to her beloved homeland.</description>

  <description>Rylie's been bitten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's changing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now she has three months to find a cure before becoming a werewolf... forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rylie Gresham hates everything about summer camp: the food, the fresh air, the dumb activities, and the other girls in her cabin. But the worst part is probably being bitten by a werewolf. Being a teenager is hard enough, but now she's craving raw flesh and struggles with uncontrollable anger. If she doesn't figure out a way to stop the transformation, then at the end of summer, her life is worse than over. She'll be a monster.</description>

  <description>Zoey Stranford might’ve had a crush on the sexy boy next door since middle school, but she’s a woman now, and that crush has turned into a full blown case of lust. So why is it that at twenty nine, her libido decides to ramp into high gear and the only thing she can focus on is the intensely sexy, scorching hot boy next door who is definitely not a boy anymore? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem is that Zoey and Kaleb have been best friends for as long as she can remember. Not to mention, Kaleb and his brothers are working on buying Stranford land to build a new resort, and she’s more than a little hesitant about his intentions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaleb Walker has had his eye on Zoey for close to twenty years, but never before has he considered taking their friendship to the next level, no matter how many fantasies he’s had about her over the years. That doesn’t explain why Kaleb is hell bent on having her – in as many ways as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaleb finds himself in a precarious situation. His brothers have nominated him to pursue Zoey’s father about purchasing the land needed to get their new resort off the ground. Finding out that Carl Stranford is on the brink of foreclosure and Zoey might just lose her house and the land, Kaleb now has to convince her to put aside her pride and let him help her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t take long before the flames start burning bright and hot, and the two of them burn up the nights and the days as they explore each other’s forbidden fantasies. But can their friendship survive a business transaction or the new friends with benefits clause? Or will they realize that they’ve been overlooking something much deeper that’s been right in front of them all along?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This book contains sexual encounters and graphic language that some readers may find objectionable, including, but not limited to m/f/m encounters, anal sex, exhibitionism, and voyeurism. Consider yourself warned! Contains graphic material that is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotic Romance&lt;br&gt;Mature Audience</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Everyone should have something to rebel against.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crank Wilson left his South Boston home at sixteen to start a punk band and burn out his rage at the world. Six years later, he’s still at odds with his father, a Boston cop, and doesn’t ever speak to his mother. The only relationship that really matters is with his younger brother, but watching out for Sean can be a full-time job. The one thing Crank wants in life is to be left the hell alone to write his music and drive his band to success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia Thompson left a secret behind in Beijing that exploded into scandal in Washington, DC, threatening her father's career and dominating her family's life. Now, in her senior year at Harvard, she's haunted by a voice from her past and refuses to ever lose control of her emotions again, especially when it comes to a guy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Julia and Crank meet at an anti-war protest in Washington in the fall of 2002, the connection between them is so powerful it threatens to tear everything apart.</description>

  <description>Discover your inner bad girl, and set her free…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heather Pierce is done being a wallflower, both personally and professionally. Desperate to live a different life for one night, she attends a speed dating event. Maybe here, anonymous unless she chooses otherwise, she can become someone new. When a man way out of her league sits across from her, Heather gathers her courage and takes charge of what she wants, secretly fearing he won’t desire the real person she’s desperate to hide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Top acquisitions officer and international playboy Tony Carmine is about to close the biggest deal of his career. But then he meets Heather at a speed dating event…and discovers losing control may be exactly what he needs. Her blossoming sensuality occupies his every thought, consuming him with the need to possess the most intriguing lover he’s ever encountered—until he walks into the boardroom and sees Heather on the other side of the negotiating table.</description>

  <description>Previously homeschooled Camie Ramsey is being shoved into the shark-infested waters of public high school, where even helium filled, penguin bespeckled arm floaties likely won’t help keep her inexperienced, fifteen-year old head above water in that rip current of hormones and emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camie’s worldly wisdom might be severely lacking (i.e., the closest she’s come to being kissed was sitting too close to the TV whilst Jake Ryan leaned in to give Samantha that fateful 16th birthday kiss), but she does understand her only hope for survival is if she’s thrown some kind of “social” life preserver before she sinks like a freaking rock. However, what will her fate be when she endeavors to flag down the only lifeguard on duty, the enormously popular and ridiculously beautiful Tristan Daniels? The most sought after and virtually most unattainable guy in school who not only makes Camie’s heart flatline on a recurring basis, he’s also the one guy who seemingly doesn’t know she exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeling like an inept piece of chum that could ultimately be swallowed by Jaws, can Camie get Tristan to rescue her from floundering in the treacherous deep, or is she destined to be Shark Bait?&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author's Note:&lt;br&gt;While the tales themselves are fictional, some of the events and characters are very loosely based in reality and on my experiences—but don’t worry, the names of the characters, most of their unfortunate fashion sense and/or questionable taste in music has been changed to protect the not-so innocent. &lt;br&gt;______________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to language and some adult content, this book may not be suitable for readers under the age of 16.</description>

  <description>Interior decorator Suzanne Barron's new tenant is the most dangerously sexy man she's ever met. Navy Commander John Huntington, a former SEAL (aka 'Midnight Man') works best under cover of darkness. Within hours of meeting him, Suzanne has wild, no-holds barred sex with John, then panics at the depth of her passionate response to such a powerful and dangerous warrior. Suzanne doesn't do sex like that. John is definitely someone she needs to avoid for her own peace of mind. But when killers come for her, Suzanne knows she can turn to only one man. John will guard and protect her body. But who will guard and protect her body against John?</description>

  <description>WHAT IF YOUR WHOLE LIFE WAS A LIE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One Planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two Worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Population: Human ... 7 billion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Others ... unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When 14-year-old Charlie Blake wakes up sweating and gasping for air in the middle of the night, he knows it is happening again. This time he witnesses a brutal murder. He's afraid to tell any one. No one would believe him ... because it was a dream. Just like the one he had four years ago - the day before his dad died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie doesn't know why this is happening. He would give any thing to have an ordinary life. The problem: he doesn't belong in the world he knows as home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He belongs with the others.</description>

  <description>Ryan's relationship-phobic, preferring to live his life from one anonymous hook-up to the next. He never remembers a name, and he never goes back for more. But then he meets Jayden, the one-off who won't get out of his head, his life -- or, indeed, his bed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan remains in a denial, however; he has no place in his life for emotion or feelings, despite how much difficulty he finds in keeping away from the gorgeous, confident Jayden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not until Jayden gets a boyfriend, bringing their non-relationship to a sudden end, that Ryan thinks he might have been feeling something all along. Feeling a lot, actually, but it's too late. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jayden's happy with his new man, and Ryan shouldn't want to get in the way of that -- but he's selfish, and he's had an epiphany, and maybe the only way to get Jayden back is to reveal more of himself than he knows how to handle. But is it enough for Jayden to take a risk on a man who, by his own admission, has no idea how to love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover edition, asin:B00APLND3A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;ar has taken everything from me. My family. My home. My innocence. In a country blasted by war and wracked by economic hardship, a young orphan girl like me has very few options when it comes to survival. Thus, I do what I must to live, to eat, and I try very hard to not consider the cost to my soul. My heart is empty, and my existence brutal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one impossibility in my life is love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I meet HIM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War is hell. It takes a chunk out of a man's very soul to do the kinds of things war demands of you. You live with fear, you live with guilt, and you live with nightmares. If you haven't been through it, there's no understanding it. War leaves no room for love, no room for tenderness or softness. You gotta be hard, closed off, and ready to fight every moment of every day. Lose focus for a split second, and you're dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the only thing that can save me is HER.</description>

  <description>"I never want to hurt you. You get that, right?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skylar knows Rafael wants something very specific from him--and Skylar wants him to have it. Convincing Rafael is going to take some serious innovation. Skylar lost his voice twelve years ago to the Nettlebush Indian Reserve's first and last serial killer. That serial killer was Rafael's father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rafael's father, Skylar learns, isn't the problem. Something else happened when Skylar survived that blustery summer night. Something Skylar never thought twice about. Something Rafael can't look past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Supreme Court ruling on Kelo v. New London changes the face of US property laws, plunging the reservation into an insidious tug-of-war between the Bureau of Land Management and the Plains Shoshone who have called the soil home for centuries. History, Skylar realizes, is repeating itself. Their parents powerless, the law their enemy, Skylar and his friends are going to have to get creative if they want to keep what's left of their land.</description>

  <description>"Your dad's Indian. Your mom's black. Why are you white?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skylar St. Clair's been getting questions like these all his life. Skylar's home is the Nettlebush Indian Reserve; his family, the hundreds of Plains Shoshone living there. Skylar can't help it if he better resembles his biological mother, a woman whose untimely death left him with more secrets than memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Skylar's father has been in federal prison for the past fifteen years. The summer of his release coincides with familial matters of a different nature: Skylar and his husband are trying to adopt a daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piecing together a fragmented family is no small task. All the patience in the world cannot contend with thirty-three years of reticence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But love can.</description>

  <description>At a freshman party she doesn't remember, Jess Jordan was almost raped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Almost. Very nearly. Not quite. Three years later, Jess has managed to make everyone believe she's better. Over it. Because she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Almost. Very nearly. Not quite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, until Jess proves she's back to normal activities, her parents won't discuss college. So, she lands a summer internship and strikes a deal with hockey jock, Gray Porter: He gets $8,000. She gets a fake boyfriend and a social life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jess has no idea Gray signed on for reasons other than money. She also never expects to fall in love. But Gray’s amazingly hot, holds her hand all the time, and makes her forget that he’s simply doing his job. It’s like having a real boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Almost. Very nearly. Not quite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gray Porter is hiding secrets of his own. About Jess Jordan. About why he’s driven to protect her, why he won't cash her checks, or deny her anything she asks.</description>

  <description>Ben Walsh is well on his way to becoming one of Manhattan’s top litigators, with a gorgeous boyfriend and friends on the A-list. His life is perfect until he gets a phone call that brings it all crashing down: a car accident takes his parents, and now he must return to Austin to raise three teenage brothers he barely knows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the funeral, Ben meets Travis Atwood, the redneck neighbor with a huge heart. Their relationship initially runs hot and cold, from contentious to flirtatious, but when the weight of responsibility starts wearing on Ben, he turns to Travis, and the pressure shapes their friendship into something that feels a lot like love. Ben thinks he’s found a way to have his old life, his new life, and Travis too, but love isn’t always easy. Will he learn to recognize that sometimes the worst thing imaginable can lead him to the place he was meant to be?</description>

  <description>Mark Harrison has exactly what Nolan Daniels wants—his signature on a sign-in sheet. Even better that Mark is gay and seriously good-looking. Nolan’s got these one hundred hours of community service nailed, just as soon as he nails the handsome doctor. It’s his pride that takes a hit when Mark rejects his advances in no uncertain terms. What else did Nolan expect from a man of privilege? Certainly not that Nolan would want Mark more than he wanted Mark’s signature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark’s the good boy who always plays by the rules, always does what’s expected of him...and secretly chafes at the restrictions of his straight-laced life. Now he’s faced with the leather-jacketed bad boy who arouses the closeted Mark more than he wants to admit. A man he can’t resist. A man who helps him admit other things about his not-so-perfect life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s time to take a stand. Time to burst the protective bubble each has built around himself in his own way. Little do they realize that moving forward could also cause them to lose each other and the love that has grown between them.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Although these books are part of a series, they do not need to be read in order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since Daphne Harper graduated from college, all of her friends have fallen in love, become engaged and walked down the aisle.  Be it a blessing or a curse, Daphne (a hopeless romantic and perpetual single girl) catches the bouquet at every single wedding she attends.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daphne’s love life is a mess. Her first love, Mayson, haunts her heart and keeps her from pursuing happiness with any man who comes along. As she struggles to move on from the one who got away, Daphne wonders if she will ever break her curse and find her happily ever after.</description>

  <description>With only 48 hours back on home soil for Christmas, United States Army Corporal Saskia Cullen is desperate to spend every minute with her young son. So when heavy snowfall closes JFK airport and she misses her connecting flight, she’s devastated. Until Navy SEAL Luke Gray offers to keep her company… and then personally finds a way to get her home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke is back in the US on leave, waiting to hear the details of his next mission, and Saskia proves to be a pleasant distraction. And when he hears that she needs to get home to see her son, he’s prepared to do anything to help the sexy single mom. Trouble is, he hadn’t planned on falling for anyone, let alone a beautiful soldier about to return overseas.</description>

  <description>Alec Caldwell has everything going for him. He’s young, successful, and reasonably handsome with a body he’s happy with but there’s one thing that plays on his mind. Alec is still a virgin. At twenty-four Alec sees it as a problem. He’s had plenty of opportunities but never followed through and the longer he leaves it, the harder it is to step over the threshold into manhood. Almost as embarrassing as his virgin status is the crush he has on his boss, Rick Hamilton. Not a day seems to go by without Hamilton catching Alec staring or drooling. If only Alec could find the courage to say something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Alec is called into Hamilton’s office after the latest incidence of ogling he thinks he’s going to be transferred. Instead he’s offered the chance of a lifetime – to be Hamilton’s personal sex toy at work. A whole new world unfurls as Alec is inducted into the exclusive Order of Gentleman that weaves through the rich and powerful corporate institutions of The City and beyond. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains multiple explicit scenes. &lt;br&gt;Tags: D/s; sex-at-work; threesome; man-love; sex-acts-in-public; multiple partners; polyamory; erotic-exhibitionism; sex-club; Master/slave&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free M/M fiction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://theriseofaleccaldwell.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://theriseofaleccaldwell.blogspot...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Can art imitate death? Oh no, girlfriend. Don’t even go there…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, the Human Hemovore Virus blazed through the world, and left the few victims who survived unable to eat, allergic to sunlight and craving the taste of blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Jensen used to think V-positives were incredibly sexy with their pale, flawless skin and taut, lean bodies. Not anymore. Not since he’s been stuck procuring under-the-counter feline blood for his control-freak boss, Jonathan Varga. Why cat blood? Mark has never dared to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not as if he’s usually at a loss for words. He can dish an insult and follow it with a snap as quick as you can say “Miss Thang”. But one look at Jonathan’s black-as-sin gypsy eyes, and Mark’s objections drain away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So he endures their strange, endless routine: Jonathan hiding in his studio, painting solid black canvases. Mark hurling insults as he buffs the office to a shine with antiviral wipes and maps out the mysterious “routes” he’s required to drive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a blurb in &lt;em&gt;Art in America&lt;/em&gt; unleashes a chain of events neither of them saw coming. As secrets of Jonathan’s past come to light, it becomes clear all his precautions weren’t nearly enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be sure to schedule adequate breaks for food and sleep while reading this novel. The author will not be held liable for any missed workdays, low blood sugar headrushes, or unfortunate bathroom accidents that may result from reading “just one more chapter”.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The hunt is on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pretty young men and women like Michael's best friend, Scary Mary, are disappearing from underground goth clubs all over Detroit. For over two years, Michael has been scouring the midwest for buried newspaper articles and obscure medical reports, and now he's finally pinpointed the source of the problem. Too bad he can't exactly go to the cops and tell them his friend was murdered by vampires. Since it's his duty to start wiping out the scourge, he's posing as bait—and he's got a bag of sharpened hickory stakes to do the job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything should go smoothly, given the amount of preparation that Michael has put into the hunt. He's got a practiced repertoire of come-hither eyeliner looks and a full blister-pack of the date rape drug Rohypnol. But he didn't count on Wild Bill showing up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wild Bill is a vision in spiked hair and scuffed black leather—exactly the type of guy Michael would have fallen for…if he'd ever had the chance. Unfortunately, with a vampire in his sights, Michael has no time for an actual date. Despite his best efforts, it seems there's nothing Michael can do to shake Bill loose. Looks like they're in for a wild, wild ride.</description>

  <description>Holly was forced to leave Avalon at the tender age of twelve, simply because she refused a union with her chosen one. She believes love ruins everything. Holly is sent to earth to live with her guardian family and lives on earth like any normal teenage girl, but she is different, she has a gift. In her senior school year, Holly attends boarding school in England and is introduced to a new student, Leo. She cannot understand why she is so drawn to his dark confident nature. His touch awakens a part of Holly she believed was dormant forever. All is not what it seems. What secret is Leo hiding? And is there more to Leo’s presence in her life?</description>

  <description>Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother’s house one afternoon doesn’t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she’s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse—she doesn’t know his real name or where he lives, she’s ninety percent certain he’s a criminal and that the “business” he talks with her brother isn’t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he’d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she’s not interested in becoming “property of”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Romantica® contemporary erotic romance from Ellora’s Cave</description>

  <description>That rat bastard Michael Wallace is back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last person Olivia Parker expects to walk into her lingerie shop is her high school sweetheart. She's so over him. Mostly. Except that he's hotter than ever and still knows her better than she knows herself. But how can she risk her heart when she knows he's just going to leave again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a simple plan: return home, shoot the movie, and leave emancipated from the contract he signed eleven years before. But Michael's plan gets blown away the moment he sees Olivia again. Smart, sexy, and successful, Olivia is distraction personified. Only worse than that—Michael fears Olivia may be his heart and soul…</description>

  &lt;em&gt;Tara Holloway has got your number. A special agent on the IRS’s payroll, she’s dead-set on making sure that money crimes don’t pay…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tax cheats, beware: The Treasury Department’s Criminal Investigations Division has a new special agent on its payroll. A recovering tomboy with a head for numbers, Tara’s fast becoming the Annie Oakley of the IRS—kicking ass, taking social security numbers, and keeping the world safe for honest taxpayers. &lt;em&gt;Or else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tara’s latest mission finds her in hot pursuit of ice-cream vendor Joseph “Joe Cool” Cullen. Along with frozen treats he’s selling narcotics—and failing to report his ill-gotten gains on his tax returns. &lt;em&gt;Over Tara’s dead body&lt;/em&gt;. Then there’s Michael Gryder, who appears to be operating a Ponzi scheme…with banker Stan Shelton…whose lake house is being landscaped by Brett Ellington…who happens to be dating Tara. If following that money trail isn’t tough enough, now Tara must face a new conundrum: Should she invest her trust in Brett—or put him behind bars? New love always comes at a cost but justice? &lt;em&gt;Priceless.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Having never been to a co-ed party, much less on a date, Scarlett has relied on her books, her music, and living vicariously through her best friend Evie to keep her sanity as she's patiently awaited her freedom from their rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Scarlett and Evie go away to college, Scarlett quickly meets Ashton, Dylan, and later, Mason, and is thrown into a crash course of like, love, and lust. With Evie's help, she must figure out the difference in the three and which one she wants before she ends up without any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metamorphosis is the story of Scarlett's transformation from a young, naive girl to a strong, mature young woman and her search for self-discovery and true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Recommended for readers 17+ due to sexual content and harsh language.**</description>

  <description>Veronica Cruz has been through hell and back. After disconnecting with the world two years ago to be at the side of her dying mother, she’s left alone, unemployed, overweight, and feeling a decade older than her twenty-eight years. When her best friend coaxes her into joining the local gym to ditch her depression and rejuvenate her life, she meets Noah. Assigned to help Veronica lose weight, Noah is everything she expected a young trainer to be—perfectly chiseled, supportive and motivating. Add to that, he’s incredibly sexy. He’s everything she’s ever looked for in a man. What she least expected was for him to fall for her, but he has. There's just one glaring problem: Noah is eight years younger. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah Quintanilla has his eye on a boxing title—someday. Down for a few months with an injury, his maintenance-boy pay at 5th Street Gym won't cut it. He’s finally given the opportunity to train. The catch? His trainee is an out-of-shape woman with a free week pass. Taking on the challenge, Noah stumbles into one of the closest friendships he’s ever known, and before he knows it, he’s in love. But Veronica’s not having it—the age difference is too much. Their platonic relationship means having to watch her date other men—something that would make him crazy. Believing he's the man for her, Noah sets out to prove that age is but an illusion, and there's more to him than just a number.</description>

  <description>When Mike found out he would be sharing a dorm with a former football star, he was terrified. He'd been bullied by jocks all his life for being scrawny and weak and didn't have high expectations of how it would go. To his surprise, Brett was a great guy that was easy to get along with and seemed to enjoy his company. When Mike learned that Brett was gay, it was a shock but it also explained the threatening letters that Mike had been receiving. Was Mike really at risk because of a jealous ex? Was there even anything to be jealous of? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;*** Warning: Contains graphic descriptions of gay sex ***&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Halloween is fun...at least, it's supposed to be. Costumes, candy, trick-or-treat, even jaded Victor Bayne can get behind those sorts of antics. Too bad this year's Halloween is a grownup event. Not only must Vic don a suit and endure a disco-obsessed DJ, he has to mingle with friends of Jacob's he would much rather ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vic thinks he has the party's host all figured out--but as he so often realizes, once he looks beneath the surface, things are seldom what they seem.</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She's trying to break out of prison--even though if she succeeds, she'll be the Commonwealth's most wanted fugitive. Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit's grandmother is missing. It turns out there are many things Scarlet doesn't know about her grandmother or the grave danger she has lived in her whole life. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother's whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her prisoner.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nick and Allie don't survive the car accident...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ...but their souls don't exactly get where they're supposed to get either. Instead, they're caught halfway between life and death, in a sort of limbo known as Everlost: a shadow of the living world, filled with all the things and places that no longer exist. It's a magical, yet dangerous place where bands of lost children run wild and anyone who stands in the same place too long sinks to the center of the Earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When they find Mary, the self-proclaimed queen of lost kids, Nick feels like he's found a home, but Allie isn't satisfied spending eternity between worlds. Against all warnings, Allie begins learning the "Criminal Art" of haunting, and ventures into dangerous territory, where a monster called the McGill threatens all the souls of Everlost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this imaginative novel, Neal Shusterman explores questions of life, death, and what just might lie in between.</description>

He needs more than just a mate—he needs a savior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dev turns up at a pack get-together, Laine finds both. The two werewolves have an instant attraction, but the pack Alpha is determined to keep Laine for himself.

  <description>There's a dead body in Perry Foster's bathtub. A dead body in a very ugly sportscoat and matching socks. The dead man is a stranger to Perry, but that's not much of a comfort; how did a strange dead man get in a locked flat at the isolated Alton Estate in the wilds of the "Northeast Kingdom" of Vermont? Perry flees downstairs to get help and runs into "tall, dark and hostile" former navy SEAL Nick Reno.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reno doesn't have a lot of time for drama queens, but, convinced that Perry's jitters are based on something more than caffeine overdose, he heads upstairs to investigate. By then the body has disappeared. If there's one thing Nick has learned the hard way, it's to mind his own business. But Perry Foster doesn't believe in ghosts and isn't willing to let sleeping dead men lie. And Nick just can't convince himself to walk when it's becoming increasingly obvious someone wants the sexy young artist out of the way — permanently.</description>

  <description>A thousand years ago, two factions of gods, the Stronni and the Taaweh, nearly destroyed the Kingdom of Dasak by warring for the land and the frightened humans who lived there. Then suddenly the Taaweh vanished and the Stronni declared victory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, as tensions escalate between the emperor and his regent, Vek Worlen, the vek's son, apprentice mage Sael dönz Menaük, finds himself allied with a homeless vagabond named Koreh. Together they flee the capital city and make their way across a hostile wilderness to the vek's keep, mere steps ahead of the emperor’s assassins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Koreh has dreams—dreams of the ancient Taaweh—and he knows the looming war between the emperor and the vek will be nothing compared to the war that is about to begin. The Taaweh are returning, and the war between the gods may destroy the kingdom once and for all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word Count: 79,709&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Companion to Wolves&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a young nobleman, Isolfr, who is chosen to become a &lt;em&gt;wolfcarl -- &lt;/em&gt;a warrior who is bonded to a fighting wolf. Isolfr is deeply drawn to the wolves, and though as his father's heir he can refuse the call, he chooses to go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people of this wintry land depend on the wolfcarls to protect them from the threat of trolls and wyverns, though the supernatural creatures have not come in force for many years. Men are growing too confident. The wolfhealls are small, and the lords give them less respect than in former years.  But the winter of Isolfr's bonding, the trolls come down from the north in far greater numbers than before, and the holding's complaisance gives way to terror in the dark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Isolfr, now bonded to a queen wolf, Viradechtis, must learn where his honor lies, and discover the lengths to which he will to go when it, and love for his wolf, drive him.</description>

  <description>Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “No man and no force can abolish memory.” John Oakes and Kurt Fournier are living proof of the truth behind those words. Since the horrors of the Second World War, John and Kurt have been trudging through existence, bleeding from wounds that have never healed. Now they’re at the crossroads of the 1950s: the war may be over, but the battle to find lasting peace has just begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John, a PhD student at UC Berkeley and a battle-hardened veteran, floats through his postwar life until he catches the mysterious Kurt secretly playing a university piano. John thinks he may find comfort in Kurt’s company but doesn’t know how to connect with a man who lives a life of such careful solitude. Guilt and regret threaten to cripple their hopes for a normal life. No man is an island, so John and Kurt must risk their hearts to find happiness. Unfortunately, memories and enduring fears can paralyze even the strongest man.</description>

  <description>Gideon Makepeace, a young man of twenty, knows who he is and what he likes: decency, men and women too, horse training, and fun... and in Livingston, Montana, in the lush autumn of 1895, he finds he likes a Lakota Sioux Indian better than he might ought to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jedediah Buffalo Bird is seriously wounded and seeking medical care, and Gideon helps Jed when some bigoted townsfolk might have done otherwise. Jed, who knows the wild far better than Gideon and feels indebted to him, agrees to repay him by being his guide to San Francisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their trip takes them across thousands of wild miles, through the mountains men mine and the Indian reservations dotting the plains. Facing a majestic West, they learn from each other about white folks and Indians alike. Gideon’s interest in Jed is clear from the start, but will Jed give up the life he knows for a young, brash white man he has perhaps come to love? Or will he push Gideon away in favor of the peace of nature and the personal freedom of having nothing to lose?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Novel of Robyn Hood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hooded One. The one to breathe the dark and light and dusk between.... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an old druid foresees this harbinger of chaos, he also glimpses its outcome.  A young peasant from Loxley and his sister will be the greenwode’s last bastion of the Old Religion, but a young and devout nobleman could well be their destruction: Gamelyn Boundys, whom Rob and Marion have both befriended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a risky bid for happiness, Rob dares his god to reinterpret the ancient rites, allow Rob to take Gamelyn as lover instead of rival.  But in the eyes of Gamelyn’s Church, sodomy is an abomination... and the old pagan magics are an evil that must be vanquished.</description>

  <description>When high school teacher Tom Smith meets Kevin Bannerman at a gay club, he violates his own rule: one-night stands only. But when the weekend is over, he walks away, reminding himself that he lives a deeply closeted life for painful, compelling reasons. He keeps his secrets, his heart, and the cause of his crippled arm to himself, but almost immediately he bitterly regrets leaving Kevin. Months later, while Tom serves as reluctant assistant director for his school's production of Rent, he fears that the show's same-sex love angle will somehow out him. Protests against the play begin, one of the student actors is harassed, and during a parents' meeting, Tom encounters Kevin again. This time Tom can't fight the attraction between them, and he and Kevin begin a tentative relationship. Within Rent's message of acceptance and support, and as local churches oppose the play, Tom struggles to find the strength to admit one man into his heart.</description>

  <description>After Quinn O’Malley loses his partner of ten years, Aaron, to cancer, he withdraws from everything. In a single tragic moment, he goes from an artist with a loving partner and a future to an uninspired comic book store owner who barely exists. He hides behind a shield of grief, refusing to let Aaron go. He feels guilty for even trying to imagine a life apart from what he’d had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The charming party planner Quinn’s best friend insists he meet on a blind date isn’t someone he’s ready for. Brady Banner walks into Quinn’s small frozen world and turns everything upside down. For years, Quinn has focused on endings, but as Brady begins to thaw his existence, Quinn realizes that one moment can do more than stop a life—it can also start a new one.</description>

  <description>After escaping robbers intent on murder, Katherine Grant says, "I jumped from the frying pan into the fire. Before long I'll be dancing on the coals." The highwaymen were the frying pan; the handsome young Apache who saved her from them was the fire; and the coals? Gaetan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rage against the enemies of his people has consumed Gaetan from boyhood. The only use he ever found for any white was to test the sharpness of his knife. Forced by his brother to endure Katherine's company, Gaetan tries to deny what he sees—the white woman has a man's temper and a lion's courage. She has an Apache heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of hate, distrust and fear, surviving in the rugged country of southern Arizona and northern Mexico forges a strange bond between Katherine and Gaetan. When the bond turns to love, can they admit it? Can they bear the consequences?</description>

  <description>After a car accident, Adam wakes up in a hospital room with no memory and a man named Joe, who acts like his boyfriend. So when Joe says Adam is straight—and Joe’s not—and they’re just best friends and roommates, Adam is more than a little confused. But as Adam starts to fill in the gaps, the one thing that becomes apparent is that Joe is the missing piece that can’t be replaced.</description>

  <description>Following an amicable divorce, former stay-at-home dad Scott Mitchell needs to get a job—and a new lifestyle to help him manage his depression, since he lost his Domme along with his marriage. At least one of his problems is solved when finds work at Wilde Publishing. Fulfilling his boss’s needs at the office gives him a productive focus and pays the bills, but becoming a PA to publishing wunderkind Milo Brock isn’t without its trials. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an injury put an end to his dreams of the NHL, Milo got an education and pursued other interests. At work, he runs Wilde’s sports division. At play, he’s always thought of himself as straight, but his attraction to his new PA casts that into doubt. Luckily a hard life has taught Milo to take things in stride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scott and Milo are battling separate lives, ghosts from their pasts, a sister dying of cancer, and a clash of preferences in the bedroom. Scott needs to submit to keep himself balanced; Milo prefers vanilla sex. If they can’t find some middle ground, they’ll lose the support they both desperately need.</description>

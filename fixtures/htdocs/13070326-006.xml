Determined to stay one step ahead of the sexy journalist, Rebecca reluctantly agrees to partner with him to find the real murderer. But as their mutual attraction heats up, Rebecca finds it harder and harder to keep Brandon from discovering the existence of the shifter society--and her own true nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the search leads them back to the Pride, Rebecca must attempt to Change for the first time in years to face the killer, and save the man she loves...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Genre:&lt;/strong&gt; LGBT Erotic Contemporary  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Take two, and call me in the morning.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eli and Zane. Colleagues at work and close friends, though on the surface it's an unexpected friendship between an odd couple. While Zane took the "high school to college to med school" track, medicine is Eli's second career and the best choice he ever made. He has work that he loves, an extended second family of colleagues and friends, and Zane.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So why does everyone make such a big deal about the pair of them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, they spend a lot of time together. It doesn't mean they're a real couple. When teased about it one too many times by their colleagues, Zane challenges Eli to set the record straight with a kiss to prove there's absolutely no chemistry between them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Neither expected a spark to ignite between them. More than a spark. Desire. &lt;em&gt;Passion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Zane wants to try getting up close and personal again to see if it was a one-time fluke or something more. Eli thinks he's too old to jump the fence now, but he can't say no to Zane and he doesn't want to.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Truth be told, Eli's not so sure they can set the record straight after all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>There s no escaping the man at the heart of his memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, David and his college roommate, Ethan, were on the brink of unimaginable success, ready to revolutionize an industry and reap billions. Then David accidentally revealed the attraction he d never wanted to feel, and certainly never meant Ethan to see. Mortified, he ran from everything that mattered the fledgling company he d helped to build, the bright future he d worked to secure, and the man he couldn t let himself want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now he s built a new life for himself. So what if it s not the one he hoped for? He s learned to look only forward, and not to envy the success Ethan achieved without him. He s even learned to cope with the nightmares. The panic attacks. The failed relationships with women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an opportunity arises to enjoy a once-in-a-lifetime getaway to a private island resort, David never suspects a trap is about to be sprung. One where he ll be forced to face the truths from which he s been hiding and the man from whom he s never stopped running.Warning: This book contains erotic waffles, sexual math, blatant ABBA worship, kidnapping, nude napping, dog-napping, journal hijacking, betrayal, redemption, and red-hot man love so poignant and passionate, you won t know whether to say " awwwwwww " or " oooooohhh!

  <description>Scotland, 1751&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MacLeods are a strong clan, united with their fellow Scots to resist English rule. But when their leader, the Black Wolf, is struck down in battle, it is up to his daughter to keep the rebellion alive. Megan knows she must act quickly or risk losing the fight for their ancestral lands. Desperate, she secretly assumes the Black Wolf's mantle, fooling their enemies into thinking he's still alive. If she can keep going for a bit longer, the clan's future will be secure…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolf St. James has been sent by the king to settle the Scottish lands once and for all. He's not about to let a woman get in his way, no matter how desirable he finds her. He must put aside his attraction and fulfill his duty to permanently quell the rebellion, regardless of the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rolf represents everything her father hated, everything she's been fighting against. But as the days pass and Rolf's code of honor reveals itself, Megan finds it's not so easy to hate him anymore. Can she risk her people's future for a chance at personal happiness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previously published, newly refreshed.</description>

      <![CDATA[I've discovered something about myself as a reader.

  <description>When Nadia’s family moves to Captive’s Sound, she instantly realizes there’s more to it than meets the eye. Descended from witches, Nadia senses a dark and powerful magic at work in her new town. Mateo has lived in Captive’s Sound his entire life, trying to dodge the local legend that his family is cursed - and that curse will cause him to believe he’s seeing the future … until it drives him mad. When the strange dreams Mateo has been having of rescuing a beautiful girl—Nadia—from a car accident come true, he knows he’s doomed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the forces pulling them apart, Nadia and Mateo must work together to break the chains of his family’s terrible curse, and to prevent a disaster that threatens the lives of everyone around them. Shimmering with magic and mystery, New York Times bestselling author Claudia Gray’s new novel is sure to draw fans of the Hex Hall and Caster Chronicles series, and fans of the hit CW TV show The Secret Circle.</description>

  <description>Renee Evans has a knack for trouble. After walking in on her best friend and boyfriend in bed together, twenty-five year-old Renee flees sunny Los Angeles and her dream job as a music journalist and returns to her hometown of Boston – only to meet Dylan Cavallari, the mysterious, aspiring musician who lives in her apartment building. Dylan’s piercing gaze and womanizing demeanor make him exactly the type of guy that Renee should steer clear of – which is most likely the reason she falls for him. But when Renee’s troublesome ex comes back and threatens to drive her and Dylan apart, Renee is forced to face her past and save her relationship with Dylan before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sound Bites dramatizes what happens when Renee finds herself caught between a painful past and an uncertain future. Happiness turns out to be within her grasp, but it all depends on whether she can trust herself enough to make the right decisions. Sound Bites is a novel about love, friendship, betrayal, forgiveness, and the power of music to help you find your way.</description>

  <description>Being bisexual is cool now—unless you're a boy. Or so it seems to invisible fifteen-year-old Hazard James. But when he falls in with bad apple Jesse Wesley, Hazard is suddenly shoved into the spotlight. Jesse and his friends introduce him to the underworld of teenage life: house parties, hangovers, the advantages of empty homes, and reputation by association. So what if his old friends don't get it? So what if some people love to hate him? Screw gossip and high school's secret rules. There's just something about walking into a room and having all eyes on him when just last year nobody noticed him at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a while Hazard basks in the attention, and before he realizes the depth of the waters he's wading, he and Jesse strike up a "friends with benefits" routine. It could be something more, but what self-respecting teenage boy would admit it? Not Jesse—and so not Hazard, either. Not until it's too late. Hazard and Jesse have collided, and Hazard's life will never be the same.</description>

  <description>I don’t have a sister—I was an orphan. I don’t believe in Vampires. They are myths that make interesting movies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Say this three times, and three women find out that what they have believed in all their lives is wrong. They do have sisters, and there are Vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the Vampires are those who just want their blood, because it is better than normal mortal blood. But there is also a special connection for each sister with three male Vampires who want more than just blood.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Preservation Series Companion Novel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love, life, and happily ever after? It’s all relative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine biology student Emma Pierce lives in paradise—geographically speaking, anyway. Stranded on Sanibel Island, Florida, she works at a nursing home by day and spends her nights dodging the island's infamous bad boy, Jackson Taylor, at her favorite karaoke bar. Trying to heal from the loss of her sister and a failed relationship she rerouted her life for, she's ready to graduate and finally leave Florida behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a run-in with Jackson and his rowdy crew goes sour at the bar one night, sparks fly and irreversible damage is done. It’s no secret that Jackson loves to get underneath her skin, but this time he's gone too far. Now all he wants is to earn her forgiveness before she's gone for good, but their ideas of closure—and the future—are enough to keep them worlds apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a stand-alone title but coordinates with The Preservation Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation (Book One, Available Now)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reservation (Book Two, Coming March 6, 2013)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declaration (Book Three,TBA)&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;September, 1941.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War correspondent Joseph Byrne has been cheating death all his life, ever since he spent two years in an iron lung as a boy diagnosed with polio. In the years since, the Fetch, a strange being charged by Death with collecting Joseph and transporting him into the unknown, has been condemned to watch and wait. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, with Joseph working in a Finland caught in a tug of war between Nazi and Soviet forces, it seems a foregone conclusion that the Fetch's sentence is at its end and Death will have Joseph for her own at last. Joseph, an openly Jewish American, has no doubt where his allegiance lies, no matter the danger. But after all these years at Joseph's side, watching him overcome adversity to grow into a brave and principled young man, the Fetch has come to realize that there are forces stronger and so much sweeter than even the purpose you were made for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Part of the Goodreads M/M Romance Group's &lt;em&gt;Love is Always Write&lt;/em&gt; event.)</description>

  <description>Former Navy medic Sebastian Thompson has classic good looks and a true blue heart.  But that doesn’t mean he has the confidence to make a move on the gorgeous young blond who just breezed in to the Blue Dragon Bar.  Fate will play its hand, anyway.  Finding the same young blond beaten to the edge of death, terrified of a hospital, Sebastian has to choose - walk away, or try to save a life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one chance encounter will lead Sebastian into a web of danger. Who is the enemy and who is a friend?  Who will he trust when everyone has a reason to lie?  How far will he go, and what will it cost, to do the right thing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION&lt;/strong&gt;: A bleached-blond young man with a sculpted body is sitting half-naked and curled over his own knees. His eyes are closed, and his head is down. He looks tired and scared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY LETTER&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Author, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm so out of my league with this one I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I watched him walk into that bathroom. How could I not notice him? Just look at him. He's fucking beautiful. I didn't see him come back out, but I was trying to play it cool, ya know? I thought maybe he'd left when after 30 minutes I didn't see him in the bar anywhere. Shrugging it off, figuring he's probably a good 10 years too young for me anyway, I went to the bathroom and saw him again. Only this time he was a broken, bloody heap on the floor in the last stall. Shit! I rushed over to him, felt for a pulse and tried to assess the damage. I'm just a retired Navy medic, not a doctor but when I roused him, he started screaming and pleading with me not to take him to the hospital. Said they'd kill him if they found him and they'd be sure and look there first. So I picked him up, carried him out and brought him home. He's so badly beaten. I think they kicked him half to death. I have to examine him, but he's so scared. I'm not sure if he's been raped or not but how do I get him to trust me enough to even check? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please help me put this beautiful, battered boy back together again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY INFO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;genre:&lt;/strong&gt; contemporary, thriller. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tags:&lt;/strong&gt; medical personnel; military men; first time; hurt/comfort; slow burn; unresolved sexual tension&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;content warnings&lt;/strong&gt;: descriptions of post-violent-attack first aid and medical care; non-graphic discussions of off-screen sexual assault; gun violence (non-sexual). &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;words&lt;/strong&gt;: 70,085&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>After a hard life filled with experiences he’d rather not remember but can’t forget, Brett Taylor decides he doesn’t need anyone or anything. He gets a job at a bar in a nothing little town where he can fish and race dirt bikes and hide from the world. So naturally as he’s walking across the parking lot at his new job, reminding himself how self-reliant he is, he meets someone he can’t shove aside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brett can’t help but admire Cory Butana, the kid who lives above the bar where his father is the principal bartender. Unwanted by either parent, the sweet, personable Cory grew up neglected and hungry for affection. Now he’s determined to make something of his life, even if he has to work himself ragged to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cory shouldn’t have to suffer like Brett did, and Brett wants to lend a hand. But when their relationship evolves into something Brett isn’t ready to need, he reacts… and the consequences may destroy their fledgling future. With scars like theirs, forgiveness is never easy.</description>

  <description>In this 60,000 word full length novel, Jonah Sweet has a secret need to be dominated and punished, with whips and chains and leather cuffs. He also has a degree in puppetry from a good university, but can’t find a job and is still with his mom and dad in Queens. So he signs up for cooking school, hoping to learn a trade. But it’s nothing like he thought it would be and he winds up flunking everything from cutlery to hard-boiled eggs. The only other skill Jonah has is the ability to read other people's thoughts, which he knows isn’t going to get him very far. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the day of an important cooking exam, Jonah meets David Abernathy, the owner of the cooking school and a billionaire who owns restaurant chains, casinos, and real estate. The harder Jonah tries to impress David the worse it gets. But handsome David Abernathy sees something in Jonah. With no explanation at all, David sets Jonah up in an office, buys him a brand new wardrobe, and brings him into his unusual home on Delancey Street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Jonah is stunned by all this, he’s even more stunned by the fact that he can’t read David Abernathy’s thoughts. But Jonah is in no position to turn any offers down. He takes the job in spite of David’s rude, nasty disposition and his erratic rants. From there they enter into an unusual relationship filled with light bondage and discipline and more love than either one of them could ever have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When David introduces Jonah to a little boy in a wheel chair and explains his past, Jonah only falls deeper in love with David. He discovers a gentle side of David no one knows about. But will intense love and exotic sex be enough to compensate for David’s complicated personality and his vicious need to control everything? And will Jonah be able to put up with David’s public outbursts and his violent moods?</description>

And when someone is brutally murdering infecteds, Eli Winters, leader of the Church of the Divine Transformation, hires Roan to find the killer before he closes in on Eli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working the crimes will lead Roan through a maze of hate, personal grudges, and mortal danger. With help from his tiger-strain infected partner, Paris Lehane, he does his best to survive in a world that hates and fears their kind… and occasionally worships them.</description>

Now that Devin is over 18 he's no longer pleasing to his Master, who arranges a replacement, Ronan.

  <description>The best things in life aren’t free…they’re freely given.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Lethbridge doesn’t have many vices left. After raising his little sister to adulthood, he wasted no time making up for the youth he lost to responsible parenting. Two years of partying it up—and ignoring his diabetes—has left him tethered to a home dialysis regimen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He can do his job from his flat, fortunately, but most of his favourite things are forbidden. Except for DVD porn…and fantasizing over Ollie, the gorgeous, purple-haired skateboarder who delivers it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their banter is the highlight of Ben’s lonely day, but his illness-ravaged body is the cruel reality that prevents him from believing they’ll do anything more than flirt. Not to mention the age gap. Still, Ben figures there’s no harm in sprucing himself up a bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day, a package accidentally splits open, revealing Ben’s dirty little secret…and an unexpected connection that leaves him wondering if he’s been reading Ollie wrong all this time. There’s only one way to find out: risk showing Ollie every last scar. And hope “far from perfect” is good enough for a chance at love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains superhero porn comics and a cute, accident-prone delivery guy with colour-changing hair. Readers may experience coffee cravings, an unexpected liking for bad mullets, and the urge to wrap Ollie up and take him home</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover for ASIN B009YLRCCU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love. Sex. Magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before her 20th birthday, Gabriella was pretty much clueless about all three. In love with her best guy friend since the age of 14 and too crass and intimidating for most of the male population of Colorado Springs, love and good sex were virtually a myth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there’s magic. Freakin’ magic. There’s no way that legend could have a place in her less than exciting life. So why after twenty years of utter obscurity do her adopted parents hit her with the ton of bricks that is her true identity? And how the heck is she supposed to accept all this and become what she was truly created to be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucky for Gabs, sexy as sin Dorian is more than equipped to help her embrace these new revelations. And while everything about him feels oh so good, she soon learns that there’s more behind his crystal blue eyes, chiseled body and exotic beauty. Something dark, menacing and downright unnatural. Yet Gabs is in way too deep to even try to turn away from him now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark Light, Book 1 of the Dark Light Series, is the raw, emotional story of a young woman’s journey of self-discovery in a world that was not meant for her. And her scorching hot, lip-biting addiction for the man she can’t deny, no matter the cost.&lt;br&gt;*Contains strong adult content.(</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;When the boat's a rockin', don't come knockin'! &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out-and-proud travel writer Dan Taylor can't steer a boat to save his life, but that doesn't stop him from accepting an assignment to write up a narrowboat holiday. Instead of a change of pace from city life, though, the canal seems dull as ditchwater. Until he crashes into the boat of a half-naked, tattooed, pierced man whose rugged, penniless appearance is at odds with a posh accent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still smarting from past betrayal, Robin Hamilton’s “closet” is his narrowboat, his refuge from outrageous, provocative men like Dan. Yet he can’t seem to stop himself from rescuing the hopelessly out-of-place city boy from one scrape after another. Until he finds himself giving in to reluctant attraction, even considering a brief, harmless fling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, in less than a week, Dan’s going back to his London diet of casual hook-ups and friends with benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined not to fall in love, both men dive into one week of indulgence…only to find themselves drawn deep into an undertow of escalating intimacy and emotional intensity. Troubled waters neither of them expected…or wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains one lovable tart, one posh boy gone feral, rough sex, alfresco sex, vile strawberry-flavoured condoms, intimate body piercings, red thermal long-johns, erotic woodchopping, an errant cat, a few colourful characters you wouldn't touch with a bargepole, and plenty of messing about on the river. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One man became her husband. The other became her best friend. Together, they were the holy trinity of rock and roll. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1974. Danny Fiore is a handsome, charismatic singer with huge ambitions and a voice that can peel the paper off the walls. Casey Bradley is just eighteen years old, but the songs she writes send an icy finger down the center of Danny's cynical spine. Danny knows exactly where he's going, and he has no intention of taking any woman along. A woman like Casey would want things he's not prepared to give. A home. Stability. Children. He's married to his music, and that's the way he likes it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Casey is engaged to her childhood sweetheart, her wedding just four weeks away. She has Jesse, and Danny has his career. There's no room in her life or his for an extracurricular love affair. Besides, she's a good girl who doesn't believe in casual sex. But nothing between them could ever be casual, and the first time she looks into Danny Fiore's eyes, Casey is ready to toss away her entire future for a man who's almost certain to break her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither of them plans on falling in love. But sometimes, the heart has a mind of its own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Guitar wizard Rob MacKenzie doesn't have Danny's looks, or his charisma, or his sense of style. Tall and gaunt and bony, Rob isn't a god, just an ordinary mortal, an easygoing guy who wants nothing more than to write his songs, play his guitar, and find the right woman. But life is never quite as simple as it seems, and his search for Ms. Right keeps leading him down all the wrong roads. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rob MacKenzie and Casey Bradley Fiore begin writing songs together, the result is an unstoppable hit-making machine that catapults Danny Fiore to stardom. But the road to success is littered with land mines, and life with Danny isn't all that Casey expected. Rivers of darkness run through her troubled marriage, and every time Danny breaks her heart, it's Rob who picks her up, dusts her off, and glues the pieces back together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It isn't until she suffers an unimaginable loss that Casey begins to question who she is and what she really wants from life. As she searches for herself amid the wreckage, she discovers the bittersweet truth that the choices a woman makes at thirty can differ vastly from those she made at eighteen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming Home is a poignant story about the seasons of a woman's heart, and the roundabout route we sometimes have to take to get to where we're meant to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Like two ships passing in the night--if one was a narrowboat and the other a luxury yacht.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disgraced private school teacher Giles Rathbourne has been sent home on extended sick-leave and is stuck in a rut of obsessive housework and drinking. His ex may have been a snobbish bastard, but without him, Giles is adrift, rattling around his huge, lonely house. When a dreadlocked narrowboater’s engine breaks down at the end of his canal-side garden, Giles is furious at this invasion of his privacy—for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smutty might not have ever held down a proper job, but the fire-dancing, free-spirited traveller can recognise an opportunity for mutual benefit when he sees it. Giles’ extensive gardens are in as desperate need of attention as the upper-class hunk is himself, whereas Smutty knows a thing or two about plants and needs a place to moor up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A simple business arrangement between two men who have nothing else in common? It would be—if they could keep their hands off each other!</description>

  <description>Passionately driven artist, Norah Ross, has been banished from New York to Morewell for her final semester of graphic design at McLaren University. Her move allows her to reconnect with Josh, her best friend, who is more then thrilled at Norah's appearance back into his life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time that Norah steps back into Josh's heart, she learns that he is in the process of being accepted into McLaren's uber exclusive secret society, the 'Lappell'. Josh takes Norah to the Lappell's glamorous parties in the hope of taking their friendship to the next level, but when Norah meets the handsome and elusive Clint Weston, a leader in the Lappell, he sweeps her off her feet in more ways then one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norah quickly becomes caught up in an emotional tug-of-war between the two guys while also trying to deal with her own secrets that follow her every day. When Norah's past begins to intertwine with her present, what unfolds is a series of dramatic events filled with romance, mystery and dark motivations. She quickly realizes the path to real love can be paved in all kinds of lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*NOTE:  This is a new adult novel with some mature sexual content.</description>

  <description>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to walk through life in someone else's shoes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong-willed tomboy Harley LeBeau puts you in the boots her mother gave her, as she takes you along her journey of escape from an abusive childhood and the desire to find herself as she comes of age. Made to feel a burden to her father simply by her gender, Harley is determined to prove her worth and independence, leaving the small town she grew up in and the one boy who gave her a soft place to fall, Jeremiah Johnson. Torn between saving herself and abandoning her mother and younger sister, Harley chooses her own life in hopes they will choose theirs, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mature, candid read for everyone. A must for women. The Boots My Mother Gave Me explores the dynamics of abuse and dysfunction, the courage to overcome, the strength in sisterhood, and the ongoing conflict and unconditional love between mothers and daughters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climb into Charlene the Chevelle for a fast-paced story about a girl who is tough enough to survive and tender enough to learn to trust in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Signed Paperback &amp;amp; Original Music Soundtrack to The Boots My Mother Gave Me can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.brooklyn-james.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.brooklyn-james.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Danny Kelly cares only for rock 'n' roll and fast cars. Too bad he's stuck in the capital of country music and he's banned from driving until he turns twenty-one. Plus he likes other boys, a secret that he's vowed to keep until he graduates high school. When his stepdad's new truck roars off on its own, Danny discovers a secret that is endangering cars and drivers across America. It almost kills Danny, too, until he's saved by seventeen-year-old Kevin Clark. Kevin's gay, handsome, and confident, but working with his dad's secret government organization has left him lonely. It's going to take a weekend of car chases, fiery explosions, and country-western singing to save the citizens of Nashville from certain death—but can Danny protect his heart and secrets as well?</description>

  <description>'R' is a zombie. He has no name, no memories and no pulse, but he has dreams. He is a little different from his fellow Dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amongst the ruins of an abandoned city, R meets a girl. Her name is Julie and she is the opposite of everything he knows - warm and bright and very much alive, she is a blast of colour in a dreary grey landscape. For reasons he can't understand, R chooses to save Julie instead of eating her, and a tense yet strangely tender relationship begins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has never happened before. It breaks the rules and defies logic, but R is no longer content with life in the grave. He wants to breathe again, he wants to live, and Julie wants to help him. But their grim, rotting world won't be changed without a fight...</description>

  <description>As if stumbling over a dead body isn't enough, Crystal Cartwright finds herself playing surrogate mother to two small boys when their father--her neighbor--doesn't come home. The kids aren't much trouble, but the thieves, drug dealers and kidnappers they're about to encounter are. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Jack Dunlevy, a cop down on his luck, draws the cases no one else wants. A simple investigation involving a dead homeless man quickly changes as Crystal enlists Jack's help with the children. Drawn into a mystery that none of them could have anticipated, they're faced with a situation that will change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>“I shall always be in his shadow, unable to live up to the standard he set at Spindrift, hoping that someday Carlo might love me the way he loved his lost Timothy…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The memory of Timothy haunts every corner of Spindrift, the beautiful mansion on the Atlantic shore. His face was flawless, his body breathtaking perfection. Everyone who saw him loved him, desired him, wanted him—whether they first laid eyes on him in a magazine ad, on a billboard, or on a box of underwear. No one ever forgot him, once they had passed through his orbit. They remember his wit, intelligence, and sense of style. He was the perfect match for wealthy Carlo Romaniello. Spindrift was the perfect backdrop for the glamorous couple, and the unforgettable, fabulous parties they hosted there. But then tragedy took Timothy, and darkness descended on the beautiful house on the beach. Carlo closed the house, and its secrets remained hidden within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carlo reopens the house as a home for himself and his new young husband, those old secrets begin to creep out into the light. And those secrets might just prove deadly for his new spouse, a young man who has to compete with the memory of the unforgettable Timothy….&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>From the moment Detective Gavin DeGrassi steps into the world of BDSM to solve the brutal slaying of Dom George Kaiser, his course is not his own. Mesmerized by the context in which the victim lived and the images of the lifestyle seared into his soul, Gavin must find a way to navigate these unknown waters. With his personal life in upheaval due to marital trouble, and his professional life uncertain with the assignment of a new partner, Gavin needs all the help he can get understanding the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Ben Haverson, a psychologist and a well known Dom. With Ben’s help as a consultant and attention to Gavin's own murky truths, Gavin delves deeper than he ever thought he would into the world of restraints and paddles. Forced to scrutinize  his true nature and his innermost desires, Gavin has a choice: keep the fear of submitting at bay, or dive in and solve the case with the knowledge he gains. When another victim is discovered, Gavin’s choice is made for him, and he’s pulled headlong into the deepest, most emotional journey of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for him and Ben, a killer has noticed, has taken stock, and has set his sights on the D/s pair. Can Gavin outwit him, or will his first exchange of power be his last?</description>

  <description>Late in the 21st Century-ravaged by the deadly Sept virus, the one time United States has disintegrated into The Fundamental Christian Territories, where Catholics, Baptists and Jews are registered as heretics, and gays are herded into walled ghettos: the Zones of Perversion. Harvey Milk Walton, a runner, finds his way to the ghetto in Angel Land, oldest of the territories, where a legend says that his long ago martyred namesake will return one day to lead his people to freedom-but even to speak of freedom, of leaving the FTC, is punishable by death. In a crumbling totalitarian society, where evil masquerades as piety, two men fall in love, and begin to dream of escape from Angel Land.</description>

  <description>Imagine a place where the dead rest on shelves like books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each body has a story to tell, a life seen in pictures that only Librarians can read. The dead are called Histories, and the vast realm in which they rest is the Archive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Da first brought Mackenzie Bishop here four years ago, when she was twelve years old, frightened but determined to prove herself. Now Da is dead, and Mac has grown into what he once was, a ruthless Keeper, tasked with stopping often—violent Histories from waking up and getting out. Because of her job, she lies to the people she loves, and she knows fear for what it is: a useful tool for staying alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being a Keeper isn’t just dangerous—it’s a constant reminder of those Mac has lost. Da’s death was hard enough, but now her little brother is gone too. Mac starts to wonder about the boundary between living and dying, sleeping and waking. In the Archive, the dead must never be disturbed. And yet, someone is deliberately altering Histories, erasing essential chapters. Unless Mac can piece together what remains, the Archive itself might crumble and fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this haunting, richly imagined novel, Victoria Schwab reveals the thin lines between past and present, love and pain, trust and deceit, unbearable loss and hard-won redemption.</description>

  <description>In this sexy new Star Harbor romance series, featuring the too-tempting Grayson brothers, a celebrity chef turns up the heat for a local café owner—and things start to sizzle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lexie Meyers decides there’s nothing sweeter than watching Sebastian Grayson’s perfect, wicked mouth devour her coconut cake. He’s hot, he’s hungry, and he’s sizing her up like she’s the best thing on the menu. But she’s been burned in the past and flings just aren’t her thing. Too bad Sebastian can’t resist a challenge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worldly, famous, and notorious with the ladies, Seb had planned a weekend of fishing and relaxation with his brothers. Until Lexie, with her kissable lips and frosty “get lost” attitude, makes him want to forget his culinary empire and create some magic with her. After he fires up his charm—including challenging her to a televised cook-off to break through her resistance—it’s now hotter in the bedroom than it is in the kitchen and Lexie isn’t sure whether she’s lost her mind . . . or just her heart.</description>

  <description>What happens when an introverted artist who only likes sex when it's a one-night stand meets a computer-geek-extraordinaire with his own sexy secrets? Objectification, romance, pain, adoration, lots of kinky toys, and oodles and oodles of wonderfully imaginative sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Cara and Travis on their journey to mesh their distinctive sexual tastes into a loving relationship with blow-your-mind kink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ob•jec•ti•fi•ca•tion: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  Treating a person as an object for use, with no regard&lt;br&gt;     for a person's personality or sentience. &lt;br&gt;2.  Regarding someone as a commodity; considering them &lt;br&gt;     merely an instrument towards one's sexual pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of OBJECTIFICATION:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.  A woman is on her back at the edge of a tall bed with&lt;br&gt;     hands and feet bound together and restrained above her&lt;br&gt;     head. A curtain drapes from a canopy above and puddles&lt;br&gt;     on the backs of her thighs. The man about to penetrate&lt;br&gt;     her sees only female genitals available for use. &lt;br&gt;2.  A woman is dressed in a full latex blow-up doll costume&lt;br&gt;     with durable latex ‘pockets’ stuffed into her orifices.&lt;br&gt;     She is bound into a position giving easy access to all&lt;br&gt;     three holes at a party. Her face is completely covered&lt;br&gt;     excepting nose and mouth. The men do not know who&lt;br&gt;     is in the costume.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safeword: Quinacridone&lt;/em&gt; is a stand-alone book. You do not need to have read the previous books in this series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This title contains graphic language, consensual BDSM, extreme objectification, bondage, watersports (one scene), chemical play, fisting, temporary body modification with saline injections (one scene), and the use of toys including clamps, canes, plugs, paddles, whips, floggers, and zip-ties.</description>

  <description>Cassie Robichaud’s life is filled with regret and loneliness after the sudden death of her husband. She waits tables at the rundown Café Rose in New Orleans, and every night she heads home to her solitary one-bedroom apartment. But when she discovers a notebook left behind by a mysterious woman at the café, Cassie’s world is forever changed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The notebook’s stunningly explicit confessions shock and fascinate Cassie, and eventually lead her to S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T, an underground society dedicated to helping women realize their wildest, most intimate sexual fantasies. Cassie soon immerses herself in an electrifying journey through a series of ten rapturous fantasies with gorgeous men who awaken and satisfy her like never before. As she is set free from her inhibitions, she discovers a new confidence that transforms her, giving her the courage to live passionately. Equal parts enticing, liberating and emotionally powerful, S∙E∙C∙R∙E∙T is a world where fantasy becomes reality.</description>

  <description>Ian is a fifteen year old, socially isolated, orphan who can never seem to make his adopted parents happy.  His guardians, an abusive Pentecostal reverend and his wife, force Ian to live in an oppressive, chaotic world, but all that is about to change when he is suddenly forced from the only world he knows. Can he learn to think for himself in a modern world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;W A R N I N G&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parts of this story are exceptionally violent and contain an extreme depiction of radical Christianity at its worst.  It should not be read by people who are faint of heart, or by people who wish to continue to live in their delusion that child abuse does not happen.  It does.  It happens everywhere, everyday, and in some cases by the people you would lease suspect.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;You only hurt the ones you love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Logan Witherspoon recently discovered that his girlfriend of three years cheated on him. But things start to look up when a new student breezes through the halls of his small-town high school. Sage Hendricks befriends Logan at a time when he no longer trusts or believes in people. Sage has been homeschooled for a number of years and her parents have forbidden her to date anyone, but she won’t tell Logan why. One day, Logan acts on his growing feelings for Sage. Moments later, he wishes he never had. Sage finally discloses her big secret: she’s actually a boy. Enraged, frightened, and feeling betrayed, Logan lashes out at Sage and disowns her. But once Logan comes to terms with what happened, he reaches out to Sage in an attempt to understand her situation. But Logan has no idea how rocky the road back to friendship will be.</description>

  <description>"Last week I cut my hair, bought some boys' clothes and shoes, wrapped a large ACE bandage around my chest to flatten my fortunately-not-large breasts, and began looking for a new name." &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angela Katz-McNair has never felt quite right as a girl. Her whole life is leading up to the day she decides to become Grady, a guy. While coming out as transgendered feels right to Grady, he isn't prepared for the reaction he gets from everyone else. His mother is upset, his younger sister is mortified, and his best friend, Eve, won't acknowledge him in public. Why can't people just let Grady be himself? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grady's life is miserable until he finds friends in some unexpected places -- like the school geek, Sebastian, who explains that there is precedent in the natural world (parrotfish change gender when they need to, and the newly male fish are the alpha males), and Kita, a senior who might just be Grady's first love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From acclaimed writer Ellen Wittlinger, this is the groundbreaking story of one teen's search for self and his struggle for acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>They met at ten, they kissed at twelve, and were madly in love by eighteen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb Deering is the captain of the swim team and the hottest senior in school. He comes from a loving home with a kind father and a caring, but strict, mother who is battling breast cancer. Nico Caro is small and beautiful, and has a father who rules with an iron fist--literally. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One morning Caleb forgets himself, and he pecks Nico on the lips at school. A teacher sees them and tattles to the Headmaster. The accidental outing at school might be the least of their problems, because the ball set in motion by the school’s calls to their parents could get Nico killed. In the face of that very real danger, Caleb knows he has only one mission in life: to keep Nico &lt;em&gt;safe.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of Australia’s most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and that’s why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they’re always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s his game and his rules. He’s content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, she’s exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and language.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sex + money shouldn’t = love, but since when does the heart follow any laws but its own?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent college graduate and mathematical genius Skye McCord is determined that this summer he is going to do something he’s always wanted to try.  Living.  And, as a scientist, he’s not leaving anything to chance. He’s got a new job in Las Vegas, a signing bonus burning a hole in his pocket and what else does a brainy geek spend his money on but an education? This time of the carnal variety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam Maddox isn’t your ordinary gay male escort – he’s actually gay, and he really loves his job.  Especially when he meets his newest client.  Skye’s cute and awkward and sort of odd, and when he informs Liam that he wants to hire him to teach him everything he needs to know about being gay, well…Liam’s too intrigued to say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except what starts as light-hearted lessons in sex and seduction quickly becomes more as Liam begins to tap into a submissive side of Skye the young man never knew he had.  Liam’s never been this drawn to anyone before, and he’s beginning to wonder if he can walk away when their time is up. Does happily ever after exist for someone like Liam with someone like Skye?</description>

  <description>Between revving engines, smoking tires, and high speeds, two friends form a vital bond in the shadows of the blaring spotlight. Sway Reins, a track owner’s only daughter, and Jameson Riley, a gritty NASCAR rookie driver, have been best friends since they were kids. Over the years, Sway becomes his safety shield during his rapid rise to the elite levels of auto racing. A night of celebrating a victory leaves Sway believing that she can convince Jameson to fall in love with her. She becomes determined to be more than just a pit lizard trolling the pits. Little does she know that this steadfast racer has his own idea of revelry. Soon their compression ratios are timed exactly right and all the reciprocating motions have led them to happy hour. As their passion revs, the inner workings of an internal combustion engine have never been so erotic. Just a taste turns into a thirst neither of them saw coming. Can she convince this rookie he can have love and his dream?</description>

  <description>While recovering from the recent loss of his parents, Daniel Donnelly receives a phone call from his estranged aunt, who turns over control of the family fortune and estate, Timber Manor. Though his father seemed guarded about the past, Daniel’s need for family and curiosity compel him to visit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located in a secluded area of the Northwest, Timber Manor has grown silent over the years. Her halls sit empty and a thin layer of dust adorns the sheet-covered furniture. When Daniel arrives to begin repairs, strange things happen. Nightmares haunt his dreams.

  <description>A friendship between the lost and lonely Caroline, and the unhappy Sebastian, leads to an illicit love that threatens them both.&lt;br&gt;Caroline Wilson is trapped in a cold and loveless marriage with an older man. When her husband finally wins a long sought-after promotion, Caroline feels she has little choice but to follow him to a new home in San Diego. There she meets Sebastian, a young man of 17. &lt;br&gt;For an all too brief summer, their happiness blooms. &lt;br&gt;But external pressures begin to bear down, not least from the overbearing David, and Sebastian’s parents begin to suspect that their son has a secret. Even Caroline’s new friend, Donna, realises that dark passions exist below the serene surface.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What a scoundrel wants, a scoundrel gets...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A decade ago, the Marquess of Bourne was cast from society with nothing but his title. Now a partner in London’s most exclusive gaming hell, the cold, ruthless Bourne will do whatever it takes to regain his inheritance—including marrying perfect, proper Lady Penelope Marbury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A broken engagement and years of disappointing courtships have left Penelope with little interest in a quiet, comfortable marriage, and a longing for something more. How lucky that her new husband has access to such unexplored pleasures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bourne may be a prince of London’s underworld, but he vows to keep Penelope untouched by its wickedness—a challenge indeed as the lady discovers her own desires, and her willingness to wager anything for them... even her heart.</description>

I will provide, take care and see that no harm falls upon you, as long as you respect me and behave according to your status. As I said, you are the most adorable thing that had caught my attention in years. You have to be mine and I have every intention to win you over.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I'm 44 and way past the age for playing. You are everything I've dreamed of for a lover and a companion in life. Your beauty and innocence makes you perfect for me." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these words, Konrad von Lintorff, a Swiss German banker declared his intentions to a 19 years old penniless student. Guntram was young, kind hearted and exactly looking as Konrad's former lover. Can a young sweet boy survive the High Finance World and the love of a possessive and violent man? Follow Guntram's diary through a story of intrigue, love, sex, betrayal, secret societies, deceptions and murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The author decided that Substitute and its sequel will be available only in paper version.

  <description>Myra Sommers, an attractive young copy editor living in Philadelphia, makes the tough decision to return to her family home in Nyssa, Oregon. A recent death leaves her with no remaining family, and she decides to heal and regroup there. Her decision to leave is solidified by recent revelations involving her cheating ex-boyfriend, Trent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Myra parts ways with her only friend, Susie O’Connor, a zany woman who’s more than a little insane. In Nyssa, Myra finds little immediate comfort in her “new” home which is literally falling apart around her. She sinks into a deep depression, exacerbated by her feelings of loneliness and isolation in the small town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;News of Myra’s return takes no time to spread through Nyssa, and she quickly encounters several locals, some friendly, some not. Among the friendly faces is Jim, an elderly neighbor whom she begins to rely on for help and companionship. When she realizes that she’s going to have to hire someone to do repairs on her broken-down home, Jim gives her the name of a local contractor, Dylan Lawson, who has done work for him in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Myra calls Dylan for an estimate, she’s astounded by the contractor’s gruff, surly demeanor. But she trusts Jim and there are few other options in the small town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan can’t help but notice that Myra is young, single, and beautiful, which makes him suspicious of her real reason for calling him. The women in Nyssa pursue him relentlessly but he’s not in the least bit interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Myra approves his estimate, Dylan begins the process of repairing her home. While he works, she begins writing a book; that is, when she’s not fielding insane calls from Susie who misses her like crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowly, a reluctant friendship develops between the pair, followed by romantic feelings which neither of them can fight. However, their painful past experiences threaten to tear them apart. Can they move beyond their despair and open their hearts to love?</description>

  <description>Since the 1970s humans have forced supernaturals to live in caged cities. Silver brands embedded in their foreheads identify them by species: a full moon for Vampires, a crescent moon for Shifters, a pair of wings for Fairies, and the list goes on, for each supernatural species has been tagged and categorized by humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanore Vesta is marked with a silver X, the brand of Mixbreeds, second-class citizens shunned by society. She stays to herself, revealing her ability to create fire only during emergencies. All she wants to do is graduate college and stop having to steal to survive. But when she stumbles upon a murder in progress, she catches the attention of a supernatural killer. Now all she wants is to stop finding dead bodies in her apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enlisting help from her Were-cheetah ex-boyfriend MeShack and a new mysterious friend named Zulu, she is steered through the habitat’s raunchy nightlife. But their presence sometimes proves to be more burden than help, as they fight for her attention.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the corpses pile up, and the scent of blood fills the air, Lanore is left wondering: Will she find the psycho or die trying?</description>

  <description>Wrapping his arms tightly around her, Ashton pulled Roxy against the chiseled-muscular-perfection that was his body. Waiting patiently for her defiance to crumble, he lightly traced his lips over hers, beckoning her like a siren. She could almost taste his irrefutable hunger when she finally gave into him. A deep moan escaped his throat as she trembled under his embrace. She gasped when he finally released her of his enslaving kiss. Hitherto, Ashton never demanded that she disclose her secret about the blood-lust urges that ruled her body. Even so, his curiosity burned in his hauntingly exquisite, blue-green eyes. &lt;br&gt;“Who poisoned your heart with animosity, my beloved?” Ashton whispered so quietly she hardly heard him. “Silencing your urges by dirtying a knife with your blood is not a sight my soul can bear any longer.”&lt;br&gt;Once upon a time...&lt;br&gt;Two courts rule Faierie – the Seelie and Unseelie. Seelie faie are recognized for their illusionists and magic that mimics fantasy. The darker, wicked Unseelie are coveted for their extraordinary senses and trickery spells. Their rivalry flourishes between their courts, especially when seemingly random faie turn up missing and dead.  &lt;br&gt;Accompanied by her guardian lover, Roxy is appointed to unmask the criminal mastermind. As evidence leads her back to the Goblin Territory – the very place where her destructive, blood-lust tale began – her guarded, dark past unravels. Unseelie accusations develop as she attempts to keep her secrets hidden. They scrutinize Roxy’s association with the atrocious goblins and suspect her murderous involvement. However, what’s more alarming than the allegations, is the growing suspicion and distrust in her lover eyes. With each clue uncovered, he gets closer to discovering the truth behind it all, which has unforeseeable consequences...</description>

  <description>Heralds are the most powerful of all angels, secretive and feared, created for a single purpose. Only those most courageous and worthy earn a place within the elite choir, and only by breaking ancient oaths held sacred can the honor be stripped. It's a punishment that hasn't been imposed in over two-thousand years, until a single reckless act sets off a firestorm, threatening to consume all creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rise Hawke never suspected she'd been marked to play a role in the deadly events unfolding in the spiritual realm. Independent and resistant to authority, she isn't thrilled when she meets Dominik, an angel with new wings, an old grudge, and a mysterious agenda he's determined to impose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vowing to uncover the secrets kept from her, Rise soon learns that knowing what you are isn't nearly as dangerous as discovering why. Hunted by those who want to destroy her, and controlled by those who would see her fulfill her purpose, she is forced into a brutal battle set in motion long before she was ever born. It soon becomes clear that what one angel will risk to earn the title of Herald, is matched only by what another will do to keep it.</description>

  <description>Rett’s done some running away in his life, from family and from boyfriends, and he’s not above doing it again. His current boyfriend wants to take their relationship to the next level, which makes Rett hesitant and doubtful. Luckily, a job offer in a new town solves his problem for him, giving him the perfect excuse to run away yet again from the uncomfortable feeling of someone trying to get close to him, even if it means picking up after seven years of school and starting over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most guys would kill for his new job, and Rett’s certainly desperate for the paycheck. But the irony of the new position isn’t lost on him — he’s never cared a whole lot for sports, and even far less about the world of professional sports, which is right where he’s landed. Then he finds out he’s not the only one that’s new to pro sports, and he gets closer and closer to one of the players as they try to make sense of the whole crazy thing together. And things seem good!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when his family, whom he had long since left behind, shows back up with a family crisis, his life starts to unwind and Rett allows everything around him to painfully self-destruct. It’s only then that he realizes he’s got to get back up, stand his ground, and teach himself the one thing he never truly learned growing up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s got to stop running away and finally learn what it really means to be a man.</description>

  <description>This omnibus combines the three Elements of the Undead books in a single volume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book One - Fire&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Megan Pritchard clocks in for her late night shift in a Nevada brothel, she has no way of knowing it will be her last. Around the world, the dead are rising, and mankind is on the express train to extinction. As her coworkers turn into cannibalistic zombies, Megan is forced to flee into the desert with nothing but the clothes on her back and a vague plan to reach her sister in southern Arizona.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book Two - Air&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the dead rise in Houston, Dave and Chris Thompson find themselves stranded on the top floor of the Liberty Medical Center, with nowhere to run and no help in sight. With Dave's broken leg making movement impossible and the disintegration of civilization accelerating around them, they have to act fast, or be consumed by the seething horde below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book Three - Earth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been three years since the undead dragged mankind kicking and screaming from the top of the food chain and sent him scurrying into the dark corners of a dead world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a beleaguered band of survivors in southern Arizona, life is about to go from bad to worse. The rains have failed and, they have no choice but to leave the safety of their home in search of water. But before they can make their move, they must face a new threat from the undead, a threat beyond anything in their worst nightmares.</description>

  <description>Dane Stiger is a man on the run, but running is expensive when you're the Captain of a small cargo ship. To make ends meet, Dane and his crew take up mercenary jobs. Yet wherever they go, trouble never seems to be far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On what should have been a routine cargo delivery, the ship is forced to make an unexpected pit-stop on the barren wastelands of Earth. There Dane meets a young man with no name or past, whose only companion is a leopard by the name of Spot. Feeling a connection to him, Dane takes the duo onto his ship, unaware of the trouble he has invited in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the young man's memories begin to surface, Dane leads his crew across space in search of a hidden past, to a backwater planet where something is very amiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written as part of the 'Love is Always Write' event for the M/M Romance Group.</description>

  <description>When Arthur agrees to meet Gwen's new boyfriend Lance and his group of friends he never expected it to include Merlin. It's been nine years since they broke up, but the memories are still raw. Pretending that they don't know each other seems like the best idea, until it's not.</description>

  <description>Closeted eighteen-year-old Steve Chiverton’s fantasy boyfriend is Beau Mason, a quiet and reserved older man who lives on the edge of the village. A man who barely knows Steve exists. Amateur artist Beau’s fantasy is Rick Angell, international rock star and the fuel of many an erotic dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temptation is the hottest club in town, and Steve’s there looking for a boyfriend who can tear down his walls of secrecy. Beau’s there too, looking for indiscriminate sex to ease the pain of a broken relationship. When Beau suffers a minor asthma attack, Steve sees his chance to play rescuer and jumps at the chance to escort his fantasy home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sex they enjoy is more intense than Steve’s virginal imagination could ever have supplied. Beau is everything he could want in a boyfriend and far more besides. The unexpected arrival of Beau’s ex-lover sends Steve’s dream-come-true crashing around his ears. How can he possibly compete for Beau affections with Rick Angell, world famous rock star, public heterosexual and bedroom user of Beau’s affections and body?</description>

  <description>As Maurice Hall makes his way through a traditional English education, he projects an outer confidence that masks troubling questions about his own identity. Frustrated and unfulfilled, a product of the bourgeoisie he will grow to despise, he has difficulty acknowledging his nascent attraction to men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Cambridge he meets Clive, who opens his eyes to a less conventional view of the nature of love. Yet when Maurice is confronted by the societal pressures of life beyond university, self-doubt and heartbreak threaten his quest for happiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new edition of this novel, which although written in 1914, was not published until after the author's death in 1970 because of its homosexual content. It tells the story of a young man at Cambridge, who falls in love with another man who betrays him by turning to women. But then he meets someone else and finds happiness with him.</description>

  <description>Soon-to-be high school junior David Harper hates his family’s move to the country. There’s nothing to do, and he misses his friends in the city. But he doesn’t have a choice. His mother’s job is in Mason County now, so David and his mom are too, and he has to make the best of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, the only redeeming feature of David’s new home is the swimming hole across the field from his house. Then David meets Benjamin Killinger, and suddenly life stops being so dull.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benjamin is Amish, and cooling off in the swimming hole is one of the few liberties he and his brothers enjoy. A friendship with an English boy is not—but that doesn’t stop him and David from getting to know each other, as long as it's on the neutral ground by the creek. After David risks his life to save Benjamin’s father, the boys’ friendship is tolerated, then accepted. But before long, Benjamin’s feelings for David grow beyond the platonic. Benjamin's family and the rest of the community will never allow a love like that, and a secret this big can’t stay secret forever...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gay Contemporary Young Adult/Juvenile</description>

  <description>"To seal their bond, they must break the ties that bind. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Painfully introverted and rendered nearly mute by a heavy stammer, Lord George Albert Westin rarely ventures any farther than the club or his beloved gardens. When he hears rumors of an exotic new orchid sighted at a local hobbyist s house, though, he girds himself with opiates and determination to attend a house party, hoping to sneak a peek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He finds the orchid, yes but he finds something else even more rare and exquisite: Michael Vallant. Professional sodomite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael climbed out of an adolescent hell as a courtesan s bastard to become successful and independent-minded, seeing men on his own terms, protected by a powerful friend. He is master of his own world until Wes. Not only because, for once, the sex is for pleasure and not for profit. They are joined by tendrils of a shameful, unspoken history. The closer his shy, poppy-addicted lover lures him to the light of love, the harder his past works to drag him back into the dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There s only one way out of this tangle. Help Wes face the fears that cripple him right after Michael finds the courage to reveal the devastating truth that binds them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains wounded heroes, bibliophilic tendencies, orchid obsessions, a right bastard of a marquis, and gay men who get happily-ever-afters.</description>

  <description>Contemporary Military Romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the war-torn streets of Baghdad to the bittersweet comforts of the home front, two wounded hearts navigate the battlefield of coming home from war in this explosive eBook original from newcomer Jessica Scott.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Keeping his men alive is all that matters to Sergeant First Class Shane Garrison. But meeting Jen St. James the night before his latest deployment makes Shane wonder if there’s more to life than war. He leaves for Iraq remembering a single kiss with a woman he’ll never see again—until a near fatal attack lands him back at home and in her care. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Jen has survived her own brush with death and endured its scars. And yet there’s a fire in Shane that makes Jen forget all about her past. He may be her patient, but when this warrior looks her in the eyes, she feels—for the first time in a long time—like a woman. Shane is too proud to ask for help, but for Jen, caring for him is more than a duty—it’s a need. And as Jen guides Shane through the fires of healing, she finds something she never expected—her deepest desire.</description>

  <description>Kit Connor has always led a safe, cautious life. But when her friend points out that her erotic writing lacks something, she decides to attend a Sexual Healing group to improve her knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kit expects to find the gritty underbelly of sex, and instead finds louche, laidback, sex-loving Dillon Holt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He makes a suggestion to her: that he will tell tales of his sexual excess, and help her book get the realism it needs. She agrees, but hasn't the least idea of what she's getting into.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dillon doesn't have simple advice in mind … he has lessons to teach her. Lessons on everything she's never dared to experience, from kink to real passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Kit is never sure: is Dillon the addict, or is she just addicted to him?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THERE'S A FINE LINE...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an emergency paramedic, Lauren Boyer is dedicated and highly capable. Until an earthquake strikes, trapping her beneath the freeway with a group of strangers--including Iraq war veteran Garrett Wright... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...BETWEEN PERIL AND PASSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Handsome and take-charge Garrett aids Lauren in her rescue efforts, even as the steely look in his eyes seems to hide dark secrets. When a gang of escaped convicts goes on the attack, Garrett's bravery makes him more than a courageous bystander to Lauren. If they can save the others before time runs out, maybe, just maybe, they can explore the fire igniting between them--if the truth about who he really is doesn't pull them apart forever....</description>

  <description>*An Erotic Spy Thriller* &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrenaline junkie Jessica Booker joined the CIA to take on bad guys and flirt with danger. And with perks like sleeping with hot foreign men added into the mix, well…it’s a pretty sweet deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now in Paris, she’s about to take on her second assignment as an official agent but is caught off guard when her new handler turns out to be Sims, a sexy CIA instructor. Sims was hard enough to resist in the classroom—in the field, he's a dangerous distraction. To make matters worse, Jessica’s target is a gorgeous Frenchman who manages to put her in the most compromising positions—positions she doesn’t altogether mind.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With rogue agents, classified secrets, and tempting men at every turn, this mission will prove to be the first real test of her skills, both in and out of the bedroom.</description>

  <description>*** Please note: This is a New Adult Romance novel involving two siblings who struggle with their emotions. This is not a work of erotica.***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heart cares not what society forbids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily nurtures a secret love for a flawless man—the one who is her soul mate. Donovan is gorgeous, charismatic, and delights in all of Lily’s talents and quirks. Their innate knowledge of each other is almost telepathic. Together they interlock like fine threads creating luxurious silk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But society dictates this picture-perfect adoration is the ghastliest of all possibilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lily embarks on a quest for the romance the heavens intended, her suitor turns reluctant. Desperate to uncover why Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hiding decayed from a tender-hearted gentleman into a ferociously self-serving, cocky bastard, Lily is prepared for battle when it comes to the salvation of her soul mate. However, Donovan traps Lily in a mental game of chess, leaving her to question his sanity. When Lily’s revelations about Donovan’s destructive alter ego lead to an inconceivable truth, can she help Donovan survive fate’s cruel joke?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impassioned, witty, and deeply moving, Love’s Forbidden Flower is filled with stunning controversies that will forever haunt your heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sometimes bravery and love are one and the same.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriel and Tristan Stalling parted ways seven years ago when their father kicked Gabriel out of the house for being gay. The years that passed were hard on both brothers. Tristan was left with his guilt and shame for not sticking up for his twin, the relentless need to please their parents, and the gnawing ache for his other half.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriel manages to make his dreams of becoming a rockstar come true, but with his fame comes drugs and meaningless sex as he tries to drown out the hurt he feels when Tristan abandoned him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As fate would have it, the Stalling twins are about to get one last chance to make things right. Both Gabriel and Tristan will be tested as never before. Not only will they have to make a choice between giving in to a love so taboo it can never be revealed or spending their lives forever broken, but they will also have to face the ghosts of their past, even the ones with the power to destroy them.</description>

  <description>Compared favorably to the works of Faulkner and Dickens, Arundhati Roy’s debut novel is a modern classic that has been read and loved worldwide. Equal parts powerful family saga, forbidden love story, and piercing political drama, it is the story of an affluent Indian family forever changed by one fateful day in 1969. The seven-year-old twins Estha and Rahel see their world shaken irrevokably by the arrival of their beautiful young cousin, Sophie. It is an event that will lead to an illicit liaison and tragedies accidental and intentional, exposing “big things [that] lurk unsaid” in a country drifting dangerously toward unrest. Lush, lyrical, and unnerving, The God of Small Things is an award-winning landmark that started for its author an esteemed career of fiction and political commentary that continues unabated.</description>

  <description>Demon Jace Barton owns Tailz, a colorful pub in Salem, along with his twin brother Konnor. Strange folks pass through every day, but on Halloween things tend to get more bizarre. Still, Jace is surprised when Cash Rowan pays him a visit with a tale that stands Jace's hair on end. This dark urban fantasy contains graphic violence and a consensual sexual relationship between non-human twin brothers.</description>

  <description>For twins Ryker and Ranger Good, life has never been easy. Kicked out of the house when they were barely eighteen, the brothers started a new life together. Now in their thirties they are ready to make a commitment, not only to each other but to the woman they’ve waited to claim for four years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilly Bevin has been in love with the Good twins for years, only to be treated like a child by them. Now twenty-one, Lilly’s ready to spread her wings. Working in the town bar is just one of the ways she’s declaring her independence, dating is the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the twins find out the woman they want is dating a smarmy hustler they try to talk some sense into her, only to be told to butt out. Now it’s up to them to tame their wildcat and bring her into the fold of their love. A wildcat however, has claws and Lilly isn’t shy about using hers to her advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is best read in sequence as part of a series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains a twincest storyline, sexual intimacy between twins, and may be offensive to some readers.</description>

  <description>The Blake brothers have upped the ante in their weekly poker game. The week Terry loses, he finds that paying his debt of telling the truth sets him free to pursue a fantasy he never dreamed could be reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terry has lived his life according to the guidelines, by studying accounting, getting an MBA, and working for the family business. And while his work has its own rewards, something has been missing, and his eyes have only just been opened to what--or rather who--that could be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terry can handle any dare his brothers dish out, but the demand for Truth is a different matter. Unable to hide behind his pristine reputation and fancy business suit, Terry is honor bound to divulge secrets he’s been ashamed to admit even to himself in the privacy of his own bedroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twins Dex and Trick have finally found acceptance for their relationship in the homes of their friends. They would never do anything to jeopardize that newfound sense of belonging. Fooling around with Mischa’s prissy, domineering, oh-so-sexy older brother is risky. A one night stand might be okay, and the boys happily indulge, but then close ranks afterward, pushing Terry aside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terry isn’t going to back down without a fight. He’s convinced that Dex and Trick are meant to be his, and he’ll do whatever it takes to make them realize all the safety and protection they need can be found in his arms.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A sweet baker with spicy taste...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcell lives a quiet life, keeping the treats coming in his aunt's bakery. He is well known for his manners, his shy demeanor, and his perfect cinnamon rolls. He's a classic good boy, who has never stepped so much as a toe out of line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Withers Boys are the town bad boys—faerie half-brothers whose only talents are their green thumbs and an unmatched ability to cause trouble. When they're not causing trouble, it's only because the Sheriff has caught them for the moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things are never what they seem in a small town, and it's always the quiet ones...This is Book 4 of the Midsummer series, but can be read without reading the prior books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This story features incest and a threesome.</description>

  <description>Not so long ago, Elton had it all. A loving family, a jewelry business he helped his father run, and the esteemed position of Jeweler Troisieme to Mars. But the revelation of deep betrayals by his father tore his life and his family apart, culminating in a tragedy that forever ruined any chance of happiness for Elton and his sister, Lana. Parents dead, abandoned by friends, and their reputations ruined, Elton and Lana accept the offer of a new life on a planet far away from Mars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before settling into their new lives, however, Elton and Lana decide to stop on Bangkok, the notorious 'star of pleasures.' In the place where all dreams come true, all they want is to learn how to be happy again. But everything goes awry when Elton's unmatched skills with gems allows him to spot a fake necklace in a museum, a discovery that leads him straight to the legendary Jewels of Bangkok.</description>

  <description>Growing up, Blythe Gold did everything a big brother should do. He did his best to protect Sterling and was always there, looking out for him. One night of shared passion with friends, opens Blythe's eyes to a future he never thought possible. For Blythe, life would never be the same. For as long as he could remember, there's only been one man for him. A man who, according to society, should be out of his reach. But society's expectations couldn't stop his heart from falling in love with Sterling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sterling Gold grew up to believe that love was unconditional. Never could he have imagined, the person he would love most was the only man he should never love. After years of trying to hide his feelings, transferring universities and moving out of state, events begin to unfold that would change his future forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would society standards rip them apart or will the love between brothers prove stronger?</description>

  <description>Santa Baby,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been very conflicted about the Kaulitz twins. The (albeit very small) NICE side of me wants to adopt them and carry them around in my pocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NAUGHTY side, however.... The NAUGHTY side can't help but let the thoughts wander.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, what side wins, Santa Baby? NAUGHTY or NICE? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If their secret to youth is Vampirism, well, that explains a lot!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This story features a consensual sexual relationship between twin brothers. Not for everyone, and not safe for work.</description>

  <description>Twins Heath and Vanner travel the rodeo circuit together, Heath watching while Vanner does the hard riding. Heath loves to watch his twin ride, loves Vanner like no one else. He doesn't dare tell anyone, least of all Heath, about his secret love, though, knowing things could go very bad if he did, not just for the two of them, but for their mentally disabled sister Marybeth as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things don't always go as planned, though, and when Vanner's sponsor starts to make demands, and Heath and Vanner find themselves in a tough spot, Heath finds a way to share what's in his heart. Just when things seem to be going their way, Heath’s friend Lucy barges in on them making love, it seems that everything is going to be exposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before they can come to terms with Lucy knowing not only about their relationship, but also about their sister Marybeth, they find out that someone else knows about Marybeth, someone who isn’t a friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they rescue Marybeth without exposing themselves further?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compilation of the Chaser series Taboo.</description>

  <description>In this first installment of the exciting new psychosexual thriller, The Flesh Cartel, orphaned brothers Mat and Dougie Carmichael are stolen in the night from their own home. Taken to a horrifying processing facility, they are assessed, microchipped, and subjected to unspeakable brutality—all in preparation for sale to the highest bidder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world where every person has a price, the beautiful and subduable PhD student Dougie is highly prized. His brother, a rough-edged MMA fighter, is less desirable—and potentially too dangerous—but he still has his own appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abused and locked up under round the clock surveillance, with no idea where they are or even why they’ve been taken, escape seems impossible, which leaves staying together their only hope. And after being separated once by the foster system, they'll do anything to keep it from happening again. Anything at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Publisher's note: This title contains material some may find objectionable or trigger-inducing, including explicit violence, non-consent, and forced incest.)</description>

  <description>Mermen twins Jaden and Chrys have been scorned all their lives by Atlantean society. The only one who cares about them is Prince Aurus. But when Aurus and Chrys fall in love, they leave Jaden an outsider. Secretly, Jaden wants his twin, but he keeps his sinful affection well hidden. After they are separated from Aurus, he is the only one who can comfort Chrys, even if only in a brotherly manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Atlantean king concocts a plan to hurt them, Jaden and Chrys run away, and their paths cross with Aurus's again. This time, though, a strange force interferes in their lives. A dark, powerful beast that lives in the depths of the ocean calls out to Jaden, luring him toward its lair. With Jaden in danger of disappearing forever, Chrys and Aurus are faced with a choice, a realization, and a decision. Will mysterious Vaar finally help the three mermen see the truth, or will he end their very existences?</description>

  <description>Fiona volunteers to help her recently widowed uncle get his house in order before starting her freshman year of college. Uncle Ed and aunt Carole are two of her favorite people in the world. While trying to help her grieving uncle, she doesn't expect her school girl crush to turn into a torrid affair, but it does. She doesn't expect him to want her at all, but he does, more than he can handle. And as her uncle struggles with the thoughts of wanting and having his niece in so many ways, Fiona struggles to show him that it's all okay. That she's not a little girl any more.</description>

  <description>She is pretty and talented - sweet sixteen and never been kissed. He is seventeen; gorgeous and on the brink of a bright future. And now they have fallen in love. But... they are brother and sister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Lochan and sixteen-year-old Maya have always felt more like friends than siblings. Together they have stepped in for their alcoholic, wayward mother to take care of their three younger siblings. As defacto parents to the little ones, Lochan and Maya have had to grow up fast. And the stress of their lives—and the way they understand each other so completely—has also also brought them closer than two siblings would ordinarily be. So close, in fact, that they have fallen in love. Their clandestine romance quickly blooms into deep, desperate love. They know their relationship is wrong and cannot possibly continue. And yet, they cannot stop what feels so incredibly right. As the novel careens toward an explosive and shocking finale, only one thing is certain: a love this devastating has no happy ending.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Such wonderful children. Such a beautiful mother. Such a lovely house. Such endless terror!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn't that she didn't love her children. She did. But there was a fortune at stake--a fortune that would assure their later happiness if she could keep the children a secret from her dying father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she and her mother hid her darlings away in an unused attic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just for a little while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the brutal days swelled into agonizing years. Now Cathy, Chris, and the twins wait in their cramped and helpless world, stirred by adult dreams, adult desires, served a meager sustenance by an angry, superstitious grandmother who knows that the Devil works in dark and devious ways. Sometimes he sends children to do his work--children who--one by one--must be destroyed....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     'Way upstairs there are&lt;br&gt;       four secrets hidden.&lt;br&gt;         Blond, beautiful, innocent&lt;br&gt;           struggling to stay alive....</description>

  <description>Discover the delicious lure of a taboo siren call with four stories bundled into a wickedly hot anthology that's determined to keep it all in the family!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Patrick's father went off to war in 1944, he told his eighteen-year-old son, You're the "Man of the House" now. Patrick's stepmother has struggled to keep them afloat, and he does what he can to help. He knows she's tired, sad and very lonely, but when circumstance brings a young woman into their lives for a brief time, it alters everything between he and his stepmother forever. Will Patrick become the real "man of the house" before his father returns from the war?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "The Garden of Eden," Libby has lived her whole life with her stepfather, Ed, in a nudist colony. It's a very open, natural life, and they've never had an issue--until Libby's mother, Kim, re-enters their lives. Kim is appalled by their living and sleeping arrangements and wants to take Libby away from the nudist life. Libby, still devastated by her mother's abandonment, wants to have nothing to do with the shopping trips and material things her mother is offering, but the longer Kim stays, the more everything --everything--becomes a greater temptation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Lassoing the Moon," Leila knows she's always been closer to her stepson, Rich, than most mothers, since Rich's father left when he was just a baby. He's been the man in her life forever--but now he's really a man, and his coming-of-age is a test for both of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Lost Souls," eighteen-year-old Lily, raised by her fundamentalist preacher stepfather, Adam, isn't allowed to date or do anything against church "law." Asked to the Halloween dance by a boy she really likes, Lily defies Adam. But when they are caught in a compromising position by her stepfather, what will her punishment and repentance be?</description>

  <description>Devastated by the loss of his Master and long-time partner, Owen's life slips into a tailspin of loneliness and abuse. When he finally gives in and gives up, an angel pulls him from the filthy ground of a back alley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitchell isn't in the market for a new boy, but he can’t bear to stand by and watch Owen's demise from the sidelines. He finds more than a companion in the older man when he takes him under his wing, and makes it his mission to show Owen it’s never too late to teach an old dog some new tricks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genre: Contemporary slave fiction &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tags: d/s, kink, light BDSM&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>At twenty-one years old, Richard Lewis Bancroft was on the fast track to fame and fortune. An award-winning start on the Broadway stage led him to the silver screens of Hollywood, where his star began to rise, and his heart fell hard for professional baseball sensation, Manuel Guzman. But there was no script for living out loud with the man of his dreams in the world of 1964. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Richard disappeared without a trace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty years later, Michael Spencer discovered a journal in his grandmother's attic that would change his life forever, and quite possibly, solve the mysterious disappearance of Richard Lewis Bancroft. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genres/Tags:&lt;/strong&gt; Gay M/M / Contemporary / Family Secrets / Lies / Angst / HEA / Intolerance / Sacrifice / Romance / Emotional&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approx.

  <description>Part of the Goodreads M/M Romance group's Love is Always Write event. Story Prompt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION: Sexy Marine sitting on the floor, shirtless with just fatigue pants, another sexy Marine leaning down with his hand resting on the other Marine's lower stomach. Matching tattoos on their shoulders and upper arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;STORY LETTER:&lt;br&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;He's been in my life for two decades. Don't Ask Don't Tell ended too late for us as we were months from retirement. We spent so much of our lives in the closet, hiding our love that I worry if we can hold it together when we're out. I'm scared of losing him. For me, he's the hottest thing I've ever seen still and I know he could get guys half my age without trying hard. Why would he stick with me now? But he always knows...he knows when I need him to center me—to remind me of what we have. We're in it together to the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If an author selects this...I LOVE BDSM. Please, please...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited to clarify: I see the man facing forward as a sub and the other man as his dom. They've had stolen moments over the years but never the time and privacy to truly explore their D/s needs at the level they have desired. Now they do since they have retired. I enjoy a little angst (no cheating) but definitely want a HEA. Moderate BDSM would work great. Author, up to you if you take this mind. Ultimately, author, if you pick this one I'll be pleased no matter what you do to give my guys a story!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Virginia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read it free HERE:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/914930-sjd-peterson-beyond-duty-6-4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/9...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The prompt: "It seems like we've known one another for ever, but he doesn't really know me at all. He doesn't know I'm gay and I'm really scared what will happen when he finds out. Especially when he finds out that I don't want to be just friends anymore."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh and Trey have been friends since they were kids, but Josh moved away when they were both seventeen. Their bond has been thinned by distance, by the weight of secrets withheld and a trust betrayed. For years now they've only exchanged short emails and occasional calls, over too many miles to cross. Trey's been willing to live with that, even encouraged it. Because letting Josh get close again might make keeping Trey's secrets impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Josh shows up on Trey's doorstep with a request for help, it could well be an unmitigated disaster.  But Trey finds he can't say no.  This is Josh asking Trey to lend a hand.  Josh, the guy who still pushes every other man Trey ever looked at to second place. So Trey's going to take the chance and say yes.  He's going to grab a few days with the straight guy he never stopped loving, take what crumbs he can get, and damn the consequences.  Although those consequences may not turn out to be the ones Trey's expecting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Shawn Graham and Bobby Wilder couldn't be more different. Shawn is a devout Christian fundamentalist from northern Michigan; Bobby is a street-smart latchkey kid from southern Ohio. From an early age, they are both confused and troubled by their attraction to the same sex. Shawn believes that homosexuality is sinful, and a traumatic incident of childhood sexual abuse adds to his guilt and shame. Bobby has an image to maintain and flatly denies the possibility that his same-sex attractions even exist. He's just too cool to be gay. When they finally connect, their preconceptions are suddenly dwarfed by what they feel for each other. They become inseparable and fall deeply in love; however, love doesn't make life easy. Plans are in motion that will surely devastate the young couple. Painful experiences of the past overshadow happy memories, and heartbreaking obstacles loom over the possibility of a future. If Shawn and Bobby want to stay together, they will have to fight with everything they have.</description>

  <description>Kael Saunders loves to dominate handsome, masculine men like himself. Being in charge is his way of life whether it be in his work with the Secret Intelligence service, his personal life, or in the dungeon. The last thing he expects when he is out on a hit is to fall in love with Angel, an eighteen-year-old boy desperate for the love and guidance of a Daddy. Yet Angel also has a passion for being spanked and restrained. Two very different men find love in a world of skilled assassins, Bosnian terrorists, and dungeon play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM theme and content, male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A six-year downward spiral into a world of lies and deception leads to the end of one man’s life when self-discovery crosses the line between being the perfect son or following his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jimmy Miller never intended to lead a double life starting the day he fell in love with Darian, but his parents’ divorce, fighting in school, and constantly keeping secrets for his closeted best friend and protector, Matt, force his hand. Jimmy finds the demands too great to withstand and ends it all prematurely, leaving behind an angry best friend and a shattered lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt and Darian cling to one another in the aftermath of their loss, forging a new friendship immediately tested by the truths of their relationships with Jimmy that are hidden in the pages of Jimmy’s journals. Will Matt and Darian discover what truly happened to their friend? And will this tragedy birth something beautiful between them as they learn the balance between life, family, and friendship when love is simply not enough?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Bittersweet Dreams&lt;/strong&gt; title: It's an unfortunate truth: love doesn't always conquer all. Regardless of its strength, sometimes fate intervenes, tragedy strikes, or forces conspire against it. These stories of romance do not offer a traditional happy ending, but the strong and enduring love will still touch your heart and maybe move you to tears.</description>

  <description>Danny Marshal has always lived his life out loud, but his androgynous appearance is only a small part of who he is. One night at a frat party, Danny meets Lance Lenard, football jock and apparent straight guy. Lance is shocked when he's immediately attracted to Danny's feminine side. Danny is happy to be the subject of Lance's first man-on-man experiment—until Lance begins to struggle with the fact that despite his appearance, Danny is indeed a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lance's whole life has been focused on his goal of playing in the NFL, and he knows those dreams will be smashed if anyone finds out about his little secret. Although Lance has come to hunger for Danny's touch, he's not willing to give Danny what he's grown to crave: a boyfriend who's proud to love him for every flamboyant and snarky cell in his body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life sends Danny and Lance in different directions, each of them focused on his respective Plan A. But the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.</description>

  <description>Travel writer Joe Jordan hasn’t been home to New York since his boyfriend broke up with him. Instead he’s hopped from hotel to hotel, collecting pens like a child in a fairytale might leave a trail of breadcrumbs hoping to find his way back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now he has an assignment, an article titled “5 Ways to Rediscover New York.” Being back on his home turf is daunting—until he meets Claude Desjardins, a gay romance translator staying in his hotel who, after a night of near passion, leads Joe on a treasure hunt through Manhattan, writing clues on Joe’s skin using hotel pens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it isn’t just New York Joe needs to rediscover.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The False Prince&lt;/strong&gt; is the thrilling first book in a brand-new trilogy filled with danger and deceit and hidden identities that will have readers rushing breathlessly to the end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a discontent kingdom, civil war is brewing. To unify the divided people, Conner, a nobleman of the court, devises a cunning plan to find an impersonator of the king’s long-lost son and install him as a puppet prince. Four orphans are recruited to compete for the role, including a defiant boy named Sage. Sage knows that Conner’s motives are more than questionable, yet his life balances on a sword’s point—he must be chosen to play the prince or he will certainly be killed. But Sage’s rivals have their own agendas as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sage moves from a rundown orphanage to Conner’s sumptuous palace, layer upon layer of treachery and deceit unfold, until finally, a truth is revealed that, in the end, may very well prove more dangerous than all of the lies taken together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An extraordinary adventure filled with danger and action, lies and deadly truths that will have readers clinging to the edge of their seats.</description>

  <description>Tatsu Kurosaki Cobb, the last of an ancient samurai house, will not stop until he takes the head of the vampire that butchered his family. But his vow of revenge means he gives up on any hope for that once-and-forever love. Then he crosses swords with Saito Arisada, second-in-command of Seattle’s vampires and the most beautiful creature Tatsu has ever seen. The sexual chemistry between them is pure, hard, and undeniable. Unable to accept Arisada might be the killer, Tatsu begins a dangerous game. A game driven by the all-consuming thirst for blood that will force them to the extremes of love and hate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fukushū, vengeance. It is all that has sustained Saito Arisada for eight-hundred years. Sōhei monk turned vampire, he has searched for the returned soul of his lover who betrayed him and the Temple of Mii-dera. Arisada believes in only one thing—taking the head of the traitor. Yet, when Arisada sees that soul shining from Tatsu’s emerald eyes, his hatred shatters. He wants Tatsu in his arms and in his bed and in his heart. But Arisada’s samurai code of honor demands nothing less than Tatsu’s death. How can Arisada kill his unmei no hito—his soulmate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a bloody battlefield of feudal Japan to a world where humans and vampires fight for survival, Arisada and Tatsu must choose. At stake is not only love but honor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: The book contains sexually explicit scenes, violence and adult language that may be considered offensive to some readers. This book is for sale to adults only.</description>

  <description>Dr. Samantha Moore is one of the youngest and most acclaimed researchers in the world. Her specialty is blood and she has been recruited by the largest pharmaceutical company in Scotland. For what purpose she cannot begin to imagine, but in an attempt to break out of her painfully shy shell, she throws caution to the wind and leaves her family and best friend behind in Savannah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kade Gunnach is taking a chance hiring an outsider, but he’s desperate to find out how to help his sister. He believes the key lies in her blood, but so far, no one has found the answers. When the new researcher walks into his office, he’s unprepared for his reaction to her and the life-changing ramifications her arrival brings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re drawn together by a force neither is prepared for, but Kade is holding something back. Something that could scare her away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Samantha learns his secret, will she run? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Kade be able to live with the answers he’s been desperately searching for?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;(Part of &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9705875.His_For_The_Holidays" title="His For The Holidays"&gt;His For The Holidays&lt;/a&gt; Anthology)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the new millennium, diamond thief Noel Snow seduced FBI special agent Robert Cuffe, then fled into the dawn. Now a successful novelist, Noel uses his capers as fodder for his books, and has modeled his hero's nemesis (and potential love interest) on Cuffe. Though he leaves Robert a drunken phone message every New Year's Eve, Noel hasn't seen or heard from him in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he's thrilled when his former lover shows up at his upstate farm one Christmas Eve. Elation quickly turns to alarm when Robert accuses Noel of being responsible for a recent rash of diamond heists. Robert is all business and as cold as ice: it seems his only interest in Noel is to put him behind bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innocent of the crimes, and still as attracted as ever to the oh-so-serious lawman, Noel plans a second seduction—providing he can stay out of jail long enough!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>18-year-old Vincent has spent his entire life being shuffled from one foster home to the next. His grades sucked. Making friends? Out of the question thanks to his nervous breakdowns and unpredictable moods. Still, Vince thought when Maggie Atkins took him in, he might've finally found a place to get his life--and his issues--in order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Maggie dies, it all falls apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year ago, Vince watched a girl leap to her death off a bridge. He's starting to think she had the right idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through a pro-suicide forum, Vince meets others with the same debate regarding death: cancer-ridden Casper would rather off herself than slowly waste away, and there's quiet, withdrawn Adam, whose mother wouldn't notice if he fell off the face of the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they gravitate toward each other, Vince searches for a reason to live while coping without Maggie, coming to terms with Casper's imminent death, and falling in love with a boy who doesn't plan on sticking around.</description>

  <description>Ten years after Dorjan trusted a boy’s word over his superior officer’s, he and his best friend, Areau, are still living the aftermath—and trying to stop the man responsible. Locked in a careful dance to bring down a corrupt government, Dorjan struggles to balance his grief with Areau’s anger. Just when Dorjan reaches the end of his rope, he sees a familiar face in the shadows, and the boy he trusted a decade before offers him unexpected kindness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taern remembers the soldier who found him under the rushes and listened to his pleas to save his family. When Dorjan reappears in his life, Taern is both captured by his commitment to justice and terrified by the risks he takes. All Taern wants to do is fix him, but the oncoming destruction has been ten years in the making, and Dorjan doesn’t want his help. Not if it puts Taern at risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powers clash and a world's fate dangles between Areau's madness and Dorjan's nobility. While Dorjan fights to save the world, Taern joins the battle simply to save Dorjan, knowing everything hinges on the heart of a man in armor and the strength of the man who loves him.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When love drifts into his life, danger isn't far behind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Mayne's life is as dull as the dishwater in his small-town Montana diner, and that's just how he wants it. Quiet, uneventful, safe from his shadowy past. The breezy young drifter who answers his help-wanted ad makes him uneasy in ways he dare not examine too closely. Except he can't help but be pulled in by Jay Colby's spunky attitude, endless stories, and undeniable sex appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fresh off yet another romantic disaster, Jay doesn't understand his attraction to the taciturn line cook, but there's no fighting the chemistry that lands them in bed together. Where Sam's subtly dominant streak takes command, and Jay delights in discovering the pleasures of his submissive side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safe in the assumption their relationship is temporary, neither lover holds back when the heat is on. Until Sam's deadly past catches up with them with a vengeance, forcing him to drop the life he's built, pick up his lover, and run. As danger cuts closer to the bone, Sam and Jay are forced to face the truth. About themselves, about the depth of their love-and the newly forged bonds that are about to be tested to the limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains enough sparks to ignite a sexual fire, ably fanned by the judicious use of some interesting props, as well as some butt-warming spanking.&lt;/em&gt; Sizzzzle.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;As he continued to stare, I wanted to point to my cheek and remind him, But you were the one who wanted this, remember? You're the one who asked-and I repeat-&lt;/em&gt;Why not fix your face? &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard not to notice Terra Cooper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She's tall, blond, and has an enviable body. But with one turn of her cheek, all people notice is her unmistakably "flawed" face. Terra secretly plans to leave her stifling small town in the Northwest and escape to an East Coast college, but gets pushed off-course by her controlling father. When an unexpected collision puts Terra directly in Jacob's path, the handsome but quirky Goth boy immediately challenges her assumptions about herself and her life, and she is forced in yet another direction. With her carefully laid plans disrupted, will Terra be able to find her true path?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in lively, artful prose, award-winning author Justina Chen Headley has woven together a powerful novel about a fractured family, falling in love, travel, and the meaning of true beauty.</description>

  <description>In a changed world where the sky bleeds red, winter is hotter than hell and full of sandstorms, and summer's even hotter with raging fires that roam the desert-like country, the Heaters manage to survive, barely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to toxic air, life expectancies are so low the only way the tribe can survive is by forcing women to procreate when they turn sixteen and every three years thereafter. It is their duty as Bearers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Siena is a Youngling, soon to be a Bearer, when she starts hearing rumors of another tribe of all women, called the Wild Ones. They are known to kidnap Youngling girls before the Call, the ceremony in which Bearers are given a husband with whom to bear children with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the desert sands run out on her life's hourglass, Siena must uncover the truth about the Wild Ones while untangling the web of lies and deceit her father has masterfully spun.</description>

  <description>Anna Zendel is your average 32-year-old therapist, stressing about clinical exams and struggling to recover from an abusive relationship. But at night she transforms herself into the saucy burlesque dancer Velvet Crush, enchanting Chicago audiences with the art of the tease. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Anna struggles to keep the therapy and burlesque worlds separate and get over her crush on the troupe's emcee, a new danger threatens women across the city. The papers have dubbed him the Darling Killer, because after strangling his victims, he scrawls the word "darling" on their skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one of Anna's fellow dancers is murdered in the dressing room, she realizes that Darling Killer could be closer than she thought. Could Max, Anna's new therapy client who confessed to fantasizing about dead girls and obsessing over the Darling Killer, have anything to do with the murders?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As more women are murdered, and Anna begins receiving mysterious gifts, this burlesque dancer pits feathers and sequins against foul play in the deadliest dance of all.</description>

  <description>Who is Jenna Fox? Seventeen-year-old Jenna has been told that is her name. She has just awoken from a coma, they tell her, and she is still recovering from a terrible accident in which she was involved a year ago. But what happened before that? Jenna doesn't remember her life. Or does she? And are the memories really hers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fascinating novel represents a stunning new direction for acclaimed author Mary Pearson. Set in a near future America, it takes readers on an unforgettable journey through questions of bio-medical ethics and the nature of humanity. Mary Pearson's vividly drawn characters and masterful writing soar to a new level of sophistication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/theadorationofjennafox/MaryEPearson" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/theadorationo...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>When Freedom Airlines flight 121 went down over the Pacific Ocean, no one ever expected to find survivors. Which is why the sixteen-year-old girl discovered floating among the wreckage—alive—is making headlines across the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more strange is that her body is miraculously unharmed and she has no memories of boarding the plane. She has no memories of her life before the crash. She has no memories &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt;. No one knows how she survived. No one knows why she wasn’t on the passenger manifest. And no one can explain why her DNA and fingerprints can’t be found in a single database in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crippled by a world she doesn’t know, plagued by abilities she doesn’t understand, and haunted by a looming threat she can’t remember, Seraphina struggles to piece together her forgotten past and discover who she really is. But with every clue only comes more questions. And she’s running out of time to answer them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her only hope is a strangely alluring boy who claims to know her from before the crash. Who claims they were in love. But can she really trust him? And will he be able to protect her from the people who have been making her forget?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From popular young adult author Jessica Brody comes a compelling and suspenseful new sci-fi series, set in a world where science knows no boundaries, memories are manipulated, and true love can never be forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Enter the world of the highly-acclaimed Experiment in Terror Series by visiting...the Darkhouse:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s always been something a bit off about Perry Palomino. Though she’s been dealing with a quarter-life crisis and post-college syndrome like any other twenty-something, she’s still not what you would call “ordinary.” For one thing, there’s her past which she likes to pretend never happened, and then there’s the fact that she sees ghosts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily for her, that all comes in handy when she stumbles across Dex Foray, an eccentric producer for an upcoming webcast on ghost hunters. Even though the show’s budget is non-existent and Dex himself is a maddening enigma, Perry is instantly drawn into a world that both threatens her life and seduces her with a sense of importance. Her uncle’s haunted lighthouse provides the perfect catalyst and backdrop for a mystery that unravels the threads of Perry’s fragile sanity and causes her to fall for a man, who, like the most dangerous of ghosts, may not be all that he seems.</description>

  <description>Dangerous. Ruthless. Savage. And she's the good guy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Sinclair had a desperate childhood until she was rescued and adopted by a retired army ranger who molded her into a master of self-defense. Now, she's a cunning and fearless assassin thrust into assignment after dangerous assignment, using everything she has-nerve, resilience, strength, sex-to come out on top. Her only rule: trust no one.&lt;br&gt;Abby's latest assignment is in Columbia: go undercover and snuff out a dangerous arms dealer active in the underground sex trade. But when Abby purposely blows her cover in a last-ditch attempt to free the helpless victims, deadly mercenary Kane Woodland is recruited as back-up. His mission: get Abby out of that hell hole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Kane expects is to feel a primal attraction for Abby. But when she convinces him to join her on her perilous mission, their newfound passion could put the lives of their whole team at risk.</description>

  <description>A bodyguard’s life is turned upside down by his intriguing new charge. After three consecutive expulsions for sexual misconduct, Luca D'Amato has no choice but to return to America. Jacob Ryder is the man charged with protecting him from his family's many enemies – but who will protect Ryder from Luca?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status:&lt;/strong&gt; Complete &lt;strong&gt;Word count:&lt;/strong&gt; 267,017  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author’s Note: This story will contain a fair bit of kink and potentially squicky content, including multiple sexual relationships with considerable age differences. The main characters are themselves ten years apart in age. In addition, there will be references to sexual activity that took place when one of the characters was 16/17. As sixteen is the age of consent where I live, I do not consider this to be underage, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://ckingsbridge.livejournal.com/822.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://ckingsbridge.livejournal.com/8...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>It was supposed to be simple. All Navy SEAL Nathan Malone had to do was rescue three young girls from a Colombia drug cartel, then allow himself to be captured just long enough to draw out a government spy. That was before his mission went disastrously wrong…and before his wife, Bella, was told that Nathan was never coming home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bella’s mourned her husband’s death for three long years. But she has no idea he’s still alive. Forced to assume a new identity, the man Nathan was is now dead. If he can get back to his wife, can he keep the secret of who he really is…even as desire threatens to consume them? And as danger threatens to tear Bella from Nathan’s arms once more?</description>

  <description>Too weak to resist young Kelly Benton's attempts at seduction, Rowdy Mackay left home eight years ago. Duty as a U.S. Marine put a safe distance between Rowdy and the nubile Kentucky vixen with persuasive desires of her own. Now, he's returned home, his fantasies fueled, ready to engage the young woman in the kind of erotic games that have earned him and his two cousins Nauti-boy reputations in three counties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once, it was Kelly's dream, too, to feel the heat of the boy she desired. But a brutal attack from a stalker still on the prowl has left Kelly terrified of the dark unknown and of a man's touch. Now, as fear and desire converge, Rowdy fights for the only woman he ever loved--to save her from the deadly threats of a stranger, to rid her of her demons, and to satisfy a hunger more powerful than either can imagine.</description>

  <description>Luke is the perfect boyfriend: handsome, kind, fun. He and Emaline have been together all through high school in Colby, the beach town where they both grew up. But now, in the summer before college, Emaline wonders if perfect is good enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Theo, a super-ambitious outsider, a New Yorker assisting on a documentary film about a reclusive local artist. Theo's sophisticated, exciting, and, best of all, he thinks Emaline is much too smart for Colby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emaline's mostly-absentee father, too, thinks Emaline should have a bigger life, and he's convinced that an Ivy League education is the only route to realizing her potential. Emaline is attracted to the bright future that Theo and her father promise. But she also clings to the deep roots of her loving mother, stepfather, and sisters. Can she ignore the pull of the happily familiar world of Colby?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emaline wants the moon and more, but how can she balance where she comes from with where she's going?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Dessen's devoted fans will welcome this story of romance, yearning, and, finally, empowerment. It could only happen in the summer.</description>

  <description>The irresistible, ever-curious, and always best-selling Mary Roach returns with a new adventure to the invisible realm we carry around inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“America’s funniest science writer” (&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;) takes us down the hatch on an unforgettable tour of our insides. The alimentary canal is classic Mary Roach terrain: the questions inspired by our insides are as taboo, in their way, as the cadavers in &lt;em&gt;Stiff&lt;/em&gt; and every bit as surreal as the universe of zero gravity explored in &lt;em&gt;Packing for Mars&lt;/em&gt;. Why is crunchy food so appealing? Why is it so hard to find names for flavors and smells? Why doesn’t the stomach digest itself? How much can you eat before your stomach bursts? Can constipation kill you? Did it kill Elvis? We meet scientists who tackle the questions no one else thinks—or has the courage—to ask. And we go on location to a pet-food taste-test lab, a bacteria transplant, and into a live stomach to observe the fate of a meal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like all of Roach’s books, &lt;em&gt;Gulp&lt;/em&gt; is as much about human beings as it is about human bodies.</description>

But giving Rowan up isn't an option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discovering that he is the mate of a vampire isn't so bad for Rowan, but the things required of him as the mate of the leader of a vampire tribe just might be more than he can handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rowan is kidnapped, not once, but twice, Luca knows he has to do everything in his power to keep his mate safe, something that would be much easier if Rowan would accept his place as the mate of a vampire and behave. Instead, Rowan is drawing Luca into more trouble with every breath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Luca just can't seem to mind.</description>

  <description>Regan Finley's photography makes the local music scene shine. He's four months from his final exhibition and graduation. But instead of preparing for the party, he's fretting about his exhibition theme -- bondage and passion. There's one person he wants to make his exhibition come to life, if he can convince his housemate to participate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camryn Tate plays the music that makes the young girls scream. He likes being a local rock hero. When he finds out what Regan wants for the exhibition, Cam has to make a decision. He can let Regan have his commanding way and get the pictures he needs for the exhibition, or he can walk away from the best roommate and friend he's ever known... all because of a little ball of nylon rope.</description>

  <description>Ash is an ordinary girl, leading an ordinary life, but behind her smile she hides a secret so damning she’s sure no one could ever love her. Noah is a war photographer who’s come back from Afghanistan with a secret so dark he can’t escape its smothering grip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both need redemption. Ash looks for it by making people happy. Noah seeks it under the whip of a Dom. They’re damaged souls, drowning in guilt, unable to escape the legacies of their pasts. Then their worlds collide in an explosion of fireworks so strong it singes not only them, but those around them. It’s said love heals all wounds, but sometimes before love enters the heart, the intense fire of passion has to burn a path, lighting the way.</description>

  <description>Mac MacAllistre is obsessed; the online news reporter needs enough evidence to write a story accusing billionaire art collector Daniel Terrebone of stealing The Golden Dancer, a priceless work of art, from son-of-a-Nazi Horst Von Berg. The story promises the recognition Mac craves, but then Mac meets a real golden dancer, ballet star Trelain Medveyev, and his attraction to the man rocks his formerly straight world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mysterious Terrebone "collects" this beautiful dancer, too, Mac rushes to the rescue like a knight in shining cargo pants and plunges into a three-way passion that tears him between love and guilt. Can Mac keep investigating when his story could send one man to prison and another to the morgue? Will this reporter get his story or get his men?</description>

  <description>Conrad Muller’s heart is the center of a web of friendships, fights, and love lost and found in a close-knit group of gay men in Orange County, California. Six months ago, Conrad died, and his organs were donated for transplant. A month later, Conrad’s lover, Christian, receives a letter from the recipient of Conrad’s donated heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian can’t stop thinking about the letter, and he’s not the only one affected by loss. Conrad’s best friend Eban is also brokenhearted, and he’s struggling with his lover Damien, who has always resented living in Conrad’s shadow. Though Conrad is gone, his friends and his lover will have to cope with their grief to move on and find new love.</description>

  <description>Werewolves are real. And they make excellent pets. Owning one of the legendary creatures is the latest fad. The WereHouse insists their werepets are loyal, docile, and 100% safe, but what happens when these gentle giants turn on their masters? While on a routine EMS call, paramedic Christine Alt is attacked by a rogue werepet. She escapes with her life, but the encounter leaves her with more than just scars. As her body begins to change, she discovers the WereHouse is hiding a terrible secret, and they will stop at nothing to keep her from exposing them. Tamed is a werewolf tale with a twist from the author of the The Light of Epertase trilogy.</description>

  <description>Keegan lives to exact revenge on the evil demon who sired and abused him. When his father devises a plan to bring on the apocalypse, he and his three half-brothers, interdimensional bounty hunters for the Elden Council, are charged with capturing and delivering their father for punishment.Art gallery owner Brynn Meyers has no idea that her ability to read memories embedded in objects and drain people of their life force means she has demon ancestry. Unfortunately for Brynn, she's also the key to raising an ancient zombie army, which puts her on every demon's Most Wanted List.And no one wants her more than Keegan's father.Keegan must protect Brynn from his father by any means necessary, but he'll have to learn to harness the other half of his genetics-the far deadlier, uncontrollable half-when he starts to fall for the one woman standing between him and the vengeance he so desperately seeks. The one woman he'll never be able to resist.</description>

  <description>Logan Sellers's parole officer has issued three commandments: stay sober, stay employed, and stay out of trouble. At first Logan thought those three simple rules would be easy to follow. But that was before he accepted a side job assisting his boss’s housebound agoraphobic nephew, Caleb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb is deceptively normal for a guy who hasn't left his apartment in three years, and his friendly, caring personality tugs on heartstrings Logan didn’t know he had. But hitting on his boss’s nephew is asking to be unemployed. Logan has enough problems with booze on every corner and a supervisor trying to jump into his bed. He doesn’t need to work out how to free Caleb from the anxiety that keeps him in his apartment; he needs to keep his nose clean, attend his AA meetings, and make a fresh start—alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only his heart would get with the program.</description>

  <description>On the cusp of his twenty-fifth birthday, Bo Sanford grows frustrated with his directionless life. Slaving away at his father’s construction company all week and partying every weekend leaves him little time for introspection, but he knows it’s time for a change. When his best friend, Mac, drags him to a college party, Bo catches sight of a girl. But not just any girl—the girl of his dreams: a delicate blonde-haired beauty with a pink scarf and a smile that promises warmth and humor. There’s just one problem: she isn’t a girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even after Bo discovers the truth, he keeps seeing Erick, and the choice to follow his heart despite the obstacles has profound repercussions on not only his sense of self but his relationship with his family and even his job. Being with Erick makes him all the more determined to be his own man and claw his way out from under his father’s thumb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Erick faces choices of his own: the choice to get involved with someone redefining his sexuality, the choice to trust again, and even the choice to believe love can last beyond the temporary.</description>

His latest job went south, his favorite car has been totaled, people keep wanting his lover dead, and on top of all that he still has not a single damn clue what to get Jack for Christmas—a gift he desperately wants to get right, because otherwise he fears he’ll be spending New Year’s alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he finds himself forced to take an unusual job on Christmas Eve, and Allen wonders if they’ll even live long enough to exchange gifts…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;To survive in a ruined world, she must embrace the darkness…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allison Sekemoto survives in the Fringe, the outermost circle of a walled-in city. By day, she and her crew scavenge for food. By night, any one of them could be eaten. Some days, all that drives Allie is her hatred of&lt;em&gt; them&lt;/em&gt;—the vampires who keep humans as blood cattle. Until the night Allie herself dies and becomes one of the monsters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to flee her city, Allie must pass for human as she joins a ragged group of pilgrims seeking a legend—a place that might have a cure for the disease that killed off most of civilization and created the rabids, the bloodthirsty creatures who threaten human and vampire alike. And soon Allie will have to decide what and who is worth dying for… again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Julie Kagawa's dark and twisted world as an unforgettable journey begins.</description>

  <description>When alcohol and fierce tempers land two cowboys from the rodeo circuit under house arrest, it may be time to Let It Go. Can hidden secrets and a common enemy hold the key to happiness or... will they destroy them both? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creed was the main focus of Eli’s fierce temper. For ten years the two men left a trail of destruction in their wake, with rodeo, beer, and fists all they had in common. Until a judge had enough and sentenced them to house arrest—in the same house. They’d either learn to get along or they’d kill each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trapped on Eli’s rundown Florida ranch, Creed discovers Eli’s secret, one that he shares. But he didn’t count on Eli learning all of his secrets, especially the one that would shatter their newfound truce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scarred to his bones, Eli avoided relationships like the plague. Yet something about the quiet Creed had always pushed his buttons. Falling in love with him was never part of Eli’s plan. When it happens he’s unprepared and out of his league.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a shared enemy comes calling Eli can only think of keeping Creed safe. He never dreamed that their lives were linked or that Creed’s former life could destroy them both. Will love be enough to save them?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Book 1 in the Phoenix Agency series.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Faith and Mark, the telepathic connection they'd shared for years was nothing compared to the scorching physical connection they realized as adults. From the first moment they came together, "erotic" was too pale a word to describe their relationship. Together they explored each other's deepest, darkest desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now Mark, survivor of an ambush to his Delta Force team, is a prisoner of a terrorist group in the Peruvian jungle, and his telepathic communication with Faith is his only contact with the world. While she searches for help to save him, they survive on dreams that take them beyond all sexual boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Publisher’s Note: This story was previously published elsewhere under the title Always On My Mind and has been revised for Ellora’s Cave.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Truman Durant has two painful secrets. One keeps him in the closet and the other hangs inside his closet. Letting either out seems like the equivalent of suicide to him. He didn’t know just how badly he needed Stasi Manolis until he found himself in the pushy Greek’s sights. Would giving up his secrets and maybe falling in love really be so bad?</description>

  <description>It’s 1950, and as the French Quarter of New Orleans simmers with secrets, seventeen-year-old Josie Moraine is silently stirring a pot of her own. Known among locals as the daughter of a brothel prostitute, Josie wants more out of life than the Big Easy has to offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She devises a plan get out, but a mysterious death in the Quarter leaves Josie tangled in an investigation that will challenge her allegiance to her mother, her conscience, and Willie Woodley, the brusque madam on Conti Street. Josie is caught between the dream of an elite college and a clandestine underworld. New Orleans lures her in her quest for truth, dangling temptation at every turn, and escalating to the ultimate test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With characters as captivating as those in her internationally bestselling novel Between Shades of Gray, Ruta Sepetys skillfully creates a rich story of secrets, lies, and the haunting reminder that decisions can shape our destiny.</description>

  <description>Genre: LGBT Erotic Contemporary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Stephen, I'm in trouble . . . "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The voice on the phone was the last voice Dr. Stephen Thorpe expected to hear. But ex-lover Mark Hardwicke is injured and in trouble -- and Stephen has always had a hard time saying no to this particular brand of trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His cover blown, his enemies closing in, British spy Mark is seeking sanctuary with the man he never stopped loving. But there's a new man in Stephen's life, and Stephen's not interested in hearing Mark's explanations or excuses -- let alone playing doctor with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something went terribly wrong on Mark's last mission. Something he can't bring himself to think about, let alone talk about. But he better start talking soon because not only is Stephen losing patience fast -- someone wants this spy left out in the cold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable:  male/male sexual practices, violence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s nobody’s bitch. Until he gets a ride on the bitch seat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to apply for a job he doesn’t want, Cosmo Rawlins has only one aim in mind: fail the interview and get back to making music. Except his attempt to shock the older, sharp-suited Alasdair Grant doesn’t have the desired effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of getting thrown out of the office by flaunting an interest in BDSM, Cosmo finds himself on his knees, apologizing to the sexy, good-looking Top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alasdair has more important things on his mind than training a novice sub, especially a rebellious bad boy like Cosmo. But there’s something beneath the younger man’s defiant attitude that’s too intriguing to ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Alasdair takes Cosmo in hand—and for a wild ride on his Harley—he becomes obsessed with bending the young rocker to his will, both in and out of bed. Until he goes one demand too far, and Cosmo is gone in a cloud of dust. Forcing Alasdair to admit that earning Cosmo’s loyalty—and love—will involve the toughest challenge he’s ever faced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br&gt;This title contains an overbearing Top with a less-than-glamorous job, a rebellious brat who refuses to call him sir, and a total lack of high-end BDSM clubs or playrooms. Expect floggings over the kitchen table instead.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She's a mortal with dark powers...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person's darkest secrets through a single touch. Leila is doomed to a life of solitude...until creatures of the night kidnap her, forcing her to reach out with a telepathic distress call to the world's most infamous vampire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He's the Prince of Night...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vlad Tepesh inspired the greatest vampire legend of all—but whatever you do, don't call him Dracula. Vlad's ability to control fire makes him one of the most feared vampires in existence, but his enemies have found a new weapon against him—a beautiful mortal with powers to match his own. When Vlad and Leila meet, however, passion ignites between them, threatening to consume them both. It will take everything that they are to stop an enemy intent on bringing them down in flames.</description>

  <description>Gentle Rory Calhoun Wilson is the antithesis of the 1950s cowboy he’s named for. He loathes sports, NASCAR and everything else his father adores, putting the two on a collision course fueled by Darrell Wilson’s inability to control contempt for his son’s emerging homosexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another F-Word is a story of bullying, courage and love. It examines parental struggles to support a gay child, the role that schools and religious institutions play, the tragedy of teen suicide, and the ability of a rural Bible Belt boy to remain open to people who can influence his life in remarkable ways. Rory’s is a story of triumph over the scarring effects of being labeled and bullied.</description>

  <description>Dave de Guzman is an editor at an LGBT lifestyle magazine, who wants to fall in love. When a hot, new neighbor Ned moves into his apartment building, he makes his move—only to discover he’s straight and has a girlfriend. He’s too drunk to care now and he makes out with that pudgy bartender—Jude, was it? Soon enough, they’re dating. Problem is, he still wants Ned. In him, preferably.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if things aren’t bad enough, a group of anti-gay reactionaries on a 50-day protest make it their mission to convert all homosexuals in Manila into straights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows he has to do something, but in a country where a separation of church and state is nonexistent, what's a gay to do?</description>

  <description>Attorney Kate Bollinger is desperately searching for her twin brother, Kristopher, when she meets Detective Sarah Mendez. Together they begin the search for her brother and in the process they unravel an unscrupulous plot to enslave thousands of homosexuals on an uncharted island. With the help of news reporter, Raquel Meadows, they work in harmony to expose the truth. When they end up on the island, they must fight beside all of the other captives, in order to avoid becoming slaves to the medical experiments being conducted on them on the island, by a ruthless dictator who has nothing but a wanton disregard for the lives of all homosexuals.</description>

  <description>Anthea Cane is a successful actress—well, action star. Her films are mostly about how hot she looks silhouetted by fiery explosions. But Anthea is determined to prove she's more than just a body. With the role of a lifetime up for grabs—a serious adaptation of her favorite novel—Anthea sets off to her small hometown in the name of research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole Daniel is a blind farmer with no patience for divas, especially one who mercilessly teased him as a young boy. When Anthea shows up using a fake name and pestering him into letting her stay, he can't pass up the opportunity to torment her just a little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Anthea won't let the stubborn farmer deter her from her goal, even if he is hotter than any man she's ever met. Cole finds his form of payback less than satisfying when Anthea keeps turning the tables on him, proving her mettle and gaining his respect. Will Anthea's research land her a man, as well as the part?</description>

  <description>In which an argument about Dickens leads to a Twitter scandal, broken bones, midnight conversations, and transatlantic longing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Or, an AU with Arthur and Merlin as moderately famous authors.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: this fic contains brief and blasé references to suicide and addiction. (Which is subsequently written off as artistic temperament.) It also features Arthur as a snob, a fair amount of epistolary material, and a lot of literary references. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merlin/Arthur Pendragon, Alternate Universe - Modern Setting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 12,176</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>This is the story of Paul, a sophomore at a high school like no other: The cheerleaders ride Harleys, the homecoming queen used to be a guy named Daryl (she now prefers Infinite Darlene and is also the star quarterback), and the gay-straight alliance was formed to help the straight kids learn how to dance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Paul meets Noah, he thinks he’s found the one his heart is made for. Until he blows it. The school bookie says the odds are 12-to-1 against him getting Noah back, but Paul’s not giving up without playing his love really loud. His best friend Joni might be drifting away, his other best friend Tony might be dealing with ultra-religious parents, and his ex-boyfriend Kyle might not be going away anytime soon, but sometimes everything needs to fall apart before it can really fit together right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a happy-meaningful romantic comedy about finding love, losing love, and doing what it takes to get love back in a crazy-wonderful world.</description>

  <description>THE &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/em&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness… &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I’d never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gideon &lt;em&gt;knew. &lt;/em&gt;He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other’s most private wounds…and desires.The bonds of his love transformed me, even as i prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart...&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evie worries he’ll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The work of an exceptional artist working close to the peak of his powers." —Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the elegant Edwardian world of Cambridge undergraduate life, this story by a master novelist introduces us to Maurice Hall when he is fourteen. We follow him through public school and Cambridge, and on into his father's firm, Hill and Hall, Stock Brokers. In a highly structured society, Maurice is a conventional young man in almost every way, "stepping into the niche that England had prepared for him": except that his is homosexual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written during 1913 and 1914, after an interlude of writer's block following the publication of &lt;em&gt;Howards End&lt;/em&gt;, and not published until 1971, Maurice was ahead of its time in its theme and in its affirmation that love between men can be happy. "Happiness," Forster wrote, "is its keynote….In Maurice I tried to create a character who was completely unlike myself or what I supposed myself to be: someone handsome, healthy, bodily attractive, mentally torpid, not a bad businessman and rather a snob. Into this mixture I dropped an ingredient that puzzles him, wakes him up, torments him and finally saves him."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now a major motion picture from Summit Entertainment, the studio behind the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; series and the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt;, starring Academy Award Nominee John Malkovich, Nicholas Hoult, and Teresa Palmer and directed by Jonathan Levine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R is having a no-life crisis--he is a zombie. He has no memories, no identity, and no pulse, but he is a little different from his fellow Dead. He may occasionally eat people, but he’d rather be riding abandoned airport escalators, listening to Sinatra in the cozy 747 he calls home, or collecting souvenirs from the ruins of civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he meets a girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First as his captive, then his reluctant guest, Julie is a blast of living color in R’s gray landscape, and something inside him begins to bloom. He doesn't want to eat this girl--although she looks delicious--he wants to protect her. But their unlikely bond will cause ripples they can’t imagine, and their hopeless world won’t change without a fight.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"There’s a reason why Brewster can’t have friends – why he can’t care about too many people. Because when he cares about you, things start to happen. Impossible things that can’t be explained. I know, because they're happening to me."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Brontë starts dating Brewster “Bruiser” Rawlins – the guy voted “Most Likely to Get the Death Penalty” her twin brother, Tennyson, isn’t surprised. But then strange things begin to occur. Tennyson and Brontë’s scrapes heal unnaturally fast, and cuts disappear before their eyes. What at first seems like their good fortune turns out to be more than they bargained for…much more.</description>

  <description>Harry Crewe is an orphan girl who comes to live in Damar, the desert country shared by the Homelanders and the secretive, magical Hillfolk. Her life is quiet and ordinary-until the night she is kidnapped by Corlath, the Hillfolk King, who takes her deep into the desert. She does not know the Hillfolk language; she does not know why she has been chosen. But Corlath does. Harry is to be trained in the arts of war until she is a match for any of his men. Does she have the courage to accept her true fate?</description>

  <description>Miss Zula Bragg, award-winning writer in residence at Ogilvie College in Ogilvie, Georgia, has finally said yes to a documentary about her life. She insists that Tied to the Tracks, a shoestring film company from up North produce it-because, she says, they have an edge. So the entire company is summoned to Ogilvie-Angie Mangiamele, who writes, produces, and keeps it all together; Rivera Rosenblum, who photographs and edits; and Tony Russo, principal photographer and soundman. Only Angie is reluctant to head south because the new chair of the English department at Ogilvie is John Grant, and John and Angie have a fiery past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A member of the founding Ogilvie family on his mother's side, John has finally returned home after years "up North" to take up his place in the community and to marry the lovely Caroline Rose, the last unmarried daughter of the prominent Rose family in what Ogilvie residents regard as the wedding of the century. The town-rich with tradition and rife with gossip-is fascinated by the three Yankees, but when it seems as though sparks still fly between John and Angie, the townsfolk rally to protect their own.</description>

  <description>Rule #3: &lt;em&gt;Don't stare at invisible faeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislinn has always seen faeries. Powerful and dangerous, they walk hidden in the mortal world. Aislinn fears their cruelty - especially if they learn of her Sight - and wishes she were as blind to their presence as other teens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #2: &lt;em&gt;Don't speak to invisible faeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now faeries are stalking her. One of them, Keenan, who is equal parts terrifying and alluring, is trying to talk to her, asking questions Aislinn is afraid to answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #1: &lt;em&gt;Don't ever attract their attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's too late. Keenan is the Summer King, who has sought his queen for nine centuries. Without her, summer itself will perish. He is determined that Aislinn will become the Summer Queen at any cost — regardless of her plans or desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly none of the rules that have kept Aislinn safe are working anymore, and everything is on the line: her freedom; her best friend, Seth; her life; everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faery intrigue, mortal love, and the clash of ancient rules and modern expectations swirl together in Melissa Marr's stunning twenty-first-century faery tale.</description>

  <description>Now hailed as an American classic, &lt;em&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/em&gt;, Henry Miller’s masterpiece, was banned as obscene in this country for twenty-seven years after its first publication in Paris in 1934.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a historic court ruling that changed American censorship standards, ushering in a new era of freedom and frankness in modern literature, permitted the publication of this first volume of Miller’s famed mixture of memoir and fiction, which chronicles with unapologetic gusto the bawdy adventures of a young expatriate writer, his friends, and the characters they meet in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/em&gt; is now considered, as Norman Mailer said, one of the ten or twenty great novels of our century.</description>

  <description>A lonely obese boy everyone calls "Butter" is about to make history. He is going to eat himself to death-live on the Internet-and everyone is invited to watch. When he first makes the announcement online to his classmates, Butter expects pity, insults, and possibly sheer indifference. What he gets are morbid cheerleaders rallying around his deadly plan. Yet as their dark encouragement grows, it begins to feel a lot like popularity. And that feels good. But what happens when Butter reaches his suicide deadline? Can he live with the fallout if he doesn't go through with his plans? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a deft hand, E.J. Lange allows readers to identify with both the bullies and the bullied in this all-consuming look at one teen's battle with himself.</description>

  <description>The startling, universally acclaimed breakthrough YA novel from master bestselling author Alice Hoffman, now in paperback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Left on her own when her family dies in a terrible disaster, fifteen-year-old Green is haunted by loss and by the past. Struggling to survive physically and emotionally in a place where nothing seems to grow and ashes are everywhere, Green retreats into the ruined realm of her garden. But in destroying her feelings, she also begins to destroy herself, erasing the girl she'd once been as she inks darkness into her skin. It is only through a series of mysterious encounters that Green can relearn the lessons of love and begin to heal enough to tell her story.</description>

  <description>Four decades of peace have done little to ease the mistrust between humans and dragons in the kingdom of Goredd. Folding themselves into human shape, dragons attend court as ambassadors, and lend their rational, mathematical minds to universities as scholars and teachers. As the treaty's anniversary draws near, however, tensions are high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seraphina Dombegh has reason to fear both sides. An unusually gifted musician, she joins the court just as a member of the royal family is murdered—in suspiciously draconian fashion. Seraphina is drawn into the investigation, partnering with the captain of the Queen's Guard, the dangerously perceptive Prince Lucian Kiggs. While they begin to uncover hints of a sinister plot to destroy the peace, Seraphina struggles to protect her own secret, the secret behind her musical gift, one so terrible that its discovery could mean her very life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her exquisitely written fantasy debut, Rachel Hartman creates a rich, complex, and utterly original world. Seraphina's tortuous journey to self-acceptance is one readers will remember long after they've turned the final page.</description>

  <description>The nameless and beautiful narrator of The Gargoyle is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and wakes up in a burns ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned. His life is over – he is now a monster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in fact it is only just beginning. One day, Marianne Engel, a wild and compelling sculptress of gargoyles, enters his life and tells him that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly burned mercenary and she was a nun and a scribe who nursed him back to health in the famed monastery of Engelthal. As she spins her tale, Scheherazade fashion, and relates equally mesmerising stories of deathless love in Japan, Greenland, Italy and England, he finds himself drawn back to life – and, finally, to love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gargoyle&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinary novel that will take you on a wild and original journey. It will have you believing in love, in miracles and in redemption.</description>

  <description>Also Known As: Two Pearls of Wisdom, Eon: Rise of the Dragoneye, and Eon (All the same book just published with different publishers)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swordplay, dragon magic--and a hero with a desperate secret&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twelve-year-old Eon has been in training for years. His intensive study of Dragon Magic,, based on East Asian astrology, involves two kinds of skills: sword-work and magical aptitude. He and his master hope that he will be chosen as a Dragoneye--an apprentice to one of the twelve energy dragons of good fortune. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Eon has a dangerous secret. He is actually Eona, a sixteen-year-old girl who has been masquerading as a boy for the chance to become a Dragoneye. Females are forbidden to use Dragon Magic; if anyone discovers she has been hiding in plain sight, her death is assured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eon's secret threatens to come to light, she and her allies are plunged into grave danger and a deadly struggle for the Imperial throne. Eon must find the strength and inner power to battle those who want to take her magic...and her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I didn't decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . ."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn't enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women's health issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.</description>

  <description>Detective Matthew Bennett doesn't believe in ghosts. So when the spirit of a murdered child leads him to her body, he's shaken to the core--and taken off the case. Unable to explain his vision, or to let go of the investigation, Matthew turns to renowned medium Kiernan Fitzpatrick. Though he has doubts about Kiernan's claims to communicate with the dead, Matt is nevertheless drawn to the handsome psychic, who awakens feelings he thought were long-buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by the lingering spirit of the little girl, Kiernan is compelled to aid in the search for her killer. The chance to get closer to the enigmatic Matt is an unexpected bonus. Although Kiernan's been betrayed by people who turned out to be more interested in his fame than in himself, with Matt he's willing to risk his heart. As the two men grow closer, Kiernan helps Matt rediscover that life offers no guarantees--but love offers a reason to believe...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;81,000 words</description>

  <description>**New Version with edits, new formatting and a new Cover available soon!**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #1 Do NOT ignore the signs.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #2 Pay attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #3 The less they know about you, the harder it is for them to hurt you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #4 Comfort is dangerous.  It can be taken away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #5 Need is a handicap.  It can cripple you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #6 He isn’t what he seems.  Don’t trust him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simple rules made for a simple purpose.  Nina Ryan learned early on in life that if you want to avoid being hurt, you need to be proactive.  If you pay attention the Universe will always steer you in the right direction.  It will help keep you safe.  So, she follows the rules, and she is safe.  Until Connor Wright barges his way through all her carefully laid defenses and threatens to destroy the comfortable life she has created.  Faithfully following her #1 rule, Nina tries to accept that the Universe has pushed Connor and her lives together for a purpose.   Determined to make Nina his, Connor chips away at the walls Nina has placed around her heart and her secrets.    Is Nina following the signs that will lead her down the right path, or does Connor hold secrets of his own that will ruin Nina for good?  Only the Universe knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 18+ only due to sexual content and mature situations.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This is an alternate cover edition - ASIN: B0097T6OGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;City slicker Ami Jordan was just dumped by her back-stabbing boyfriend, has no job prospects, and can't find a decent cup of coffee in the entire state of Vermont. The last thing she needs is a sexy, bearded lumberjack complicating her life. Even if he’s smart, talented, and has the hottest ass she’s ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tree house builder, environmental champion, and Bulldog owner Marcus Anderson has no patience for flatlanders with an attitude. But when landscape designer Ami Jordan shows up at his log cabin, he suddenly develops a hankering for a high-maintenance city gal. Now his house looks like a jungle, his recycling is in disarray, and his libido's on fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's a lumberjack in love</description>

No longer dressed up in antiquated clothes and ideals, she is finally trying on her freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before she moves to New York City, she meets Ian Sterling, a musician Sparrow has dreamed about since she first saw him. The attraction is instant, but their relationship isn't so simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over a five year span, Sparrow and Ian run into each other in unusual places. Each time, Sparrow has to decide if she can trust him, if he feels the same for her, and finally, if love is really enough.</description>

  <description>When Phoenix police officer Stephen Miranda offers tipsy Zachary West a ride home one Friday night, he’s just doing his job. He doesn’t expect to unleash a glittery whirlwind on his orderly, very homogenized life. From minute one, Zach is like nothing Stephen’s ever known and like everything he’s secretly craved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zach doesn’t hide who he is for anyone’s comfort, even his own, but for a chance at a man like Stephen, he’d be willing to be an “undercover lover.” But while Stephen lusts after the vibrant man, hooking up with a guy who’s never used his “closet” for anything but fashion isn’t going to do his straight-acting routine any favors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sex is sizzling, no doubt, but Stephen wonders if there’s more to his relationship with Zach that’s worth gambling on...</description>

  <description>All Nico wants is to leave his fame behind for a bit and enjoy a relaxing vacation. His trip to Belize starts off promisingly, but it all goes wrong quickly when he accidentally ruins the plans of Patrick, an ex-pat in the middle of an illegal deal. Patrick takes Nico hostage, hoping to recover his loss, and if Nico wants to regain his freedom he'll have to do exactly what Patrick says—including, apparently, a bit of cross-dressing.</description>

  <description>It’s taken Clea Rose ten years to get over the one night she spent with bad boy Nick Lombard—a night of teenage passion that produced her son, and sent Nick to prison for murder. Now, with her life finally back on track, Clea’s about to marry a wonderful man and leave town for a promising career in New York. The last thing she expects is Nick’s return and the intense feelings he stirs within her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent to prison for a murder he didn’t commit, Nick Lombard comes home to the tiny town of Port Bliss to attend his mother’s funeral, but he doesn’t count on running into Clea. Seeing her reminds him of everything he’s tried to forget, and everything he longs to remember. When Nick learns Clea is about to marry the man who sent Nick to prison, he knows he must stay and fight for the family he was forced to leave behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Nick and Clea must find their way back to the summer they were young lovers on the beach in Port Bliss, realizing that together their love is strong, strong enough to survive anything, even the web of lies that separated them ten years ago.</description>

  <description>John Palmer hasn’t felt like a real man since he was injured during combat in Iraq. Though not content with his new life, he is mostly adapting, just like the other vets at the Lost ‘N’ Found Investigative Service. When Shannon Murphy is hired on as the new office manager, life suddenly gets a lot more interesting. Before long, John finds himself wondering if he could ever be the kind of man Shannon needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shannon Murphy wasn’t really looking for love when she hired on at LNF, but finds herself hopelessly attracted to the sex-on-wheels former Marine, John Palmer. The man is grumpy and nearly impossible to work with, but his brand of masculinity appeals to her on a basic level. Soon Shannon is wondering just what it would take for John to want her the way she wants him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an old enemy tries to settle a vendetta against Shannon, John insists on protecting her. He moves into her house, fanning the spark of attraction into a blaze. But the danger continues to escalate. Even with all the resources at their disposal, they’re thrust into a fight for their lives.</description>

  <description>Summary:&lt;br&gt;Sebastian Coxe, a young dashing man from London, arrives in the company of his shy twin sister Octavia to spend the season in Bath. There he meets Baron Carl Whitmore, a private gentleman who has withdrawn from society and with no intentions whatsoever of involving himself in a forbidden liaison, especially not with an infamous rake....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keywords:&lt;br&gt;Notorious reputation, romance, raining, misunderstandings, M/M erotica.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note: This novella contains erotic scenes which include the practise of gay sex (oral sex and anal intercourse) and is intended for adult readers.&lt;br&gt;The story also includes love and romance between gay men. If you are offended by this, please get over it or read something else...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An extract from the story:&lt;br&gt;"The message was short and written in an elegant longhand on thick paper. Carl Whitmore stated politely that he had enjoyed their company and asked if they would like to come to his estate during the weekend for a shooting excursion.&lt;br&gt;“Do you understand what this means?” Mrs Coxe said, and her voice went up several octaves.&lt;br&gt;“Eh… it is an invitation to spend the weekend at his estate?” Sebastian said, stating the obvious. “Well, we did talk about shooting the other day, and he said that his estate had rather good hunting grounds.”&lt;br&gt;Mrs Coxe gave him an apologetic look, the kind reserved for feebleminded young children.&lt;br&gt;“Sebastian, my dear son. Clearly you do not comprehend the situation. This means that the Baron is falling in love with your sister, of course!”&lt;br&gt;A new outburst of female screams surrounded Sebastian, but he was unaware of the turmoil and only stood there, perfectly still, with the handwritten letter in his hand.&lt;br&gt;Oh, he thought vaguely. "That was not really according to the plan..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product details:&lt;br&gt;Category: Gay Victorian Romance and Erotica&lt;br&gt;Format: Kindle eBook&lt;br&gt;Written and published: 2012&lt;br&gt;Professional proofreader: Pauline Nolet, &lt;a href="http://www.paulinenolet.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.paulinenolet.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Length: Bedtime companion (~19000 words)&lt;br&gt;Publisher: My Secret Quill</description>

  <description>Seth McDaniel wasn’t raised among a shifter passel and has no idea what it’s like to turn furry once a month. An orphan, torn from his father’s family at an early age, he scarcely remembers Great-aunt Irene. Now her passing brings him back to Possum Kingdom, Georgia, to take up a legacy he doesn’t understand and reconnect with a friend he’s never forgotten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Irene’s second-in-command, Dustin Livingston has two choices: assume control of the passel or select another replacement. Unfortunately, the other candidates are either heartless or clueless. Dustin’s best hope to dodge the responsibility is to deliver a crash course in leadership to his childhood pal Seth, a man he hasn’t seen in twenty years. However, while Dustin's mind is set on his task, his heart is set on his old friend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth’s quest for answers yields more questions instead. What’s with the tiny gray hairs littering his aunt’s house? Why do the townsfolk call each other “Jack” and “Jill”? Do Dustin’s attentions come with ulterior motives? And why is Seth suddenly craving crickets?</description>

  <description>Davis Carmichael doesn't do love. Ever. He'd rather strip naked and crawl through a field of broken glass than give anyone that much control over his head or his heart. The only thing he cares about is his career in journalism. That's it. Period, dot, full stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until he meets Cristián Baranov, a die-hard Romeo with an uncanny knack for making connections and taming cranky wordsmiths. A man who breaks down Davis's resistance with a sweep of his hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one night. Granted, it's a night of marathon sex not to be forgotten…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither expected they'd meet again, but fate has other plans. Now Davis's job is on the line, with the sacrifice of his pride and an article on modern matchmaking the only thing that can save him. And the matchmaker he's meant to interview in-depth? Cristián. Who, though able to strike matches for everyone else, had given up on finding the one who was made for him. Until he slept with Davis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Cristián and Davis go head to head over romance and reason in print and in the sheets, sparks aren't just going to fly. They'll ignite.</description>

  <description>Deep in the heart of the French Quarter, where the Bourbon Street revelry is nothing more than a far off whisper, underground blood-bar La Luxure beckons those with darker tastes through its narrow archway...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Level headed and practical, Julia Brown isn't normally the type of woman that runs around believing in vampires. But when she travels to New Orleans for a week long work conference and stumbles unwittingly into La Luxure, she begins to question that assumption. After a patron is found dead on the street, drained of blood and covered in bites and marks, Julia quickly becomes convinced the city is filled with actual, supernatural vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And at the center of it all is Armand Laroque, who awakens a lust she never knew existed, and a temptation impossible to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This book is adult romance and not suitable for readers under 18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in the Human Vampire Series:&lt;br&gt;La Luxure (Book One)&lt;br&gt;de Sang (Book Two)&lt;br&gt;Eveillez (Book Three)&lt;br&gt;Expiez (Book Four)</description>

  <description>A Story Inspired by Steven Tyler: The first book in a three-part series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It happened by accident, a lottery of events…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1988, a blind seven-year-old lay in a hospital room longing for her mother, unaware that eight years earlier a chance encounter occurred that would shape her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American musician Bobby Carter moved to Manchester, England with one objective—to become a major player in the postpunk scene of the late Seventies. His quest for stardom steers him in the direction of Kindle Hyrum, whose feistiness is only exceeded by her raw beauty. Though Bobby’s steady pursuit trumps Kindle’s cheeky resistance—sweeping them into present bliss—past secrets, new temptations, and a series of hapless and happy accidents will determine their future...and the future of a blind child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set to the lyrical soundtrack of the 60s and 70s, A Happy Accident is a story of love and choice that transcends the ages.</description>

She never thought he’d pack his bags and leave because he “needed space.” With her newfound single status and fear of being alone, Ellery buries herself in her artwork and paintings until one night she helps a mysterious intoxicated stranger get home safely. Little did she know the mysterious stranger is none other than CEO and millionaire Connor Black.  After finding Ellery in his kitchen the next morning and assuming she broke his #1 rule about sleepovers, he becomes intrigued, not only by her stubbornness and defiance, but by her kindness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor Black, emotionally dead and damaged, that stemmed from a personal tragedy, made a vow to never love or fall in love with a woman, until Ellery Lane walked into his life by accident. After she opens up and shows him her world, Connor starts to feel emotions and feelings he never knew existed. Despite the rumors and warnings regarding Connor Black and his use and misuse of women, Ellery finds herself being drawn into his world.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellery knows they can never be together because she is harboring a deep secret that could destroy Connor emotionally forever.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Connor and Ellery as they embark on a journey of courage, love and strength. Will it be enough to save them?</description>

  <description>When a family friend offers him the job of resident psychologist at Chicago’s GLBT Center, Kyle Michelson jumps at the chance to reinvigorate his career, move on from his recent breakup, and get his life back on track. Kyle hopes returning to the familiar territory of his hometown will do him good, but meeting Emory Brenner at a club changes everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anything but familiar, Emory leaves Kyle breathless from the start. There’s just one problem: Kyle wants more than a one-night stand, Emory doesn’t do relationships, and neither man can resist the other. Luckily for Emory, he never has to see Kyle again. Or so Emory thinks until he runs into him while volunteering at the GLBT Center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyle makes Emory want things he never thought he could have and chips away at secrets Emory has kept locked away for years. On the surface, Emory’s recovered from his past: he has a job at a record store and a roof over his head. But putting his trust in another person, having a relationship, means opening himself to more pain—and that is a risk he can’t take.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A gripping tale of self-exploration and atonement, emotionally complex and brimming with grit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the fall of 1918 infantry sniper Joshua Hunter saves an ambushed patrol in the Bois le Prêtre forest of Lorraine . . . and then vanishes. Pulled from the rubble of an enemy bunker days later, he receives an award for valor and passage home to Hadley, a remote hamlet in Virginia’s western highlands. Reeling from war and influenza, Hadley could surely use a hero. Family and friends embrace him; an engagement is announced; a job is offered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet all is not what it seems. Joshua experiences panics and can’t recall the incident that crippled him. He guards a secret too, one that grips tight like the icy air above his father’s quarry. Over the course of a Virginia winter and an echoed season in war-torn France, &lt;em&gt;The Fallen Snow&lt;/em&gt; reveals his wide-eyed journey to the front and his ragged path back. Along the way he finds companions – a youth mourning a lost brother, a widowed nurse seeking a new life and Aiden, a bold sergeant escaping a vengeful father. While all of them touch Joshua, it is the strong yet nurturing Aiden who will awaken his heart, leaving him forever changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set within a besieged Appalachian forest during a time of tragedy, &lt;em&gt;The Fallen Snow&lt;/em&gt; charts an extraordinary coming of age, exploring how damaged souls learn to heal, and dare to grow.</description>

  <description>In 10th century France, 18-year old Cherine Cadet only knows one thing: that the life of a peasant isn’t a life at all. Tired of working in utter poverty for an unfeeling Lord, with only her indifferent family and love-struck best friend as company, Cherine dreams of the day she can run away from the future set-up for her, even if she knows there’s no real escape from her destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, in one brutal instance, everything changes. A Viking fleet led by the powerful nobleman and warrior, Rolf the Walker and his right-hand man, Erik the Axe, arrive on the shores of the Lord’s estate. In minutes, the entire land is up in flames, Cherine’s family and fellow serfs are killed, and Cherine comes dangerously close to death herself. She is saved only by the fierce Erik – but a new lease on life comes with a cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cherine becomes a slave to the Vikings, a fate she thinks is no better than the one she had before. But as she finds herself being shared between the two men, the savage and darkly handsome Rolf and the mysterious and sensual Erik, Cherine discovers that she too has a fiery warrior heart and that the flames that consumed her old life might burn them all to the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author's Note: While this book is set in 909 A.D. and efforts were made to keep it authentic to the time period, the language used IS modern. If you are looking for a 100% accurate historical read, this might NOT be the book for you. If you don't like historical romances because of the old language, then this book might be for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** Rated 18+ for graphic sexual content and violence ***</description>

  <description>Conner, a rogue wolf and murder detective, isn't looking for a lover when he moves to Haven City. He wants to solve crimes and keep to himself - unable to trust anyone since his pack betrayed him six years before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Seth Alwen, his new partner, is different. He excites the wolf's animal instincts - waking up the passion Conner buried long ago. Seth's not only beautiful and alluring; he's also haunted by the death of his former partner. And despite his better judgment, Conner aches to relieve the man of his guilt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth's a seer, but ever since his old partner died his powers have been on the fritz. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Conner Sharp, Seth's sexy and mysterious new partner. While the dark-haired stranger ignites Seth's desire, he also awakens the seer's power with every touch. Seth sees their future together - a future rich with lust and danger - but is it a future the enigmatic Conner wants?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two men solve a series of murders, their sizzling attraction overflows into the bedroom. Is the overwhelming passion just a fling or is it forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains graphic M/M sex scenes.</description>

  <description>Johnny Cairo is known as the Scaremaster. He works for Fear Asylum, his father’s traveling haunted house, and makes his living terrifying people. But Johnny has never frightened easily himself. That is, until he wakes up in the middle of the night and finds his best friend’s younger brother in his bed. Naked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnny’s fought against his attraction to Brennan for years, worried that giving in to it will lead to losing the friendship he shares with Brennan’s older brother, Eddie. As much as he fights it, though, the lure of having Brennan in his bed proves too hard to resist. They start an affair that’s supposed to be no-strings-attached, but Johnny’s persistent denial of the growing feelings between them leads to a rift that might not be mendable. Then an accident at Fear Asylum nearly costs Johnny the one thing he holds dear, and he learns that while his nickname might be the Scaremaster, he knows next to nothing about real fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Currently unavailable.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>“Contract killer” is a fitting job for a vampire, and it suits Liam just fine. Cast down from the wealth and status of the Sky for taking a human lover, Liam lurks in the poor and pollution-choked Gutter, killing to survive. Between his natural strengths and his Cybernetix mods, no mark has ever escaped him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam’s ex-lover Daniel is the heir to Cybernetix—and its greatest threat. Horrified by people less man than machine and the exploitation of Gutter factory workers, he’d rather destroy Cybernetix than inherit it . . . if his father doesn’t destroy him first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years of anger and a heap of mods have kept Daniel and Liam apart. When Liam is hired to slaughter a man in his glass Sky tower, he walks right into a Daniel-shaped trap. Daniel’s father has betrayed them both, and only by working together can Daniel and Liam survive the coming day. They have no reason to trust each other, but as the dawn looms, a bargain that began with the simple urge to live soon reminds them of the love they once shared. Can they find each other again, or will the Cybernetix assassins find them first?</description>

  <description>Sometimes two people fit together so well it seems their love was preordained, as if every step taken led inevitably to a happy ending. Deeply in love, Jared and Alex are such a couple, but the path to true and lasting love is rarely smooth. At 15 being gay isn't the best thing that ever happened to a guy. In fact, Alex Ross thinks it's down right scary. Then he meets 20 year old construction worker Jared Douglas, and Alex starts to think the gay thing might not be so bad after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attraction between them is intense, but mindful of Alex's age Jared is determined to keep the sparks from igniting. The stress of controlling his feelings makes it almost a relief when Alex's father ships him off to prep school. Jared expects Alex to forget him and find a boy friend his own age; he doesn't anticipate how much it will hurt. When Alex comes home for Christmas, just turned 16 with his heart on his sleeve, Jared knows he can't continue to keep everything he feels a secret.</description>

  <description>Nick O'Mallley is an agent for the Nevada Gaming Commission. He's also a Goth with a hearse he's restoring, and an ex lover he's only just getting over. Brandon Carr is a cop with the Riverside PD. Lucky for him, he's in Vice where his tattoos and biker boy looks serve him well. The two meet at a Goth convention in San Diego and the sparks fly immediately. So much so that a weekend fling turns into more and Brandon spends his four day weekend visiting Nick. Things aren't all sparks and roses though: the two do live a nine hour drive apart, and Brandon's not out. Add to that a murder right in front of them, a company trying to cheat the system and the Mexican Mafia, and Brandon and Nick's relationship will need to overcome a whole slew of obstacles in order to work. Despite everything, can Brandon and Nick make a go of it? Taken a chance on these two and find out.</description>

  <description>“Hilarious, unique, heartfelt and sharp. A wonderful read.”—&lt;strong&gt;Sandra Cisneros&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against a vibrant South Bronx neighborhood and the queer youth culture of Manhattan's piers, &lt;em&gt;Chulito&lt;/em&gt; is a coming-out, coming-of-age love story of a sexy, tough, hip hop–loving, young Latino man and the colorful characters in his vibrant neighborhood. Chulito, which means "cutie," is one of the boys, and everyone in his neighborhood has seen him grow up—the owner of the local bodega, the Lees from the Chinese restaurant, his buddies from the corner, and all of his neighbors and friends, including Carlos, who was Chulito's best friend until they hit puberty and people started calling Carlos a &lt;em&gt;pato&lt;/em&gt; . . . a faggot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chulito rejects Carlos, buries his feelings for him, and becomes best friends with Kamikaze, a local drug dealer. When Carlos comes home from his first year away at college and they share a secret kiss, Chulito's worlds collide as his ideas of being a man, being macho, and being in love are challenged. Vivid, sexy, funny, heartbreaking, and fearless, this brilliant work is destined to become a queer classic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Rice-González&lt;/strong&gt;, born in Puerto Rico and reared in the Bronx, received an MFA in creative writing from Goddard College. He has attended the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference and worked with writers David Leavitt, Rebecca Brown, and Stacey D'Erasmo. The author is a public relations and marketing specialist in the area of Latino arts and culture. He lives in New York.</description>

  <description>They should have spent the past 22 years together, but life took some unexpected turns for Bobby Gallegos and Alejo Sandoval. Heartbreak and rejection can harden the hearts of two passionate, stubborn men. One, deeply devout, wanted to attend college. One, who perfected a tough act to deceive his brothers, might have followed his dad to prison. Now, at 40 years old, they maintain a long-distance relationship as sex buddies, who don't quite trust each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their lives have sharply diverged. One is now divorced with two teenagers, who bring him joy and despair. One has just had a near-death experience on the job. When Bobby returns to Albuquerque, he will use sex, persuasion, and memories of their shared past to try to convince Alejo to take a chance on him and reach for the future that they were meant to share together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: REACH FOR THE MOON is listed as a prequel to FALL INTO THE SUN, but only in the sense of having the same characters at a younger age. Think of FALL INTO THE SUN as what might have occurred on an alternate timeline. Meanwhile, REACH FOR THE MOON is what really happened on the main timeline. The events of REACH FOR THE MOON do not fit into the backstory of FALL INTO THE SUN.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;You never forget your first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cameron Lewis loves his job as an instructor/trainer for a water safety firm that inspects water parks. He gets to travel from March through September, always moving on to something different. When a strange emptiness starts plaguing him, he chalks it up to turning thirty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He manages to shake off the feeling—until he walks into a classroom and discovers that the eye candy in the front row is actually a very grown up version of his best-friend’s kid brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah Winthrop never forgot his first time. Scary, painful and then absolutely amazing—and with Cameron, the guy he’d always wanted. He’s had a crush on his brother’s best friend since puberty and now nothing will keep him from finally getting Cameron Lewis to notice him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Cameron once rejected him, Noah is determined to get it right this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product Warnings: This title contains the following: explicit male/male sex, graphic language, and mild Dominant/submissive action&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>SEAL candidates Cooper Fitch and Eli Jones are cut off from the outside world and pushed to their physical and mental limits by the demands of the Navy's elite training program. Their reliance on each other takes an unexpected turn after Hell Week, the most grueling stretch of basic conditioning, when Cooper and Eli surrender to passion fueled by fatigue, horniness, and alcohol. Despite the danger of being discovered, their intense attraction begins to feel like a natural extension of living, working, and training side by side, and neither is willing to give it up, no matter the risk.</description>

  <description>A mysterious distress call draws the crew of the Hermes to what appears to be an empty, drifting ship. Empty, that is, excerpt for the blood and gore splattered corridors and a lone survivor locked in a holding cell. Drawn to the handsome, traumatized man, the crew's comm officer, Isaac Ozawa, makes Turk his personal responsibility. Isaac offers Turk kindness and warmth to counter the horror he experienced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turk longs for Isaac, but he harbors dangerous secrets. His brain is a military experiment gone wrong. When an amoral, power-hungry admiral kidnaps Isaac and uses him to convince Turk to become a cataclysmic weapon, it will take the ingenuity of the Hermes crew, the help of the enigmatic Drak'tar, and Isaac's own stubborn will to save them.</description>

  <description>Jason Miller is still in the closet. He's never found a reason to kick the door open, walk into the light of day, and tell the world he's gay. At least that's what he keeps telling himself -- along with a multitude of other solid arguments. As an ad man, he's used to hawking a bill of goods, he just never imagined he'd fall victim to his own hype.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When ex-activist/coming out guru, Chad Wellington came along, he was the one thing Jason never saw coming. Like a moth to a flame these two opposites ignite leaving Jason to decide if he can handle the heat.</description>

  <description>It only takes one night with Ash Gallagher to make Eli Hollister think he’s finally met the right man at the right time. Good thing he doesn’t bet on it, because Ash turns out to be a student in Eli’s class at the local college. Eli can’t deny he’s attracted, but now it’s complicated. He’s already in enough trouble with the department head, a man who would like to see Eli denied his tenure and fired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ash is looking forward to taking his life in a new direction. After serving one active-duty stint in the Marine Corps and another in the Reserves, he’s ready to put his military life behind him. The last new experience he’d planned for this semester was to fall in lust with his English professor, but the more Eli resists, the more Ash is determined to have him. Then he discovers Eli’s playing for keeps, and Ash is only interested in a fling... or is he? Between these two, when it comes to life and love, all bets are off.</description>

  <description>The truth is out there. Way, way, way out there!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew Lawson is racing against the clock. He's got a twenty-four-hour window to authenticate the mummy of Princess Merneith. If he's not at his boyfriend's garden party when that window closes, it'll be the final nail in their relationship coffin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing he needs traipsing on the final shred of his patience is brash, handsome reality show host Fraser Fortune, who's scheduled to film a documentary about the mummy's Halloween curse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opportunity to film a bona-fide professor examining the mummy is exactly the aura of authenticity Fraser needs. Except the grumpy PhD is a pompous ass on leave from his ivory tower. Yet something about Drew has Fraser using a word he doesn't normally have to draw upon: please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no time to waste -- and a spark of attraction he can't deny -- Drew reluctantly agrees to let Fraser follow his every move as he unwraps the mummy's secrets. Soon they're both making moves behind the scenes that even the dead can't ignore!</description>

  <description>Andreas Nikandros has one focus, to kill the vampire he believes murdered his sister, and he knows with their greater strength, the surest way to kill a vampire is to become one.  As a zoologist, he’s used to looking at the world from a natural standpoint, but when he sets out on a quest to find a vampire to Turn him, what he finds in Titus Antonius Calidus is the last thing he expected.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Titus has lived for over a thousand years, and in that time has only ever given his heart to one man.  As they follow their natural instincts, they discover something truly worth living forever for, each other.</description>

  <description>When High Paladin Sorin discovers the brutally dismembered body of his cousin Alfrey, a much loved priest in the royal palace, he is left baffled as  to who would do so terrible a thing to so good a man. But to find the answer to that question, he must cooperate with one of the highly despised necromancers, men who practice black magic, sleep in graveyards and feed upon souls …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The necromancer Koray, however, is far from what he expected. He is beautiful, stubborn, and possessed of a tongue sharp enough to cut down even the High Paladin himself. Koray is also possessed of a strength like nothing Sorin has ever encountered, and the power of the Goddess herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not take them long to realize that solving a murder is the easiest challenge they must face, and in order to save a kingdom they must first unravel centuries of lies and misunderstandings.</description>

  <description>Tasting Never, a New Adult Novel Recommended for Ages 18 and Up&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Never Ross wants to be loved.&lt;br&gt;It's that simple, but it's not that easy."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Never is a girl with a broken soul who doesn't date nice guys and can't seem to go to bed at night without crying herself to sleep. She doesn't need any complications in her life, especially not when they're attached to a man that could be her emotional twin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ty McCabe can't stand Never the first time he meets her. He's aware that the feeling's mutual and the two don't think they'll ever see each other again, but when fate takes a hand and puts them both in the wrong place at the wrong time, Ty and Never form a tentative friendship that opens the door on their dark sides and shows them what it's like to live in the light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a few, careful steps back."</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sean never asked to be an O'Hara, and he didn't ask to be cursed by one either.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After inheriting a hexed druid stone from his great-grandfather, Sean starts reliving another man's torture and death...every single night. And only one person can help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cormac Kelly runs a paranormal investigation business and doesn't have time to deal with misinformed tourists like Sean. But Sean has real magic in his pocket, and even though Cormac is a descendant of legendary druids, he soon finds himself out of his depth...and not because Sean's the first man he's felt anything for in a long time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pair develop an unexpected and intensely sexual bond, but are threatened at every turn when Sean's case attracts the unwelcome attention of the mad sidhe lords of ancient Ireland. When Sean and Cormac are thrust backward in time to Ireland's violent history—and their own dark pasts—they must work together to escape the curse and save their fragile relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;117,000 words</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Some secrets are better left hidden.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To most of the world, Tom Paretski is just a plumber with a cheeky attitude and a dodgy hip, souvenir of a schoolboy accident. The local police keep his number on file for a different reason—his sixth sense for finding hidden things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he’s called in to help locate the body of a missing woman up on Nomansland Common, he unexpectedly encounters someone who resurrects a host of complicated emotions. Phil Morrison, Tom’s old school crush, now a private investigator working the same case. And the former bully partly responsible for Tom’s injury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shocks keep coming. Phil is now openly gay, and shows unmistakable signs of interest. Tom’s attraction to the big, blond investigator hasn’t changed—in fact, he’s even more desirable all grown up. But is Phil’s interest genuine, or does he only want to use Tom’s talent?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the pile of complicated evidence surrounding the woman’s murder grows higher, so does the heat between Tom and Phil. But opening himself to this degree exposes Tom’s heart in a way he’s not sure he’s ready for…while the murderer’s trigger finger is getting increasingly twitchy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains a flirtatious plumber with hidden talents, a cashmere-clad private investigator with hidden depths, and an English village chock full of colourful characters with plenty to hide.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>As the only male studying magic in a female-dominant society, Seiran Rou’s life is already on a precarious perch. Then he finds a dead co-worker on his doorstep, and Sei realizes someone is trying to set him up for the fall. It could be anyone—including his own mother, a powerful witch and leader of the Dominion, the ruling body of elemental magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sei’s only saving graces are his on-again, off-again vampire boyfriend, Gabe, and the mysterious Jamie, who wants to help him for reasons Sei doesn’t understand. They may be all that stand between Sei and the Dominion’s demands to control his magic. One man’s devotion could be the key to save Sei’s life and pull him back from the brink of losing his humanity to the magic he possesses.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Always have an ace up your sleeve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Broken Mirrors, Book 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If con games were taught in high school, Spencer Crain would be on the honor roll. As it is, he’ll be riding the edge of failure to graduation next month. Then Spence gets the news that his long-gone father is not only dead, but was a Coyote, one of three clans of tricksters in the City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a near-catatonic mother on his hands, Spence couldn’t care less about the Coyotes’ ongoing feud with the Phouka and the Kitsune—until it lands on his doorstep. Suddenly he’s thrown headfirst into a dangerous world he knows next-to-nothing about. His only guide is Rourke, dashing King of the Phouka, plus a growing pack of half-siblings, a god, and Fate herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Spence embarks on a journey to learn the Coyote’s creed, the truth about his heritage, and how to handle his growing attraction to Rourke, he wonders when his life turned from TV sitcom to real-life danger zone. And what price must he pay to survive the next roll of the dice…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains PG-13 rated violence, R-rated language and X-rated hotel scenes. Meta-humor, pop-culture humor, utter disregard for the 4th wall abound.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Data Collection by Dalhousie, Dr. Donna L.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patient 331&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New, confused. His powers unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patient 289&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No longer viable in the test pool, he remains in isolation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patient 77&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reclassified to staff status. Useful, malleable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confined in a sterile research facility and treated like a lab rat, Chris is alone and terrified. His special powers are his only escape, allowing him to psychically connect with other patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alone in his cell for longer than he can remember, Vance is hungry. When newcomer Chris makes a mental connection, Vance is intrigued and soon wants more than just conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris and Vance seek comfort with each other, and with Simon—the only staff member who's shown them a hint of compassion. Their relationships develop during stolen moments, and they turn their thoughts to escape. But as Dr. Dalhousie's madness spirals, more than cell walls threaten to keep them apart...</description>

  <description>Gabriel Jordan lives a lonely life on the streets, taking the rare job that usually means spending hours in the cold, waiting for a chance to take a photograph of a cheating spouse. That's how he meets Dr. Aleksei Tennant-who he sees suspiciously jumping from a window of a woman's apartment. Tennant introduces Gabriel to the hidden worlds, magical worlds connected to this one by portals. Gabriel is eager to learn the runes for opening them, Tennant is eager to teach, and a fragile friendship develops amidst a series of murders. These aren't just any murders. The killer has a grudge against the mixture of other races: he doesn't kill humans, only those of the hidden worlds who are producing children of tainted blood. When the killer attacks them directly, Gabriel and Tennant have to team up to find the murderer, even though they're putting themselves, their love, and any chance at a future together, in danger.</description>

  <description>Thrown out and cursed as a trickster by his own father, Raven finds himself in the hands of a woman with a power he never could have imagined. In a time where the lands have been plagued by drought, sickness, and failing crops, Mistress Chatrina gives him food, work, and a place to sleep. But it is not out of the goodness of her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Raven is faced with the mystery concerning his new friend Myche and his master Breyre, for years held captive by Chatrina's selfishness and greed. They need to escape, and Raven is the only one who can help them return to their people, the shape shifting Eyrders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this return is not celebrated by all, and Raven, an Outlander, is not welcome. Breyre's need to seek revenge on Chatrina for all the hurt she has caused threatens to bring him nothing but hatred, having him exiled... or worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raven has to cope with the impending war, the conflicting plans of the Eyrders themselves, the struggle with his own newfound magic, and his budding relationship with a man who has a troubled past and an uncertain future.</description>

  <description>Dylan Carter has always played second fiddle to his perfect older brother, but now that brother is implicated in a terrible crime, and Dylan's family is imploding. Dylan can’t hide anymore. Knowing he’s falling apart, he searches for something or someone to hold him together—and lands in a BDSM bar called the Stonewall. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan doesn’t understand Miss Dolphinia, the hard-drinking queen who seems determined to play matchmaker. But more confusing is the way the powerful men in leather make him feel. In her wisdom, Miss Dolphinia sends Dylan off to a back room for his introduction to the world of erotic spankings and bondage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan’s teacher—for want of a better word—is the very dominant Vin Hauser. Vin likes to play hard, but he’s honest with himself—he knows all those men want is a strong hand, not a long-term relationship. Yet Vin can’t help but hope Dylan might be different. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With controversy over his brother’s sins stirring up danger around him, Dylan needs Vin’s support more than ever. But until he and Vin learn to trust each other, Dylan will have to face his fear and the growing threats alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trigger warning: off-page violent hetero rape.</description>

  <description>Though they are both classmates at the same high school and live in the same town, Rick and Steve have grown up in difference families with different values and religions. Brought together through water polo, they find themselves attracted to each other and one night, let go of everything they've both been taught about love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the late 1990's California suburbia, "Where I am Now" depicts the issues that young people face when confronting their sexuality and sexual orientation. Told through the points-of-view of not only Rick and Steve but their parents, we see the story unfold for both these families as the boys grapple with life and love.</description>

  <description>Stephen Prichard is a resilient and self-made man that has it all, a successful business, great husband, and a summer condo on the waterfront, until life throws a curve ball. After twelve years together, his husband Myron dies of cancer, leaving Stephen to confront a future of uncertainties alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, fate lends a hand when not one, but two chance encounters with the same stranger put his feelings to the test. First and second impressions are lasting. Stephen longs for companionship, and the stranger is attractive, however, he’s also enigmatic and cold, and the memories of Myron are still painfully fresh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can a man Stephen barely knows renew his faith in love? But, more importantly, is he willing to let go of the past?</description>

  <description>"Wanted: Midwife/nurse practitioner in Virgin River, population six hundred. Make a difference against the backdrop of towering California redwoods and crystal-clear rivers. Rent-free cabin included." When the recently widowed Melinda Monroe sees this ad she quickly decides that the remote mountain town of Virgin River might be the perfect place to escape her heartache, and to reenergize the nursing career she loves. But her high hopes are dashed within an hour of arriving: the cabin is a dump, the roads are treacherous and the local doctor wants nothing to do with her. Realizing she's made a huge mistake, Mel decides to leave town the following morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a tiny baby, abandoned on a front porch, changes her plans...and a former marine cements them into place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melinda Monroe may have come to Virgin River looking for escape, but instead she finds her home.</description>

  <description>A Book in the Family Series &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police captain Asher Penaz’s staunch professionalism bleeds into his home life, down to his neatly pressed attire and spartan apartment. He enjoys being the man in charge, and leather bars satisfy his need for dominance—so his sudden and powerful attraction to the lighthearted, free-spirited Daniel Tover throws him for a loop. In his entire life, Daniel has never gotten what he needs, so he moves to the next place, the next job, the next attempt to find something worth staying for, always landing at the top of his game, but never feeling like he belongs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chemistry between Asher and Daniel sizzles, so Asher invites Daniel home. As both men struggle to learn themselves while getting to know each other, the lines of desire and control blur. With all that fire comes the risk of getting burned. But if Daniel and Asher can walk through the flames together, they might find what they desperately need.</description>

  <description>Chaz never once thought the day he came out of the closet no one would be home . . . except the cat. And he was neutered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chaz is ready for the great reveal. He's carefully prepped himself for his private coming out party with new clothes, a handwritten invitation to a romantic dinner, and a solitary long-stemmed rose. Just one little problem—the object of his affection, the beautiful Karl, isn't home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the cat that looks like a rat gnaws on his rose, Chaz doesn't hear the rough and tumble Mike, the third member of the trio of apartment-mates, walk in the door. Mike's not the least bit shy . . . about anything, including letting it be known how upset he his Chaz is in love with Karl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chaz and the cat contemplate the demise of Mike who is on a quest to sacrifice the cannibalistic cat, until Karl comes home and announces he's getting married—to a woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could it get any worse for Chaz? Probably.</description>

  <description>When self-confessed player Brand Faulkner arranges to meet three different Goth guys over the course of one weekend, he isn't expecting to meet someone like 'Enigma'. Enigma isn't like anyone Brandon's met before. He's unpredictable, volatile and... well, downright weird! To make matters worse, the gorgeous Enigma isn't at all impressed with Brandon and is unafraid to crush the man's ego at every opportunity. For the first time in his life, Brandon has to work hard to win the guy. Will Brandon agree to Enigma's left of center, bizarre requests, or is the player about to get played?</description>

  <description>Recovering from a near fatal accident, artist Finn Barret returns to Seal Island in Maine to rest and recuperate. But Seal Island is haunted with memories, some sweet, some sad; three years ago Finn found his lover in the arms of Fitch, Finn's twin brother. Since that day, Finn has seen neither Conlan nor Fitch. In fact, no one has seen Fitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happened to him? Did Fitch run away, as everyone believes? Or did he meet a more sinister fate? To put the past to rest - and see if there's any chance of a future with Con - Finn must discover the truth. But the deeper he digs, the more reason he has to fear Con is the only one who knows what truly happened to Fitch...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Originally appread in the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6489596-the-art-of-dying"&gt;Partners in Crime: The Art of Dying&lt;/a&gt; anthology.</description>

  <description>Novel (66,000 words)&lt;br&gt;Genre(s): Gay, Historical, BDSM Drama&lt;br&gt;This classic gay BDSM novel, set near the end of the Viet Nam war, has been out of print for almost 20 years. Long before “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” being queer in the military was a one-way ticket to dishonorable discharge and a psychiatric diagnosis for mental disorder. In 'The Brig', a young sailor awaiting discharge as a Conscientious Objector is confined to a military prison where he is tortured with pain, fear, sexuality and mind games to force changes in his psyche and break his spirit. Yet, the sailor learns things about himself and his captors that will transform him and challenge those who hold him. &lt;br&gt;(For content labels and excerpt, see details on publisher's site.)</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This edition is no longer available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enslaved during the invasion of the rival King of Herra, Micah cut off his emotions and adapted to his new life in servitude. Xerxes, the Herran King, abuses his captive to keep the neighboring kingdom of Alekia under his yoke, but after Micah nearly dies when plague sweeps Herra, the Alekian King sends Eli to bring his beloved son home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Institutionalized by his slavery, unable to cope with his freedom, Micah seeks to please the new master he’s found in Eli throughout their harrowing journey to a homeland he no longer remembers. Eli protects the young man and introduces Micah to the pleasures denied him as a prisoner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Micah accept his noble birthright when they reach Alekia and more importantly, can he accept Eli as the devoted slave his father has given him rather than the master he’s come to love?</description>

  <description>[Ménage Amour ManLove: Erotic Alternative Sci-Fi Ménage a Quatre Romance, M/M/M/M, with Multiple Partners, Public Exhibition, sex toys]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dale despised the Terran military. He was drafted, not a volunteer. He never expected to get captured by the Algonquans and sold as a breeder pet, either. He only prays his new owner is kind and doesn’t eat him. Then he meets fellow pet, Mark, who informs him getting captured was the luckiest day of their lives. Mark also hated the military and now spends his days in a life of sexual leisure, enjoying poetry and totally at peace with his fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dale settles in and finds not only does he enjoy this life, he loves Mark, too. Despite tragedy striking too close to home in their protected world, they find room to love their Master’s newest pets, Cooper and Nate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the war ends and the Terran pets are granted their freedom, the men are faced with a choice: return, or stay with the owner they’ve grown to love?</description>

  <description>Last spring, Nikki Beckett vanished, sucked into an underworld known as the Everneath, where immortals Feed on the emotions of despairing humans. Now she’s returned—to her old life, her family, her friends—before being banished back to the underworld... this time forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has six months before the Everneath comes to claim her, six months for good-byes she can’t find the words for, six months to find redemption, if it exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nikki longs to spend these months reconnecting with her boyfriend, Jack, the one person she loves more than anything. But there’s a problem: Cole, the smoldering immortal who first enticed her to the Everneath, has followed Nikki to the mortal world. And he’ll do whatever it takes to bring her back- this time as his queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Nikki’s time grows short and her relationships begin slipping from her grasp, she’s forced to make the hardest decision of her life: find a way to cheat fate and remain on the Surface with Jack or return to the Everneath and become Cole’s...</description>

  <description>CLARITY MILLER always thought of her life as semi-normal. She had friends that would do anything for her, a boyfriend that was madly in love with her, and a roof over her head that she shared with her aunt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	Everything seemed to be falling into place. That is, until the day she met Sam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	When Sam informs her that he’s her guardian angel and that she has been given the gifts of a Seer, her life starts spiraling out of control. She wants nothing to do with the spiritual realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	All she wants is to have a normal life as a teenager, but when a tragedy occurs that causes the whole town of Garlandton to fall to its knees she realizes that she has a very important decision to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should she embrace the life of a Seer?&lt;br&gt;Only time will tell . .</description>

  <description>Reality TV? Meet actual reality…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life as a cable reality show host could be a sweet gig, if you came by it honestly… Renovations contractor Jack Hoffman did not. When a gay-unfriendly network offered him and his brother the job of a lifetime it seemed like a real Hollywood ending was finally in sight for the hard-luck pair. Jack wasn't rocking either end of the Kinsey scale exclusively, so why not? It changed what he could do in broad daylight, but everyone knows the stars only come out at night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His fool-proof plan was working until a crush on his new client's brother made him an even bigger fool. Cassius is devout, quiet, thoughtful... everything Jack is not. But from the moment he locks eyes with the strange and beautiful man Jack knows he never wants to let him out of his sight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the hot spots of WeHo to high in the hills, Jack finds himself caught in a romance that could only happen in the City of Angels. Now all Jack can do is brace for impact as his career and love life speed to a collision on the corner of Hollywood &amp;amp; Mine.</description>

  <description>Hockey player Jason Monroe lives a double life—star defenseman and soon-to-be Olympian on the ice and closeted gay man outside the rink. A serious relationship is out of the question, and Jason makes do with anonymous sex in barroom bathrooms, not willing to take the chance on coming out as gay in a decidedly macho sport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advisor to the US Olympic hockey team Patrick Parker knows a thing or two about being a professional hockey player who’s not out. He’s fifteen years older than Jason, and when he senses the sexy younger man is interested, he knows he shouldn’t give in to the attraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two men can’t keep their hands off each other, though, and with each heated encounter it gets harder to hide their relationship. When their world blows up around them, forcing them into the limelight, though, will their love survive or be put on ice?</description>

  <description>24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. &lt;br&gt;But he’s got his reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why. What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work. His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. &lt;br&gt;So he slipped far, far from it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? &lt;br&gt;Wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he'd better figure it out because he needs her to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense. Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows that. And he’s working on it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is that enough to make her stay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Please note: If You Stay contains mature subject matter such as drug use and sexual situations. It is intended for mature audiences.**</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Ender’s Game&lt;/em&gt; in an epic new series from award-winning author Rick Yancey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it’s the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth’s last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie’s only hope for rescuing her brother—or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.</description>

  <description>Abandoned by her mother on Jellicoe Road when she was eleven, Taylor Markham, now seventeen, is finally being confronted with her past. But as the reluctant leader of her boarding school dorm, there isn't a lot of time for introspection. And while Hannah, the closest adult Taylor has to family, has disappeared, Jonah Griggs is back in town, moody stares and all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this absorbing story by Melina Marchetta, nothing is as it seems and every clue leads to more questions as Taylor tries to work out the connection between her mother dumping her, Hannah finding her then and her sudden departure now, a mysterious stranger who once whispered something in her ear, a boy in her dreams, five kids who lived on Jellicoe Road eighteen years ago, and the maddening and magnetic Jonah Griggs, who knows her better than she thinks he does. If Taylor can put together the pieces of her past, she might just be able to change her future.</description>

  <description>Darin Brightmore is a nurse who runs to escape the stress of his job.  He’s unprepared when a routine trip down a local hiking trail lands him in the arms of a sexy stranger.  Darin is instantly drawn to the charming Raylan and is disappointed when their encounter is cut short.  Shortly after the encounter his life takes a turn for the strange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raylan Loup is a werewolf who is beyond pleasantly surprised when he stumbles across the enticing Darin one late afternoon.  Determined to claim the quirky nurse as his own, Raylan sets out to win Darin over.  Unfortunately, the appearance of a Huntsman dead set on putting Raylan down turns what should have been a routine courtship into a battleground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Darin accept all of the danger that comes with being Raylan’s mate or will he wish he never let the wolf at the door into his heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be Warned: m/m sex&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpt:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raylan presses their joined hands to Darin’s stomach, and his other arm comes up to wrap around his chest so that his hand is hooked around the curve of Darin’s opposite shoulder.  They fit together like puzzle pieces, and Darin isn’t ashamed of the way his stomach clenches and his cock goes hard and long in his loose fitting pants.  Not when he can feel every inch of Raylan against him and he knows that the werewolf is just as affected.  Raylan dips his head and nudges Darin’s to the side so that he can run his nose along the length of his throat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You have no idea what it did to me to have you ask for something.  What it did to the wolf to have you participate, even unknowingly, in the gifting.  It took all the control I had left not to come for you then.  Not to push my way into your life and take and take until there was no part of you I hadn’t touched, no part I hadn’t tasted.  No part of you that wasn’t completely mixed with a part of me.”  Raylan’s teeth close over the tender flesh of Darin’s neck, and he whimpers, hips bucking up and fingers tightening around Raylan’s hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Raylan doesn’t stop. He just tightens his hold on Darin’s shoulder, squeezes his hand in return, and grinds the long arch of his cock against Darin’s ass.  When he finally pulls away, Darin is breathless and knows that he’s going to have one hell of a mark.  It makes something inside of him sit up and whine, makes him want to beg Raylan to do it over and over again, to mark him from head to toe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;around.”  Raylan whispers the words into Darin’s ear.&lt;br&gt;“It got worse when I had to leave, when the Huntsman was so hard on my trail I had to disappear for a while to try to make it seem like I’d moved on.  I was two states away and the wolf would take over, would drag me almost halfway here before I could take control back enough to turn  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I-I don’t understand.  Why would the wolf drag you back here when there’s danger?”  Darin does his best to keep his voice even, but he knows he’s failing, can feel the tremors that are wracking his body and the way his heart’s beating fast enough to burst.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Because it wants you, too, just as bad as I do, and it didn’t like being away from you, being unable to protect you.  And then last night when you helped me, when you treated the wound, put me in your bed and then slipped in beside me like a true mate would, I couldn’t help but move things forward to the next step.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darin remembers the hot press and glide of bodies and hands, the thick heat of Raylan pressed against him and the tight ring of his fingers as he wrung Darin’s orgasm out of him.  He has a fairly good idea of what the third step is.  He can vaguely remember Raylan rubbing his back, the warm dampness of his hand and the way his skin had been sticky and itchy this morning.  His dawning awareness must show somehow because Raylan’s laughing again, a dark husky chuckle that sends puffs of warm air across the mark on Darin’s neck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hmm, I enjoyed it, too, enjoyed rubbing my scent onto you and yours onto me, enjoyed the thought of you lying there asleep, so trusting and smelling of our sex.  It’s a sign that you’re mine, that you belong to me and that I’m going to mate you.  If another wolf got anywhere near you they’d know right away that you were taken.  It’s still a struggle not to bend you over this counter and take you, to hold back and not fuck you right here in this kitchen until you can’t move, can’t think, without feeling me inside of you.  The scenting helps, even though the fact that it’s faded a bit  because of your shower is slowly driving me crazy.  I want to be so deep inside your skin that you’ll never wash me off.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raylan untangles their fingers, and his now free hand skims its way beneath Darin’s too large shirt, and he hooks a thumb in the waistband of his pants.  His fingers caress the arch of Darin’s cock, finding the little wet spot on the fabric that’s proof of just how affected Darin is and worrying it with a nail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As a matter of fact, I think I’ll fix that problem right now.”</description>

  <description>Into the paranormal world: A man’s idea of good and bad can be put to the test at the most unexpected moments.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maelgwn, leader of a clutch of gargoyles in Durango, Colorado, only planned to be in Stone Ridge a few days to help a fellow gargoyle’s mate through laying their first egg. His plan to leave changes when he scents his mate in the hospital. He discovers his mate is Bobby Truman, a human who has no idea the paranormal world exists, even though a number of his friends are shifters. Maelgwn begins the arduous process of watching and waiting, searching for that perfect opportunity to make contact with his mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby Truman is tired of his boyfriend, Seth’s, abusive friends, especially when Seth doesn’t do anything about their antics. The broken nose, compliments of Seth’s buddy Grant, is the final straw. When he’s attacked by muggers and rescued by a mysterious stranger in the dark, Bobby hopes it’s the opportunity he needs to make a clean break from Seth. Even if it doesn’t work out with Maelgwn, maybe Bobby can keep his new love interest’s attention long enough to prove to Seth they are really done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby thinks it’s odd that Maelgwn won’t come into the light, always meeting him after dark, but he’s nowhere near prepared for the truth when it finally comes out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Maelgwn convince Bobby that the things that go bump in the night aren’t always bad and to take his place at Maelgwn’s side in a paranormal world? Even when that means uprooting his life and moving?</description>

  <description>Kieran Appleby can't wait until graduation to escape his life in the Keys. His only friend is the school janitor, his father doesn’t talk to him, and Kieran doesn’t know how to mention he’s gay. No wonder he daydreams about college anywhere but Florida. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High school baseball star Drew Anderson has only wish in life: to be able to care for those he loves. With an absent father, an agoraphobic mother, and a closet he's not ready to come out of, he can barely stand under the pressure. No one knows how alone he feels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Drew finally notices Kieran's long-time crush, it jumpstarts a relationship that introduces them to sex, intimacy, and love. Neither has ever been this happy. But lasting happiness is evasive, and Kieran’s desperation to get out of Florida and Drew’s desire to stay and care for his family cannot be reconciled.</description>

  <description>In a post-war future world where First Contact has been made, humans are colonizing the stars, and the nations of Earth have been united under a central government, Extrahumans are required by law to belong to the Union. When a young man with visions of the future sets out on a mission to define the course of human history, he encounters a devastated former hero, a fascist dictatorship bent on world domination, and the realities of living in a society where affiliation is everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Broken figured she was done with heroics when she lost the ability to fly and fled the confinement of the Extrahuman Union. But then the world started to fall apart around her, and the mysterious Michael Forward entered her life, dangling the possibility of redemption and rebirth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Forward can see the future, but all he wants is to escape the destiny he has struggled against all his life. When the moment comes, though, he finds he can't refuse. Now he needs the help of a homeless ex-superhero to save a baby who may be the key to humanity's freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monica had a good life with her large family, until two strangers and a baby showed up at her door. Now her family is gone, her life is in ruins, and she's on the run from the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a time of spreading darkness, when paranoia and oppression have overtaken the world, can three unlikely allies preserve a small ray of hope for a better, brighter future?</description>

  <description>Leander McLoughlin is leader of the Ikati, an ancient tribe of beautiful, savage shape-shifters who live hidden in the forests of England. Their survival is rooted in secrecy, a secrecy threatened by the very existence of one raised outside the tribe. Charged with capturing her before she can expose their secret, Leander tracks the unsuspecting outsider to Southern California. The great warrior is prepared for a fight ? but not for the effect the courageous young beauty has on his heart. Jenna Moore spent her childhood in hiding, on the run from an unseen enemy. Now her mother is dead and her father has vanished without a trace, leaving Jenna alone to contend with sudden strange, superhuman abilities. When handsome, enigmatic Leander McLoughlin appears, promising answers to all of her questions, she knows she shouldn't trust him. But their connection is as undeniable as the dangerous destiny drawing her home?</description>

  <description>Flo has always had problems. Her stammer prevents her speech and her dad’s abuse makes her life a living hell. Not to mention she sees colours other people don’t. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her dad decides to ship her off to live with her grandma in the sleepy town of Chesterport, Flo thinks that this is her chance for a better life. But on her very first day at her new school she is ridiculed and laughed at for having a stammer. One student sticks up for her and his name is Frank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frank’s body is surrounded by an aura of fire, but Flo is the only one who can see it. He lives in a foster home for troubled teenagers. Flo is drawn to him because he’s different and so is she. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things are about to get scary, because Chesterport is not your ordinary suburban town. It’s infested by a coven of dark witches who prey on the young and the elderly. Soon Flo discovers that she’s next on their list of victims, and finds herself fighting a battle she never would have imagined possible.</description>

  <description>Her heart is broken and bleeding. But her blood is going to get her into trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tegan wonders if it is possible to die of a broken heart. For over two months she has grieved and not left the confines of her apartment in Tribane city. Following her friend Nicky’s advice, she is now going to step outside and start her life over again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her very first night outdoors, Tegan joins her friends at the Crimson club where she draws the attention of the mysterious owner, Ethan Cristescu. She is not entirely sure why this beautiful man is so interested in her, but she has a feeling there is something not quite right about him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she falls deeper into Ethan’s world, Tegan makes some shocking discoveries about who she really is, and finally uncovers the true face of her home city. Tribane is inhabited by vampires, dhamphirs, slayers, witches and warlocks. The problem is, they all want Tegan for her very special blood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She doesn’t want to hide again, but she also doesn’t want these creatures to capture her. Tegan has a difficult decision to make. Should she run away or stand and fight?</description>

  <description>"Sometimes letting someone go is the ultimate act of love."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Nixon is a college student with a past full of secrets and heartbreak.  At seven years old, the death of her mother by drug overdose destroys her faith in humanity and herself as she is tossed from one foster home to another. Feeling unwanted and disposable, she fights to keep herself safe in the system. Until, at the age of fifteen, she is saved by her first love, and soon-to-be rock star, Chris Knight and his mother, who quickly becomes the mother she always wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Claire encourages Chris to leave town to pursue his dreams of musical stardom, both Claire and Chris don't realize this will be the biggest mistake of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year after Chris leaves on tour, Claire has carved out a new life for herself in a new city far away from the life she left behind with Chris. On a fateful morning, she meets sexy surfer Adam Parker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Claire, Adam is just another flirty customer at the cafe, until a chance encounter and seemingly innocent comment spurs a bet between them. The bet is simple: If Adam can get Claire to reveal the secret that made her drop out of college and leave her life behind, she has to re-enroll. If he doesn't succeed, she gets to keep her secret and he has to stop stalking her at the cafe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire thinks she has this one in the bag. She's perfected the art of forgetting her past. But she isn't prepared for Adam's relentless pursuit or for him to share his own secrets. And she's definitely not prepared for the love of her life, Chris Knight, and her secret, to come banging down her door one year later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language, drug use, and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>Incidental: Occurring or likely to occur as an unpredictable or minor accompaniment* Happenstance: A chance circumstance * Neither was looking for it. Neither was expecting it. But sometimes, life has other plans… One year after the loss of her fiancé, Tia Hastings needed to find a way to start over. She had to figure out how to be single again, but she had no idea how to do it. Last Stop was a tiny pub with no significance—she chose it to be anonymous, to watch the interactions between the sexes so she could figure out how to start her life over… Dylan Miller was a megastar. It was impossible for him to move amongst the general population without being recognized, but he longed to simply blend into a crowd. He donned a disguise and wandered into Last Stop, a dark little hole-in-the-wall where he was sure he wouldn’t be recognized… When their worlds collide, Tia and Dylan discover something neither of them thought possible—love. But when a fallen star sees Dylan as her ticket back to the top and will stop at nothing to make him hers, Tia wonders if she’s out of her ; and out of time to rescue the love she thought she’d never find again… Is it fate? Coincidence? Or both?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A family is torn apart by fierce belief and private longing in this unprecedented journey deep inside the most insular Hasidic sect, the Satmar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;     Sweeping from the Central European countryside just before World War II to Paris to contemporary Williamsburg, Brooklyn, &lt;em&gt;I Am Forbidden &lt;/em&gt;brings to life four generations of one Satmar family.&lt;br&gt;     Opening in 1939 Transylvania, five-year-old Josef witnesses the murder of his family by the Romanian Iron Guard and is rescued by a Gentile maid to be raised as her own son. Five years later, Josef rescues a young girl, Mila, after her parents are killed while running to meet the Rebbe they hoped would save them. Josef helps Mila reach Zalman Stern, a leader in the Satmar community, in whose home Mila is raised as a sister to Zalman’s daughter, Atara. As the two girls mature, Mila’s faith intensifies, while her beloved sister Atara discovers a world of books and learning that she cannot ignore. With the rise of communism in central Europe, the family moves to Paris, to the Marais, where Zalman tries to raise his children apart from the city in which they live. &lt;br&gt;     When the two  girls come of age, Mila marries within the faith, while Atara continues to question fundamentalist doctrine. The different choices the two sisters makes force them apart until a dangerous secret threatens to banish them from the only community they’ve ever known. &lt;br&gt;     A beautifully crafted, emotionally gripping story of what happens when unwavering love, unyielding law, and centuries of tradition collide, &lt;em&gt;I Am Forbidden&lt;/em&gt; announces the arrival of an extraordinarily gifted new voice and opens a startling window on a world long closed to most of us, until now.</description>

  <description>Some people never grow up, and there are some people you never grow out of no matter how hard you try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s irrational. He’s crass. She wanted out of South Boston. He never wanted to leave. She keeps him at a distance. He refuses to leave her side. Together, Colleen Frasier and Bradley Patrick are ridiculous and juvenile. Apart, they’re just plain miserable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Detective Bradley Patrick was keeping the streets of South Boston safe, Colleen Frasier was busy litigating late into the evening and admiring the view from her high-rise condo downtown. Her life was perfect– sort of. She spent too much time drinking her high-priced lattes and acquiring an impressive shoe collection and before she knew it she was 35 and time for all that other stuff she wanted, like a husband and children, was quickly passing her by. And then there’s that longtime rift that’s kept her and her childhood best friend, Bradley Patrick, at odds for over a decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of that changes on Colleen’s 35th birthday when she receives a surprise marriage proposal from Brad. One night. One birthday wish. Trouble is, he brings out the worst in Colleen. She can’t possibly marry him, can she? She’s never been very good at saying “no” to him, either. What was supposed to end the next day with an annulment takes on a life of its own when video of the wedding ends up on the internet and their families are overjoyed by the news. Fearing the shame of her Catholic family, Colleen has a proposal of her own: pretend the marriage is for real– and Brad is all too willing to play the doting husband.</description>

  <description>What happens when you fall in love with the perfect guy... twice... in one day?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna Blixen spent her freshman year homeschooling in Denmark; now that she’s back in the States, she’s determined to make her sophomore year unforgettable. And by unforgettable, she imagined awesome classes, fun friendships, and maybe a little romance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she got was a whole lot of romance, and all at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same day that dark, brooding Saxon Maclean charmed her with his killer good looks and whip-smart wit, Jake Kelly stole her breath away with his heart-wrenching smile and intelligent, thoughtful focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Saxon is a proud player who makes it clear that he doesn’t know why he can’t get Brenna off of his mind and out of his system, and Jake’s sweet and humble attitude hides a secret past life that might be more darker and more complex than Brenna’s willing to handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicating the matter is the fact that Saxon and Jake were once best friends and are now arch-enemies... and the more Brenna finds out about their connection to each other, the more intrigued and worried she becomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between keeping the peace with her lovingly over-protective parents, designing t-shirts for her high school’s rising punk band, keeping up her grades in both academic and technical high school, and running the track like a maniac, Brenna has enough to worry about with out juggling two guys who make her heart thud and drive her crazy all at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has to make a choice. But how can she when giving her heart to one of them might mean breaking the other’s?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Cover Design: Steven Peterson)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended Age: Older YA</description>

  <description>A rainy night brought him to me. Now, he sits nude, (wrapped in the smallest blanket I found) nursing a brandy and telling me his life story. Which I’m not really listening to, since I’m busy planning the way to make this straight buddy bend for me – or vice versa, I really don’t care, as long as we end up tangled and satisfied. Please, don’t think I’m a selfish jerk, because my crush on him is epic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; A close-up of a man with long curly hair standing in the rain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Sequel to The Actor and the Earl&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the uncomfortable clothing and the gossip at court, Sebastian Hewel is still enjoying the role of Lady Bronwyn, wife of Earl Anthony Crofton. But when Queen Elizabeth asks a favor of Anthony, Sebastian’s world fractures and his heart threatens to break. The Queen wants Anthony to seduce Marie Valois, the beautiful daughter of a French noble, to discover the whereabouts of her father, who is wanted by the King of France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebastian knows Anthony can’t refuse the Queen, especially since he has something of a reputation at court. But the situation is further complicated when Marie meets Sebastian without his disguise—and starts flirting with him. Her brother, Nicholas, arrives at Crofton Hall, not happy that his sister has been linked to a man like Anthony, only to find his own head turned by Lady Bronwyn and her acerbic wit. Contending with the attentions of both siblings—and a very jealous Anthony—would be bad enough. But then Sebastian’s uncle demands Sebastian and Anthony stage Bronwyn’s death to avoid discovery….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Timeless Dreams title: While reaction to same-sex relationships throughout time and across cultures has not always been positive, these stories celebrate M/M love in a manner that may address, minimize, or ignore historical stigma.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Before Perry and Aria, there was Roar and Liv.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a childhood spent wandering the borderlands, Roar finally feels like he has a home with the Tides. His best friend Perry is like a brother to him, and Perry's sister, Liv, is the love of his life. But Perry and Liv's unpredictable older brother, Vale, is the Blood Lord of the Tides, and he has never looked kindly on Roar and Liv's union. Normally, Roar couldn't care less about Vale's opinion. But with food running low and conditions worsening every day, Vale's leadership is more vital—and more brutal—than ever. Desperate to protect his tribe, Vale makes a decision that will shatter the life Roar knew and change the fate of the Tides forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the harsh but often beautiful world of Veronica Rossi's "unforgettable" &lt;em&gt;Under the Never Sky&lt;/em&gt; (Examiner.com), this captivating prequel novella stands on its own for new readers and offers series fans a fascinating look into the character of Roar. Poignant and powerful, &lt;em&gt;Roar and Liv&lt;/em&gt; is a love story that will "capture your imagination and your heart." (&lt;em&gt;Justine&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Under the Never Sky&lt;/em&gt;)</description>

When Mario gets the bright idea to buy a POS house together to flip, Carter swears he's out of his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Mario Gutierrez is hard to resist.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Some things are worth waiting for…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling thousands of miles from home to enter college is the only way nineteen-year-old Avery Morgansten can escape what happened at the Halloween party five years ago—an event that forever changed her life. All she needs to do is make it to her classes on time, make sure the bracelet on her left wrist stays in place, not draw any attention to herself, and maybe—please God—make a few friends, because surely that would be a nice change of pace. The one thing she didn’t need and never planned on was capturing the attention of the one guy who could shatter the precarious future she’s building for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things are worth experiencing…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple that’s just so… so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous, but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible, he brings out a side of her she never knew existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things should never be kept quiet…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Avery starts receiving threatening emails and phone calls forcing her to face a past she wants silenced, she’s has no other choice but to acknowledge that someone is refusing to allow her to let go of that night when everything changed. When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar? And can Cam be there to help her or will he be dragged down with her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And some things are worth fighting for…&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Imagine a world where a woman's every pleasure, every wish and wildest fantasy is granted by the man of her dreams. Such is Avalon, an elite, private club in Washington, D.C., that caters solely to female desires. There, magazine reporter Billie Cort meets Adrian, the club's most infamous companion, with the intent to interview him for an article on high-dollar male escorts. Billie can't foresee, however, how quickly Adrian will strip her defenses and expose her true desires and in the process, fulfill his own yearning for love.</description>

  <description>Kipp Llewellyn would rather follow his dreams than toe the family line, so instead of the support of his wealthy family, he has estrangement and a part-time job with Hunter, an in-demand interior designer. Hunter opens a new world for Kipp to explore—and not just for his career. It’s through Hunter that Kipp meets and begins what he thinks is a one-sided flirtation with Ham, one of Hunter’s customers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Kipp’s astonishment, Ham asks him for a date. Unfortunately for Kipp, a mysterious phone call summons him home, where his father gives him an ultimatum: save the family company by marrying billionaire Hyde Wyndham, in which case all will be overlooked, or never set foot in his home again. But meeting Hyde leaves Kipp stunned and betrayed, because Hyde is actually Ham. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A guarantee of marriage is no excuse for making Kipp feel foolish, and Kipp had enough of the gilded cage in the first twenty-one years of his life. He turns Hyde down, stating that marriage should be about love rather than convenience. If Hyde wants him, he’ll have to court him the old-fashioned way.</description>

  <description>Ben Jenkins is a down-to-earth cop leading a quiet life in a big, empty house. Visits to the gay bars scratch an itch, but they don't really satisfy, and though he's used to the quiet, he recognizes that the empty feeling plaguing him of late is loneliness. It takes a police cruiser and a ten-speed to bring him together with Reece Withers, a bike messenger and photographer who's still waiting for his big break to arrive. Ben's pretty sure what he's feeling is love, but they both have old hurts that need to heal before they can live and live well... together.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Tucker Springs, Colorado: Population, 70-something-thousand. Home to beautiful mountain views, two respected universities, and a ridiculously high cost of living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Davis can handle a breakup. And an overwhelming mortgage. And a struggling business. And the excruciating pain that keeps him up at night thanks to a shoulder injury. Handling all of it at once? Not so much. When his shoulder finally pushes him to a breaking point, he takes a friend’s advice and gives acupuncture a try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Whitman is a single dad struggling to make ends meet. When a mutual friend refers a patient, and that patient suggests a roommate arrangement to alleviate their respective financial strains, Michael jumps at the opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living together would be easy if Jason wasn’t so damned attracted to Michael. Good thing Michael’s straight, or the temptation might just be too much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, their mutual friend &lt;em&gt;says&lt;/em&gt; Michael is straight…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second book in the &lt;a href="http://tuckersprings.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tucker Springs&lt;/a&gt; series, &lt;em&gt;Second Hand&lt;/em&gt;, will be written by &lt;a href="http://mariesexton.net/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marie Sexton&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://heidicullinan.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Heidi Cullinan&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

  <description>The mind may forget, but the heart remembers…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t take Hayden Garrett’s college degree to figure out why Officer Josh Peterson is the last man alive he wants to face. Not because of the council’s harebrained idea to broker peace between their clans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the sweaty palms that prove Hayden never got over his embarrassing attraction to his alpha rival. Mate with him? Nothing fills Hayden with more desire—or dread. Josh doesn’t have a gay hair in his fur. At least not one he owns up to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite Josh’s reputation for being a connoisseur of female flesh, he’s always cared about Hayden. In a different world, they might have been friends. Now, face to face after five years, the bitterness in Hayden’s eyes fills Josh with regret for what could have been—should have been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Hayden and Josh journey through rituals—and intimacies—that will knit their souls for life, passion and anger flares, revealing a powerful secret. The truth about a long-ago sharing of hearts, bodies and souls that ended in tragedy…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Steamy love between two rival alpha werewolves, a pregnant moon that inspires mating urges, and one shy guy who knows exactly what he wants.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>I thought I knew what love was…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Hunter Willis and I’ve found love. The problem? I’m not sure I’m ready for the rest of the world to know I’ve fallen for my best friend. Everyone knows Max is gay. Me? They think I’m straight as an arrow. So did I, until Max and I shared a kiss three months ago that blew that theory right out of the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, by the ocean in Florida, thousands of miles away from prying eyes, I’m finally ready to admit to myself that Max and I have something special. Max has been ready for a long time—and he’s been waiting for me. Really waiting. As in…he’s still a virgin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s nothing I want more than to be Max’s first lover. But I know when Max gives away that part of himself, it won’t be just a summer fling. It’ll be for keeps. Max deserves the best. I’m just not sure, when it comes right down to it, that I won’t break his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did I mention I’m scared as hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;: This title features summer lovin’ between two hot men, a secret romance between best friends—one of whom doesn’t think he’s actually gay, and enough heat to set any beach vacation on fire. Be sure to keep the extinguisher handy!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Wild boy Tarin is determined not to be captured by the men who live in the decaying Before Times buildings on the other side of Tarin’s woodland home, but he’s just as determined to protect the younger boys in the woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one remembers being a child or knows where all the women have gone or how society crumbled, but for as long as they can remember, boys have lived in the woods and are hunted by the men each Fall. Some boys believe in a mysterious Lady who protects them, while others think the men are magic. Tarin knows better – he’s met a man, and escaped by stabbing him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunted through the woods as he tries to protect the weaker Cory, Tarin is trapped and claimed by the very man he knifed. All Tarin wants is to stay in the woods and not have to get ‘civilized,’ but he’s carried off into a different world of rules and discipline. Will he be able to survive now that he is Out of the Woods?</description>

  <description>Chip Arnold is a well-liked football coach at a small liberal arts college, but his personal life is in a bit of a rut. He goes out drinking with his colleagues, gets along well with his players, and dates all the prettiest women in town-he has the life most straight men dream of. But lately none of the women he dates seem to be igniting any passion in him. Then he meets the new school chaplain, Foster Lewis. Romantic attraction to another man is new and terrifying, and Chip just can't put his finger on why he's drawn to Foster, but it's stronger than anything he's felt for anyone in his life. Never one to back down from a challenge, Chip decides to go for it. But love is never simple, and sometimes it's a downright mess!</description>

  <description>Fiction writer Logan Brandish is perfectly happy in his peaceful small-town routine with his best friend, his cat, and his boyfriend—until he meets the editor of his next book, the handsome Brock Kimble, and the lazy quiet of everyday living goes flying out the window. Faced with real passion for the first time, Logan becomes restless and agitated, and soon his life and his new manuscript—a work in progress he’d always thought would be completed—are in a shambles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Logan is learning, you can’t always get what you want… at least not right away. To take his mind off the mess, he takes a trip, but even the beautiful Italian, um, scenery can’t keep his thoughts from his erstwhile editor for long. Logan just might have to admit there are some things you can’t run from.</description>

  <description>A coming of age story with a supernatural bent, "The Rest is Illusion" is set on the campus of Verona College, a small liberal arts school that overlooks an ancient river valley. The story centers on five students at critical points in their lives. Sarah, a young woman at odds with everything her parents stand for; Ash, a mysterious genius; Dashel, a young man with a mysterious illness; Tony, a closeted football star; and Wilder, a manipulative hopeful politician. Their individual stories run in and out of each other in the course of a week. Personal problems are further complicated by an unseen force that surrounds the college, living deep in the woods. As this entity begins to more fully touch the lives of the characters, things begin to unravel. For some this is a needed change, but for others this is a catalyst to a terrifying end.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From an injured rodeo rider to an addicted rodeo clown. From the world’s hottest country singer to two men who had fallen in love as boys before drifting apart, the Home series takes these lovers all over the country and around the world, all to discover home truly is where their hearts love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book one in the Home Series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years ago, a hoof to the head ended Leslie Hardin’s showjumping career and his relationship with the man he loved. Broken, hurt and rejected, Les has focused his energies on rebuilding his life. &lt;br&gt;Les’ accident has shown him that the most valuable treasures are usually found under an imperfect surface, and his reputation for taking in strays starts to grow. But it’s one of these strays in particular, injured rodeo cowboy Randy Hersch, who captures more than just his compassion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between his disapproving father and his chosen career path, Randy has always felt the need to deny his passion. When Les takes him under his wing, Randy begins to realise that he is truly strong enough to admit his true self—to himself and to the rest of the world. But in the arms of a broken man, can he find acceptance...and love?</description>

  <description>Levi Binder is a Miami bartender who cares about only two things: sex and surfing.  Ostracized by his Mormon family for his homosexuality, Levi is determined to live his life his own way, but everything changes when he meets massage therapist Jaime Marshall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaime is used to being alone.  Haunted by the horrors of his past, his only friend is his faithful dog, Dolly.  He has no idea how to handle somebody as gorgeous and vibrant as Levi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complete opposites on the surface, Levi and Jaime both long for something that they can only find together.  Through love and the therapeutic power of touch, they’ll find a way to heal each other, and they’ll learn to live as sinners in a family of saints.</description>

  <description>Liam loves his life as a linguist and trader on the Rownt homeworld, but he has ignored his heart and sexual needs for years. He won't risk letting anyone come too close because he won't risk letting anyone see his deeply submissive nature. For him, submission comes with pain. Life burned that lesson into his soul from a young age. This fear keeps him from noticing that the Rownt trader Ondry cares for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ondry may not understand humans, but he recognizes a wounded soul, and his need to protect Liam is quickly outpacing his common sense. They may have laws, culture, and incompatible genitalia in their way, but Ondry knows that he can find a way to overcome all that if he can just overcome the ghosts of Liam's past. Only then can he take possession of a man he has grown to love.</description>

  <description>Stood down from duty on convalescent's leave, secret agent Arthur Pendragon wonders if sheer boredom might just do him in. But when his handler saddles him with a caretaker who is by turns completely inept and strangely brilliant, and invites trouble wherever he goes, Arthur has to concede that death by boredom looks less and less likely. Death by goon squad, high-speed car chase, poison, or fiery explosion, however...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fandom: Merlin (TV)&lt;br&gt;Pairing: Merlin/Arthur Pendragon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~68,000+ words</description>

  <description>There’s a fine line between being quirky and being downright weird, and Lou had unknowingly crossed it years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being told that you have a feminine brain might not seem much of an insult. Being told so at the age of eleven by your Maths teacher in front of the whole class is insulting… especially when you’re a boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Lou Lawrence has been coasting through life. He resides at the family home in the small town of Crockham for £40 a week and changes jobs whenever the going gets tough. But the one thing that doesn’t come easily to Lou is his relationships with men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lou believes that all his problems will disappear when he meets the right guy. What isn’t helping is the fact that Lou has a habit of chasing after straight men. That hazardous trend is set to continue when Lou, swayed by events at younger brother Roy’s wedding, takes on the role of delivering the Christmas mail. Lou falls for his beefy-legged colleague Dean... then befriends his fiancée.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Dean's wedding fast approaching, should Lou listen to his ‘feminine brain’ and carry on chasing after Dean in the hope that he'll stray to the dark side? Or should he follow the advice of his straight-talking ‘masculine brain’ and look for love elsewhere?</description>

  <description>After a near-fatal accident, Logan Walker seeks help to control the compulsive blood fetish that almost cost his submissive's life. Help happens to be in the form of an athletic, smart psychologist by the name of Dr. Kasper Bromley. Kasper, though, soon finds himself swept up in the fantasies Logan came to him to control. Reluctantly throwing his ethics to the wind, Kasper submits himself to Logan, gambling his career, his future, and his heart on this intriguing man and the lifestyle he offers. But when Kasper's desires outpace Logan's, the young doctor is swept down into a whirlpool of sex and sadism that even Logan's love may not be enough to rescue him from.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The last thing she needs right now is a man . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lindsey Brooks had it all—an awesome job doling out advice to the lovelorn, a fabulous high-rise apartment, and a to-die-for fiancé. But then she got dumped—wearing nothing but a "Kiss the Cook" apron—and desperate to escape, she retreats to a tiny Montana town to reclaim a family treasure. She never dreamed anyone would try to stop her—or that he'd be sexy as sin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too bad she finds such a hot one . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob Colter isn't into relationships—but Lindsey sees Rob as the perfect guy to help her "get back on the horse." The sex horse, that is. Unfortunately, he comes complete with a mysterious past, which gets even more mysterious when she finds his passionate letters to another woman—whose name happens to be tattooed on his chest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And too bad he has so many secrets . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Rob's dangerous past is about to catch up with them both. And if that's not horrible enough, Lindsey is falling for him—hard. For a girl who usually has all the answers, Lindsey is up to her neck in trouble.</description>

  <description>Lilith Bresson, an independent, successful young artist, is forced to travel from her home in Spain to the wild borderlands of northern England, to repay her feckless father’s latest debt by painting a portrait of the enigmatic Lady Blaine Albermarle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her first night at Albermarle Hall she meets Finn Strachan, Blaine’s ‘companion’, a cultured and hauntingly beautiful young man who seems to have it all. But Lilith has an artist’s eye, and a gift for seeing what lies beneath the skin. She soon discovers that Blaine is more gaoler than lover, and if the price is right, depravity has no limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the weeks pass, Lilith finds that she too is drawn into the malign web that her patron has spun, yet against the odds she forges a strong friendship with the damaged, dysfunctional Finn. In a dark, modern twist to an age-old story, Lilith Bresson proves that sometimes it’s the princess who needs to become the rescuer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that this storyline contains depictions of drug abuse, violence and non-consensual sexual activity.</description>

  <description>On the evening of Sofia Claremont's seventeenth birthday, she is sucked into a nightmare from which she cannot wake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quiet evening walk along a beach brings her face to face with a dangerous pale creature that craves much more than her blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is kidnapped to an island where the sun is eternally forbidden to shine.&lt;br&gt;An island uncharted by any map and ruled by the most powerful vampire coven on the planet. She wakes here as a slave, a captive in chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sofia's life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn when she is the one selected out of hundreds of girls to join the harem of Derek Novak, the dark royal Prince.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his addiction to power and obsessive thirst for her blood, Sofia soon realizes that the safest place on the island is within his quarters, and she must do all within her power to win him over if she is to survive even one more night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she succeed? ...or is she destined to the same fate that all other girls have met at the hands of the Novaks?</description>

  <description>He was sent to be the consort for the high king. Allen is a prince taught in the arts of diplomacy and politics but not fighting. The high king is a warrior and his dead lover was his first general. He does not want anyone who cannot wield a sword as well and only fight with words. That’s just not someone that he wants to help him raise his children. So when Allen is presented before him, the high king does not chose him to be his next consort. What is a rejected consort to do? Allen cannot return home, since he was sent to cement a treaty between his kingdom and the one of the high king. The army is hiring and Allen asks to be a part of the next expedition, to train to be a warrior and tries to forget the king, who rejected him, without knowing him. Can those two come to together and find love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; A young man with short, messy, dark brown hair and gray eyes. He's wearing chain mail, and has not been able to shave for a couple of days. He is handsome, almost pretty, but wears a somber expression. He looks as though he is weighed down by his thoughts, or troubled by something he can see off in the distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>What if the last place you should fall in love is the first place that you do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’d think getting sent to Turning Pines Wilderness Camp for a month-long rehabilitation “retreat” and being forced to re-live it in this journal would be the worst thing that’s ever happened to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’d be wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s the reason I was sent to Turning Pines in the first place: I got arrested. On prom night. With my two best friends, who I haven’t talked to since and probably never will again. And then there’s the real reason I was sent here. The thing I can’t talk about with the guy I can’t even think about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if the moment you’ve closed yourself off is the moment you start to break open?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there’s this guy here. Ben. And the more I swear he won’t—he can’t—the deeper under my skin he’s getting. After the thing that happened, I promised I’d never fall for another boy’s lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet I can’t help but wonder…what if?</description>

  <description>Tallis Carrington ruled Rock Bay with his gang of jocks and an iron fist-until a scandal destroyed his family's name. Ten years later Tallis is dead broke, newly homeless, and on the walk of shame to end all walks of shame. He needs money and needs it fast, and Rock Bay is the only home he knows. But the people of Rock Bay haven't forgotten him-or the spoiled brat he used to be. The only person in town willing to overlook his past is Lex, the new coffee shop owner, who offers Tally a job even though he appears to despise Tally based on his reputation alone. When Tally discovers his gorgeous boss is the kid he tortured back in high school, Lex's hot and cold routine finally makes sense. Now Tally has to pull out all the stops to prove he was never really the jerk he seemed to be. After all, if he can win Lex's heart, the rest of the town should be a piece of coffee cake.</description>

  <description>Amy Curry thinks her life sucks. Her mom decides to move from California to Connecticut to start anew--just in time for Amy's senior year. Her dad recently died in a car accident. So Amy embarks on a road trip to escape from it all, driving cross-country from the home she's always known toward her new life. Joining Amy on the road trip is Roger, the son of Amy's mother's old friend. Amy hasn't seen him in years, and she is less than thrilled to be driving across the country with a guy she barely knows. So she's surprised to find that she is developing a crush on him. At the same time, she's coming to terms with her father's death and how to put her own life back together after the accident. Told in traditional narrative as well as scraps from the road--diner napkins, motel receipts, postcards--this is the story of one girl's journey to find herself.</description>

  <description>Senior stage manager Jesse Ferelit and sophomore light board operator Simeck Whedon meet while crewing a college theater production. Jesse hates everything about Sim, from his lack of theater experience, to his obsession with LGBTQ politics, to his infatuation with, of all things, Hula hoops. Well, he doesn't hate everything. He doesn't mind Sim's eyes, or hair, or his surprising ability to be cool in a crisis. But Jesse is graduating in just a few months, and if there's one thing he does not have time for, it's a relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sim knows exactly what he likes: civil rights, the circus, and sex. And he knows what he likes about Jesse. In the control booth, Jesse is exactly Sim's type—a natural leader, collected and confident. But outside the booth, he seems reclusive, acerbic and uptight—hardly Sim's type at all. Is a relationship with Jesse a real possibility, just a fantasy, or a hopelessly lost cause? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sim offers to teach Jesse how to hula hoop as a way to relax and loosen up, the lessons ease the two men into an unexpected shared world of sex, kink, friendship, and eventually love.</description>

  <description>The only interesting thing about Why Yell, Iowa, is its name, so when Mark Johansen left for college, he didn’t plan to return. But his family has other ideas: his father manipulates him into a job he hates and his mother uses him as a patch for coping with his siblings’ problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Mark runs into Jamie Novotny after a particularly bad day at work, he’s surprised to find the quirky kid he knew in high school has grown into a driven ecowarrior. But the shock of finding Jamie working in the local co-op pales compared to his astonishment when Jamie confesses he’s had a crush on Mark for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their first night together leaves Mark happy but disoriented, but their second leaves him bereft. He's unable to find Jamie because he refuses to use cell phones, fearing their environmental impact. Mark’s usual stoicism splinters, and he can’t stop himself from tracking Jamie down. When their lives collide, Mark makes room in his heart and his house for Jamie—but what Jamie really wants is for Mark to man up.</description>

  <description>Jesse Clayton loves painting, his cowboy grandfather, and his life as an artist with a wild abandon that leaves scorch marks on everything he touches. Budding Navajo cartoonist Lorenzo Maryboy is a hard-working former Marine: staunch, brave, and honorable. Chance brings them together on the road to Marathon, Texas, and passion flares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as always, Jesse puts his art ahead of everything. He betrays their growing trust, and that Lorenzo can’t forgive. But Jesse’s found something he loves more than his art, and what he does to win Lorenzo’s forgiveness is far more dangerous than either man understands.</description>

  <description>Logan Crane’s life changed dramatically the day a blind fit of temper resulted in him accidentally injuring his wife. Although he’s now in an abuser counseling program, Logan cannot face the real source of his unhappiness: he’s always been attracted to men but has refused to accept it since witnessing an act of violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During his therapy, Logan meets Nick Zales, a counselor at a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Nick is understandably suspicious of Logan despite an immediate attraction to him. Logan feels the same attraction and faces a critical internal struggle as he finds himself falling in love with this enigmatic man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both men are haunted by unacknowledged ghosts and abuse in their pasts. How can they help each other heal if they continue to ignore their own wounds?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Give me six months, and I'll give you the world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brandon McKinney has scraped and sacrificed for what little in life he's ever had. Though it's been fifteen years since he escaped his father's abuse, the damage remains. Trust seems as far out of reach as his dream of becoming an architect, and though he's come to accept being gay, he can't deny the shame and confusion he feels at other urges--the deeply repressed desire to submit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonathan Watkins is a self-made Silicon Valley billionaire whose ex-wife took half his money and even more of his faith. Comfortable as a Dominant but wary of being hurt again, he resorts to anonymous pickups and occasional six-month contracts with subs seeking only a master, not a lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a sizzling back-alley encounter cues Jonathan in to Brandon's deep-seated submissive side, he makes the man an offer: Give me six months of your life, and I'll open your eyes to a whole new world. Brandon doesn't care about that; all he wants is the three million dollars Jonathan's offering so he can buy the construction company he works for. But he soon learns that six months on his knees is no easy feat, and shame and pride may keep him from all he ever wanted-and all he never dreamed he had any right to have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader discretion advised. This title contains heavy kink. While consent is clearly established and frequently reaffirmed, some moments in Power Play push hard against the outer edges of consent.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Mac has never wanted to be out. He's not ashamed of his sexuality--especially after he started hooking up with his teammate, Fritzy. The lies are exhausting, but the risks that come with the truth are enough to convince him to keep his mouth shut. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fritzy already has a reputation as a troublemaker. He's actually good enough to make to the major leagues … if anyone will take him and being out and gay makes that even less likely. So, they have to stay quiet for now. Be hockey players today, be gay later.  Mac has always felt that coming out was a personal decision, but this is clearly a business decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for him the business of hockey means a lot of homophobia passed off casually and thoughtlessly. His teammate aren't bad guys. His coaches aren't bad guys. The reporters, the fans, the scouts and agents--no one wants to be called a bigot, but nobody thinks about the things they say in jest. Just how much longer will Mac have to stick to business? How many more lies will he and Fritzy have to tell just to hold onto their dreams?</description>

  <description>Joel Summer is six foot of pure sex with close-cropped black hair, dark tanned skin, and a smooth, broad chest with just a thin trail of dark hair disappearing under the waistband of his blue shorts. He plays football, baseball, runs track, and still managed to get good enough grades to get into an Ivy League college. He’s everything I want to be. The high school girls gasp and wet their panties every time he so much as smiles in their direction, so what’s he doing looking at me?</description>

  <description>You can’t plan for everything…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what Ellie Glass realizes after she has a chance encounter with a young musician.  Long-haired, a bit scruffy, and undeniably sexy, he’s the exact opposite of her “type,” but now Ellie can’t stop thinking about him.  When fate intervenes and the two are thrown together, Ellie gets more than she bargained for.  Pretty soon she finds herself feeling and doing things that she never thought were possible.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the captivating story of an undeniable attraction, the choices that we make, and ultimately, the unexpected power of love.</description>

  <description>Kenton Palmer finds an injured dog on the road on a rainy night and takes him to the nearest vet clinic only to discover he's actually a wolf. Despite that, he decides to  nurse the injured animal following the necessary surgery. Even better, the handsome vet who treated the wolf offers his own brand of animal attraction and makes it clear he wants to be a big part of Kenton's world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gray Fowler is a werewolf. He's forced to remain in wolf form after Kenton rescues him and takes him home to heal, but that doesn't prevent him from falling hard for Kenton. It starts out as jealousy but Gray soon discovers Kenton's new love, Dr. Will Barclay, is caught up in something sinister. But he must wait until he's healthy before he can shift and enter Kenton's life as a man. How are Will's shady activities linked to the men who ran Gray down, and can he expose the scheme before Kenton gets too involved with Will?</description>

  <description>Duff Randall wouldn't dream of breaking the law, but when conventional medicine fails to improve his father's health, Duff risks arrest by trying to score some weed. He never expected to find his would-be dealer so attractive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an undercover vice cop, Jim "Hick" Hickam can tell the junkies from the desperate. He doesn't know why Duff showed up on his corner, but he's definitely interested to learn more...and to get to know Duff better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes we take chances to help those we love. Duff and Hick put their jobs and reputations on the line...will it pay off or will somebody get hurt?</description>

  <description>Fifth grade English teacher, Kendra Wright, doesn't believe in instant love. In fact, at twenty-nine, she's all but given up hope of ever finding love, period. That is, until she meets the new principal, Valerian Riche. &lt;br&gt; He may be stunning, gentlemanly and honorable, but falling for the man is the last thing on Kendra's agenda. But when Val makes the first move, Kendra's life as the youngest spinster to ever grace the pages of history is turned upside-down. &lt;br&gt; She's longed to be treated like the lady she knows she is, but "technically," is not. But if the truth comes out, it will destroy her career and end the wildest romantic ride she's ever known. &lt;br&gt; Kendra must end the relationship before she's in too deep. Before the truth is revealed. But, how does a lady say no to the charm-charged wiles of a man as determined, and eager, as Val Riche? While she anticipates the horror of breaking the news, he persists on making her decision as difficult as possible. Maybe Val should've checked Kendra's package before he unchecked his heart. &lt;br&gt; Special Content Alert: M/M, Transsexual &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He thought he had nothing left to lose…until he lost his heart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake will be forever grateful to the man who rescued him and brought him to an animal preserve to live. It’s the perfect home for a bander, a type of shifter known to be notoriously taciturn. Now Jake runs the place, and he’s content with the hard truth that he’ll always be alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summer visitors are a necessary evil. And Vaughn Prentiss is exactly the sort of tourist that gets on Jake’s last nerve. A happy-go-lucky, carefree, trust-fund baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaughn can’t fathom why Jake seems to enjoy insulting him for no reason. Yet he’s attracted to the man’s gruff kindness with the preserve’s youthful workers. And it hasn’t escaped his notice that Jake is something special. Something not quite human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Vaughn discovers his financial manager has absconded with the family fortune, Jake acts on impulse to offer him a job, and wonders if he’ll live to regret it. It’s hard enough to keep his shifter nature private, much less keep his paws off his newest employee…a man Jake is coming to admire. If only he could be sure, when danger reveals the truth of what he is, if Vaughn will stay by his side—or run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains a sexy “pretty boy” who’s smarter than he looks and a grouchy shapeshifter who can’t resist strong hands and a wicked tongue. Prepare yourself. This book is anything but tame.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Limericks, lies, and puppy-dog eyes...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jude Biggerstaff is all the way out and loving it - mostly. The Anglo-Japanese university graduate is a carnivore working in a vegan cafe, an amateur poet with only one man in his life. His dog, Bubbles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's "Karate Crumpet", a man who regularly runs past the cafe with a martial arts class. Jude can only yearn from afar, until the object of his affection rescues him from muggers. And he learns that not only does this calm, competent hunk of muscle have a name - David - but that he s gay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jude should have known the universe wouldn't simply let love fall into place. First, David has only one foot out of the closet. Then there's Jude's mother, who lies about her age to the point Jude could be mistaken for jailbait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a maze of stories to keep straight, a potential stepfather in the picture, ex-boyfriends who keep spoiling his dates with David, and a friend with a dangerous secret, Jude is beginning to wonder if his and David's lives will ever start to rhyme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warnings: Contains a tangled web of little white lies, a smorgasbord of cheesy limericks, a violin called Vanessa, some boots that mean business, and the most adorable little dog ever. Poetry, it's not...&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Film student Micah Malone learns the hard way that when life sucks, you can’t just yell, “Cut! Let’s do another take!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His grades are a box-office bomb. His friends create more drama than a soap opera. And his love life needs a laughtrack. While there’s no script to dictate what happens next, can Micah find the direction he needs? Life, after all, is no film school project. But it is great source material. The only source material.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the cameras roll. Micah’s quirky story has begun filming.</description>

  <description>Cain Elliott is a desperate man – on the brink of losing La Terraza, the 1920’s Spanish style courtyard apartment complex his grandmother left him in her will, he’s faced with the option of selling to a real estate developer or losing the building outright, due to the costs of upkeep that have now left him teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. One setback after another has slowly whittled away any hope he’d been harboring to turn the tides. Having time for little else in life, Cain’s guilt over his failure to protect the home of those who reside within the walls of La Terraza has crippled his spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the partnership fast-track at the flashy architectural firm of Hamilton-Bach, Henry Abrams is new in town, a little lonely and looking for inspiration. Tired of games and longing for something real, Henry discovers the road to happiness could lie in the arms of the sad, uncomplicated Cain Elliott. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discovering that Hamilton-Bach represents the mysterious entrepreneur attempting to purchase La Terraza, combined with the self-doubt and mistrust over a love that develops too fast, leave both men struggling to decide whether or not they can truly find…Love in La Terraza.</description>

  <description>Captain Jason Kim is less than thrilled when the mission log for his merchant starship includes ferrying three male Perels back to their home planet after sowing their wild oats across the 'verse. After being burned in his last relationship, he wants nothing to do with the sensual, quill-haired creatures. It's just his luck that Ferran, one of the Perels, takes a distinct liking to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ferran is captivated by Jason's aloof nature, but for one who must return home to domestic obligation and impending marriage, lasting romance seems out of the question. Nevertheless, his charm begins to open Jason up, and the more time they spend together, the more difficult it becomes to say goodbye.</description>

  <description>Can the idyllic simplicity of a garden change a life forever? It's a question three men on a vacation to the small seaside town of Beechwood will find the answer to when they stay at a B&amp;amp;B with an expansive and breathtakingly beautiful garden. A garden with an air of the supernatural. Jerry's there for love, Doug's there for sex, and Tony? Well, Tony is practically dragged along against his will. A comedy of errors ensues as the three men cling stubbornly to their self-destructive ways; can a cook named Anna Magnani, a roller-skating drag queen, and the magic of the garden tame the tempest and prevent love's labors from being lost?</description>

  <description>What happens when you have a reputation as a cad and you hire the perfect man to work in your office? Workplace romance is a recipe for disaster. Surviving the rough patch in the economy, Braxton Todd’s LA PR firm was flourishing. Having one assistant, both of them overwhelmed by work, Braxton hires someone to give them relief from the hectic non-stop phone calls and emails from their demanding clients. And not only was Braxton going out of his mind with too much work, his love life had taken a dive ever since he got the reputation as a hit &amp;amp; run lover, which he was; ‘A one-date-wonder’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roped into a charity event where he is auctioned off for three dinner dates with three different people, Braxton ends up being the prey for a trio of terrible dining companions and can only think of one man. The man he just hired to help him out.&lt;br&gt;And that man, Fabian Rhys, is too good an employee to dare cross the line into a relationship with and risk losing him as a worker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fabian Rhys was sick of temp jobs and when he got the offer from Braxton Todd, the infamous PR man whose reputation was a splattered all over tabloid press, he knew one thing. He could not be attracted to a man with a notorious reputation as a one-hook-up cad. But when Fabian began the job, and could see the press had painted Braxton in a terrible light. The two men began to dance around each other at work, terrified of ruining a good thing.&lt;br&gt;Would either man cross the line and risk losing what they needed financially? Or did the connection have disaster written all over it?&lt;br&gt;When two A-type individuals find working with each other a breeze, what will it take for them to jump the divide into each others’ arms?&lt;br&gt;Maybe it was two simple words. Marry me.</description>

  <description>An ex-soldier and an urban Goth walk into a desert. It sounds like the start of a joke, but for Sam Collins and Daniel Evans, it is the beginning of their story. Daniel walks to shed his drug-filled past and make himself whole. But Sam, who hides the demons of war behind a smile, needs Daniel more than either man knows. An old stockman’s wisdom sends them on their journey together, a long hard road to find Australia’s sacred Red Heart and—perhaps—each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the Under the Southern Cross anthology.</description>

  <description>Chaz is the youngest recruit the Academy has ever seen. Godlike reflexes and hawk eyes make him a natural gunner assigned to fly the futuristic ship with technology so advanced it’s still classified. But it takes a two-man crew and Chaz, the lone wolf, must have a partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On his first day he meets Ferron, the most dangerous man at the Academy. The ice blue eyes and scarred face of the older cadet aren’t enough to scare Chaz. Nor are the rumors that Ferron killed his last partner. But when he finds out they are to be a team, his anxiety starts to mount.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tension climbs to a breaking point when Ferron informs him that in order to fly the Needle he and Chaz must have their bodies pressed together in a dance of sensual intimacy that makes the sexually straight Chaz angry and uncomfortable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ferron must master Chaz completely and break down his physical and emotional boundaries. The only thing that will keep them alive is their partnership—any space between them means certain death.</description>

  <description>Sex for money. That's the simple deal ex-freedom fighter Richard offers when he buys Denny's freedom. But as they get to know one another it becomes something more, until a ghost from Richard's past threatens to tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When ex-freedom fighter Richard buys a slave's freedom, he has a deal to offer. Being more inexperienced than he appears, he needs someone to teach him a few things. Sex for money and help is what he's proposing. Denny can always say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denny agrees, and as they settle into their new life, they learn things about themselves and each other, as well as the nature of freedom and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when are things ever that easy? Their world is suddenly shattered by a ghost from Richard's past. That's when Denny takes control, shows what he's made of and fulfills a need Richard didn't even know he had. It turns out neither are what they appear to be.</description>

  <description>“Give me a reason to let you live…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beached after losing his ship and crew, and with England finally at peace, Lt Christopher Penrose will take whatever work he can get. A valet? Why not? Escorting an elderly diplomat to the Leeward Islands seems like an easy job, but when their ship is boarded by pirates, Kit’s world is turned upside down. Forced aboard the pirate ship, Kit finds himself juggling his honor with his desire to stay alive among the crew, not to mention the alarming—yet enticing—captain, known as La Griffe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kit has always obeyed the rules, but as the pirates plunder their way across the Caribbean, he finds much to admire in their freedom. He deplores their lawlessness but is drawn to their way of life, and begins to think he might just have found a purpose. Dare he dream of finding love too? Or would loving a pirate take him too far down the road to ruin?</description>

  <description>Southpointe High is the last place Lucy wanted to wind up her senior year of school. Right up until she stumbles into Jude Ryder, a guy whose name has become its own verb, and synonymous with trouble. He's got a rap sheet that runs longer than a senior thesis, has had his name sighed, shouted, and cursed by more women than Lucy dares to ask, and lives at the local boys home where disturbed seems to be the status quo for the residents. Lucy had a stable at best, quirky at worst, upbringing. She lives for wearing the satin down on her ballet shoes, has her sights set on Juilliard, and has been careful to keep trouble out of her life. Up until now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jude's everything she needs to stay away from if she wants to separate her past from her future. Staying away, she's about to find out, is the only thing she's incapable of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Lucy Larson and Jude Ryder, love's about to become the thing that tears them apart.</description>

  <description>I can’t describe what it’s like to want to scream every minute of every day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years after a terrifying night of pain destroyed his normal teenage existence, Aaron Downing still clings to the hope that one day, he will be a fully functional human being. But his life remains a constant string of nightmares, flashbacks, and fear. When, in his very first semester of college, he’s assigned Spencer Thomas as a partner for his programming project, Aaron decides that maybe “normal” is overrated. If he could just learn to control his fear, that could be enough for him to find his footing again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his parents’ talk of institutionalizing him—of sacrificing him for the sake of his brothers’ stability—Aaron becomes desperate to find a way to cope with his psychological damage or even fake normalcy. Can his new shrink control his own demons long enough to treat Aaron, or will he only deepen the damage? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to understand his attraction for Spencer, Aaron holds on to his sanity with both hands as it threatens to spin out of control.</description>

  <description>Soon-to-be medical student Brett Derwent thinks he has everything all planned out. That is, until he meets Tommy Hawks. Over the course of one incredible summer in Northern Montana, this easy-going, kind-hearted guy turns Brett's life upside down...but Tommy isn't everything he seems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brutalized by his violent father, desperate to protect his mother and four siblings, and terrified of losing the love he never expected to find, Tommy is pushed to the edge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Tommy's father is found dead, Brett must face some impossible questions: how much is he willing to sacrifice for Tommy, and will having faith in him be enough?&lt;br&gt;violence, disturbing themes, sexual content)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title is no longer available from Freya's Bower.

  <description>Eden Anfield loves puzzles, so when mysterious new boy Ryan Westland shows up at her school she's hooked. On the face of it, he's a typical American teenager. So why doesn't he recognise pizza? And how come he hasn't heard of Hitler? What puzzles Eden the most, however, is the interest he's taking in her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Eden starts to fall in love with Ryan, she begins to unravel his secret. Her breakthrough comes one rainy afternoon when she stumbles across a book in Ryan's bedroom - a biography of her best friend - written over fifty years in the future. Confronting Ryan, she discovers that he is there with one unbelievably important purpose ... and she might just have destroyed his only chance of success.</description>

  <description>October "Toby" Daye, a changeling who is half human and half fae, has been an outsider from birth. After getting burned by both sides of her heritage, Toby has denied the Faerie world, retreating to a "normal" life. Unfortunately for her, the Faerie world has other ideas... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The murder of Countess Evening Winterrose pulls Toby back into the fae world. Unable to resist Evening's dying curse, which binds her to investigate, Toby must resume her former position as knight errant and renew old alliances. As she steps back into fae society, dealing with a cast of characters not entirely good or evil, she realizes that more than her own life will be forfeited if she cannot find Evening's killer.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note: Alternative cover edition of B00A73HYV8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Severine Blake has seen far too many friends taken down in the crossfires of dating. She devises a precise course of action to protect her heart. The plan is working very well...until she meets Thayer and Macsen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Sloan brothers come into her life, nothing is the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thayer is self-possessed, arrogant and used to getting what he wants. Being near him leaves Severine unsteady and shaken. He makes her question everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Macsen contradicts his brother in every way. His calm personality captivates her. Severine is drawn to him instantly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Severine quickly discovers that when you want something, that want can turn wicked. Giving in is not always easy, especially when your heart refuses to give up the fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What little illusion of love Severine has is soon destroyed. Every option is broken, and the protection she has built around her heart instantly crumbles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's just no right way with the Sloan brothers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Adult&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>After a hard life filled with experiences he’d rather not remember but can’t forget, Brett Taylor decides he doesn’t need anyone or anything. He gets a job at a bar in a nothing little town where he can fish and race dirt bikes and hide from the world. So naturally as he’s walking across the parking lot at his new job, reminding himself how self-reliant he is, he meets someone he can’t shove aside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brett can’t help but admire Cory Butana, the kid who lives above the bar where his father is the principal bartender. Unwanted by either parent, the sweet, personable Cory grew up neglected and hungry for affection. Now he’s determined to make something of his life, even if he has to work himself ragged to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cory shouldn’t have to suffer like Brett did, and Brett wants to lend a hand. But when their relationship evolves into something Brett isn’t ready to need, he reacts… and the consequences may destroy their fledgling future. With scars like theirs, forgiveness is never easy.</description>

  <description>Elizabethan actor Sebastian Hewel takes his bow at the proscenium only to embark on the role of a lifetime. When his twin sister, Bronwyn, reneges on the arrangement to marry Earl Anthony Crofton, Sebastian reluctantly takes her place. At nineteen, Sebastian knows his days as a leading lady are numbered, but with this last performance, he hopes to restore his family’s name and pay off his late father’s debts. Never mind the danger of losing his head should he be discovered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He didn’t expect Anthony to be so charming and alluring—not to mention shrewd. While he applauds Sebastian’s plan, Anthony offers a mutually beneficial arrangement instead. Sebastian will need every drop of talent he has to survive with both his head and his heart intact, because this is the best part he’s ever had.</description>

  <description>Holidays are for lovers, just apparently not Ben Haggerty. Not this holiday. After his degree-seeking lover leaves humble blue-collar Ben, Ben spends the Yuletide miserable. He's not accustomed to being alone, not after seven years. Eventually Ben finds his lover's new address and sends him a greeting card asking when he'll come back home—only to learn in the returned correspondence that his card reached the wrong address and another man, Jason Prescott, by mistake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason is touched by Ben's appeal to his lover, and he and Ben spend months growing close as pen pals. Frequently exchanged correspondence turns into weekends spent together, but after learning Jason's working on his second master's degree and is even smarter than Ben's ex, Ben wonders if Jason will be able to love someone as ordinary as he is.</description>

  <description>Sequel to No Quarter&lt;br&gt;Archangel Chronicles: Book 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventy years after it began, the war between angels and demons is over. Archangels Gabriel and Michael reunite at last, but a dangerous new challenge stands in the way of their happiness: someone is kidnapping angels and selling them as trophies on the black market. When Raphael, Archangel of Healing, goes missing, his tearful lover joins with the Brotherhood of Archangels and their lieutenants to rescue him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without Raphael’s healing touch, disease spreads quickly through the world’s human population. The situation only worsens when the angel Agrat is kidnapped: the number of sex crimes begins to rise and her husband, Gabriel’s lieutenant, loses himself to his grief. As they mount a rescue mission, Gabriel and Michael’s relationship will be put to the test. With the threat of the world dying around them and tragedy looming overhead, can Gabriel and Michael keep love and hope alive?</description>

  <description>Fulfilling a duty could be so much fun…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shayonn has been special his entire life. He is the future king of Atraya, a country filled with tiger shifters like him, but there is more to him. He is one of the few white tigers left and destined to save his rare breed from extinction. Finding the one female in a million that will allow him to fulfil his duty would be great—too bad that Shayonn prefers to share his bed with men. &lt;br&gt;Faolan is a lone wolf in many ways. Alienated from his own kind because of his low pedigree, he leads a life at the border of his species, roaming the country and taking jobs where he can get them. Working as a guard for the tiger shifter community, he knows exactly what he has to do when he meets a stray one. &lt;br&gt;Tarina has never been special. She’s just an ordinary woman, who enjoys her pleasures when she can get them. She also happens to be a shifter, but she’s just another plain brown tigress among many others—until one day, a gorgeous white male singles her out as the future mother of his babies. &lt;br&gt;When those three get together in different pairings, their mutual attraction is immense, but there is that issue of finding the right mate for every one of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader advisory: This book contains sexually explicit scenes (MF and MM, including spanking and bondage) and is only suitable for adult readers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/283334" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.smashwords.com/books/view...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Evie and Leo met in foster care as children and formed a bond of friendship. As they grew, their bond turned to love, and they vowed to make a life together when they turned 18 and were no longer a part of the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Leo unexpectedly gets adopted as a teen and he moves to another city, he promises Evie that he will contact her as soon as he gets there and come back for her in a few short years. She never hears from him again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now eight years later, in spite of the odds, Evie has made a life for herself. She has a job. She has friends. She's content. Then a man shows up out of the blue, claiming that her long lost love, Leo, sent him to check up on her. The attraction between them is undeniable. But, should she trust this sexy stranger? Or is he keeping a secret about what his connection to Leo is really all about and why Leo disappeared all those years ago?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Music. Sex. Fame. What's missing? Surely not the "L" word...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adder has a plan for his life: play his music for millions of adoring fans, who will reward him with money, fame and as much sex as he can handle. It's a goal he's been working toward since his teens and is on the cusp of achieving. The idea of a relationship never entered his mind--until a new drummer joins his band. One taste of Kalil, and all he wants is more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Kalil, playing drums for Adder is a dream come true, the creative connection he's always wanted. What he never reckoned on is the deeper connection he finds with Adder. Kalil would rather avoid sexual involvement with a bandmate, but Adder seems just as determined to break through his resistance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attraction aside, music and sex are about the only things the hedonistic Adder and the increasingly jealous Kalil can agree on. Still, before they know it they're on the brink of something deeper, something lasting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it scares the hell out of both of them.</description>

  <description>YA M/M short story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone dies, how are you supposed to behave? Josh Roberts has no idea. Losing his dad has left him deeply confused. He loved his dad, so why isn't he crying? All Josh can think about is spending time with his boyfriend, Bradley. He can't wait to go to Uni, when he and Bradley will finally get to be alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bradley wants nothing more than to give love and support to his grieving boyfriend. But Josh's expectations of a life together next year are putting a lot of pressure on him. He's not going to get good enough grades for Uni, especially if whenever they are in Josh's room they don't get round to any real studying. Why can't Josh understand that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jms-books.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;amp;cPath=46&amp;amp;products_id=748&amp;amp;zenid=miu2okj2t0v8pahn8n5m14om01" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.jms-books.com/index.php?ma...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A lyrical novel about family and friendship from critically acclaimed author Benjamin Alire Sáenz.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When the two meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special friendship—the kind that changes lives and lasts a lifetime. And it is through this friendship that Ari and Dante will learn the most important truths about themselves and the kind of people they want to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sometimes family chooses you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does a man get to be forty without knowing whether he’s gay? That’s a question Vince Fierro is almost afraid to answer. If he is gay, it’ll be a problem for his big, fat Italian family. Still, after three failed marriages, he can’t help but wonder if he’s been playing for the wrong team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s only one way to settle it, once and for all—head for Chicago’s Boystown bars, far from anyone who knows him. Naturally, he runs smack into someone from the neighborhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between working two jobs, going to school, taking care of his grandmother, and dealing with his mother’s ongoing substance abuse, Trey Giles has little time for fun, let alone dating someone who swears he’s straight. Yet after one night of dancing cheek-to-cheek to the sultry strains of Coltrane, Trey finds himself wanting to help Vinnie figure things out—no promises, and no sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like a simple plan, until their “no-sex” night turns into the best date of their lives and forges a connection that complicates everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This book deals with alcoholism, broken promises, and overbearing little sisters.</description>

  <description>If you survive...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ellis Winston is left for dead, he knows his life will never be the same. The public face of the largest fashion house in North America, Ellis has fallen out of favor with the powers that be, the advertising agents who are seeking a much younger man to take Ellis’ place in the spotlight. Ellis never dreamed he’d be washed up at the tender age of twenty six.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you rebuild...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Rowe has given up on trying to force relationships. While he longs for someone to share his life with, Jake’s content growing his private therapy practice and helping his dad keep the family recycling business in the black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is it worth the risk…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a chance trip to the wrong side of town on a frigid Chicago morning brings Ellis and Jake together, there’s a moment when Jake actually believes fate might just be on his side. But two white lies, one favor and an empty hospital bed later, Jake realizes he’s the one that’s been left this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And honestly, that really sucks because no-one deserves to be thrown away.</description>

  <description>I wasn't always in love with Colton Calloway; I was in love with his younger brother, Kyle, first. Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go.</description>

  <description>As coxswain of a Cambridge college rowing team, pint-sized Dave Tanaka has eight strapping athletes hanging on his every word, their strength at his command. Leading his crew to win their oars might be easier if Dave didn’t have to hide his crush on Archie, the stroke rower – but as they prepare for their final race, Dave doesn’t suspect that Archie is in the same boat as him in more ways than one!</description>

  <description>A wander down a country pathway, a cruise vacation in the Mediterranean, a school reunion, a sandwich eaten in the park - in the stories of Stevie Carroll, the mundane becomes tantalizingly magical. A footballer’s mistress gets more than just an apartment when her lover tries to keep her in style; a rock-and-roll bass player finds out that second chances aren’t all they’re cracked up to be; something sinister lurks beneath the trappings of a travelling carnival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richly peopled with characters you might meet in the shop around the corner, yet haunted by glimpses of something entirely otherworldly, A Series of Ordinary Adventures will transport you from the streets and lanes of England to a place where imagination is only the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magical realism mixes with subtle horror and heartfelt romance in a collection of stories that will captivate and transform you long after the final page.</description>

  <description>When Katrina “Kat” Vallia, an idealistic if somewhat naive 20-something American pediatrician travels halfway across the globe to volunteer in a poor African village, she looks at it as a means of closure. Following a bitter breakup with her unfaithful boyfriend, she decides to throw herself into her work without any distractions from a man. That’s until she encounters Dr. Julian Kiron, a handsome, career driven pediatric oncologist. Even though she tries to fight it, Kat finds herself falling deeply for him; until she painfully realizes that they both want totally different things from life. Not willing to compromise for the other, they sadly say goodbye, cutting all ties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years later, Kat’s happy world is turned upside down when she is given devastating news. She must now confront her past and the secret she’s harbored for years. But will saving the one she loves most also rekindle the love she let slip away?</description>

  <description>It could be worse for Sylva Lark. She could be dead. A coma was nothing to that. Or her family moving across country for the treatment, leaving her with a big blue mark on her back.&lt;br&gt;She can handle it. &lt;br&gt;Mostly. &lt;br&gt;Except the mark glows and tingles, especially whenever transition helper Atticus Plot (Attic) is close by. She suspects he’s hiding something, and when she stumbles across a torn body bearing the same spiral marking as her own, that suspicion is confirmed. &lt;br&gt;After a few shaves with death, the truth finally comes out and the battles begin. &lt;br&gt;But not all her fights are external; her biggest one is the decision she has to make between doing the right thing for the world and giving up her beloved family for good.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Caleb Mackenzie doesn't put up a fight when his father announces the family is moving to Stapeton, Nova Scotia. In fact, Caleb looks forward to a fresh start in the scenic little area. Their new home, Wakefield House, sports large rooms, a big barn where Caleb can work on cars, and acres of forested land for privacy. But it also has a troubling past. In 1943, a boy who lived in the home vanished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb hears the stories about what may have occurred so many years ago, but he passes them off as folklore until one day he's alone in the woods and hears the faintest whisper. Did someone in the distance just call his name? And what about his discovery in the hayloft? Could there be something to those old stories after all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The initial need to dismiss everything as coincidence becomes a soul-searching journey into the past where Caleb is determined to uncover the truth about what really happened to the missing boy. And in the process, he learns even more about himself and what's really important.</description>

  <description>It’s 1991, and Dan Calzolaio has just moved to Florida with his lover, Mark, having fled Chicago and Mark’s addictions to begin a new life on the Gulf Coast. Volunteering for the Tampa AIDS Alliance is just one part of that new beginning, and that’s how Dan meets his new buddy, Adam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam Schmidt is not at all what Dan expected. The guy is an original—witty, wry, and sarcastic with a fondness for a smart black dress, Barbra Streisand, and a good mai tai. Adam doesn’t let his imminent death get him down, even through a downward spiral that sees him thrown in jail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each step of Adam’s journey teaches Dan new lessons about strength and resilience, but it’s Adam’s lover, Sullivan, to whom Dan feels an almost irresistible pull. Dan knows the attraction isn’t right, even after he dumps his cheating, drug-abusing boyfriend. But then Adam passes away, and it leaves Sullivan and Dan both alone to see if they can turn their love for Adam into something whole and real for each other.</description>

  <description>In a war that shook the earth, the Six gods of Nendor defeated their brother Neldin, god of evil. For the three thousand years since, Nendor and the Seven Kingdoms have known peace and prosperity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then a new wizard unleashes the power of Neldin. Meglar, wizard king of Zargon, uses dark magic to create an army of creatures to carry out his master's will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One by one, the sovereign realms fall. Soon the only wizard who can stop Meglar is Grand Master Farrell, the Prince of Haven, the hidden home of refugees. An untried wizard, Farrell carries a secret that could hold the key to defeating Meglar—or it could destroy the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While helping Nerti, queen of the unicorns, Farrell saves Miceral, an immortal muchari warrior the Six have chosen to be Farrell's mate. But Farrell approaches love with caution, and before he can decide how to proceed, Meglar invades a neighboring kingdom. Farrell and Miceral find themselves in the middle of the battle. Farrell pushes himself to the limit as he and Miceral fight not only to stop Meglar but for their very survival.</description>

      <![CDATA[Okay, no rating of this book for me because I couldn't get all of the way through it.<br /><br />I really liked Andrew Gordon's writing in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15760970.Un_masked" title="Un masked by Anyta Sunday">Un masked</a> so even though epic fantasy <em>so</em> isn't my thing, I decided to give it a shot.

  <description>Bailey Gray is tired of her perfectly planned life. Everything about her life has been organized and lived out to the expectations set of her parents. She is the class valedictorian, has perfect grades, the perfect friends, a perfect boyfriend, basically perfect life...or so everyone thought. That's when she realizes the path planned isn't always the path chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On graduation day she makes a decision. One that changes everything she thought she knew about her intended future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a whim, she runs away with the town rebel, Dylan Wade, in search of the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Wade isn't looking to run away from anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows what he wants as he's been waiting on it for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a journey to find the unknown, they discover a friendship they once knew along the open highway and have not a care in the world. Between the yellow and white lines of the heated summer asphalt, a spark draws them together as Dylan's past and Bailey future try to rip them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could it be that Dylan and his GTO are exactly what her perfectly planned life needs?</description>

  <description>When Flip McCabe spots an unusual ad in a magazine requesting a young man or woman to train in the fine art of tea service, he's pleasantly surprised to learn that it's still available. He needs this job—any job—desperately, but his new boss, Mr. Chen, will mysteriously tell him only to report for duty at Platform Thirteen at LA's Union Station at nine o'clock the following morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arriving in plenty of time, Flip becomes panic-stricken when he can't find any such platform, nor is there a tea shop listed at the bustling railway station. Frantic to get to work, he stumbles across an old line on an outdoor platform and is catapulted in another era of the station somewhere else in time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The elegant, old-worldly Mr. Chen dispenses tea and serious help for those who need it, but his frail body is no longer up to the dangerous escapades involved with murder, mayhem and steam trains. Flip is sent back to the past to help various famous, often wrongfully convicted criminals, and then plunged back to the present to find a man who needs not only his help, but his love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But will Flip be able to aid the dynamic, exhilarating Balthazar Starblitz, a werewolf on the run from charges related to a series of grisly murders he did not commit?</description>

  <description>What if a ‘Once in a Lifetime’ could happen twice? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suffering from a past full of tragedy, Dahlia London's soul has been left completely shattered. Happily ever after is a far cry from reality in her world. But, when she is reconnected with her past, the bonds that form are irrefutable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When River Wilde, lead singer of The Wilde Ones, comes back into Dahlia’s life, the intensity that fires their relationship combined with underlying feelings that have never died lead her to believe she has met her soulmate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling with confusion as old connections fade and new ones begin, Dahlia's grief begins to lift--but guilt remains. River wants to be the one to mend all that is torn within her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with a past that is never really gone, can their future survive?</description>

  <description>Derek Rory never meant to propose to his best friend's little sister. But when her boss tells a family-oriented investor he's Stephanie's fiancé, Derek can either play along or let her get fired. He's hardly one to turn away from a damsel in distress. If only that damsel wasn't adorable and sexy with a laugh that could melt any cold business mogul’s heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a business proposal becomes a marriage proposal, Stephanie Miller tries to keep it strictly boardroom. But when things get hot under the table, it's all they can do to stay apart. As the tangle of lies drags them deeper into the underhanded world of business politics, Stephanie finds herself in over her head—not just with her job, but with her "fiancé." His eyes are cold, but his kisses light her on fire. If she's not careful, she'll end up faking her way into a real romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Seattle Stories novel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly a year after being rejected for another man, Seattle paramedic Peter Morse is still pining, so when the one that got away asks him for a favor, he agrees. His mission: track down Sean Reid, the runaway brother of a mutual friend. Peter isn’t thrilled about it—until he finds Sean injured by the side of the road. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything about Sean stirs Peter’s protective instincts—saving people is what he lives for—but he never anticipated falling for someone so hell-bent on running away. On top of his physical wounds, Sean struggles with grief and guilt, and the mess his estranged father left when he died threatens to overwhelm him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saving Sean means Peter must let go of his pride and turn to friends and family. Asking for help is a bitter pill for Peter to swallow, but if he can’t, how can he expect Sean to accept his help—and his love—in turn?</description>

  <description>Seattle Stories: Book Three&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;House-sitting for a friend is supposed to be a lucky break for Aiden Daly. Discovering his new housemate is the image of his first crush turns it into a nightmare. Marco de Luca is obviously interested in being more than housemates, but his resemblance to Aiden’s ideal man seems only skin-deep. Besides, Aiden doesn’t date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since his adoptive father’s suicide, Aiden’s first priority has been supporting his remaining family—and shielding them from the truth of their financial situation. Deeply concerned for his mother's mental health, Aiden remains closeted and lonely, convinced that bad luck is the only luck he'll ever have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if the pressure of keeping his father’s financial secrets weren’t enough to handle, Aiden’s birth father makes contact, sending Aiden’s anxieties spiraling out of control. But it’s a crisis at work that finally brings Aiden to his breaking point. Accepting support from Marco is a gamble, but it could be just what Aiden needs to turn his luck around.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Based on the wildly popular Twitter feed Dear Girls Above Me, a roman à clef about how thinking like a couple of girls turned one single guy into a better man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When Charlie McDowell began sharing his open letters to his noisy upstairs neighbors—two impossibly ditzy female roommates in their mid-twenties—on Twitter, his feed quickly went viral. His followers multiplied and he got the attention of everyone from celebrities to production studios to major media outlets such as&lt;em&gt; Time&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Glamour&lt;/em&gt;.  Now &lt;em&gt;Dear Girls &lt;/em&gt;breaks out of the 140-character limit as Charlie imagines what would happen if he put the wisdom of the girls to the test. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;After being unceremoniously dumped by the girl he was certain was “the one,” Charlie realized his neighbors’ conversations were not only amusing, but also offered him access to a completely uncensored woman’s perspective on the world. From the importance of effectively Facebook-stalking potential girlfriends and effortlessly pulling off pastel, to learning when in the early stages of dating is too presumptuous to bring a condom and how to turn food poisoning into a dieting advantage, the girls get Charlie into trouble, but they also get him out of it—without ever having a clue of their impact on him.</description>

  <description>Dr. Erik Daniels hasn't had it easy. He lost love and fought addiction to get where he is, one of the best substance abuse counselors people with no money and no insurance can get. Not the dream life he had in San Francisco, but at least he has something to call his own. Everything seems to be on the right track until Angel, a heroine addicted male prostitute, and the kid's lover happen to cross his path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erik not only sees a lot of himself in Angel, but he also sees a lot of potential in the kid and he quickly realizes he's willing to sacrifice a lot to get him on the right path, even his own love life.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Trouble comes in deceptive packages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still recovering from an accident that left him emotionally and physically battered, Jon's goal is to lead a simple life, free of complications and attachments. His new roommate—a happy-go-lucky bookworm—seems to fit into his plans fine at first. He doesn't find out till later that Leander's also a psychic, specializing in finding lost pets. Jon's a skeptic when it comes to the supernatural, so he's convinced Leander's a nut job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jon's beliefs are challenged when Leander has to track down a missing teenager and he ropes Jon into assisting him. Soon the two of them are knee-deep in a decades-old murder case. The hills and valleys of the City of Angels hold many buried secrets, and Leander has a knack for finding them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jon's hopes for a trouble-free life go out the window as he's drawn deeper into Leander's psychic sleuthing. Digging into the past poses many dangers, but the biggest risk Jon faces is putting his bruised heart on the line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Men loving men, skeletons, and an unlucky Chihuahua.</description>

  <description>Dating is hard enough. Throw in an incontinent Chihuahua, an unrequited love affair, a severe case of social anxiety disorder, a dying father, and a man-eating hog and it becomes darned near impossible. Still, it takes two to tango—and when Tom Morgan, a mild-mannered assistant bank manager with a debilitating case of shyness, meets Frank Wells, who is straight off the farm and even shyer than he is, sparks start flying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Tom and Frank’s burgeoning love affair is rolling along nicely, Frank must return to Indiana to oversee the farm while his father battles cancer. Tom tags along to help Frank out and finds himself slopping hogs and milking cows and wondering what the hell happened to his orderly citified existence. And what’s with all the chickens? Tom &lt;em&gt;hates&lt;/em&gt; chickens!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Frank’s help, Tom grits his teeth and muddles through. Funny what a couple of guys can accomplish when they’re crazy about each other. Not even nine hundred chickens can stand in the way of true love.</description>

  <description>Daren Boothe's most significant secret centers on an unlikely object: a xylophone. That secret led him to develop his professional alter-ego, a sensual, androgynous dancer. When Dare begins his second (and considerably more wholesome) job playing clarinet in a polka band, he meets a young man who takes his grandmother out dancing. But Dare knows the man has his own secret. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah Day immediately recognizes the clarinetist. Three years earlier they crossed paths in a therapist's office, but they both abandoned that route to mental health. Neither was ready then to open up about the psychological traumas that haunted them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to heal their wounds, Dare and Jonah turn to each other. Understanding and empathy come instantly, accompanied by ambivalence about their growing attraction. But the repercussions of victimization are many. Soon, the very experiences Dare and Jonah share threaten to drive them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A cop and a recovering addict – no chance for romance there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Vince, a street-hardened narcotics officer, is having to reassess his life. Six months ago, he hit rock-bottom. A bullet brought him down, and his beloved partner Jack betrayed him. Badly disabled and in constant pain, Vince is flying a desk these days, and it doesn't suit him at all. His world is looking grim when he meets Rowan Clyde, sole surviving witness to a vicious drugs-related killing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowan doesn't want to talk. He's vulnerable, trying to hold his own life together in the wake of a crippling addiction. Vince should have no time for him, and Rowan certainly shouldn't trust a cop with an agenda to get him onto the witness stand at any cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet despite their differences, there's an instant pull of attraction between these two damaged men. Their new bond is put to the ultimate test on the tough streets of Newcastle during a dark northern winter, as each turns out to hold the keys to the other's survival – and to his destruction.</description>

  <description>Andrew’s life is a cliché: he’s a gay man trapped in a loveless marriage, thanks to his religious, overbearing mother. Then a new couple moves in down the street, and Andrew finds himself falling for Nathan in a big way. Nathan is straight, married, and just about to be a father, but after one fateful night out together at a club, Nathan has to face the fact that his feelings for Andrew go way beyond that of a friend and neighbor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Andrew’s wife asks for a divorce, both men’s lives are thrown into disarray. Arguments about their responsibilities to their wives and children, doubting themselves and each other, and some harrowing lies pull them apart… but they never leave each other’s thoughts.</description>

  <description>In a world where everyone has their place, Amaranth &amp;amp; Ash belong together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amaranth is a vasai, born with both male and female characteristics, and a soul that can reach out and touch the souls of others in order to heal them. But a vasai’s services are only for the Elai, and they demand sexual satisfaction as well as healing from their beautiful servants. Frustrated with these constraints, Amaranth wants to use his talent to help those who really need it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ash is a chel. Considered devoid of souls, chel are the lowest of the low. Not content with his lot, Ash steals from the middle class pel. One night he’s caught and brutally punished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A soul in agony calls out to Amaranth from across the city. When he discovers that it belongs to a chel, it only confirms his worst suspicions about the lies of the Elai. Amaranth takes Ash home and heals him, an act of rebellion that could cost both their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amaranth's compassion for Ash soon turns to passion. Ash treats him like a person, not an instrument of sexual gratification. Neither of them have much experience with mutual pleasure but together they embark on an exploration of intimacy and desire that carries them to the heights of passion and love -- and shakes the very foundation of their world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations some readers may find objectionable: Intersex relationships, violence.</description>

  <description>When Roman politician Caelius inherits a stable of gladiators, there is one who captures his attention above the others...one whose eyes gleam with hate, pride and desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced into slavery by Roman greed, Gaidres can barely conceal his contempt toward his new Dominus. Gaidres has a plan: kill Caelius and end the lineage of the Roman family that enslaved him. For his plan to succeed, he must make a show of respect and obedience--even when called on to service his master's desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaidres is shocked to learn that in the confines of his quarters, Caelius doesn't want to dominate his slave, but to be taken by him. The sex is explosive as they break society's taboos and, to Gaidres's dismay, they form a tenuous relationship. Even when Caelius learns of Gaidres's plans for revenge, he knows he can't live without his perfect lover. Is he willing to risk it all to tame his gladiator's heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;88,000 words</description>

  <description>As a bisexual bastard born to a country stuck in antiquated mores and ideals, Charles Perry had learned long ago to set his sights low: all he wants is a drink, a dram, and a whore of each gender to share them with. But strange visions haunt his dreams, and now the ghosts are following him into his waking hours. Charles must seek help from an alchemist or risk running mad. Charles’s House blood makes him a high prize in magical circles, so he’ll have to be careful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what the alchemist discovers in Charles's blood turns the whole world on its head. And in the arms of an exotic male pleasure slave, Charles will discover a destiny so huge it doesn't seem possible, but it's true. Charles Perry, noble bastard, is the lost consort of the Goddess of All Creation. And as the forces of darkness converge on him, Charles must learn to channel his power to save the world—or risk becoming the pawn that destroys it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices, violence (rape of hero by villain).&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It happened like this. I was stolen from an airport. Taken from everything I knew, everything I was used to. Taken to sand and heat, dirt and danger. And he expected me to love him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A letter from nowhere. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen year old Gemma is kidnapped from Bangkok airport and taken to the Australian Outback. This wild and desolate landscape becomes almost a character in the book, so vividly is it described. Ty, her captor, is no stereotype. He is young, fit and completely gorgeous. This new life in the wilderness has been years in the planning. He loves only her, wants only her. Under the hot glare of the Australian sun, cut off from the world outside, can the force of his love make Gemma love him back? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story takes the form of a letter, written by Gemma to Ty, reflecting on those strange and disturbing months in the outback. Months when the lines between love and obsession, and love and dependency, blur until they don't exist - almost.</description>

  <description>Vinter is not your typical businessman. Tattoos, piercings and not a suit and tie in sight. One-third owner of a bar and a tattoo parlor along with being a bassist in a band, Vinter comes and goes as he pleases. He likes his beer cold, his music hard and his women scorching hot. Until he’s knocked off his game by a suburban doll he can’t stop wanting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elise needs a change. In men. The buttoned-up businessmen she’s been dating leave a lot to be desired—in romance, in respect and most definitely in sex. A recent text message from her now ex-lover drives Elise into a popular bar on the outside of town, where she meets one of its owners. He’s just the kind of man she’s never had and definitely the kind she’s always fantasized about. Big, bad and oh so naughty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unexpected tenderness. Unimaginable lust. Being dumped has never felt so damn good.</description>

  <description>Brian Ames has never been lucky in love. Getting a guy has never been a problem; keeping one after they meet his mother and sisters, all witches with magical abilities, is another matter entirely. After a disastrous family dinner, Brian goes home dumped again, only to find a homeless cat outside his home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an accident involving too much beer, an old spell book, and some blessed Elderflower, Brian wakes up the next morning to Tom, his now very human, and very tempting, familiar. Will Brian keep his new lover? Or will he lose another love to circumstances he can’t control?</description>

  <description>Owen Sage is the emblematic college freshman at Easton Falls University. He studies hard, plays hard, and is incredibly charming. With all the worries about his first year in college, he was not prepared for what would happen next. His way of life was flipped upside down when he was drawn into a different world, a world unbeknownst to him. He mysteriously crossed into another dimension, into the beautiful land of Everville. His tragic excitement was abruptly halted when he discovered that there was a darkness forged against both the natural world, which he knew well, and the new land which he discovered, Everville. He must devise a plan to save both worlds while joining forces with the race of Fron and The Keepers, whom both harbor hidden secrets he must learn in order to gain power over the evil that dwells in The Other In Between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a race against time to save both worlds, his short time at Easton Falls did not quite prepare him for the evil, dark forces he must fight in order to conquer The Other In Between.</description>

  <description>In 1915, starstruck Jack Abadie strikes out for the gilded streets of the most sinful town in the country—Hollywood. With him, he takes a secret that his country hometown would never understand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of hard work and a chance invitation to a gay gentlemen's club, Jack is discovered. Soon, his talent, matinee idol good looks, and affable personality propel him to the height of stardom. But fame breeds distrust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meeting Wyatt Maitland turns Jack’s life upside down. He wants to be worthy of his good fortune, but old demons haunt him. Only through Wyatt's strength can Jack face that which keeps him from being the man he wants to be. Love without trust is empty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the 1920s roar, scandals rock the movie industry. Public tolerance of Hollywood's decadence has reached its limit. Under pressure to clean up its act, Jack’s studio issues an ultimatum. Either forsake the man he loves and remain a box office darling, or follow his heart and let his shining star fade to tarnished gold.</description>

  <description>After being betrayed and abused by an ex-lover, Sean trusts no one--but he can't help wishing he could trust gentle-hearted tattoo artist Riordan. When these two vulnerable men, scarred inside and out, find each other, neither is willing or able to walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both starved for touch and lonely in his self-imposed exile, Sean can't help wanting Riordan both body and soul and in his bed, and Riordan is captivated by the sweet nature and the beauty he can still see beneath Sean's scars. Yet despite his hunger for affection, Sean can't break free of a cycle of shame and despair, not even as Riordan's falling in love with his beautiful disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Sean be able to break through the barriers he's built around himself and let Riordan in--and will Riordan find the key to unlock Sean's frozen heart?</description>

  <description>Jonah Fairchild is a 17-year-old high school senior who feels all alone in the world. His parents died when he was seven, his sister lives in New Orleans and his brother has been missing since he ran away from juvenile detention. Being gay only exacerbates his isolation; he's afraid to get close to any of the guys he meets—and as for love, well that’s totally out of the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his grandmother dies, he inherits Chimneys—a long abandoned mansion on the Gold Coast of Long Island. Besides being haunted by ghosts and other denizens, the mansion is in danger of foreclosure due to substantial unpaid taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are the ghosts that inhabit Chimneys and what do they want? Can he come up with the money to save the mansion before an unscrupulous real estate developer takes the estate away from him? Will he reconnect with his siblings or ever overcome his aversion to finding true love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answers to these questions and other mysterious riddles lie on the pages within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note from Amazon (unknown if still valid): 10% of the publisher’s proceeds from Chimneys is gifted back to the queer community via LGBTQ and ally scholarships!</description>

  <description>EYE OF SILVER, EYES OF GOLD is a story of romance and family conflicts set in Colorado in 1885.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne Wells has embarrassed her rigidly proper family since she was a child with occasional but grievous lapses from ladylike behavior. They blame those lapses for the disgraceful fact that she is a spinster at 28.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cord Bennett, the son of his father's second marriage to a Cheyenne  woman, is more than an embarrassment to his well-to-do family of ranchers and lawyers - they are ashamed and afraid of their black sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Anne and Cord are found alone together, her father's fury leads to violence. Cord's family accepts that the fault is his. Can Anne and Cord use the freedom of being condemned for sins they didn't commit to make a life together? Or will their disapproving, interfering families tear them apart?</description>

  <description>At sunrise, the dead began to walk the earth. &lt;br&gt;Our days were numbered. &lt;br&gt;The world was over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One month after the virus took over the United States of America and turned its inhabitants into ravenous, flesh-eating monsters, Dakota Travis and his friend Steve Earnest have been barely surviving. Hiding out in an abandoned apartment building, they struggle to live in a world where danger lies around every corner and is not limited to only the threat of the walking dead. Their latest supply run almost ended with their deaths. When a local gang violently uproots them from their shelter, there is little they can do but run. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their flight finds them sanctuary one town over in a converted insane-asylum with members of the United States military. While things should be safer, an underlying tension begins to rule their lives as Sergeant Armstrong, leader of the small unit, begins to succumb to insanity. Tension runs high within the asylum. When all that separates them from the undead is a chain-link fence, Dakota begins to wonder whether or not they might be safer outside, especially when his feelings for another man leave him an open target to the disaproving within their midst.</description>

  <description>William needs to learn to think before he speaks. He accidentally outed his last boyfriend to his bigoted family. Looking to make a new start, he escapes to the most distant place he can think of: New Zealand. There he boards with a substitute mom and her too-hot-to-be-real son, Heath, but Heath and his homophobic friend Rory want William to leave before things “crash and burn,” whatever &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; means. &lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, traveling to the end of the world isn’t far enough for William to lose his runaway mouth.&lt;br&gt;But is it far enough to lose his loneliness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anytasunday.com/william.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.anytasunday.com/william.html&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>I stopped believing in monsters long ago. But I knew I wasn't imagining things when I found one in my kitchen baking muffins. I'd seen him before: lurking in my closet, scaring the crap out of my five-year-old self. Turns out that was a misunderstanding, and now Maurice needs a place to stay. How could I say no?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, I've always been a magnet for the emotionally needy, and not just in my work as a wedding planner. Being able to sense the feelings of others can be a major pain. Don't get me wrong, I like helping people--and non-people. But this ability has turned me into a gourmet feast for an incubus, a demon that feeds off emotional energy. Now, brides are dropping dead all over town, and my home has become a safe house for the supernatural. I must learn to focus my powers and defeat the demon before he snacks on another innocent woman and comes looking for the main course...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;77,000 words</description>

  <description>He’ll teach her how to bring a man to his knees…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Ellie Swan has a plan: open her practice in tiny Bluelick, Kentucky, so she can keep an eye on her diabetic father, and make hometown golden-boy Roger Reynolds fall in love with her. But Ellie has a problem. Roger seeks a skilled, sexually adventurous partner, and bookish Ellie doesn’t qualify.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyler Longfoot only cares about three things: shaking his bad boy image, qualifying for the loan his company needs to rehab a piece of Bluelick’s history, and convincing Ellie to keep quiet about the “incident” that lands him on her doorstep at two a.m. with a bullet in his behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The adorable Dr. Swan drives a mean bargain, though. If sex-on-a-stick Tyler will teach Ellie how to bring a man to his knees, she’ll forget about the bullet. Armed with The Wild Woman’s Guide to Sex and Tyler’s lessons, Ellie is confident she can become what Roger needs…if she doesn’t fall for Tyler first.</description>

  <description>Heroes fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter first came to the tiny backwater of Daisy, California, as a child, and he was sure of one thing: his cousin Michael would take care of him. When Michael started a friendship with the fragile, haunted Bodi Kovacs, Peter's consolation in losing any claim to Bodi was that Michael would care for him too. But tragedy struck, and Michael ripped himself out of their world and threw away the people who loved him most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years later, Michael is coming home in a box. All it took to destroy a hero was a town full of bigotry and hatred. Reclaiming him will take strength of heart that neither Peter nor Bodi had six years ago. Since Michael left, Bodi has been lost and alone. Peter can try to make Bodi his and take the role Michael should have had, but first he and Bodi have to confront the past. They will need to face Michael, the good and the bad, the beauty and the sadness, and see his memory truly for what it was and not what it could have been. It's a simple act that may destroy them both: sifting through the flaming ruins of heaven is a sure way to annihilate a bleeding mortal heart.</description>

  <description>Ryder made a mistake Harlan can't forgive. Will Ryder cross a line no man should cross to obtain a second chance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryder Halloway made a life changing decision about his relationship with Harlan when he was young and stupid. Thanks to one rash moment, he lost it all. He lost the only man he would ever love, his drive to even try to finish college and his zest for life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven years later finds him in front of Harlan's house preparing to take back what he lost with a vengeance. He's prepared to use all the tricks in his arsenal to plow through every wall, protest and excuse Harlan might come up with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, he never expected Harlan to put him in the hospital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harlan Mychels had his heart broken in college by the popular Ryder. He learned his lesson about love and since then hasn't allowed anyone even remotely close to his heart. Then one morning he turns and sees the one person able to tear his walls down and destroy what is left of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He uses every defensive tactic in his possession to keep Ryder at arm's length, but Ryder is persistent. Harlan's not sure if he can stay safe from heartache, and he starts wondering what the real heartache is – letting Ryder in again...or letting him go for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This book was previously published in the Story Orgy anthology Word Play**</description>

  <description>Lord Oliver Marsden has a secret. He's been in love with his childhood friend for years, though Vincent's never shown an interest in him beyond friendship. Ruggedly handsome, wealthy, and successful, Vincent is everything Oliver is not. And Vincent doesn't prefer men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Oliver discovers Vincent hires a man during his visits to a London brothel. Desperate to be with Vincent, Oliver orchestrates a deception, switching places with the brothel's employee. When Oliver arrives at the bedchamber, he's in for another surprise. Restraints and a leather bullwhip? Apparently Vincent isn't as conservative as he appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Vincent Prescot has a secret of his own. One kept locked away and only indulged once a month. But this month's appointment is different. The mysterious man is so perfect, so beautiful in his submission, rousing protective instincts Vincent can't deny. Yet he refuses to believe he might truly prefer men, for it could mean the end of his hopes of earning his father's respect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will betrayal destroy them or will they be bound together by deception?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, BDSM theme and content, including bondage and spanking, male/male sexual practices. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>How do you keep going when you feel like your life is over?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie never thought she’d see Clay again.  So, she attempts to put her life back together after her heart has been shattered to pieces.  Moving on and moving forward, just as Clay wanted her to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clay never stopped thinking of Maggie.  Even after ripping their lives apart and leaving her behind to get the help he so desperately needed.  He is healing...slowly.  But his heart still belongs to the girl who tried to save him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a sudden tragedy brings Maggie and Clay face to face again, nothing is the same.  Yet some things never change.  Can the darkness that threatened to consume them be transformed into something else and finally give them what they always wanted?  And can two people who fought so hard to be together, finally find their happiness?  Or will their demons and fear drive them apart for good?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing about love, is even when it destroys you, it has a way of mending what is broken.   And in the shadows, you can still see the light.</description>

  <description>"I can give you exactly what you're asking for, Janie, and I can give it to you all night long." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their first kiss is impulsive, fun, a little wicked--everything Jane Elliot isn't looking for in a man--but desperately needs.  Their second kiss is slow, deliberate, an instant connection--everything Austin Sinclair never had with a woman--and doesn't want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane isn't the easy conquest Austin's used to.  She's a stubborn-as-hell bookworm who's more interested in studying than dating.  She needs a little--no--a lot of fun in her life, and Austin's just the guy who can give it to her.  Too bad she thinks love should be easy. Too bad Austin knows it isn't.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everybody told her to stay away from the heartbreaker, but Jane knows there's more to Austin than full-body contact kisses and bad boy charm.  All he ever promised her was a good time and wow, does he ever deliver....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A steamy romance sure to get your juices flowing. FOR ADULTS ONLY.</description>

  <description>Terry Pratchett's profoundly irreverent, bestselling novels have garnered him a revered position in the halls of parody next to the likes of Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut, Douglas Adams, and Carl Hiaasen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Color of Magic&lt;/em&gt; is Terry Pratchett's maiden voyage through the now-legendary land of Discworld. This is where it all begins -- with the tourist Twoflower and his wizard guide, Rincewind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a world supported on the back of a giant turtle (sex unknown), a gleeful, explosive, wickedly eccentric expedition sets out. There's an avaricious but inept wizard, a naive tourist whose luggage moves on hundreds of dear little legs, dragons who only exist if you believe in them, and of course THE EDGE of the planet...&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Neil Dalton’s foundation is already cracking. Grief, guilt, and PTSD have ruled his life since a terrible crime tore his world apart last year, and he’s dreading a holiday visit with the family he simultaneously needs and resents. Then someone from his past shows up and rattles that shaky foundation right out from under him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First a war nearly destroyed Jeremy Kelley. Then his family threw him out when he needed them the most, and now he’s barely holding on emotionally. He spends his last dollar to get to Chicago and prays his former best friend doesn’t leave him out in the cold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, Neil and Jeremy spend the holidays with Neil’s family in their hometown of Omaha. They struggle to deal with families, flashbacks… and feelings that haven’t even begun to fade since their last failed attempt at more than friends. As they try to repair their fractured psyches and rebuild damaged bridges, they rely on each other more than ever, but they can’t deny the mutual attraction that’s existed since before they were both emotionally battered and scarred.  If they couldn’t make it work back then, how in the world can they pull it off now?</description>

  <description>Darren Fording works as a Senior Timetabling Officer for his local college. When Max Sheldon arrives to take over as Acting Registrar, Darren finds himself consumed by lust for his new boss and making the kind of decisions he as a stuck-in-his-ways administrator has never made before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Darren initiates a full-on kiss during a meeting with Max, the enthusiasm of the Registrar's response takes him by surprise. Max is reluctant to pursue a relationship with an employee, but Darren is equally determined not to take no for an answer. Can he prove his worth to the man he's beginning to love and show him he's a dab hand at educational politics as well?</description>

  <description>After a near-fatal head injury, navy SEAL lieutenant Tom Paoletti catches a terrifying glimpse of an international terrorist in his New England hometown. When he calls for help, the navy dismisses the danger as injury-induced imaginings. In a desperate, last-ditch effort to prevent disaster, Tom creates his own makeshift counterterrorist team, assembling his most loyal officers, two elderly war veterans, a couple of misfit teenagers, and Dr. Kelly Ashton-the sweet "girl next door" who has grown into a remarkable woman. The town's infamous bad boy, Tom has always longed for Kelly. Now he has one final chance for happiness, one last chance to win her heart, and one desperate chance to save the day . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sonnet Gray has problems, and not just those of a typical 18 year old.  Her family is one of the Lost; time travelers who have no power over their journeys.  Hopelessly old fashioned and yet more modern than most girls, Sonnet speaks several languages and takes care of her motley crue back home by working in a coffee shop and playing guitar.  Over time, the Lost leave behind those they love and pick up new characters along the way.  In twenty-first century America, Sonnet meets Emme, a Lost young woman with a questionable line of work, Luke, a mysterious photographer, and Israel, a young doctor .  But no one can take the place of Sonnet's sister, Rose, who was left behind as a baby in the fifteenth century.  The ghost of her beckons from each time and place; but what's real and what isn't? Is Rose Gray trying to contact her before it's too late?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A ghost story with a sci-fi, Gothic romance twist, Shadow's Gray will keep you up at night, wondering: is the redemptive power of love enough to change history?</description>

  <description>If you fall too fast, you just might crash...Daisy has been dumped, unceremoniously jilted. Not by any ordinary guy, no...Daisy has a secret in her past that she won't even tell her best friend, Holly. She's given up on men - and on her own family. But life still has to be lived and where better to recover than as far away from home as possible. Grabbing a chance to see the world, Daisy packs her bags and joins the team catering to the world's highest-paid, supercharged racing drivers on the Formula 1 Grand Prix circuit. From Brazil to Italy, from Melbourne to Monte Carlo, life passes in a dizzying whirlwind. But nothing - and no one - can stop Daisy from falling again...this time for a man who is prepared to risk his life, and his heart, for the sake of speed, danger and ultimate success.</description>

  <description>Amnesia is just another case to solve. Piece together unfamiliar faces, reconstruct the old identity, the lost reality. A challenge that Sherlock could even enjoy. He can read people like books. The man with the silver hair is his boss. The tottering old woman, his landlady. The girl with the worried look in her eyes…infatuated. And as for John Watson? His husband. Obviously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 8,251</description>

  <description>Sadie Turner can organize just about anything — except her own life. When her cheating spouse topples Sadie’s impeccably tidy world, she packs up her kids for a summer vacation at her aunt’s lake house, hoping to relax, reboot, and formulate a new plan — one that does not include men.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But eccentric Aunt Dody has other plans; she’s determined to see Sadie have a little fun—with Desmond, the sexy new neighbor. Tall, tanned, muscular—and even great with her kids, Desmond is Sadie’s worst nightmare. He must have a flaw—he’s a man, after all—so Sadie vows to keep her distance. But as summer blazes on, their attraction ignites, and the life Sadie is trying so hard to simplify only gets more complicated. But maybe a little chaos is just what she needs to get her future, and her dreams of love, back in order.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What the tide washes in, the past can sweep away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Dr. Tom Penrose wants is his old life back. He's home in Cornwall after a hellish tour of duty in Afghanistan, but while the village is the same, he isn't. His grip on his control is fragile, and it slips dangerously when Flynn Summers explodes into his life. The vision in tight neoprene nearly wipes them both out in a surfing mishaps and shatters Tom's lonely peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flynn is a crash-and-burn in progress, one of only two survivors of a devastating rescue helicopter crash that killed his crew. His carefree charm is merely a cover for the messed-up soul within. The sparks between him and Tom are the first light he's seen in a long, dark tunnel of self-recrimination, which includes living in sexual thrall to fellow crash survivor and former co-pilot, Robert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their attraction burns through spring and into summer, Tom must confront not only his own shadows, but Flynn's before the past rises up to swallow his lover whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning Contains explicit m/m sex, hot helicopter pilots and skin-tight wetsuits. Also, in true British tradition, a tiny bit of joystick innuendo.</description>

  <description>She’s running from the law, and the law wants her &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opportunity was just too damn delicious for Ginger Peet to pass up. The purse full of money she finds—$50,000 to be exact—could give her and her teen sister the new start they need. So she grabs the cash, her gothy sibling, and their life-sized statue of Dolly Parton, and blows outta Nashville in a cloud of dust. &lt;em&gt;Chicago, here we come...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, Chicago has some pretty hot cops. Hot, intense, naughty-lookin’ cops like Derek Tyler, who looks like he could eat a girl up and leave her begging for more. And &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. Tempting as he is, getting involved with the sexy homicide lieutenant next door poses a teensy problem for a gal who’s on the lam. But one thing is certain—Derek’s onto her, and he wants more than just a taste. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as far as he’s concerned, possession is nine-tenths of the law.</description>

  <description>Jaci Harmon was born a Sapphire, but after she’s summoned to receive her final designation, the testing reveals she carries a gene slated for eradication. Within a day, she’s sterilized and dumped in the Amber Zone, where the damaged are corralled away from the rest of New Atlanta. Scared and alone, Jaci would rather die than face her future as an Amber. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in the Amber Zone, Xander Dimos is a product of a lifetime spent under the oppression of the Repopulation Laws. Decades of suffering have taught the Ambers to make the zone a place where touch, sex, and unconditional acceptance ease the pain of their fate. Jaci has a lot to learn about her new home, and it’s Xanderís responsibility to guide her through the differences and the dangers safely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the simmering undercurrents of sexual chemistry growing between them, and in the midst of discovering the Gov’s true motives, Jaci and Xander must overcome his secret and accept their love as undeniable...even if the time allotted to share it is short.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Bar worker and serial slut Terry Seymour is hardly charm personified when it comes to romance. In fact, he doesn't believe in love at all despite his latent desire for his best friend of fourteen years, builder Marc Pierce.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dan Hutchinson is a young homeless man living in a derelict house Marc's halfway to renovating. When Marc announces Dan's moving in for a while, Terry is understandably miffed. After all, it hasn't been that long since Marc spilt with his boyfriend of a year, so why is he intent on bringing a total stranger into their home?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It seems to Terry there's more to this arrangement than meets the eye. Marc must be providing Dan with food and lodgings in exchange for sex. And with the lusty vibes Dan sends his way, it's not long before Terry succumbs to the boy's talents between the sheets. But carrying on with Dan behind his best friend's back is not easy. Or desirable. And when Terry's plans to oust Dan fail, he's the one who finds himself out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Former Marine Will Marlowe dreams of being a great classics scholar, but his subversive street art, Bad Toys, is what he does best. When he’s sent to London to retrieve Tommy Jones, what he’s really interested in is a chance to take Bad Toys global. He doesn’t expect cancer survivor Tommy to captivate him or to become the pet project of a real live—dead—author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Tommy is struggling to write a dissertation about Christopher Marlowe while conveniently ignoring the fact that he knows Marlowe didn’t die in 1593. And Marlowe’s ghost? He has an agenda all his own that seems to involve two parts mystery, one part romance.</description>

  <description>“Wolf or vamp? Decide. It has to be now.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those were the last words Sam Garrett ever heard—as a human. Now on the para side of normal, the NOPD slammed the proverbial door on his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis Boudreaux knows exactly how his former partner feels—but when some doors close, the golden window of opportunity opens. Crimes against supernaturals require a new and different approach, and once the Feds show up, the Odd Squad isn’t the only law enforcement game in town.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a revenge-seeking vampire creates deadly havoc, the new agent-in-charge is on a recruiting mission—and he’s more than ready to fight fire with fire. What do you get when you mix old friends, new enemies, and a license to kill? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pure dynamite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This is an erotic urban fantasy. In this series the vampires don’t sparkle, werewolves kill, and the men sometimes have sex. With each other.</description>

  <description>Aside from a sympathetic parole officer, Aiden Finn is alone in the world. He knows this is his last chance—after a lifetime in and out of prison, one more mistake will land him there to stay. Unfortunately, his job as a night custodian at a motel is neither satisfying nor good for building his confidence, and booze and burglary are always just a step behind him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter beautiful, exotic, and secretive Luka Gabor, the motel’s new security guard. He seems to know a great deal about literature, history, and travel but otherwise remains a mystery. Aiden has to admit, the sex has never been better, and he might even be feeling the beginnings of friendship. He dares to hope that this time, he won't mess things up—if lurking monsters don't ruin his plans.</description>

  <description>Mina Clark is losing her mind—or maybe it’s already gone. She isn’t quite sure. Feeling displaced in her over-priced McMansion-dotted suburban world, she is grappling not only with deep debt, a mostly absent husband, and her playground-terrorizer 3-year old Emma, but also with a significant amnesia she can’t shake—a “temporary” condition now going on several years, brought on by a traumatic event she cannot remember, and which everyone around her feels is best forgotten. A routine trip to the dentist changes everything for Mina, and suddenly she's not sure if what's happening is real, of if she's just now fully losing her mind... especially when she realizes the only person she thought she could trust is the one she fears the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This latest novel by Francine LaSala (Rita Hayworth’s Shoes) is a fast-paced, richly layered, and darkly humorous satire filled with quirky characters and unforgettable moments of humanity.</description>

  <description>Neriah, the crown prince of Tazier, escapes his father’s deadly wrath with the help of a Jinn named Tamir. Knowing that the other Jinn would find and punish him for falling in love with a human, Tamir takes Neriah’s memories of their brief time together and leaves him with only a jade pendant as a token of his love. Tamir is then stripped of his powers and imprisoned for his crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, Neriah is still on the run from the King’s assassins, but each night he dreams of a lover whose face he cannot see and whose name he does not know, but who fills his heart with peace. Tamir, freed at last from his prison cell, poses as a pleasure slave and offers to serve the prince. Although Neriah does not recognize Tamir, he falls in love with the powerless Jinn. But just when Tamir has earned Neriah’s trust, he is forced to betray it. There may be no hope of mending their broken relationship, but Tamir is determined to see Neriah on his rightful throne—even if it costs the Jinn his life.</description>

  <description>Part one in the Yes, Forever serial&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when John Weston thinks he’s got it all together, he learns he’s really just buried his head in the sand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Weston has been using his past behaviour as a weapon against himself. He’s not wanted to fall back into old habits and ways that nearly destroyed him. That’s why he’s kept to himself for the past two years.Little by little, things happen that begin to make him see what he’s really done—wall himself off in such a way that he no longer knows how to be around people outside of his job and his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One man will come along and rattle John’s self-imposed cage, and start John on a journey of self-discovery and acceptance he didn’t even know he needed. John will have to take risks instead of hide away, and learn that making mistakes doesn’t mean he’s a lost cause. It simply means he’s a man who can feel more than he’d ever thought he could.</description>

  <description>This is the biography of Alexandra Fuller's childhood in Rhodesia during the beginning of the guerrilla war time. It's funny, scary, and a remarkable glimpse of a world turned upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight&lt;/em&gt;, Alexandra Fuller remembers her African childhood with candor and sensitivity. Though it is a diary of an unruly life in an often inhospitable place, it is suffused with Fuller’s endearing ability to find laughter, even when there is little to celebrate. Fuller’s debut is unsentimental and unflinching but always captivating. In wry and sometimes hilarious prose, she stares down disaster and looks back with rage and love at the life of an extraordinary family in an extraordinary time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A memoir of a child of expats growing up in Africa. Alexandra writes in a very honest, non-judgemental and funny style about her unusual upbringing in a hardscrabble land. Her parents are hardworking farmers and ranchers and the children are raised to be independent. It can be quite hair-raising at times!</description>

  <description>Ivan has no love for adventure, nor does he have any sort of desire to see and/or experience the world around him. In point of fact, overly long trips of any sort kind of make him want to die, so there is obviously no reason for him to force his best friend on a journey across America with him. Obviously. M/M slash etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complete&lt;br&gt;Chapters: 14&lt;br&gt;Words: 60,720</description>

  <description>When you pit knowledge against emotions, there's the no-man's land in between those two opposing forces where taboos lie. Incest is one of the untouchables, a taboo that even in alternative cultures is often still looked on negatively. But how can something that feels so right be wrong? In &lt;em&gt;Fraternal Devotion&lt;/em&gt;, the focus is on brotherly love--in every sense of the word. These are tales of love, lust, devotion, and passion as real as any other romance. Why should the fact that the two men are brothers take away from that? This collection may challenge your assumptions and beliefs, but may also melt your heart. Not to mention steam up your glasses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keith is a Humanist Corpsman, sworn to protect society from the mutated ranks of the Infected. When his own team betrays him, however, it's his long lost brother, Riley, who takes him in and makes him choose between &lt;em&gt;War and Peace and Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt;. After nineteen months apart, Brandon Patrell, of &lt;em&gt;Analgesia&lt;/em&gt;, is convinced it will take more than a home renovation to keep his playboy brother, Ethan, from running away again. But as Ethan resumes his old mind-games, Brandon is determined to tease back for once, even if it means risking everything in a game of all or nothing. A dozen years after discovering his father's suicide, Cale returns home and finds his older brother Derrick showing the same signs of melancholy. But as much as he wants to help his brother, he fears being sucked back into that world of &lt;em&gt;Depression, Love, and Swimming Pools&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy has been &lt;em&gt;On Clouds of Obsession&lt;/em&gt; since long ago glimpsing his brother, Matt, naked in the locker room. Years later, with Matt due to be married in a week, Jeremy takes a chance after Matt's bachelor's party that could jeopardize their relationship, not to mention the impending wedding. Songwriter Andrew lives life &lt;em&gt;On the Edge&lt;/em&gt;, using drugs to quiet his uncertainties about his ongoing relationship with his twin, Ben. Disheartened by Andrew's empty promises, Ben begins to pull away, forcing Andrew to choose between letting go and finally finding the strength to stop running.</description>

  <description>Astrophysicist-in-training Piper Minogue has a lot of control over her day-to-day life. Between completing a Master’s degree at Caltech and beginning her fruitful career at a local observatory she has little time for socializing. Until she attends one specific party that is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There, Piper is introduced to a drinking game called Never Have I Ever, and she finds herself admitting to a secret fantasy which challenges her friends’ views of her otherwise prudish nature. Her confession piques the interest of one man in particular, Noah; a handsome stranger with a darkly boyish charm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The resulting spiral of rapture and torture that follows is threatened by the demons of both their pasts. Piper's inability to give her heart to anyone, and Noah's guilt over the death of his former lover claw to the surface to tear Piper away from not only the one man who has ever made her feel like she does not have to be in control of her desires, but also the newly collected list of Nevers they both want to turn into reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Contains strong BDSM themes*</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For some, virtue is a vice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the illegitimate daughter of a scandalous woman, Miss Anna Rees is almost as well known for having been raised in the hedonistic &lt;em&gt;demimonde&lt;/em&gt; as she is for her quiet nature. Anna longs to leave behind her mother’s world of courtesans…until she unexpectedly meets the handsome, charming and decidedly wicked Lord Dane.  If only she could convince him to join her in search of respectability. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For him, vice is a virtue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Viscount Maximilian Dane is perfectly content being a rake. After years of obeying the dictates of proper society--with disastrous results--he stopped following the ton’s ridiculous rules, and he sees no reason to begin courting respectability anew. Except that it may be the only way for him to win the lovely and fascinating Miss Anna Rees—if only he could convince her that the grass is greener on the wicked side of the fence. . . </description>

After the death of her father, she taught herself to live on a pauper’s allowance—until a charming visitor promises her the funds that had been stolen from her through the years.

  <description>Brooke Wright has only two goals her senior year at Charity Run High School: stay out of trouble and learn to forgive herself for the past. Forgiveness proves elusive, and trouble finds her anyway when she discovers a secret club at school connected to the death of her best friend. She learns that swim team members participate in a “Fantasy Slut League,” scoring points for their sexual acts with unsuspecting girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke, wracked with guilt over her friend’s death, decides to infiltrate the league by becoming one of the “unsuspecting girls,” and exact revenge on the boys who stole away her best friend. An unexpected romance complicates her plans, and her dogged pursuit of justice turns her reckless as she underestimates just how far the boys will go to keep their sex club a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is a New Adult fiction book with mature themes. It contains graphic sex and language and a description of sexual violence.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>My sister has always been of the romantic sort. She fell in love with a prince and made a deal with the sea witch that she could make him fall in love with her as well. But it's been a month and so far she has failed. Unable to see her broken hearted and knowing that she would soon be claimed by the sea witch, the three eldest sisters presented her with a knife to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She loves him too much to do so and now the task falls to me. If I can kill the prince, my sister will be safe to mend her broken heart. And what does it matter, he is only human. The human that rejected my sister and put her in the situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I'm beginning to realize that the prince is far more than simply human to me. And I think I'm losing my heart to him as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(book can also be &lt;a href="http://www.allromanceebooks.com/product-bloodinthewater-874365-143.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;downloaded at ARe&lt;/a&gt;)</description>

  <description>Toby Andrews is cooking up more than a little trouble for Evan Blankenship. Because of pranks, indiscretions, and plain bad timing, his ability to work in New York's temples of haute cuisine is a thing of the past. When Toby's sister tells him he should look up an acquaintance whose restaurant -- Le Potiron --is failing, he doesn't have much choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pretty soon he's in bed, literally, with a cook who hates people, trying to save a restaurant that only the neighborhood mothers seem to love, and on the verge of another --possibly painful -- lesson or two about what it means to be successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan hates everyone but Toby. Toby likes to stir things up. See what's on the menu at Le Potiron, in Stirring Up Trouble.</description>

  <description>Ophelia Brand’s life is in shambles. Married to an abusive man and forced to act like the perfect politician’s wife in public, her freedom has been completely stripped away. Alone and without purpose, Ophelia feels as if there isn’t much in this world to live for. Everything changes when an employee kidnaps her from a state dinner. Ophelia is thrust into a new world filled with people who claim to be an ancient race of Mages. They also claim that she is one of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  While the country falls into the hands of a tyrannical dictator, Ophelia finds herself torn between the friendly Reece who wants nothing more than to protect her, and Spencer, the leader of the resistance who sees her as a tool to fight the war. Tensions run high as Reece and Spencer both try to help her master her powers and unravel the spells that restricted her from using them.   As revelations of her past come to light, and the war is brought to her feet, Ophelia must quickly make a choice of who to trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Binds is the first in a series of adult urban fantasy novels with sexy Mages, a sugar skull army, and an unfortunate set of Hello Kitty pjs.&lt;br&gt;Coming Spring 2013</description>

  <description>Reporter Drew Edwards got too close to his story and now finds himself a hunted man. After being kidnapped and then released in Colorado Springs Forest, he has six hours’ headstart on a madman trying to teach his son a lesson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chance Collins gets one warning from his bigoted, abusive father: “Kill him or be killed.” Horrified, Chance sees only one real option—run with Drew. When he takes it, there’s no turning back. If Drew and Chance can work together, they might make it out of the mountains alive to the promise of a brighter future.</description>

  <description>An all-expense-paid week at a luxury villa in Jamaica&amp;amp;#8212;it&amp;amp;#8217;s the invitation of a lifetime for a group of old college friends. All four women are desperate not just for a reunion, but for an escape: Tina is drowning under the demands of mothering four young children. Allie is shattered by the news that a genetic illness runs in her family. Savannah is carrying the secret of her husband&amp;amp;#8217;s infidelity. And, finally, there&amp;amp;#8217;s Pauline, who spares no expense to throw her wealthy husband an unforgettable thirty-fifth birthday celebration, hoping it will gloss over the cracks already splitting apart their new marriage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Languid hours on a private beach, gourmet dinners, and late nights of drinking kick off an idyllic week for the women and their husbands. But as a powerful hurricane bears down on the island, turmoil swirls inside the villa, forcing each of the women to reevaluate everything she knows about her friends&amp;amp;#8212;and herself.</description>

  <description>A frustrated spaceship captain, her trusty second-in- command, and a handsome alien prove that three is definitely not a crowd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kithran Regenesis, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spaceship captain Lux Moyans is currently piloting missions for The Company. When her second-in-command, Kol Frega, informs her they’ve been ordered to Kithra, she’s furious. A year on an uninhabitable planet? She’ll only be flying supply missions! But her ship—Kol’s design—is the only one that can withstand the planet’s gases…and Lux is one of the few pilots with the skill to navigate the debris fields resulting from the explosions that killed most of the planet’s Gwinarian race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kol is the engineer who learned to manipulate the indestructible metal on Kithra, and he and a surviving Gwinarian will be her only company on planet. When they pick up Egan Lothbrun, Lux knows there will be trouble. She’s already attracted to Kol and she doesn’t need another man to arouse her either mentally or physically. Lux doesn’t want or need the complications that emotions bring. Yet, when she learns Kol and Egan share a painful past, she realizes getting Kithra livable won’t be her only challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping her heart intact might be harder.</description>

  <description>Henry Walker is the only son of a wealthy businessman - and heir to a vast company. It is his birthright and destiny. But Henry only truly desires the one thing he cannot have…time to spend with his lover, Archie Banks. Archie is his childhood friend turned driver, bodyguard and dirty little secret. Circumstances make it difficult for them to sneak moments together – something that will become impossible once Archie moves on after he graduates from college.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They fear the uncertain future, and what will become of their blossoming feelings - but nothing prepares them for the danger and disaster about to overwhelm their lives. A shocking kidnapping leads to tragedy and suddenly Henry and Archie are thrust into a dramatic fight against an unknown enemy. They must fight not only be together, but to also save the company Henry has been groomed to run his entire life.</description>

  <description>Shelly Gelson had it all...a job teaching English at Carver High, her best friend Mel working by her side, and she's engaged to her high school sweetheart Chase Marino. That is until Chase breaks her heart and leaves her for another teacher at the school. Now Shel is left broken hearted and trying to figure out what she wants while watching Chase and the home wrecker make moon eyes at each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Matt Fuller, Shel's friend for the past 5 years and the perfect rebound. He's gorgeous, smart, funny and fits into Shel's idea of the right guy. Only problem is there may be more there than just a simple rebound. Is it a way to fill a void left by Chase, or is there more smoldering between these two friends?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out what happens when the bell rings and the teenage drama ends and the adult drama begins. Who says being a teacher is boring? They obviously haven't met the teachers at Carver High.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is Rated R for adult content. &lt;br&gt;Sex: Yes!&lt;br&gt;Profanity: Hell yeah.&lt;br&gt;Booze: That too.</description>

  <description>Chris and Vyv have always been close -- as the only two 'weird' kids in their small Midwestern town, they've often depended on each other to survive. But their friendship will be put to the test when Vyv runs away and continues to communicate with Chris in secret. All summer, as the search for Vyv mounts, Chris tries to avoid the pressure by working for Albert, an off-the-grid survivalist writer building an anarchist compound from an abandoned house and barn. But as Albert's plans for the future grow more apocalyptic, and Vyv's emails gradually become more terrifying, Chris will face the complete upheaval of everything he's ever known. The Chicago Center for Literature and Photography is proud to present &lt;em&gt;Have You Seen Me&lt;/em&gt;, the debut novella of local author Katherine Scott Nelson.

  <description>First they were three, now there are two. Can Jason and Morgan make a relationship work without Paul?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years the three of them had been inseparable, first as friends, then lovers. It's been ten years since they parted for what was supposed to be a year apart to pursue their dreams. This isn't the reunion they planned then. It's nine years too late for one thing, and they are one man short for another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the years since Paul's death, Morgan hasn't exactly been waiting for Jason to reach out to him. He's been too busy trying to forget, to move on. Until Jason sends the right message. Is the painting just an excuse to see his ex again?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the space of a few months, sixteen-year-old Ethan Poe's life has become a complicated mix of facts, theories, and hypotheses. Things he knows beyond doubt: his parents are divorcing, his older brother Kyle is exhibiting alarming behavior, and his best friend is turning into a spiritual fanatic. Then there are the shifting uncertainties, including his feelings toward his father and his desire to both blend in and stand out in his rural Maine hometown. Most pressing of all, there's his attraction to Max Modine, a boy he wants to know much better than he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Ethan's initial reluctance, he gets pulled into a heated and sometimes violent conflict about whether to introduce Intelligent Design into science classrooms. Family and friends are turning against each other, school is a battleground, and Ethan will have to take a stand.  Because some facts are irrefutable and some bonds unbreakable, even when they can't be seen.  And once Ethan finds the courage to become who he was meant to be, the outcome could be absolutely extraordinary...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Callum Walker is feeling listless in his life in London. When his job takes him to Canada to install communications software for a new sports arena, he’s glad for a change of scenery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During his stay, he befriends Noah Lukas, the strikingly handsome star player of the Toronto Bobcats professional hockey team. Callum knows nothing will ever come of it, but he can’t stop his attraction. As their bond grows, Callum learns more about—and falls more for—Noah through his sensitive and humble interactions with fans, his gentlemanly reaction to flirtations from arena staff, and his frank apprehension over his impending retirement. Their friendship evolves from workout partners to confidants, and then to even more. But Callum’s time in Canada is limited, and circumstances may divide him from a love he wasn’t looking for.</description>

  <description>Wade  is a throwaway, forced into prostitution at fourteen and living on the mean streets of Los Angeles. Nearly four years later, and now calling himself Trick, he’s still struggling to survive. While huddled in a doorway on a cold rainy morning, he thanks his lucky stars when an expensive Mercedes pulls up and rolls down a window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phoenix, known as Master P, may be a big intimidating Dom, but he has a soft spot for vulnerable young men. When he sees a homeless kid trembling in the cold, he has to stop and pick him up. What he finds is a boy with a naturally submissive nature and a damaged soul. As he begins to train the boy at the online BDSM club where he’s employed, DOMZ.com, they form a fast and explosive combination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Trick begins to fall for his big Dom, Phoenix is forced to tell him that this is only play. The resulting fallout will shake Phoenix to his very core. Is this chance encounter doomed for failure or can the two men find a balance?</description>

  <description>Robotics researcher Henry Travis uses his brain for just about everything, but once he meets Nick Shelton over the hood of his 1960 Mercedes 300, he's at a loss. How does he control his attraction to this brash, sexy mechanic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick owns his own classic car garage, and he is more than willing to hit it with the brainy, seriously hot, Henry. What he doesn't need is the aggro that comes with feelings. But since his 14yo nephew, Grant, has come to live with him, he's been dealing with aggravation every day. And now his dad lives with him, too. A dad who doesn't mind commenting on Nick's lame parenting skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Henry turning his crank in a big way, and Nick enjoying not being in charge for a change, things heat up pretty fast. They're actually dating, with dinner and everything, before he knows it. And the after-dinner drinks at Henry's gorgeous house have Nick wiping the sweat from his brow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Henry and Grant don't get along; Nick isn't sure he wants a relationship at all, and Nick's dad, Big Mike, has an opinion on everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How's a guy to have fun on the weekends - even during the week, for crying out loud - with all the family baggage hanging around?</description>

  <description>When sixteen year-old Bijou Fitzroy and her nomadic grandmother leave New York City to live in a home in the sleepy town of Sykesville, Maryland, Bijou thinks she will finally be able to live a normal life and be like everyone else. This move will be permanent, and Bijou cannot be anymore thrilled. After years of being shut away by her grandmother, Bijou will finally able to interact with peers, make friends, go to school, and live like a normal teenager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving around and being homeschooled definitely made it difficult to make friends, but there are other reasons for Bijou’s solitude. With eyes that constantly change from gray to green to a honey-coated shade of brown and an ability to feel exactly what other people are feeling, the concept of obtaining closeness is more of a fable than a reality. Although her eyes are beautiful, their constant shift in color instills a sense of fear within other people and causes them to look away. Bijou’s premonitions, blackouts, and semi-prophetic dreams of a faceless boy don’t help her social musings either. Regardless, she decides to attend the local high school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bijou is immediately introduced to Sebastian Sinjin, a quirky and unusually beautiful boy who doesn’t seem to belong in a high school in nowhere Maryland. Sebastian is also special. Instead of looking away from Bijou, he makes direct eye contact with her. And when he shakes Bijou’s hand something dark and familiar to awaken within her as an electric shock surges through her body. Bijou soon finds herself deeply attracted to Sebastian, who remains aloof and often acts like Bijou doesn’t exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the pains of having her first real crush, Bijou makes friends quickly and excels in all of her classes…well, all except for Mythology with Mr. Jennings. Mr. Jennings’ class starts off great with endless discussions of djinn and how they conceal themselves from the human eye, but things soon take a turn for the worse when the stories of the mythical creatures begin to take shape in Bijou’s life.</description>

  <description>Josh is secretly in love with Erick. How could he not be? Erick is sweet, funny, smart, and as wonderful as he is handsome. He's simply everything Josh could ever want in a man. Plus, there's no one in the world that knows or understands him better. After all, Josh and Erick have been friends and companions for as long as either can remember.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Josh is sure that he'll never find the right opportunity to share his feelings with Erick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, everything changes when Josh creates a profile on the popular online social network, Visive Encounters, a video chat website that randomly arranges face-to-face meetings with strangers via webcam. One night, in a collision of fate and software algorithms, Josh is more than surprised when his monitor reflects a mirror image...his random connection is none other than the object of his desire, his twin brother Erick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With only a screen of pixels separating them, will Josh finally be able to confess his more-than-brotherly feelings to his twin? Will a lifetime of memories be enough to hold the brothers together?</description>

  <description>What happens when a 35 year-old soccer mom from Indianapolis, Indiana sends her only child off to college and suddenly discovers that she has no identify of her own?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what happened to Samantha (Sammie) Dennison. Her marriage was loveless from the start; her 'mannequin' husband has his own agenda, which has never included her, and she feels lonely, ignored and downright &lt;strong&gt;frumpy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her daughter and her best friend both tell her to get a life, and that's exactly what Sammie does, starting with a Kickboxing/Pilates class to get into shape, and then continuing her regiment by signing up for pole-dancing lessons. Sammie graduates at the top of her class, and ultimately ends up with a secret career as a pole dancer at a Gentleman's Club in Indy called 'Jewels.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Known only by her dancer name, "Diamond," she is well on her way to finally carving out a secret life and identity all of her own that brings excitement and mystery to her otherwise mundane existence. The thrill of the dance and sexuality she discovers within herself is a potent mixture, but it's all about the dance with Sammie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until bad-boy biker Slate enters the picture. He is the ultimate 'alpha' male and quickly draws the attention of the dancers - including Sammie. Slate is a 'prospect' for the notorious Outlaw Motorcycle Club, but he is also inexplicably drawn to "Diamond." Sammie is totally out of her league with Slate and the dangerous people he associates with in Indianapolis during the summer of 2012. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No spoilers here, but something BIG is brewing in Indy; and it ain't about race cars either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Diamond Girl' will keep the reader on the edge of their seat from beginning to end; this book has it all: passion, erotica, romance, danger and possibly more . . . much more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:  This book is based loosely on actual events that occurred in Indianapolis, Indiana in the summer of 2012 involving certain members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club after a two-year investigation conducted by various federal agencies.  The names have been changed to protect the parties.  Other events depicted in this book are purely fictional for entertainment purposes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>The hole in Tony Teagan’s heart is slowly shrinking. Since losing the love of his life, he’s buried himself in running West TonDe Press, but now he can remember the good times. Still, that doesn’t mean he’s ready for a new man in his life. Then he meets nighttime delivery guy Brandon, who appears on his doorstep with Thai food. Tony’s interest is piqued despite their ten-year age difference, and Brandon is all for a new relationship. Relinquishing his hold on his deceased lover is the hardest challenge Tony will face, but if his future is combined with Brandon’s, he may have a second chance at love after all.</description>

  <description>Obsession, defined as the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a persistent idea, image or desire....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chantel Rosenberg's passion for music and life had never shone brighter than the time she spent in Bordeaux France.  It's a time when feelings arose and desires ran deep, a time that fundamentally changed her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man living in seclusion, Phillipe Tibideau is haunted and plagued by memories he cannot disregard. Choosing to live a quiet life in his Chateau surrounded by the vineyards of France, he's left his passion for art behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the time has arrived to tell his side of a tale. A tale that has depicted him as a 'beautiful monster' and he's finally allowing someone close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Close enough to ask questions. Questions he's not sure he wants to answer. Questions about her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For up and coming journalist Gemma Harris, the pursuit of truth is what drives her and when a job of a lifetime presents itself there is nothing in the world that will stop her from taking it. Even if it does mean leaving her home for several months to stay at Chateau Tibideau, with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story of what happens when three passionate lovers collide and the desire for truth, art and music merge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chateau Tibideau is a place full of unanswered questions, dark sinful desire and a beauty so hauntingly sad it will have you wondering how you will ever leave the same....</description>

  <description>Justin Parker and Derrick Wilson have been best friends since meeting back in middle school.  Currently they are in their junior year at Chandler High School, and living the good life as teenagers.  They have great girlfriends, plenty of close friends, their own cars, and parents who are well off. As nice as things might look to an outsider, something is missing from each of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin has become the invisible son in the midst of his parents failing marriage. In an effort to get his parent’s attention, Justin keeps getting into trouble. So far he has been able to get away with anything without facing any repercussions, while Derrick is feeling distant and tired of what he feels is a too “perfect family”.   He just wants to have a normal social life and spend time with his friends without the pressures from his family to spend time with them.  With blurring the lines of friendship in the process to realizing what was missing and discovering who they really are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justin and Derrick take turns narrating the story of their junior year in high school and all of the events that take place in their lives. Being a teenager can be tough.  Being gay can be tougher.  For Derrick and Justin they are both, and life cannot get any more complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens when two best friends cross the boundaries of friendship?  Will they be able to be happy together?  Will they keep their secret?</description>

  <description>[Siren Everlasting Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Older Hero Romantic Suspense, M/M, HEA]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drew Ward knows how to keep his head in the game and, now that he’s accomplished his mission to become one of the elite Loveland Smoke Jumpers, he’s turning his attention to the man he’s wanted nearly half his life. Seasoned smoke jumper Wesley Payton might be twenty years older, but he’s one hotbed of perfection Drew aims to have, and he won’t stop his pursuit until Wesley belongs to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wesley has avoided being caught alone with Drew for six weeks, but he hasn’t managed to evade the fire burning inside him for the younger man. Drew is sinfully sexy, dangerously tempting, and Wesley knows if he lets the man get too close he’ll be toast. But Drew isn’t a man who backs off easily, and when Wesley suddenly finds himself in the man’s arms, he knows he’s parachuted into a wildfire he won’t be able to control.</description>

  <description>Detective Remington frickin’ hates the missing persons detail, but a cold fury builds in the pit of his stomach when he realizes that over the past three months six boys have disappeared from the smaller communities that surround the greater Phoenix area. All reported to be runaways looking to escape their shitty lives, but Remy’s starting to put together a different picture and he doesn’t like it one damn bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspector Jamie Mainwaring stares at the six reports, willing them to make sense. Six boys, six months, all from just outside of London, which meant six different investigations. All of the boys were between the ages of ten and fifteen, all purportedly runaways from dysfunctional families. Something was rotten in Denmark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are always runaways. Every small town loses them—every big city collects them. Kids look for freedom and discover they have more to lose than they ever thought possible. London and Phoenix, culture and cowboys, nothing linking these two sprawling metropolitan areas. Nothing except a hit on a computer data search.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two cops, one a cowboy, the other a Lord. A secret government agency, human trafficking, and a blazing hot mutual distraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the hell have Remington and Mainwaring gotten themselves into?</description>

  <description>Cole Alston swore he’d never return to his childhood home in rural North Carolina, but when his mother dies, he inherits her hoarded property. He hopes to sell everything and use the money to start over in Canada, far away from his abusive ex-boyfriend. It’s a daunting task, and Cole has no idea where to start. Luckily for him, the local antique store owner, Jeremy Collins, volunteers his services in sorting the hoard. Their professional relationship soon evolves into a personal one, but Cole must overcome his past and his anxiety before he can accept a new man in his life or the possibility of a happy future.</description>

  <description>My soul was nothing but an ink stain of consequence.&lt;br&gt;You made me Canute, the foolish man,&lt;br&gt;Trying to turn back the rolling tide of your dark.&lt;br&gt;And I drowned.&lt;br&gt;I drowned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriel Hallow is a damaged man. Rock star, producer and public enemy number one, he sees his redemption in quiet, wholesome school teacher Noelle Winters. Crashing into her life like a wrecking ball, he smothers her innocence and leads her down the razor's edge between submissive and victim, opening her eyes to things she didn't even know could happen between a man and a woman. Overwhelmed by his generosity and charm, how far will she go to save his soul? And when is it too late to turn back?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* With bondage and multiple scenes of a sexual nature, this descent into the darkest parts of the human psyche is not for the faint of heart, or the under 18s.</description>

  <description>Foreign Affairs, Book One &lt;br&gt;Annie Prince has impetuously flown halfway 'round the world to visit a sexy cowboy she met online-only to find herself stranded in Sydney. Seems she and Dylan crossed wires, and he's on his way to New York. His twin, Hunter, saves the day and whisks her back to the family cattle station. Hunter's as easy on the eyes as Dylan, and even easier to talk to. Annie might have flown to Oz to meet one brother, but soon sparks are flying with the other. Hunter considered Dylan a dumb arse for jetting off to America for some stranger-until he met Annie. Turns out the New Yorker is a smart, funny, hard-working jillaroo...and hotter than the Aussie desert. Hunter's not normally one to poach his brother's women, but he can't keep his hands, lips, tongue and other body parts off this sexy city girl. When raging lust leads to emotional attachment, where does that leave Annie and Hunter when her vacation comes to an end-or when Dylan finds out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: 37,214&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>With a crappy job, an overstressed checkbook, and a ten-year-old son who's growing up entirely too fast, Will's lucky to find time to sleep - let alone socialize. So Will's more than pleased to make friends with another single dad - a handsome, soft-spoken contractor named Tom. But after their two sons turn out to be sworn enemies at school, things between them get complicated fast... and their growing feelings for each other sure aren't helping!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will always knew being a single dad wouldn't be easy - but when two single dads fall in love with each other, troubles really start piling up. And to merge their two imperfect families into one, Will and Tom will have to push their relationship - and themselves - beyond limits they never thought possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard-edged and humorous, cynical and tender, this story of real love between real guys is Nate Tanner's first romance novel.</description>

  <description>Domenica Ruta grew up in Danvers, Massachusetts, in a ramshackle, rundown, trash-filled house with her mother, a drug dealer and user who raised Domenica on a steady diet of Oxycontin. Growing up, Domenica knew she didn't fit in-she was far smarter and worse dressed than everyone else she knew, and she clearly had the most flamboyant mother of anyone in town-but she found solace in writing and reading. As she grew older, though, and as her mother's behavior grew increasingly outrageous and her home life increasingly untenable, Domenica fled Danvers only to become ensnared by the demons of addiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thoroughly textured and masterfully written book, layered with wildly colorful characters, a biting sense of humor, and penetrating, deeply sympathetic insights, &lt;em&gt;With or Without You&lt;/em&gt; finally ends with Domenica's increasing awareness that she must leave the life she grew up with in order to survive.</description>

  <description>It’s just a small story really, about among other things: a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist-fighter, and quite a lot of thievery. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set during World War II in Germany, Markus Zusak’s groundbreaking new novel is the story of Liesel Meminger, a foster girl living outside of Munich. Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul.</description>

  <description>After fifty years of searching for his lost brother, vampire David Derringer attempts the unimaginable: he bends his knee in prayer. While he doesn’t believe, his mother’s faith was strong, and her final request—a request made the night she and David died—keeps David on the path to his younger brother, Danny, despite the many obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David doesn’t expect his prayer to be answered. He certainly doesn’t expect an angel to intercede on his behalf.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jophiel is tasked not only with helping David find his brother but with saving David’s soul. It seems like an impossible assignment meant to punish him, especially when they must face the Brotherhood of St. Rocco, an organization dedicated to eradicating vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But David has a chance to prove he’s not like other vampires when he meets Arthur, a young man with a secret and a death wish. Following a very steamy encounter, Arthur expects to be bitten. David never even drops his fangs. Which is a good thing, since Arthur might be the key to finding Danny before it’s too late.</description>

  <description>Meili, a young peasant woman born in the remote heart of China, is married to Kongzi, a village school teacher, and a distant descendant of Confucius. They have a daughter, but desperate for a son to carry on his illustrious family line, Kongzi gets Meili pregnant again without waiting for official permission. When family planning officers storm the village to arrest violators of the population control policy, mother, father and daughter escape to the Yangtze River and begin a fugitive life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years they drift south through the poisoned waterways and ruined landscapes of China, picking up work as they go along, scavenging for necessities and flying from police detection. As Meili's body continues to be invaded by her husband and assaulted by the state, she fights to regain control of her fate and that of her unborn child.</description>

  <description>Jacque Pierce was just an ordinary seventeen-year-old girl getting ready to start her senior year of high school in Coldspring, Texas. When a mysterious foreign exchange student from Romania moves in across the street, Jacque and her two best friends Sally and Jen don't realize the last two weeks of their summer are going to get a lot more interesting. From the moment Jacque sets eyes on Fane she feels an instant connection, a pull like a moth to a flame. Little does she know that the flame she is drawn to is actually a Canis Lupus, werewolf, and she just happens to be his mate, the other half of his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The problem is, Fane is not the only wolf in Coldspring, Texas. Just as Fane and Jacque are getting to know each other, another wolf steps out to try and claim Jacque as his mate. Fane will now have to fight for the right to complete the mating bond, something that is his right by birth but is being denied him by a crazed Alpha. Will the love Fane has for Jacque be enough to give him the strength to defeat his enemy, and will Jacque accept that she is Fane's mate and complete the bond between them?</description>

  <description>After four harrowing years on the Western Front, Tom Sherbourne returns to Australia and takes a job as the lighthouse keeper on Janus Rock, nearly half a day’s journey from the coast. To this isolated island, where the supply boat comes once a season, Tom brings a young, bold, and loving wife, Isabel. Years later, after two miscarriages and one stillbirth, the grieving Isabel hears a baby’s cries on the wind. A boat has washed up onshore carrying a dead man and a living baby. Tom, who keeps meticulous records and whose moral principles have withstood a horrific war, wants to report the man and infant immediately. But Isabel insists the baby is a “gift from God,” and against Tom’s judgment, they claim her as their own and name her Lucy. When she is two, Tom and Isabel return to the mainland and are reminded that there are other people in the world. Their choice has devastated one of them.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Johanna Walker is used to taking charge. But she’s about to meet someone who will make her lose control....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It has always been up to Johanna to care for her family, particularly her younger brother, Cole. With an absent father and a useless mother, she’s been making decisions based on what’s best for Cole for as long as she can remember. She even determines what men to date by how much they can provide for her brother and her, not on whatever sparks may—or may not—fly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But with Cameron MacCabe, the attraction is undeniable. The sexy new bartender at work gives her butterflies every time she looks at him. And for once, Jo is tempted to put her needs first. Cam is just as obsessed with getting to know Jo, but her walls are too solid to let him get close enough to even try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then Cam moves into the flat below Jo’s, and their blistering connection becomes impossible to ignore. Especially since Cam is determined to uncover all of Jo’s secrets …even if it means taking apart her defenses piece by piece.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Marked as prey, Alec refuses to fall for a werewolf. Until he's forced to turn to Liam for protection.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alec Ryerson carries a scar over his heart and scars on his psyche, ugly reminders of a nightmare that still doesn't seem quite real. Even a year later, he stays inside on full-moon nights and avoids most people until he meets the strange and beautiful Liam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam feels an undeniable pull toward Alec. However Liam is a werewolf; Alec is a human who clearly has trepidations about a relationship. Then Liam discovers he is not the first werewolf Alec has encountered. Alec has been marked for death by the murderous "quad," a group of twisted werewolves who prey on humans. Now the quad's sights are set on recruiting Liam's eight-year-old brother into their murderous pack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam will do everything in his power to protect both his brother and Alec from the wolves, even if it means calling in favors and killing those with whom he once ran. Because Alec, like it or not, is Liam's chosen mate.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Blockbuster #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jennifer Weiner returns with an irresistible story about a young woman trying to make it in Hollywood…&lt;/strong&gt;At twenty-three, Ruth Saunders left her childhood home in Massachusetts and headed west with her seventy-year-old grandma in tow, hoping to make it as a screenwriter. Six years later, she has hit the jackpot when she gets The Call: the sitcom she wrote, &lt;em&gt;The Next Best Thing, &lt;/em&gt;has gotten the green light, and Ruthie’s going to run the show. But her dreams of Hollywood happiness are threatened by demanding actors, number-crunching executives, an unrequited crush on her boss, and her grandmother’s impending nuptials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against the fascinating backdrop of Los Angeles show business culture, with an insider’s ear for writer’s room showdowns and an eye for bad backstage behavior and on-set politics, Jennifer Weiner’s novel is a rollicking ride on the Hollywood roller coaster, a heartfelt story about what it’s like for a young woman to love—and lose—in the land where dreams come true.</description>

  <description>Harlan, a fox shifter, lives a lonely life- but its a life he's chosen. When Shane, a gorgeous wolf, moves in next door and insists on being friends, Harlan's solitary, quiet lifestyle is put in jeopardy. And although Harlan finds himself growing more and more attracted to the wolf, his insecurities cripple him, and his self-doubt prevents him from admitting his true feelings for his new friend. But the longer he denies his feelings, the more strained their friendship becomes, until Harlan risks losing Shane entirely.</description>

  <description>The first in a rousing, funny, genre-busting trilogy from bestseller Jaclyn Moriarty!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a tale of missing persons. Madeleine and her mother have run away from their former life, under mysterious circumstances, and settled in a rainy corner of Cambridge (in our world).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elliot, on the other hand, is in search of his father, who disappeared on the night his uncle was found dead. The talk in the town of Bonfire (in the Kingdom of Cello) is that Elliot's dad may have killed his brother and run away with the Physics teacher. But Elliot refuses to believe it. And he is determined to find both his dad and the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Madeleine and Elliot move closer to unraveling their mysteries, they begin to exchange messages across worlds -- through an accidental gap that hasn't appeared in centuries. But even greater mysteries are unfolding on both sides of the gap: dangerous weather phenomena called "color storms;" a strange fascination with Isaac Newton; the myth of the "Butterfly Child," whose appearance could end the droughts of Cello; and some unexpected kisses...</description>

  <description>What does love sound like? If you hear it, will you heed its call?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police officer Jordan Waters is recovering from a shooting by moving to a new apartment in a new town and taking a new job. In other words, he’s lonely. His first instinct is to relieve his anxiety through uncomplicated sex—until he meets a man so far out of his league and experience that he stumbles for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police volunteer Sebastian Sumner may be deaf, but his spirit, openness, and sense of humor give him the strength to get through anything—even the emotional defenses of Jordan Waters. But it’s his own family history that poses the biggest challenge. Can he learn to trust Jordan with his heart, or will his upbringing blind him to the sounds of love?</description>

  <description>"Chaos is rejecting all you have learned, chaos is being yourself." – Emile M. Cioran&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the fluttering of a butterfly’s wing cause such a ripple in the world, it can change lives?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chaos theory says it can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with the sexual revolution of the permissive seventies and eighties, men remained men. But as childhood friends Tom and Will enter adulthood, for one of them maturity isn’t just growing from boy to man. He develops into someone completely new as surely as the butterfly emerges transformed from its chrysalis, irrevocably and chaotically also transforming both their worlds in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through battle ground bravado in Northern Ireland, drugs, sexual betrayal, IVF, transsexualism, and ‘forbidden’ love, they each search for courage to live life their way. Can love be strong enough to fly in the face of the chains of convention? The answer only becomes clear after events transpire to ultimately create a simple choice for them both; life or death, and they have to face the consequence of their choices.'</description>

  <description>Princess Una of Parumvir has come of age and will soon be married. She dreams of a handsome and charming prince, but when the first suitor arrives, she finds him stodgy and boring. Prince Aethelbald from the mysterious land of Farthestshore has traveled far to prove his love—and also to bring hushed warnings of danger. A dragon is rumored to be approaching Parumvir.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Una, smitten instead with a more dashing prince, refuses Aethelbald's offer—and ignores his warnings. Soon the Dragon King himself is in Parumvir, and Una, in giving her heart away unwisely, finds herself in grave danger. Only those courageous enough to risk everything have a hope of fighting off this advancing evil.</description>

  <description>Take one NFL tight end, and one Marine, add one week and watch the sparks fly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bowen Murphy craved two things, football and Dylan. After high school he had football but he lost Dylan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Sunday walked a different path, one laid down before him by his father and his grandfather. Losing Bo one day after discovering they shared more than football wasn’t part of the bargain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years of missed connections and finally Dylan is able to come home to the man he left behind. The spectacle of the biggest game in the NFL is only the beginning of one sizzling week. After that time and fate would decide if Bo and Dylan would walk the same path, or if one of them would make the ultimate sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: bittersweet tale of two hot men, making up for six years of separation. May not be suitable for sensitive readers. Contains scenes of male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Ways-from-Sunday-ebook/dp/B00CBP5SOA/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1365769860&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=six+ways+from+sunday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Six-Ways-from-S...&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;also available at Barnes and Noble and All Romance ebooks</description>

  <description>She's hitting below the belt…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Round 1&lt;br&gt;In this corner is admittedly romantic Jenna Wilinski, who's inherited a rather seedy boxing gym from her estranged father. With it, she can realize her dream of launching an upscale matchmaking business…provided she can take on the very intimidating—and wickedly hot—boxer who stands in her way!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Round 2&lt;br&gt;In the far corner is former pro boxer Mercer Rowley. He's the only one who can protect his "home"—even if it is a little run-down—from his determined and feisty little opponent. But man, once the gloves come off, his hands just want to touch her everywhere…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Round 3&lt;br&gt;This matchup is too close to call. But no matter which contender comes out on top, the other is sure to enjoy every minute of it….</description>

  <description>When a strange boy tumbles down a river embankment and lands at her feet, seventeen-year-old adrenaline junkie Deznee Cross snatches the opportunity to piss off her father by bringing the mysterious hottie with ice blue eyes home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except there’s something off with Kale. He wears her shoes in the shower, is overly fascinated with things like DVDs and vases, and acts like she’ll turn to dust if he touches her. It’s not until Dez’s father shows up, wielding a gun and knowing more about Kale than he should, that Dez realizes there’s more to this boy—and her father’s “law firm”—than she realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kale has been a prisoner of Denazen Corporation—an organization devoted to collecting “special” kids known as Sixes and using them as weapons—his entire life. And, oh yeah, his touch? It kills. The two team up with a group of rogue Sixes hellbent on taking down Denazen before they’re caught and her father discovers the biggest secret of all. A secret Dez has spent her life keeping safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A secret Kale will kill to protect.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller and acclaimed author Jennifer Finney Boylan returns with a remarkable memoir about gender and parenting, including incredible interviews discussing gender, how families are shaped, and the difficulties and wonders of being human.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A father for ten years, a mother for eight, and for a time in between, neither, or both ("the parental version of the schnoodle, or the cockapoo"), Jennifer Finney Boylan has seen parenthood from both sides of the gender divide. When her two children were young, Boylan came out as transgender, and as Jenny transitioned from a man to a woman and from a father to a mother, her family faced unique challenges and questions. In this thoughtful, tear-jerking, hilarious memoir, Jenny asks what it means to be a father, or a mother, and to what extent gender shades our experiences as parents. "It is my hope," she writes, "that having a father who became a woman in turn helped my sons become better men."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through both her own story and incredibly insightful interviews with others, including Richard Russo, Edward Albee, Ann Beattie, Augusten Burroughs, Susan Minot, Trey Ellis, Timothy Kreider, and more, Jenny examines relationships with fathers and mothers, people's memories of the children they were and the parents they became, and the many different ways a family can be. Followed by an Afterword by Anna Quindlen that includes Jenny and her wife discussing the challenges they've faced and the love they share, &lt;em&gt;Stuck in the Middle with You&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant meditation on raising – and on being – a child.</description>

  <description>Daredevil wrestler Brad Fraser throws his body around the ring to the cheers of the crowd, but when the lights go dark, he throws it from bed to bed to alleviate the boredom of travel. It all comes crashing down one night at the hands of the resident bad guy, but Brad finds himself rescued by the cool, suave Scott O’Doul, and the two men make a pact based on the illusion of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though their relationship begins as an arrangement of pleasure rather than commitment, over the course of a year on and off the road, Brad finds himself trusting Scott more and more. But Scott plays things close to the chest, and Brad isn't sure where he stands—until the night Scott nearly pushes him too far.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Divided by blood. Destined by fate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emory is a shifter living on the edge. For years he’s struggled with his Alpha nature. Then he meets the one woman capable of soothing the savage beast—Mary incites a carnal hunger that leaves him eager and burning. Sweet, kind and impossibly beautiful, Mary is everything he and his wolven half have been craving. Unfortunately, she’s also something else, something dangerous—a Shepherd, bred of the line of hunters determined to destroy his kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emory discovers earning Mary’s trust is the least of his concerns. Her relatives want Mary back. If Emory won’t hand her over, they’ll do everything in their power to take her from the pack. As danger closes in, the passionate connection between them flares into a lascivious bond that refuses to be broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Emory wants to keep his mate, he’ll have to protect her—at any cost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher’s Note: While&lt;/em&gt; Enemy Mine &lt;em&gt;is a standalone story, readers who start with book one, Omega Mine, may find added pleasure in the adventure.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Strawberries. Rivalry. Flirting. Warm summer days and a large, orange cat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, so I almost backed into the guy. But it was mostly his fault, and I did try to apologize.  Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome is a real jerk. Or at least I thought so till he stopped to offer me a lift when I ran out of gas.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>I knew a boy once.&lt;br&gt;He was a boy that changed everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't know Parker O’Neil outside of the occasional smile and wink. The AMA Supercross racer came to our small town one winter, and I had no idea what he was capable of. How could I have known that he would change my life forever that summer? Eventually, the occasional smile became a smile I grew to love and longed to see. The occasional wink became a gesture that made my soul sway and my heart ache. In the canyons of the desert, he showed me his lifestyle and his love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I didn't see was the control he had over me. It was a power the glitz and glamour of his professional lifestyle had and eventually what tore apart any life I thought I knew. In his world of banging bars and soaring jumps, there was no room for someone like me. But for five years, every time he called or touched me, everything changed again. It was a touch that could heal anything and a smile that could light even the darkest nights.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note: Alternate cover edition,&lt;/em&gt; ASIN:B00ATRCQV0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re looking for a story about a good, humble girl, who’s been hurt by someone she thought she could trust, only to find out she’s not as vulnerable as she thought she was and discovers an empowering side of herself that falls in love with the guy who helps her find that self, blah, blah, blah...then you’re gonna’ hate my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because mine is not the story you read every time you bend back the cover of the latest trend novel. It’s not the “I can do anything, now that I’ve found you/I’m misunderstood but one day you’ll find me irresistible because of it” tale. Why? Because, if I was being honest with you, I’m a complete witch. There’s nothing redeeming about me. I’m a friend using, drug abusing, sex addict from Los Angeles. I’m every girlfriend’s worst nightmare and every boy’s fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Sophie Price...And this is the story about how I went from the world’s most envied girl to the girl no one wanted around and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</description>

  <description>A mysterious stranger rescues Charlotte Stone from her sleazy ex-boyfriend at a museum auction. The same stranger that stared at her earlier with an intensity that rippled through her like a summer storm. Charlotte is definitely interested, until she learns more. Fact: Alex Andros is a brilliant attorney with one client — the alleged head of Boston ’s rackets. Gossip: He’s the racketeer’s lover. Curious, Charlotte accepts his offer of a drink and is captivated by his raw sex appeal. How could this seductively masculine man be gay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex knows the rumors and couldn’t care less. His sexual persuasion is no one’s business. He’s sworn off relationships, but Charlotte's allure is too strong; it mirrors the chemistry Alex experienced with the man who changed the way he loved. Charlotte ’s old boyfriend is determined to “out” Alex to win her back. But when Alex’s old lover shows up after seventeen years, he must confess his secret to prove he’s worthy of Charlotte ’s trust, or risk losing her forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual content, violence.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Necromancer is such an ugly word, but it's a title Eric Carter is stuck with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sees ghosts, talks to the dead. He’s turned it into a lucrative career putting troublesome spirits to rest, sometimes taking on even more dangerous things. For a fee, of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he left L.A. fifteen years ago he thought he’d never go back. Too many bad memories. Too many people trying to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now his sister’s been brutally murdered and Carter wants to find out why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was it the gangster looking to settle a score? The ghost of a mage he killed the night he left town? Maybe it’s the patron saint of violent death herself, Santa Muerte, who’s taken an unusually keen interest in him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carter’s going to find out who did it and he’s going to make them pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as they don’t kill him first.</description>

  <description>Cold Series, Book 1: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prison is a brutal, heartless, and demeaning environment. No one knows this better than a man sentenced to life in prison for murder. Lem Porter is a high-profile prisoner who had a solid career ahead of him in a field he loved until he killed his brother. He has spent almost eighteen years behind bars and doesn’t have much hope left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anderson Passero had it all. He built a career, a name, and a relationship with a man he thought he loved. Only after he very publicly landed in prison did he realize how ignorant he’d been. He has eight months left on his sentence and he is eager to go home and put prison life behind him. He doesn’t know it yet, but he will always carry these eight months with him, and they may just help him to understand what love really means.</description>

  <description>“Is it any wonder I became a bank robber?” said Robin. &lt;br&gt;But she never dreamed she’d fall in love…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15-year-old Robin McArthur thinks she has it all figured out when it comes to bilking her wealthy dad for guilt money as a substitute for his genuine affection. Until one day he suffers a stroke, and she learns the brutal truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re broke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And everyone from bankers to bookies has come to collect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His only saving grace is what he reveals to Robin in between drools: He truly does love her, in spite of all his mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Panicked and desperate, Robin figures she has two choices. Either surrender to the pestering caseworker and live in a skanky foster home, or take a chance and sneak her dad out of the hospital to make a run for it. Little does she know that stealing a car and hitting the road means that before the day is through, she will rob her first bank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now an outlaw, Robin finds a backwoods trailer park to hide her dad from authorities. There, she encounters Creek, a local bad boy who also commits crimes to provide for their motley neighbors. Realizing she could use Creek’s help, Robin proposes an ingenious plan—they should team up to rob banks together. But when their partnership leads to a romance that turns Robin’s world upside down, she soon begins to discover that people are more precious than pocketbooks, and real love means opening your heart to the kinds of treasures money can’t buy…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Earth, Wind &amp;amp; Fire aren't just a band anymore . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Used to be my greatest achievement was holding a job more than three days. Now suddenly I can shoot fireballs, chill your drink, or blow-dry your hair at fifty paces with a blink of my eye! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all started when this crazy scientist dropped something in my Grande Mocha Latte. Of course I got wicked sick. Next morning I'm waking up with this total hottie bending over me. He tells me 1)his name's Rome Masters, 2)he's a government agent and 3)I can control the four elements with a thought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He seems even less pleased by my (apparently irreversible) transformation than I am . . . Because now he'll have to kill me.</description>

  <description>Since his wife's death, world-famous author Ford Newcombe has lived a solitary life, void of creativity -- or love. Then Jackie Maxwell tears down the walls of his isolated world with her sassy wit and fierce intelligence. Ford's heart is touched by his vivacious assistant -- and his imagination sparked by her knowledge of a strange story that drives them to a small North Carolina town brimming with secrets. There, they will trace the mystery of a woman said to have loved the devil himself...and discover not only the truth about a crime from the past -- but a passion that holds the promise of a new life together. &lt;br&gt; Jude Deveraux, whose "enchanting and extraordinary" &lt;em&gt;(Chicago Daily Herald)&lt;/em&gt; novels have enthralled millions, creates two of her most memorable characters in this powerful bestseller.</description>

  <description>Ellie Brooks has spent the past two years of her life building barriers around herself that are guaranteed to keep people out and her demons in. She doesn't want to get close to anyone for fear of being hurt again. When she meets Latin superstar Victor Garza, she is shocked at how quickly he is able to penetrate her armor. She doesn't want to let him in but can't deny the chemistry they have. He has the potential to heal her wounds and open her heart but she isn't sure she can let him. Will love be enough to keep them together or will Ellie's past prove to be too much for the pair to overcome?</description>

  <description>Allison La Crosse, beginning a challenging family medicine residency, leaves the protection of her family. With the transfer, her worst nightmares come true. Her closely guarded mystical talents – those which seldom appeared before the move – unleash themselves from her confinement and reveal their presence with very little provocation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allison’s most terrifying power is her compulsion to cure the dying with her touch. Given her career, this gift would be valuable if she were not drawn like a magnet to the ailing person's every symptom. Some of which are fatal.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the hospital and surrounded by life-and-death emergencies, Allison’s inability to manage her impulse turns deadly. When it does, her mentor, Brody, rescues her from her own demise. His resuscitation ignites an exciting and tempestuous bond between them.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate for a cure, they join forces and embark upon a journey to uncover the origins of Allison’s lethal curse. In the midst of their adventure, Allison exposes a secret pursued by many…known by few.</description>

  <description>Emily Riddle has lived her entire life inside a patriarchal commune led by her father. There are many rules, but the most important one, 'keep it in the commune', is the most difficult for her to follow... especially since the only people willing to champion her cause live on the outside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Emily learns her father has promised her to Lorenzo, a perverted man who has plans for her that extend well beyond marriage and kids, she rebels. Regardless of the consequences, she refuses to marry someone who'd rather beat her than caress her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A day of hooky that starts out as a tiny act of defiance - sneaking out of the commune for a swim - turns into a day filled with hope. After spending time with Levi, a man camping near the lake, she finds what true romance looks like and catches a glimpse into a future that's filled with love and admiration rather than hate and submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That tiny peek is enough to change the course of Emily's existence and makes it nearly impossible for her to go back to the commune and pretend she'll ever be able to tolerate the life chosen for her instead of the life she longs for. One that includes Levi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fighting to escape the commune, its leaders, and her fiancé proves to be more dangerous than Emily expected. The secrets she knows, as the leader's daughter, will either follow her to the grave or send her - and Levi - there.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When Margaret Lea opened the door to the past, what she confronted was her destiny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All children mythologize their birth...&lt;/em&gt; So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter’s collection of stories, which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself—all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter’s story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida’s storytelling but remains suspicious of the author’s sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thirteenth Tale&lt;/em&gt; is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.</description>

  <description>Shy, introverted, Clive Barrow knows that he’s different.  He tries to keep to himself but that can be difficult for a boy growing up in a western-Georgia town as small as Crossroads.  His one outlet to “the world out there” is his only real friend, Ludy Porter. &lt;br&gt;     In the winter of 1950, in the throes of adolescence, the two go on a hunting trip.  High on a successful hunt, bold from overindulgence of illicit moonshine, libidos raging, Clive and Ludy have a sexual experience.&lt;br&gt;     For Ludy, the incident is all alcohol and hormones, something to be dismissed, never discussed, never repeated.  For Clive, however, the encounter awakens a profound new aspect of himself, a genie he can’t return to the bottle.&lt;br&gt;     But this is the 1950s in the Deep South.  Clive knows he can do, must do, nothing.  Being himself could not only destroy his lifelong friendship, it could cost him his life. &lt;br&gt;     The conflict drives him into a marriage he doesn’t want, a war he barely survives, and an obsession to drive out the demon within.  On the death of his abusive father, he takes on a hardscrabble farm and turns it into a lucrative cattle business.  All seems well until his old urges arise and he’s threatened with exposure and the loss of everything he’s built with his own two hands.  He retaliates the only way he knows to protect what he’s gained.&lt;br&gt;     A thing done once becomes easier a second time.  Or a third.  Or a fourth.&lt;br&gt;     Clive Barrow explores how a castigated sexual identity and unrequited love can push a human being into an instability that grows into something insane and terrifying.</description>

  <description>Jack Fontaine, summoned to the deathbed of his estranged sister, Dana, gets an odd request from her: keep the DVD she's made for her only daughter, Jenna, safe until her 18th birthday and have her watch it - alone. Jack feels the tug of family ties and agrees to fulfill her wish. Unfortunately, at the time of Dana's death Jack is confronted with a host of other issues, including criminals, deception and the possibility of losing his job at one of the top ad agencies in Boston. When Dana's DVD is seen by the wrong eyes and the hidden fortune she revealed on the tape is stolen, the entanglements between Jack, his lover Marc, a slick corporate recruiter named Cory, and Todd, a reprehensible felon who also works at the agency, quickly unfold to expose what actually happened and who lurks In the Shadow of Stone.</description>

  <description>Ransom Burke, the handsome, wealthy, gay CEO of Burke, Burke, and Hammett, has implemented a strict no-fraternization rule for his firm. And with good reason—his father's profligate ways almost destroyed the family company. Ransom’s new policy works well until he comes into the office one day and sees Parrish Rutledge, his new executive secretary. Ransom finds Parrish extremely attractive but fights his feelings. If he takes Parrish as a lover, he'll have to fire him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parrish has been alone since he was sixteen, having been tossed out by his older brother. He dreams of his boss but knows nothing can ever come of it. Then an office party becomes their undoing and they give in to their passion. As expected, Ransom offers Parrish a choice: stay and ignore what happened or leave the job and return to college. Neither option is even remotely appealing. If only Parrish could persuade Ransom there's a third possibility….</description>

  <description>Caine Neiheisel is stuck in a dead-end job at the end of a dead-end relationship when the chance of a lifetime falls in his lap. His mother inherits her uncle's sheep station in New South Wales, Australia, and Caine sees it as the opportunity to start over, out on the range where his stutter won't hold him back and his willingness to work will surely make up for his lack of knowledge. Unfortunately, Macklin Armstrong, the foreman of Lang Downs who should be Caine's biggest ally, alternates between being cool and downright dismissive, and the other hands are more amused by Caine's American accent than they are moved by his plight... until they find out he's gay and their amusement turns to scorn. It will take all of Caine's determination-and an act of cruel sabotage by a hostile neighbor-to bring the men of Lang Downs together and give Caine and Macklin a chance at love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This edition is no longer available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matthew Doner, ex-con, needs a second chance and his aunt’s inheritance will finance his dream. Julian Capeletti is a contractor in need of a job. Will renovating a house together let them become better men in the process?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matthew Doner has been given a second chance. Fresh from a five year prison term he is given a bequest from an aunt on the condition that he uses the money to make things right. His challenge—create a safe place for people like him to find purpose and start a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julian Capeletti likes challenges. He is confident, brash, and just what Matthew needs. Working as the contractor to renovate the crumbling house is the right job at the absolutely perfect time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What neither man realizes is just how dangerous it is to keep secrets, and how hard it can be to open your heart. Is one year enough time to renovate the house and become better men in the process?</description>

  <description>Best friends share everything with each other. Or do they? Seventeen-year-old Ashlyn Frances Lanski is tired of her boring, single life. Spending time with her best friend Tatiana, dreaming about kissing Tatiana's twin brother Fin, and swimming competitively are her only sanctuary. The girls plan to leave their drab lakeside town far behind for college. But when Tatchi fails to return home after a family emergency, and no one knows where the family has gone, Ash chooses to do something drastic to find them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashlyn is about to discover what she’d thought to be true her whole life, wasn’t, and the truth, too fantastical to imagine. Secrets lurk beneath the deep blue waters of Lake Tahoe, secrets that will change Ashlyn's life forever.</description>

  <description>Micah “Pup” Slayde knows he wants Tackett Austin the moment he lays eyes on him in the Guards of Folsom. Micah wants to have purpose, to be taken care of, and to take care of his Dom—wants to trust him completely, live for him, belong to him. To become his everything. Micah is sure Tackett is the one. The problem is, in order to be the perfect sub, he needs to stay focused, and that’s not easy for Micah, who suffers from what he refers to as a “broken brain.” Focus and adult attention deficit disorder rarely coexist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since Ty Callahan and Blake Henderson’s collaring ceremony, Tackett’s been thinking too much about his own loneliness. Even though Ty introduces Micah and urges Tackett to give him a try, Tackett isn’t so easily convinced. He’s spent his life pursuing a successful business career, and the subs he dominates almost never enjoy the kiss of his leather twice. Twenty years Micah’s senior, Tackett has no interest in taking on and taming such a young and naughty sub—but it’s difficult to resist such an adorable pup when he begs.</description>

  <description>How can love mend a heart full of hate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Small town girl, Molly Bennett, moves to Los Angeles where she becomes an outsider while attending Beverly Hills High School. It seems life cannot be any more dreadful. Then one day after school, something magical happens. On a secluded hike in the Hollywood Hills, Molly chases her disobedient mutt and only friend into a hidden cavern. She stumbles upon a strange glimmering gateway that transports her to Arkana, a planet that is the cradle of an advanced human race. There, teenagers navigate amazing flying vehicles, compete in perilous games for glory, and possess supernatural powers. While Molly tries to wrap her mind around this unbelievable discovery, she meets the alluring and mysterious Victor Sorren. He is a Sentinel Apprentice, whose hatred toward people from Earth is beyond understanding. Yet every time Victor unpredictably saves Molly's life, his heart draws closer to hers, no matter how much he tries to fight against it. It further complicates things that their growing friendship is strictly forbidden. Earth people are prohibited in Arkana, yet Molly continues to cross through the portal to Arkana to see Victor. Torn between their double lives, they go down a dangerous path, from where there is no return and multiple endings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fields of Elysium is a suspenseful romantic tale full of forbidden secrets, danger, deception, and the never-ending fight for true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visit the author's page: &lt;a href="http://abwhelan.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://abwhelan.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like her on Facebook: A.B.Whelan Author</description>

  <description>Ornithologist Hunter Devereaux lost everything in the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and was forced to go underground as a matter of survival. He's just getting back to his feet, hiding among the native falconers at the Dubai Falcon Hospital, when a phone call from America threatens to drag his secret past to light and tear down the walls he's built around his broken heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Bittersweet Dreams title: It's an unfortunate truth: love doesn't always conquer all. Regardless of its strength, sometimes fate intervenes, tragedy strikes, or forces conspire against it. These stories of romance do not offer a traditional happy ending, but the strong and enduring love will still touch your heart and maybe move you to tears.</description>

  <description>An Opposites Attract novel.&lt;br&gt;Fresh from backwoods Minnesota, actuarial student Ben Dutoit is ecstatic to land a job with Sydney Sutherland Family Insurance, one of the few companies that offers life insurance to people in the high-risk category. The fact that he gets to work in Gay Central, aka San Francisco, is just the icing on the rainbow-colored cake. Ben sets himself just three goals: be out and proud enough to participate in the Pride parade; seek out the company of like-minded souls in the clubs; and maybe, if he's lucky, fall in love. But the men Ben meets are everything he's not: suave, confident, sophisticated, and sexy. Unlike redneck Ben, they're blue bloods from blue states, born with status, wealth, and the responsibility that comes with the package. Ben's still wondering if red and blue can mix when he discovers what risk really means. The global economy tanks. The job he looked forward to is in jeopardy, and every dream Ben ever had is threatened, especially love, the biggest dream of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The seduction of his enemy is the ultimate hunt…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his mortal enemy, the handsome and deadly Colton Dècarie, shows up on his doorstep asking an unspeakable favor, Killian Frost is cautious—and curious. What could drive a shape-shifter to beg a werewolf for an honorable death in the line of duty—defending humans from soul-stealing Lycans? Moreover, why ask Killian, who has kept his own feet off that dark path?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton’s conflicted heart can take no more of the violence that consumes more of his humanity with every hunt. Even now, Killian’s werewolf scent makes him burn with the instinctive urge to shift and destroy. Death would be a mercy, but the price is impossibly simple: one night of submission in Killian’s bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet as Killian extracts payment in flesh and pleasure, Colton finds himself giving all that’s demanded of him and more, feeling something he hasn’t felt in a long time. Alive. And Killian discovers the hidden cost of sleeping with the enemy. To keep the balance between light and dark, &lt;em&gt;Bella Luna &lt;/em&gt;binds his Lycan blood with a quest to unravel a conspiracy threatening all his kind. If he’s brave enough, he’ll discover a love that means more than the power of a dead man’s soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Contains plotting and scheming, a wicked, whip-wielding werewolf whose favorite word is&lt;/em&gt; “Mine” &lt;em&gt;and a sexy shifter bound with red ribbon whose favorite reply is&lt;/em&gt; “I hate you”.</description>

  <description>At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn’t the monster Conor’s been expecting — he’s been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he’s had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The monster in his backyard is different. It’s ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd — whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself — Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.</description>

  <description>Steve Campbell used to be a player, until a mid-life crisis opened his eyes to his long-repressed love for Connor, his soon-to-be-married best friend and business partner. Coming out at thirty-eight means learning how to date all over again, and this time, Steve’s not willing to settle for empty one-night stands. He wants the real thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gil Alvarez has never had it easy, struggling through childhood and rejected by his family for a body that didn’t match who he was inside. A skilled driver and mechanic, he’s working hard to make his auto shop a success. The last thing he needs is a rich white guy in a candy-apple-red Ferrari tempting him, but Steve’s ready smile and easygoing manner prove irresistible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One brief, intimate encounter leaves them both hungry for more. Gil’s not ashamed of who he is, but he’s terrified that Steve will reject him—or worse—when he discovers what Gil can’t find the courage to tell him.</description>

  <description>"When love's for sale, who really pays?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor Morrison is a 3-D optics pioneer, the star of the UC Berkeley physics department, and a socially inept workaholic. And with his dear friend and business partner, Steve Campbell, handling their investors, he's content to remain in the shadows. That is, until he meets the gorgeous and starry-eyed physics student Wes Martin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wes is brilliant but broke. Ever since his scholarship fell victim to the financial crisis, he's had no choice but to sell his body to stay in school. Already half in love with Connor, Wes initially resists Steve's offer to be Connor's thirty-fifth birthday present. But in the end, Wes is too broke--and too smitten--to say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor has no idea Steve bought Wes's attentions, and he quickly falls under the young man's spell. Yet after one night together, Wes disappears. He can't bear to hook with a man he could so easily grow to love, but he also can't bear to tell him the truth. Besides, if he sleeps with Connor again, there'd be no way to hide the bruises one of his regular johns loves to inflict. Only one thing to do: let Connor go. Walking away is painful, but not nearly as much as building a relationship on lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader discretion advised. This title contains the following sensitive themes: non-consent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This title is part of the 2012 Rentboy Collection.)</description>

The landlord of her lakeside cottage, Flynn Beckett, is a vision straight from one of her naughtiest sex dreams. She's never worked this hard to interest a man, but there is something about Flynn that tells Lacey he's worth it. After catching Flynn's attention, Lacey taps into his secretive erotic side and they begin to play with a passion that could consume them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, a criminal roadie fresh out of prison, is ready to exact revenge on Lacey's best friend, Annie Logan. His destructive trek north to carry out his plan has law enforcement racing from one crime scene to the next in hopes of catching him before he reaches the tiny lakeside town Lacey and Annie have been calling home. Neither Lacey, Annie or Flynn are aware of the approaching danger...until it is too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you enjoyed reading, Sheet Music: A Rock 'n' Roll Love Story, you will love Lacey's story. Another wild romp on and off the stage and in and out of bed, Lacey's story will not disappoint.</description>

  <description>Evangelina Green Maddox thought the remodeling of her childhood summer home could have gone a lot smoother.  Construction problems, rain delays, werewolves, vampires... yeah, just a few things had gone wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her two other 'summer sisters' arriving early, completed the chaos. One was gravely ill, with a mysterious blood disorder, and the other now had her own problems. No spoilers! They each had their own talents. Lina spoke with ghosts and had an affinity with animals. That power was now doubled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the romance with Keaton Wolfe was the biggest change. Why her? She thought herself plain and ordinary. He saw her as she really was. Sexy and VERY desirable. Would she blow it or let him into her bed and into her heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a black witch on their trail, under a demon's command, and wolves circling the property, what else could go wrong?!</description>

  <description>Daniel Stewart, Chief Petty Officer and dedicated Corpsmen, works at the Naval Hospital in Naples, Italy where he carries around two big secrets: one, he’s gay; and two, he’s in love with a very sexy Navy doctor, Ryker Kincaid, who he’s been having an affair with for a year. Yes, Don't Ask, Don't Tell may be gone, but military rules that prevent officers and enlisted from dating are still in place. Ryker and Daniel have to keep their relationship hush-hush or face discharge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ryker elects to leave the Navy after his current tour is up, all of Daniel’s future plans for their careers are blown to bits and causes Daniel to spiral out of control. Will Daniel’s rash decision cost them everything or push their relationship to the next level?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Advisory: This story has been previously released as part of the Emergency Servicing anthology by Total-E-Bound</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a world free of bloodshed and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not that world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art student and monster's apprentice Karou finally has the answers she has always sought. She knows who she is—and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; she is. But with this knowledge comes another truth she would give anything to undo: She loved the enemy and he betrayed her, and a world suffered for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this stunning sequel to the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/em&gt;, Karou must decide how far she'll go to avenge her people. Filled with heartbreak and beauty, secrets and impossible choices, &lt;em&gt;Days of Blood &amp;amp; Starlight&lt;/em&gt; finds Karou and Akiva on opposing sides as an age-old war stirs back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Karou and her allies build a monstrous army in a land of dust and starlight, Akiva wages a different sort of battle: a battle for redemption. For &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can any hope be salvaged from the ashes of their broken dream?</description>

  <description>Paris, 1937. Andras Lévi, a Hungarian-Jewish architecture student, arrives from Budapest with a scholarship, a single suitcase, and a mysterious letter he promised to deliver. But when he falls into a complicated relationship with the letter's recipient, he becomes privy to a secret that will alter the course of his—and his family’s—history. From the small Hungarian town of Konyár to the grand opera houses of Budapest and Paris, from the despair of Carpathian winter to an unimaginable life in labor camps, &lt;em&gt;The Invisible Bridge &lt;/em&gt;tells the story of a family shattered and remade in history’s darkest hour.</description>

  <description>Mitchell has a problem. He’s a little too small where it counts. The guys on the swim team have started calling him Jumbo — a cruel joke — and meanwhile he’s in love with his best friend, Luke. But when Mitchell starts receiving love letters in his locker, can they really be from Luke? Or are they from someone big enough to love him just the way he is?</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Kyra, a highly-skilled potions master, is the only one who knows her kingdom is on the verge of destruction—which means she’s the only one who can save it. Faced with no other choice, Kyra decides to do what she does best: poison the kingdom’s future ruler, who also happens to be her former best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, for the first time ever, her poisoned dart . . . misses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a fugitive instead of a hero, Kyra is caught in a game of hide-and-seek with the king’s army and her potioner ex-boyfriend, Hal. At least she’s not alone. She’s armed with her vital potions, a too-cute pig, and Fred, the charming adventurer she can’t stop thinking about. Kyra is determined to get herself a second chance (at murder), but will she be able to find and defeat the princess before Hal and the army find her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyra is not your typical murderer, and she’s certainly no damsel-in-distress—she’s the lovable and quick-witted hero of this romantic novel that has all the right ingredients to make teen girls swoon.</description>

  <description>Sometimes it seems to Seth like more trouble than it's worth to keep going on, to keep living and breathing and hurting and going to school with guys who hate him, and hiding who he is from everyone around him. Seth is sixteen, in the closet, and about ready to give up on life. But for his brother Jory, making an unexpected visit home from college, nothing is more trouble than it's worth to keep his little brother alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author and Editor royalties from this book will go to The Trevor Project.</description>

  <description>Morgan Drake is the only witness to a murder in an alleyway. Nik Valentinov works for Sanctuary, a foundation offering witness protection to anyone whose safety is compromised. Morgan discovers a bodyguard's arms can offer more than protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan Drake witnesses a murder in an alleyway. He is the only person who can give evidence in prosecuting the cop responsible for the crime. When the FBI safe house where he's being held is compromised, he follows the instructions of the agent in charge and runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nik Valentinov works for Sanctuary, a foundation that offers witness protection when FBI security is questionable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Morgan's handler sends him to Nik for safety, neither Morgan nor Nik could imagine that two weeks alone in a cabin in the woods would have their hearts racing with something much more than merely trying to keep Morgan alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love.</description>

  <description>A dangerous infatuation with a rough and ready man…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erin Coffey has been a nurse for years, but nothing’s prepared her for the physical and emotional demands of her new position. Needing to move closer to her dysfunctional family, she takes a dangerous job at Larkhaven Psychiatric Hospital, where she quickly learns that she needs protection—and she meets the strong, over-confident coworker who’s more than willing to provide it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelly Robak is the type of guy that Erin has sworn she’d never get involved with. She’s seen firsthand, via her mess of a sister, what chaos guys like him can bring into a woman’s life. But she finds herself drawn to him anyway, even when he shows up at her door, not eager to take no for an answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Erin finds even more shocking than Kelly’s indecent proposal is how much she enjoys submitting to his every command. But he can’t play the tough guy indefinitely. If they want to have more than just an affair, both will have to open up and reveal what they truly need.</description>

  <description>From the moment nurse Skylar meets the very sexy Detective Trevor Stanton at the hospital where he works sparks fly. Too bad it never seems to work out between them. Former relationships, near misses, and even after a hot night of steamy sex- it’s one opportunity after another slipping away from them. Maybe it’s not meant to be for them. Or maybe with just a little effort they'll both find the right time for love.</description>

  <description>When David Carmichael suffers a migraine and then a broken shoulder, Trace Jackson, his best friend, simply moves in to take care of him. Their easy camaraderie continues with no problems until David discovers an undercurrent of heat and tension flowing between them. Despite knowing his best friend is straight, David is slowly falling in love. What he doesn't know is that Trace is struggling with a similar discovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trace has never desired another man before. He's a ladies' man with quite the reputation, considered a top prize around town. But his close, treasured friendship with David makes the emotion and arousal growing between them irresistible. Soothing David's doubts, Trace makes it clear that he wants to know if they can make it work. Because Trace is sure he wouldn't love another man — that's not the issue. He just loves David.</description>

  <description>A violent, fast-paced and compelling debut fantasy novel, in a world where heroes and monsters are not quite as they seem...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a world dominated by The Wild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man lives in pockets of civilisation claimed from The Wild. Within men's walls life is civilised, the peace punctuated by tournaments, politicking, courtly love and canny business. Beyond those walls men are prey - vulnerable to the exceptionally powerful and dangerous creatures which populate the land and even more vulnerable to those creatures schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when one of those creatures breaks out of The Wild and begins preying on people in their homes, it takes a specialist to hunt it down or drive it out...and even then, it's a long, difficult and extremely dangerous job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Black Captain and his men are one such group of specialists. They have no idea what they're about to face...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forget George and the Dragon. Forget Sir Lancelot and tales of Knightly exploits. This is dirty, bloody work. This is violent, visceral action. This is a mercenary knight as you've never seen one before.</description>

  <description>The media has a nickname for Marnie Baranuik, though she’d rather they didn’t; they call her the Great White Shark, a rare dual-talented forensic psychic. Twice-Touched by the Blue Sense--which gives her the ability to feel the emotions of others, and read impressions left behind on objects--Marnie also has a doctorate in preternatural biology and a working knowledge of the dark arts. She is considered without peer in the psychic community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then her first big FBI case ended with a bullet in one shoulder and a chip on the other, a queasy heart and a serial killer in the wind, leaving her a public flop and a private wreck. When the FBI’s preternatural crimes unit tracks her down at a remote mountain lodge for her insight on a local case, her quiet retirement is promptly besieged by a stab-happy starlet, a rampaging ghoul, and a vampire-hunting jackass in tight Wranglers. Marnie figures the only real mystery is which one will kill her first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too mean to die young, backed up by friends in cold places, and running with a mouth as demure as a cannon’s blast, Marnie Baranuik is about to discover that there’s no such thing as quitting time when you’re Touched.</description>

  <description>"The City of Lovely Brothers" is a family saga, the history of Caladelphia Ranch, jointly owned by four brothers, Calvin, Caleb, Calhoun and Caliban Caldwell and how it grew and prospered, and how rivalry between the brothers led to its breaking up and decline.  As the story evolves, it focuses on the love affair between the youngest brother, Caliban, who is lame, and Nick, one of their ranch hands, and how their relationship set the stage for the already open feud to explode and ultimately caused the demise of the ranch.</description>

Being a freshman in college was supposed to create some of the best memories of her life, especially with her best friend, Lauren, and longtime boyfriend, Sander, by her side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the excitement begins to slip away when the people closest to her start to change. They begin moving in a direction Lilly doesn’t want to go, forcing Lilly to be faced with a decision. Should she fight for her relationships with both Sander and Lauren or move on to something different? Something unknown. Someone like…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton Davenport.

She can’t look away, doesn’t want to look away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilly must decide between a life with Sander, a life she always thought she wanted, and an unknown path with Colton. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Lilly make the right choices for her future, Becoming More?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;**This book is a New Adult Romance - intended for a mature audience.**&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Preston Fawkes is ten the first time he meets fifteen-year-old Konrad Schnell at the San Antonio Polo Club. Captivated by the mystique surrounding the sport of kings, Pres vows to learn the game at the hands of his newly acquired friend and mentor. The hero worship soon grows into something deeper, but the friends are separated when Preston goes off to boarding school in England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relationship that follows is riddled with challenges―their age gap, physical distance, and parental pressure taking precedence over feelings yet to be explored. Although their bond goes deep, they deal with the reality of their situation differently: Preston is open and fearless while Konrad is reticent and all too aware of the social implications of making a public stand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their paths intersect and twine, binding them as tightly as a cowboy’s lasso, but fate may alter their plans. How will love overcome the divots in the turf as they gallop toward the future—one where obstacles no longer stand in their way?</description>

  <description>Jacob Timber is hopelessly crushing on very private radio personality Ethan Moore—host of the most famous Indie music radio show on London’s 113.9, the Jukebox Hour—but being in love with a voice isn’t much different than being alone. Jacob’s not even sure the man is gay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob is so infatuated that all he wants for his birthday is to meet his crush in person—and he gets his wish. With Ethan and Jacob, it’s love at first sight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But do dreams really come true? Despite how he feels in Ethan’s arms, Jacob doubts it. He knows he’ll never be happy with a man who pretends to love him, only to bring his true girlfriend to public events.</description>

  <description>Danny is young, gay, and homeless. He lives in the park, preferring to avoid attention, but when thugs confront a stranger, Danny rushes to his rescue. He and the would-be victim, Harry, form a cautious friendship that deepens months later, when Harry persuades Danny to visit his home. Daring to believe he has found happiness, Danny finds his world turned upside down yet again when tragedy strikes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until he runs out of options, Danny won’t trust anyone. Finally he has to accept the offer of a home, and Danny becomes David, but adjusting to a new life isn’t easy. When he meets the mysterious Jack, it stirs up feelings he thought were long gone. Can David dare to allow himself to love? Or will the truth bring his new world tumbling down around him?</description>

  <description>Sometimes all you need is Patience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life’s been hard for Zeke. Being a punching bag for his alcoholic father has turned him into stone. Not even the dodgy trailer park he lives in can scare him. Fighting is his release and sex, drugs, and his guitar bring him peace, but deep down Zeke isn’t quite as hard as he makes himself out to be. When he meets Patience, she finds all his broken pieces and puts him back together, but she’s a ray of light in his shadowed life and the last thing he wants to do is bring her into his dark world. Playing careless is easy, playing the bad guy can be fun, but playing Patience is impossible, especially when she can see right through him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zeke isn’t the only one who’s broken, and for the first time, in a long time, Patience feels alive. Her black and white world gets a shot of color when she meets Zeke. He’s unlike anyone she’s ever met with his tattoos, piercings, and blunt honesty. She wants nothing more than to let go and ride the wild side with him, but some wounds never heal and the broken pieces of Patience aren’t so easy to find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young adult readers.***</description>

  <description>Graham is a writer. He's a slob yet precise to the core. He'd live on spicy Thai and crunchy peanut butter for the rest of his life, if his best friend, Ira, would allow. Ira, a house painter, unimposing, bossy, and generally boring. Not someone most would think fit for someone borderline famous. Then again, they do say that love is blind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slash / One Shot / From prompt: Blind Man&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 6,399</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There are two sides to every love story. Now hear Will’s.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colleen Hoover’s New York Times bestselling Slammed series has brought countless readers to their knees with a whirlwind of love, passion, and heartache. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Layken and Will’s love has managed to withstand the toughest of circumstances and the young lovers, now married, are beginning to feel safe and secure in their union. As much as Layken relishes their new life together, she finds herself wanting to know everything there is to know about her husband, even though Will makes it clear he prefers to keep the painful memories of the past where they belong. Still, he can’t resist his wife’s pleas and so he begins to untangle his side of the story, revealing for the first time his most intimate feelings and thoughts, retelling both the good and bad moments, and sharing a few shocking confessions of his own from the time when they first met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;This Girl&lt;/em&gt;, Will tells the story of their complicated relationship from &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;point of view. Their future rests on how well they deal with the past in this final installment of the beloved Slammed&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the follow-up to Colleen Hoover’s #1 New York Times bestseller &lt;em&gt;Hopeless&lt;/em&gt;, the charming and irresistible Dean Holder tells the passionate story that has melted thousands of hearts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hopeless&lt;/em&gt;, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but Holder’s past remained a mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent his entire life searching for her in an attempt to finally rid himself of the crushing guilt he has felt for years. But he could not have anticipated that the moment they reconnect, even greater remorse would overwhelm him…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes in life, if we wish to move forward, we must first dig deep into our past and make amends. In &lt;em&gt;Losing Hope&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Colleen Hoover reveals what was going on inside Holder’s head during all those hopeless moments—and whether he can gain the peace he desperately needs.</description>

  <description>My name’s David Bradley, a 20-year-old American student living in Paris, France. About a year ago, my dad lost his job and my mom had to take a pay cut, which forced me to reassess my life. Fortunately, they gave me an educational plan, and while it pays for my tuition and some of my living expenses, it’s not nearly enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This forced me to take up a part-time job as a waiter and as an English-language tutor, but even those barely covered my extras. One evening at work, I met a very well to do gentleman, and thanks to him, I’ve learned to make so much more money as a call-boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s still not enough. I want something that money can’t buy. I want a man to love me.</description>

Happily ever after is a far cry from reality in her world. But, when she is reconnected with her past, the bonds that form are irrefutable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When River Wilde, lead singer of The Wilde Ones, comes back into Dahlia’s life, the intensity that fires their relationship combined with underlying feelings that have never died lead her to believe she has met her soul mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling with confusion as old connections fade and new ones begin, Dahlia's grief begins to lift—but guilt remains. River wants to be the one to mend all that is torn within her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with a past that is never really gone, can their future survive?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The highly anticipated finale to the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling trilogy that began with &lt;em&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After traveling through time in &lt;em&gt;Shadow of Night&lt;/em&gt;, the second book in Deborah Harkness’s enchanting series, historian and witch Diana Bishop and vampire scientist Matthew Clairmont return to the present to face new crises and old enemies. At Matthew’s ancestral home at Sept-Tours, they reunite with the cast of characters from &lt;em&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/em&gt;—with one significant exception. But the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency. In the trilogy’s final volume, Harkness deepens her themes of power and passion, family and caring, past deeds and their present consequences. In ancestral homes and university laboratories, using ancient knowledge and modern science, from the hills of the Auvergne to the palaces of Venice and beyond, the couple at last learn what the witches discovered so many centuries ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  With more than one million copies sold in the United States and appearing in thirty-eight foreign editions, &lt;em&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of Night&lt;/em&gt; have landed on all of the major bestseller lists and garnered rave reviews from countless publications. Eagerly awaited by Harkness’s legion of fans, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Life&lt;/em&gt; brings this superbly written series to a deeply satisfying close. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In a future Earth, Patrick Harvey, newly promoted Class One Empath, dreams of the independence his position brings and the apartment he’s saving for. His first solo assignment is treating John Doe 439, a man found outside the city, battered, traumatized, and apparently mute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite a strong taboo against Empaths forging romantic relationships, Patrick realizes he feels a strong attraction to his patient. Soon he learns the man is a high-level Psychic Talent named Jac. Then Jac reveals that there are abusive people hunting him for his gifts, and Patrick’s uncomplicated world explodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jac needs to meet up with his companions and flee the city before anyone else can find him—but it may be too late. Word of Jac’s talents has leaked to Central Government in Chicago. If Jac wants to retain his freedom, he needs to run—now. And if Patrick wants to explore a relationship his society tells him he can’t have, he’ll have to exchange the safe fetters of his job for the uncertainty of liberty.</description>

  <description>"Love is a battlefield."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discharged under Don t Ask Don t Tell, former Marine major Cole Hammond is struggling to find a new identity. But PTSD casts a pall on everything, and his hard-nosed, homophobic father can t even bear to look him in the eye. To top it all off, he s pretty sure he s flunking out of law school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marc Sullivan is a kind, sensitive romance author-slash-waiter with a thing for men in uniform. Cole s not wearing his anymore, but there s no mistaking the warrior Marc meets in the diner one rainy afternoon. Cole s sexy smile and Carolina drawl prove irresistible, but Marc s played this game before, and he always loses. Once a Marine, always a Marine, and if there s one thing Marc knows about such men, it s that they all leave him in the end. It doesn t help that Cole s practically closeted in public, or that he refuses to seek treatment for his PTSD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But like any good Marine, Cole s willing to fight for what matters. And like the characters in Marc s stories, he s certain that if they try just hard enough, together they can find their own happily ever after.</description>

  <description>"I'll do anything." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staff Sergeant Jasper "Ace" Atchison takes one look at Private Sonny Daye and knows that every word on paper about him is pure, unadulterated bullshit. But Sonny is desperate, and although Ace isn't going to take him up on his offer of "anything," that doesn't mean he isn't tempted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, Ace takes Sonny under his wing, protecting him when they're in the service and making plans with him when they get out. Together, they're going to own a garage and build race cars and make their fortune hurtling faster than light across the desert. Together, they're going to rewrite the past, make Sonny Daye a whole and happy person, and put the ghosts in Ace's heart to rest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not even Sonny can build a car fast enough to escape the ghosts of the past. When Sonny's ghosts drive them down and run their plans off the road, Ace finds out exactly what he's made of. Maybe Sonny was the one to promise Ace anything, but there is nothing under the sun Ace won't do to keep Sonny safe from harm.</description>

  <description>The race to the Still Blue has reached a stalemate. &lt;em&gt;Aria and Perry are determined to find this last safe haven from the Aether storms before Sable and Hess do--&lt;/em&gt;and they are just as determined to stay together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within the confines of a cave they're using as a makeshift refuge, they struggle to reconcile their people, Dwellers and Outsiders, who are united only in their hatred of their desperate situation. Meanwhile, time is running out to rescue Cinder, who was abducted by Hess and Sable for his unique abilities. Then Roar arrives in a grief-stricken fury, endangering all with his need for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of options, Perry and Aria assemble an unlikely team for an impossible rescue mission. Cinder isn't just the key to unlocking the Still Blue and their only hope for survival--he's also their friend. And in a dying world, the bonds between people are what matter most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this final book in her earth-shattering Under the Never Sky trilogy, Veronica Rossi raises the stakes to their absolute limit and brings her epic love story to an unforgettable close.</description>

  <description>Emariya's life was nearly over before it started. Hidden under the floorboards while her mother died above her, she escaped a brutal death then—only to go racing toward it now, sixteen years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After learning her father has been captured, Emariya is desperate to save him, no matter who she has to turn to for help. Oblivious to her potential gifts and the secrets surrounding her dual heritage, Emariya makes a bargain with the prince of a rival land, Torian Ahlen. In exchange for her hand in marriage, he agrees to send his forces to rescue her father. With the arrangements made, Emariya embarks on a tumultuous journey through two kingdoms as different from each other as the families that rule them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before long, Emariya comes face to face with her mother's killers, and learns of an ominous prophecy: her and Torian's bloodlines must never be combined. Armed with this frightening new knowledge, Emariya begins to fear the handsome prince may desire more than to steal her heart, and it will take all of her newfound skills to survive.</description>

  <description>Delilah Palmer has control of her life and outward personality, blocking the truth just below the surface. A façade meant to be normal and hide the scars of her childhood. She’s made a good life for herself, became a lawyer, and is free from the tortured past that haunts her daily. Until he comes along and breaks open the cracks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Thorne has a past of his own. On the surface he is loved by all, personable, extroverted; everything Delilah isn’t. Hidden beneath is a dark and tormented man that only Delilah has to power to unveil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crammed in a small office together they see through each other’s masks, and the draw becomes too much, igniting an explosive relationship. Holloway and Holloway Law has a strict non-fraternization policy, forcing them to conceal their breach. Despite their efforts, separation becomes impossible, deceptions escalate, and Nathan has trouble coping; teetering on the edge of being overtaken by his past demons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What secrets does he harbor that could keep him from giving in? What keeps him from healing and moving forward? And Delilah, where does she fit into all this turmoil?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they accept love and deal with all the trials that come their way when secrets are exposed? Or will they fall through the cracks of their pasts and be consumed by all that haunts them?</description>

  <description>It’s been six years since Dylanie and her family visited a Civil War site and the place came alive with cannon fire. Problem was, no one could hear it but her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she’s sixteen, her dad’s moved out, her mom’s come out of the closet and Dylan’s got a spot on Paranormal Teen, a reality TV show filming at historic Oakleigh Mansion. She’ll spend a weekend with two other psychic teens—Jake and Ashley—learning how to control her abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of them realized how much their emotional baggage would put them at the mercy of Oakleigh’s resident spirits, or that they’d find themselves pawns in the 150-year-old battle for the South’s legendary Confederate gold. Each must conquer their personal ghosts to face down Jackson, a seductive spirit who will do anything to protect the gold’s current location and avenge a heinous attack that destroyed his family.</description>

  <description>Ian and Aiden are identical twin brothers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having moved to London against their better judgment and without the safety net of parental help, they find themselves barely able to scrap enough to pay their bills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Aiden breaks his back working an array of temp jobs, Ian keeps his much more profitable career a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything seems to be working well enough for the brothers, even if their natural closeness starts to strain due to the incompatibility of their schedules. However, when a client says the words Ian would have never liked to hear, their life descends into a complex and dangerous downward spiral that could disintegrate their relationship to its very core.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his first novella, Mike McAvoy revisits the themes of fame, forbidden liasons and the nature of love, and its survival in the grip of power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through erotic and enticing scenes, McAvoy takes us through an emotional and moving journey as we witness two of his most enthralling characters struggle to reach happiness against all odds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike McAvoy has released exclusively through Yellow Mill Publishing, Sugardaddy: A Love Story, and the upcoming enTWINed Collection. He is currently writing his first full length novel.</description>

  <description>Andrew is a starstruck teenager. Robert is a music industry mogul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all starts when Andrew, wanting to pursue a career in showbiz, writes a letter to Robert McIntosh, whom he deems the most powerful man in the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, as time passes, Andrew will discover that to him, Robert is not merely a surefire ticket to stardom; and, through doubt and sorrow, Robert will realize that love doesn't always find us the way we expect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A collection of short stories, rather than a traditional novella, Mike McAvoy uses his unique style to take us through an unexpectedly touching and erotic journey as Andrew and Robert find out that true love can be hiding in the dustiest corners of what society at large would label nothing short of immoral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All characters are of legal age.</description>

  <description>Genres: Romance, Contemporary Fantasy, Yaoi (M/M erotic romance).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been several years since the end of the Mage wars. Those born with the taint of magic are sent to places like Spiretown, a city within a city that serves as a prison for its inhabitants. Logan Grey is the self-proclaimed mayor of this ghetto, but he’s suddenly found himself in some trouble, and he needs help from an unlikely source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Templar Battalion Commander Collin Anderfels is having a very bad week. His fiancée left him for his best friend, he was blown up in a raid gone wrong, and now he’s been forced to protect a man who represents everything that Collin loathes. Worse still is the fact that Logan Grey keeps saving his life, and he seems intent on bedding the young Commander, despite Collin's sometimes violent protests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow, beyond prejudice and deceit these two unlikely partners find themselves becoming more than just allies, but can a love born from lies survive when the gates of hell are torn open?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UK purchase link: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spiretown-ebook/dp/B00AHH0UQK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spiretown-ebo...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Reclusive weaver Sonny Bly James controls every color and shape in his tapestries, but he can’t control the pattern of his life—a random encounter with Luki Vasquez, ex-ATF agent and all-around badass, makes that perfectly clear. The mutual attraction is immediate, but love-shy Sonny has retreated from life, and Luki wears his visible and not-so-visible scars like armor. Neither can bare his soul with ease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While they run from desire, they can’t hide from the evil that hunts them. After it becomes clear that a violent stalker has targeted Sonny, Luki’s protective instincts won’t let him run far, especially when Sonny’s family is targeted as well. Whether they can forgive or forget, Sonny and Luki will have to call a truce and work together to save Sonny’s nephew and fight an enemy intent on making sure loving Luki Vasquez is the last mistake Sonny will ever make.</description>

  <description>All of his life, Spencer Hightower dreamed of playing baseball in the Major Leagues. He survived growing up gay in rural Alabama due to his impressive skill on the baseball diamond. Now living in Rhode Island and playing for the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox, he’s only a few steps away from his goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brock Kinkaid, CPA, faced each day with a smile that hid his deepest desire. He wanted to be a father. Unfortunately, the gay men he knew were not into the daddy scene. Resigned to being childless, he lavished his attention on his niece and nephew. When Corey won tickets to see the local baseball team in action, they suckered him into taking them despite the fact he loathed the game. Who would have guessed one homerun ball would change everything?</description>

  <description>Like a million other young gay men, Bryan keeps his sexuality hidden because it’s safer that way. Yet other guys know he’s different -- they sense it, and make Bryan’s life pure hell. At home, things aren’t much better. He barely acknowledges his alcoholic father, and his mother has little time to spend with her family. So Bryan is alone, with no support, no shoulder to cry on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years of torture and torment, of name calling and humiliation, have taken their toll. Bryan does what he can to make new friends, but in trying to be something he’s not, he makes a huge mistake. Unable to cope with the repercussions, Bryan spends more and more time in a fantasy world he has created for himself. In this private world he is handsome, an object of desire. He is loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the hiding place as perfect as it seems? Or will Bryan go too deep and not be able to come out again?</description>

  <description>Quinn Donahue will do anyone once, so when Aaron Miller spots Quinn making his moves in a Vancouver gay bar, Aaron thinks he’s found just the guy to relieve him of his unwanted virginity. Quinn, however, has apparently decided to make an exception to his usual open-bed policy. He may be an unrepentant connoisseur of one-night-stands, but he’s not going to disappoint a sweet kid like Aaron by giving him a hot night and then leaving while the sheets are still warm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Quinn takes a job at Aaron’s family horse farm, Aaron spots both the demons and the decency that drive Quinn’s frequent brush-offs, and it makes Aaron want him even more. But Quinn is determined that Aaron won’t go home with a man who doesn’t deserve him, so he starts sending likely candidates Aaron’s way. It takes a grim act of sacrifice for Aaron to realize exactly why Quinn’s been so skittish, and he’ll have to keep a firm grip on the man of his dreams to keep Quinn from shying away.</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Elliott is looking forward to a spring break away from his college roommates—a whole week to house-sit for his uncle in Chicago, and jack-off to internet porn (and maybe check out a museum, if he has time). But his uncle doesn’t have internet. And there are no video stores around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But his uncle does have binoculars, and a clear view into a nearby high-rise apartment building full of exhibitionists. Elliott is content with watching the nightly show, until he develops an obsession with a hot, scruffy guy and his Latin lover. Elliott decides that his sex life must be more than watching, and he aggressively pursues the object of his desire. His first-time encounter is better than any video he’s ever seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A novelette with graphic m/m sex.</description>

  <description>"Some crimes can never be forgotten." &lt;br&gt; Kate Evans doesn't take risks. She chose her apartment with care-a safe district with a good neighbor-a place where she can live a quiet, unassuming, under-the-radar existence. Then she makes one mistake and opens her door to accept a delivery of flowers from a secret admirer and her life will never be the same again. A guy she's never seen before bursts into her apartment and asks her to marry him. Jack Thompson won't take no for an answer and drags Kate on a cross country journey to hell. &lt;br&gt; Invalided out of the police, Nathan Beranson works as a private investigator in San Antonio, Texas where he spends too much of his time following unfaithful spouses and delivering the bad news to their partners. When his fiancee cheats on him with Jack Thompson, the half-brother Nathan's only just met, he becomes obsessed with Jack in the same unhealthy way as his revenge-seeking clients. By the time Nathan finally realizes putting the ghosts of the past to rest is a wiser option than settling an old score, it's too late. He's already been drawn into his sibling's latest deadly game and Nathan and Kate find their nightmare is only just beginning.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"You have to teach your heart and mind how to sing together…then you'll hear the sound of your soul."&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mia Kelly thinks she has it all figured out. She's an Ivy League graduate, a classically trained pianist, and the beloved daughter of a sensible mother and offbeat father. Yet Mia has been stalling since graduation, torn between putting her business degree to use and exploring music, her true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her father unexpectedly dies, she decides to pick up the threads of his life while she figures out her own. Uprooting herself from Ann Arbor to New York City, Mia takes over her father's café, a treasured neighborhood institution that plays host to undiscovered musicians and artists. She's denied herself the thrilling and unpredictable life of a musician, but a chance encounter with Will, a sweet, gorgeous, and charming guitarist, offers her a glimpse of what could be. When Will becomes her friend and then her roommate, she does everything in her power to suppress her passions-for him, for music-but her father's legacy slowly opens her heart to the possibility of something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A "heartbreaking and romantic" (Aestas Book Blog) debut, Sweet Thing explores the intensity and complexities of first love and self-discovery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>As the captain of a schooner catering to the elite on the Caribbean Seas, Sebastian Stark does his best to avoid any human encounters.  Interacting with people isn’t his thing, and he prefers the company of a bottle of vodka, a shot glass, and maybe a whore.  There’s no doubt he’s hiding from a checkered past, but he does well keeping everything to himself…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…until the night his schooner capsizes, and he’s stuck on a life raft with one of the passengers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raine’s young, she’s cute, and Bastian would probably be into her if he wasn’t suffering from alcohol withdrawal. As the days pass, DTs, starvation, and dehydration become the norm.  Even the most closed person starts to open up when he thinks he’s going to die, but when she realizes their traumatic pasts are connected, it’s no longer the elements that have Bastian concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has no idea how he’s going to Survive Raine.</description>

  <description>Geoff is in the city, living the gay life to the hilt, when his father's death convinces him to return to the family farm.  Discovering a young Amish man asleep in his barn, Geoff learns that Eli is spending a year away from the community before accepting baptism into the church. Despite their mutual attraction, Geoff is determined not to become involved with him, but Eli has discovered that Geoff shares his feelings and begins to court him, neatly capturing first Geoff's attention and then his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their budding relationship is threatened by closed-minded, gossipy relatives and the society at large, a whole new world to Eli, and he must decide whether to return to the community, his family, and the world and future he knows or to stay with Geoff and have faith in the power of love.</description>

  <description>Jeremy Ash, an aspiring actor, is single, gorgeous…and openly, quietly gay. When he lands a starring role opposite America’s favorite former child star, 21-year old Kit Harris, he’s ecstatic and more than a little attracted to the enigmatic star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kit Harris’s career has been flagging and his agent promises this new film, an edgy coming out story with a famed director, is just the thing to get it back on track. The problem is that the film is relatively intimate in nature, and Kit’s definitely not gay. He’s not even slightly bent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the two men collide in a crushing first kiss that leaves both gasping for air, Kit’s left reeling and Jeremy’s left wanting. And that was just the audition. When filming starts and the two men are brought into close proximity every day, passions ignite and souls collide–both on screen and off. The two men find that the only way to assuage their mutual lust is to give in to it. Kit’s sure this strange new attraction will run its course; Jeremy’s hoping it never has to end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a manipulative model obtains salacious film footage of the two men in bed, Kit’s prepared to do whatever it takes to save his career. But how far is too far to push the boundaries of love and how long can one man hide from himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTE: While "Acting Out" further explores some characters and themes from "No Apologies", it is not necessary to read the books in any particular order to enjoy them fully.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Cheerful and friendly, Aaron Blake has never met a puzzle that intrigues him more than brooding Greg Falkner. He wants to get to know his roommate, but it seems the only way past his shell is through it. When a reluctant friendship turns into a budding romance, can the two keep their feelings secret from their classmates? Or will their newfound love destroy them both?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So goes the story screenwriter Greg Falkner spins for audiences and his longtime partner, Aaron Blake, in No Apologies. Loosely based on their lives together, the film rocks Hollywood with its blatant portrayal of two teenagers falling in love and coming of age in a world that struggles to accept them, while they in turn struggle to accept themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of the evening, will Greg's risky venture break a relationship that's already foundering? Or will the real life Greg and Aaron also find their happily ever after with no apologies?</description>

  <description>Coming back from being dumped is a struggle for the average guy. For Mark Newland, it's much, much worse. With a long string of broken relationships behind him, Mark is confronted with a choice: grow up and fix the man he's become, or continue on his lonely and bitter path. With reinvention in mind, Mark heads for a vacation in Bora Bora, hoping it will bring him closer to what he wants. He simply never figured it would be in the form of Hollywood's most eligible gay bachelor, Zane Whitlow. If Zane is suspicious of romance, he blames it entirely on his career. Never totally sure that men he's been with wanted him over a taste of his fame, he errs on the side of caution when it comes to love. Until he meets Mark Newland, that is. Only hours into his vacation and for reasons he can't understand himself, Zane abandons his usual safe approach in favor of pursuit. But Zane's not the only one who thinks Mark might be the perfect guy... With attraction, fear, and insecurity warring within Mark, will he have the strength to believe he deserves lasting love, or will his old ways come back to haunt him?</description>

  <description>After a kayaking accident took Josh Donald’s sight, he’s faced with learning to negotiate the world as a blind man. In short order, his boyfriend leaves him behind, making it clear he’s not inclined to deal with special needs. Reeling from the blow, Josh flounders. In an attempt to help, Josh’s friends take him to a camp for the blind, where he falls for the camp organizer, Charlie Cooper. Charlie seems to feel the attraction too, but when a horse named Dottie pushes them into a hot first kiss, Charlie resists. He believes he’s damaged goods, not boyfriend material. Since the accident, Josh has faced tough obstacles, but the most challenging hurdle of all may be getting Charlie to open up and take a chance on love.</description>

  <description>Lieutenant Evan Arden sits in a shack in the middle of nowhere, waiting for orders that will send him back home - if he ever gets them. Other than his loyal Great Pyrenees, there's no one around to break up the monotony. The tedium is excruciating, but it is suddenly interrupted when a young woman stumbles up his path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has two choices - pick her off from a distance with his trusty sniper-rifle, or dare let her approach his cabin and enter his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not? It's been ages, and he is otherwise alone...</description>

  <description>In the Pacific Northwest, where life hurries to keep pace with technology, a re-animated bride named Josie struggles to escape her creator and to find her identity in the half-erased circuitry of her mind and body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assassin Bane Connor just wants to get the girl to the Zombie Underground and receive his payoff—a mental reset that will erase his memories as well as his guilt. But an attack by a rival faction derails his rescue, and the wide-eyed female whose circuitry requires a husband tears at his hardened heart and ignites desire like he’s never known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acting as Josie’s spouse-substitute is tougher than Bane expected. The newborn stein needs touch to live, and wanting her is a complication he doesn’t need. To make matters worse, she sees into the darkest recesses of his mind. The last thing a killer wants is for his lover to read his thoughts, but if Josie can love him the way he’s programmed, perhaps Bane can find a way to heal his past.</description>

  <description>Albuquerque police officer Benji Miller made the choice to hide his sexuality and devote his life to his career. He guards his secret carefully, believing he is protecting his job and happiness. Then, during a routine traffic stop gone awry, he shoots a suspect to protect a young girl, and his life spins out of control. A department-mandated paid leave rips away the only distraction he had, and he has to deal with the unsympathetic media who criticize the police department’s every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, needing to get out of the house, Benji walks into a café, where he meets Neal McCoy—a gay man living without shame, unafraid to speak his mind or stand up against prejudice. Benji quickly falls for Neal but struggles to combine his new love interest and his career. With the media threatening the careful illusion he’s built around himself, Benji can’t stand the pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benji has to decide: sacrifice his happiness in the name of his career and an easy life, or find the courage to give up the lonely existence he knows and take a step into the unknown.</description>

  <description>Dreams and Nightmares,&lt;br&gt;Screams and Sighs,&lt;br&gt;Fate Wakes the Girl&lt;br&gt;And Says She Dies....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Boy Gets in the Way,&lt;br&gt;Then the Nightmares Come to Play...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For her eighteenth birthday, Endora Lee Andrews receives the gift of dreams. Nighttime slumber brings her visions of the future, a preview of things to come. Endora’s unsettling new ability is seemingly harmless, until her dreams turn to nightmares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she meets the mysterious and swoon-worthy Kannon, he knows things about her that he can’t possibly know, and seems to be the key to uncovering the source of her ominous prophecies. But Kannon has many secrets, some the essential difference between life and death for Endora.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she discover the origins of her nightmares and how to prevent destiny, before the harbingers of death come for her? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Woven with love, mystery and mythology, PAWN is the story of a girl who was once brought back from death, only to face it again. Because Fate may give you a second chance at life, but that doesn’t mean it’s yours to keep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out the unofficial trailer for the book in Sophie Davis' videos or on &lt;a href="http://www.SophieDavisBooks.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.SophieDavisBooks.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>At 22, Jason L’Estrange should have the world at his feet. Instead, he wakes on a dismal hospital ward to discover he has a broken foot and a multitude of other injuries. Learning he plunged down the stairs of Dublin’s seediest nightclub, Jason has no recollection if he fell or was pushed and the hospital psychiatrist is questioning if he may have had any reason to jump?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accepting his life has spiralled out of control, Jason recalls the devastating climax of the feud between his two warring best friends Lizzie and Ryan. To add to his woes, he’s blown his final chance of a reconciliation with Alex, the only man who ever mattered, his alcoholic single mother has let him down again and Celestine, the girl who once gave him hope before breaking his heart has crashed back into his world with the missing pieces to the puzzle of Jason’s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason, Ryan, Celestine and Lizzie’s lives collide on a night out in Dublin when secrets thought long buried return and threaten to destroy what’s left of their friendships. When Celestine reveals the true reasons she was forced to end their friendship, Jason believes he has finally uncovered the truth to a mystery that has haunted him since childhood; the identity of his father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lonely but filled with hope, Jason wants to take you on his journey. The invisible boy who sits in the corner of every class, Jason dreams of a future where he doesn’t have to fight to survive. Struggling with a past littered with unanswered questions and fighting to make his desired destiny a reality, Jason reflects on how the desolate teen that fought to prove he had potential has ended up in a dire situation.</description>

  <description>Oh, who was she kidding? Emma knew that going to the tattoo shop with her best friend, Allie, would result in getting badgered until she ended up with some sort of needle piercing her flesh in one way or another. What she didn’t plan on was ending up face-first on the floor of the shop with a busted lip. Or doing it in front of the hottest guy she’d seen since…well, ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mortified, Emma never thought she’d ever step foot back in Skin Deep again. But fate, with a little help from Emma’s flighty best friend and a chance encounter with a fudge bar, steps in. Now Emma’s torn between taking a chance on getting her heart broken by the enigmatic, gorgeous Lucas, and playing it safe with good ol’ trusty B.O.B. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucas lets Emma know that he gets what he wants, and what he wants is her. When Emma gives in and quits pushing him away, she’s surprised at how quickly the walls around her heart crumble. She’s even more surprised that her unconventional, zany family just endears her even more to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But no one knows there’s someone that wants her more, and they’ll stop at nothing to get her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Recommended for readers 18+ due to HOT sexual encounters, adult situations, and language.</description>

  <description>Richard Cohen, a former homosexual, now married with three children, struggled for most of his life with unwanted same-sex attractions.  He tried desperately to find professionals who understood his condition and help him heal.  Because "it was so difficult to explain myself to therapists, who didn't have a clue," Cohen eventually became a psychotherapist and developed both a groundbreaking understanding of same-sex attractions and a comprehensive treatment plan for healing homosexuality.  "Coming Out Straight" not only details Cohen's personal journey out of homosexuality but also recounts his experiences helping thousands of men, women and adolescents heal their gender identity.  &lt;p&gt;Recoginizing that the "gay rights movement" has done a great service in bringing the issue of homosexuality of the closet and into the light, Cohen points out that in the name of tolerance, society has now succumbed to acceptance.  "If we embrace someone's homosexuality as normal and natural, their potential for wholeness will remain dormant beneath their emotional wounds.  It's not bad to have same-sex attractions, as they represent a drive to heal unmet love needs. However, acting upon them leads to frustration and pain."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple language, "Coming Out Straight" presents the basic causes of same-sex attractions, a clear model for recovery, and stories of individuals who made the change. The book has three parts: In Part I, the author shares his own story and the root causes of same-sex attractions.  Part II presents a four-stage model of recovery and healing.  Part III discusses the healing of homophobia by overcoming fear and hatred of homosexuality.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the book is meant to educate therapists, clergy, and other professionals, it also assists those who struggle with their own same-sex attractions as well as their loved ones.  "Coming Out Straight" sets forth an easy to understand primer on homosexuality, both for family members and friends of homosexuals, as well as for the general public.  It will open the door to a new, happier, and fulfilling heterosexual life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In a land where humans are enslaved as sexual toys, angels and demons are in constant conflict with their playthings. The demon Varun works with STAR, an organization devoted to human liberty, and it’s a never-ending battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years ago, the angel Triste broke Varun’s heart by choosing to be his butler instead of his beloved, giving Varun no explanation and no hope. However, that doesn’t mean that Triste will simply sit back and watch as Varun takes the human Elden under his protection, and Triste’s secret investigation will unearth terrible secrets, including the kernels of a pernicious plot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite appearances, Triste and Varun are still in love, and Varun may well risk everything to protect Triste and discover why the angel left him heartbroken. But a still worse danger hangs over them as they seek to calm the threat of a catastrophic war.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author's Note: The ebook edition of "Want Me" (the one with the purple cover) is the second edition of the story and has been revised for Loose Id. In addition to tightening up the prose, etc, it contains a new chapter and a bonus alternate ending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joel Beckett is blessed. He's popular with the ladies, a star on the football field, and worshiped by everyone on campus. Including Walker Cain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Walker's worship has crossed the line, driving him to invoke ancient magic that binds them together in an inescapable downward spiral. Now reality is shifting, and with each new life Joel is forced to watch Walker steal away another of the blessings he'd always taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's never enough. Cursed blood runs hot, and with every turn of the spiral, Walker breathes the seductive words that Joel can't resist. The words that could drag them both into hell - &lt;strong&gt;'Want me.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When vice cop Gentry Trecall is informed that he’s going to be going undercover as a hooker, thanks to the city’s latest bid to crack down on prostitution, he’s skeptical but resigned. What he doesn’t expect is to encounter someone like Dublin MacAulay, the owner of the popular night club The Pale that just so happens to be right across the street from the corner Gentry has been assigned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dublin’s unlike anyone Gentry’s ever met before. He gruff and sincere, trying to get him off the street. An unspoken attraction lingers between the two, but the truth about Gentry’s profession is the only thing that keeps it at bay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the truth finally does come out will Dublin be able to forgive Gentry for the lie he’s had to tell? Or will his undercover work lose Gentry the lover of his dreams?</description>

  <description>As a nobleman's bastard, Leith has known for years he has no place in his father's castle. When a lord of the Fair folk offers him a bargain--serve a year in their court in exchange for his own title--he sees a chance to make his fortune. But the realm of the Fair, devoted to pleasures Leith has never known, has dangers all its own...and none more perilous than love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment he sees Ash, the Fair's gamekeeper, he is drawn to the scarred, mysterious Northerner; even in the throes of ecstasy with his masters, he can't get him out of his head. No matter what heat flares between them, though, they cannot be together: Ash is a slave, captured and branded by the Fair, and once Leith's term of service is over they will never see each other again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a place where every pleasure is permitted, Leith longs for the one thing he cannot have: to belong to a man who is already another's property. The Fair are greedy masters; can Leith risk their wrath for a love that can never leave the Forest of Glass?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM theme and elements, male/male sexual practices, exhibitionism/voyeurism.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sensual overload can be a tactical disadvantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devlin Grace’s experience with child exploitation cases lands him a new assignment with the Special Crimes Investigators unit of the Federal Justice Agency, plus a new partner who could make the job tougher than expected. Connor Hutchens possesses incredible, scientifically enhanced senses…and zero social skills. Word on the street is that his last partner left under a cloud—and it was Connor’s fault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor blames himself for losing his previous partner, and wants to do right by his new one. But Devlin confuses and frustrates him, and he struggles to cope with Devlin’s swift intelligence, quirky humor and teasing sexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the dangerous, perplexing case facing them, there’s no one Devlin would rather have at his back than Connor. But the longer they work together, the higher the sexual tension rises—until attraction boils over and puts everything at risk. Their careers, the children they’re trying to save—and any chance of lasting love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Violence and non-graphic reference to mutilations. But also snarking, teasing, why-won’t-they-get-a-clue syndrome, and kittens in barns.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Her deadly dreams leave her in grave danger...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since half-vampire Cat Crawfield and her undead lover Bones met six years ago, they've fought against the rogue undead, battled a vengeful Master vampire, and pledged their devotion with a blood bond. Now it's time for a vacation. But their hopes for a perfect Paris holiday are dashed when Cat awakes one night in terror. She's having visions of a vampire named Gregor who's more powerful than Bones and has ties to her past that even Cat herself didn't know about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gregor believes Cat is his and he won't stop until he has her. As the battle begins between the vamp who haunts her nightmares and the one who holds her heart, only Cat can break Gregor's hold over her. She'll need all the power she can summon in order to bring down the baddest bloodsucker she's ever faced . . . even if getting that power will result in an early grave.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A handsome Bollywood actor must choose between his career and a rugged cricket player from his past, who he’s fallen in love with…again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajan Malik has the world of Bollywood in the palm of his hand--a beautiful girlfriend, starring roles, adoring fans... He should be happy, but behind the facade lies a man conflicted and exhausted by the pressure placed on him by his ill mother, his agent and society. His life is not his own, and all he wants to do is escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian Premier League cricketer Ajay Singh can’t believe how bad his university roommate Rajan looks when he spots his picture in the paper. They had parted on bad terms. Still, he’s moved to offer Rajan his support by renewing their friendship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But friendship was not all they shared back then. Though Ajay is out,Rajan isn’t willing to give up his carefully cultivated Bollywood image to be with him publicly. And with very little privacy, it won’t take long for someone to find out they are more than friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their renewed secret affair is fraught with difficulties as they deal with the death of Rajan’s mother, the secret of Rajan’s till-now absent father, a jealous friend, intrusive social media, and threatening notes from someone who seems to know all about their private lives...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a bit of a sticky wicket they find themselves in. Will it be too late when both men finally realise that they’ll need to compromise, or they stand to lose everything?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Danger waits on both sides of the grave.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt; Half-vampire Cat Crawfield and her vampire husband Bones have fought for their lives, as well as for their relationship. But just when they've triumphed over the latest battle, Cat's new and unexpected abilities threaten to upset a long-standing balance . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the mysterious disappearance of vampires, rumors abound that a species war is brewing. A zealot is inciting tensions between the vampires and ghouls, and if these two powerful groups clash, innocent mortals could become collateral damage. Now Cat and Bones are forced to seek help from a dangerous "ally"; the ghoul queen of New Orleans herself. But the price of her assistance may prove more treacherous than even the threat of a supernatural war . . . to say nothing of the repercussions Cat never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Having narrowly averted an (under)world war, Cat Crawfield wants nothing more than a little downtime with her vampire husband, Bones. Unfortunately, her gift from New Orleans' voodoo queen just keeps on giving--leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centuries ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity--forever. But how do you kill a killer who's already long dead?</description>

  <description>Bedded by the Boss &lt;br&gt;Erotic Romance/Novella&lt;br&gt;Approximately 20,000 words&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Renee Guillot starts her new job with better pay and benefits, she thinks her only worry will be a lack of job security. Little does she know she will be working for the Devil Incarnate. Suddenly, she is tossed into a world of sexual coercion and dangerous temptation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert Thibodeaux can't be bothered with the mundane details of hiring his own secretary. So when his new employee shows up for work, one look is enough to know it will never work out. Getting her out of his office and into his bed isn't an easy maneuver. But that's  exactly what he wants, and it will only be a matter of time before he makes it happen.</description>

  <description>"Magic is just like love, Allai. It won't wait for permission before it destroys you."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like sand in an hourglass, Allai's future is dwindling away. She's spent her entire life fighting the Mages who threaten humanity, and dreams of someday eradicating magic. But all it takes is an anonymous phone call for the truth to spill out: Allai is the one thing she despises most. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's a Mage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though ancient law mandates Allai's death, she still has one last chance of survival. His name is Drake Rhaize, and he swears he can lead Allai to a sanctuary for Mages. Allai hasn't seen Drake in years, but she remembers him as the demon boy who used to hold her close and softly whisper that he'd keep her safe. But Drake has changed since then: He's now suspected of murder, and has been out-casted for betraying his own kind.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Allai doesn't trust Drake, she has no choice but to put her life in his hands and hope he can get her to safety. Because Allai's father has hired a pack of Demons to bring her back to him, dead or alive, and demons never stop the hunt.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When Jack receives a Two for One offer at a local club, he doesn’t realise the two men would change his life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Samson moves to Sumerset to start over again. He’s looking forward to his new veterinary practice and maybe having some fun once in a while. He certainly isn’t looking to fall for two men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon Wittman and Brady Vanderly have been partners for fifteen years. They love each other, but they like to play. When they pick Jack up at a local gay bar, they think they’re just looking for a night or two of fun. They end up finding so much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book was previously released at another publisher. It has been revised and re-edited for release with Total-E-Bound.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

And a vow he made in his childhood has suddenly appeared on his front door to haunt him. To top it all off it’s the Year of the Bull, which, according to the crazy little waiter at a trendy Chinese restaurant may be his lucky year IF he actually lives through it. As the day progresses, however, that seems less and less likely…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Brian in the adventure of his life as he rekindles passions he thought were dead, finds the hero inside him and rights the wrongs of this world in this hysterical fairytale for adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazon: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Year-Bull-ebook/dp/B008YJ2CKU/ref=la_B006P1QEDK_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1351704994&amp;amp;sr=1-3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Year-Bull-ebook...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barnes and Noble:</description>

  <description>“How the fuck did I get into this predicament? And look at that fucker, standing behind me with that shit ass grin on his face. When I agreed to go to a party with him after the bar closed, I had no clue that this was the party.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesus, he was so god damn sexy in the bar though. He had to be at least 5 years younger, perfect chiseled body. And when we kissed? Fuck! I couldn't keep my hands off of his tight ass. Damn I wanted that... well, look who's in the opposite position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck! Oh well. Sigh. Fine. Suck me. Fuck me. Make me yours. I don't fucking care anymore. Hopefully, I can walk out of here in the morning without too many bruises. Shit, maybe I'll even ask him for his number when this is over, huh? I bet that will shock the shit out of him.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Shirtless leather-clad blond rocker, bound on his knees in a black-padded room, in submissive position, leather thong laced around left upper arm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Drake Fallon's impulsive decision to stop and help a stranger change a tire leads to intriguing possibilities. What he doesn't know is that there are two J. Cahills. After miserable years looking for love in other places, Jesse and Jay Cahill have accepted that for them, illicit passion is the only one. They've built a life, a home together. A chance encounter on a rainy night brings something Jesse never expected- an attraction for another man. Still, he's committed to the love he has for his twin, Jay, and he pushes Drake Fallon away. Drake is intrigued by the vulnerable man he met in the downpour. Though Jesse claims to be involved, Drake is certain the relationship can't be fulfilling or Jesse wouldn't have returned his kiss with such passion. Jay Cahill is devastated when his lover whispers another man's name in his dreams. When Drake calls, how can Jay resist meeting the man who's crept into his twin's dreams?</description>

  <description>Keeping an eye on his charge isn’t easy. Keeping his hands off? Impossible…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took attending his own funeral to force Logan to accept a new life as an undercover MI6 agent. That doesn’t make his latest assignment any less aggravating. Babysitting a Russian pop star with delusions that someone’s trying to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than an inexplicable attraction Logan ruthlessly suppresses, he couldn’t have less in common with the irritating, arrogant rich kid. He’s even prepared to walk away—until very real bullets start flying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After his mother’s death, Zak Kochenkov’s life unravels in an impenetrable haze of grief, drugs and alcohol—until one bodyguard candidate stands out. Except his hopes of having some fun with that guard’s body evaporate when he realizes Logan is buttoned up tighter than a clam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first thing Logan learns is that his charge won’t do as he’s told. And there’s some secret behind his haunted eyes that shakes Logan’s resolve to keep him at arm’s length. Because he knows if he lets passion close his eyes, that’s when danger will find them both…</description>

  <description>Talents: Born with physical and psychic abilities beyond human understanding, these flawed forces of nature burn desperate paths through their own shadowy world ruled by sex, power, and madness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this first novella of the Hidden Talents series, meet Ken, Jin, Sky, Mark, Lip, and Dylan. Driven by powers and desires beyond their control, these strange and beautiful men live by their own definitions of survival...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent on the run by his leader after a disastrous change of leadership at KGA, bad boy telepath Jin heads to Paris to seek asylum with a group of rogue Talents living under the radar. Thrown into tumult after a recent suicide by one of their own, the Talents are not what Jin expected, but there's one in particular who captures his attention: Ken, a mysterious, sullen boy with mismatched green eyes and a scarred, lovely face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jin finds an old acquaintance has also been taken in by the Talents, he doesn't think things can get any weirder -- Sky, the beautiful blonde empath and former yakuza concubine Jin loved to torment in and out of bed, is hilariously furious to see him. But it's not just their history putting Sky on edge: Ken is his younger brother!</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Easy come, easy go…until the heart gets involved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;English student and aspiring journalist Luke Corbin should be studying. Instead he’s facing homelessness, thanks to the lover who’s just kicking him out of their posh digs. It’s not his first rejection—his father tossed him out at age sixteen—but Luke has no problem trading his favors for a home and security. Especially with rich, powerful, handsome men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except now, with finals bearing down, there’s no time to be choosy. He needs a roof over his head and he needs it now. Even if it means settling temporarily for a geeky, less-than-well-off chemical engineer called Russell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke’s fully prepared to put out for the guy—because after all, in this world no one gets something for nothing. But Russell isn’t just a nerd; he’s an honourable nerd who wants to save himself for someone special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first Luke is annoyed, but the more time he spends with Russell, the closer he comes to a devastating realization. He wants to be that someone special. Except he’s fallen for the one man he can’t seem to charm…</description>

  <description>Sparks ignite when Cupid takes aim at two mortals in Las Vegas: Randy Jones, an average guy on a company vacation, looks into Garrett’s eyes at a craps table and time stands still. Throwing aside everything he believes, Randy engages in a torrid two-night affair with Garrett—only to panic when he realizes he’s fallen in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cynical billionaire Garrett Shiffler has everything money can buy, and most of his dates can’t see past the dollar signs. Life has taught him that innocence and love are figments of the imagination. But when Randy disappears, taking with him feelings Garrett thought he’d never know, Garrett wages the most important battle of his life to win Randy's love—but this time he fights with his heart, not his bank account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Cupid wonders what happened. His golden arrows never fail unless the Fates interfere. If Garrett wants to win Randy back, he’s going to have to do it on his own, because the Fates have other plans for Cupid.</description>

  <description>On a dark evening, James, a young football player, encounters an ancient vampire, Sebastian, and is brought face-to-face with the part of himself he's been hiding. William, who's family has been murdered, encounters an adorable blond, Chase, who holds undeniable attraction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As fate draws these couples together, a gathering storm brewing in the darkest of dark places will draw them all into a conflict an eternity in the making. But from blind Chase and basketball player Carl to the mysteriously attactive new kids in school, nothing is ever quite what it seems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, the choices these four lovers will make decide the fate of all worlds as they form the last line of resistance against an ancient evil.</description>

  <description>In the frontier town of Belkin’s Pass, as a vampire quietly feeds on the local saloon girls and their customers, a tragedy teaches resident Josh Stanton he has the ability to raise the dead. Knowing he is now a wanted man, Josh flees into the arid plains of Venom Valley. Pursued by Dex, the town deputy and Josh’s best friend, the two realize their friendship is truly something deeper, and Dex has to decide if he’s a man of the law, or a man in love. The vampire, drawn by Josh’s power, circles ever closer, gathering his forces against them.</description>

  <description>When architect Mèco is turfed, or ejected from his protected but autocratic Dome, he finds himself adrift in a dying and dangerous land. With no choice but to scrape his survival from an abandoned farm, he tries to improve his prospects by acquiring an animal to pull his plow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he ends up with instead are two slaves, a bonded pair of Novigi, a strange people Mèco's never heard of. As the land slowly awakens by their combined efforts, so does Mèco's sense of himself as a man and maybe as a lover. But when their fragile home is threatened by brutal gangs of Salters, Mèco and his friends discover being servants of the seasons may not be enough to protect their new way of living and loving. They must become warriors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally published as the Chaser series Servant of the Seasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word count: 83200 (approx.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Ryan Betancourt has got it made: he’s reached the top tier of the tennis world thanks to a wild-card entry to the US Open. Ryan is meeting players he has idolized for years, including his teenage crush, Josh Andrews. But he isn’t ready for the politics and manipulation that come with life at the top. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh Andrews is closeted, private, and difficult to get to know. He’s been playing tennis since he could walk, won his first tournament at five, and was sent to Spain at thirteen to attend a tennis academy. Before a knee injury forced him into a year off, he was ranked the number one player in the world. Now he’s back—and intent on winning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh and Ryan first meet at a tournament in Brisbane. Ryan excitedly greets Josh only to be ignored. Crushed, he realizes the golden boy of tennis isn't all he seems. Only in the team-building environment of training for the Davis Cup does Josh open up enough for them to grow closer. Their developing relationship is everything Ryan ever wanted, and he is blissfully happy. But inevitably they have to play against each other, and everything changes.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Boleyn King&lt;/em&gt; is the first novel in an enthralling new trilogy. Reimagining history in sumptuous detail, Laura Anderssen takes readers back to the deadly intrigue, turbulent affairs, and treacherous passions of Tudor England - and answers the compelling question &lt;em&gt;What if Anne Boleyn had given Henry VIII the son he so desperately wanted?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just seventeen years old, Henry IX, known as William, is a king bound by the restraints of the regency yet anxious to prove himself. With the French threatening battle and the Catholics sowing the seeds of rebellion at home, William trusts only three people: his older sister Elizabeth; his best friend and loyal counselor, Dominic; and Minuette, a young orphan raised as a royal ward by William's mother, Anne Boleyn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against a tide of secrets, betrayal, and murder, William finds himself fighting for the very soul of his kingdom. Then, when he and Dominic both fall in love with Minuette, romantic obsession looms over a new generation of Tudors. One among them will pay the price for a king's desire, as a shocking twist of fate changes England's fortunes forever.</description>

  <description>A Union Of Curses&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isabella Farrington’s marriage was hasty. For all her new husband’s riches, Lord Draven Winthrop is whispered about, avoided, and feared. Yet Isabella is drawn to Draven’s dark good looks, his strength, the charm he can turn on as easily as she can blink. The impoverished daughter of an Egyptologist, she knows there are rumors about her, too, and the amulet she wears. Nothing more than superstitious babble…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Isabella returns to Draven’s remote coastal manor, she senses there is something more at work in the grim gardens of Thorncliff Towers than superstition. Draven is passionate and seductive, but he has a brutal, uncontrolled side too, and a history of secrets. To live in peace she must discover the reasons behind a gypsy curse and a mother’s scorn. Especially when she learns Draven believes his sweet young bride is doomed to a fate even darker than his own…</description>

When his professional and personal lives begin to merge, Zack finds himself walking a dangerous road between being a good cop and giving in to his growing desire...</description>

But the deeper she delves into the cause of his pain, the deeper she gets sucked into his chaos. &lt;strong&gt;Will Scarlett find the happiness she’s looking for, or will she be caught in Tucker’s aftermath?&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

She’s a living, breathing descendant of Artemis who has stepped right into a trap set by the children of the gods. Nikki’s new “friends” include a descendant of Eros, who uses sex as a weapon; a descendant of Loki, whose tricks are no laughing matter; and a half-mad descendant of Kali who thinks she’s a spy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But most powerful of all are the Olympians, a rival clan of immortals seeking to destroy all Descendants who refuse to bow down to them. In the eternal battle of good god/bad god, Nikki would make a divine weapon. But if they think she’ll surrender without a fight, &lt;em&gt;the gods must be crazy. . . .&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Craig Ryan's modeling dreams crashed and burned on the streets of LA. Still, a man has to eat, and the escort biz pays well, and the sex isn't bad. Actually, Craig enjoys his new job and benefits. That is, until a client called Dee hires him. Dee is a mystery. He keeps his face hidden and prohibits touching, even when touching his mouthwatering body becomes Craig's fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Falling for a customer was never in Craig's plans. But wrapped inside Dee's peculiar requirements, there's a sense of loneliness and pain that strikes deep within Craig, awakening his own need for something more-something with a future beyond one-night stands.</description>

  <description>Hired by a mysterious faerie gentleman to steal seemingly worthless artifacts, Querrilous Knotte is seen as a traitor by the humans of Halcyon. But as long as he’s getting paid, Querry doesn’t mind. When his client makes a cryptic comment about a certain house, Querry contacts his old flame Reg—a former street rat who now works in the Royal Archives—to learn if the property contains anything of value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Reg has no answers for him, Querry learns there is indeed something precious in the house, something Reg is convinced will bring nothing but trouble. The armed guards that attack the thief prove Reg’s prediction true, and he can’t leave Querry to face it all alone. Not when Reg’s feelings for the man may not be as extinct as he'd thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble is, Querry's heart doesn’t just belong to Reg anymore, and surprisingly, Reg’s heart no longer belongs only to Querry. In the end, it may not even matter, because if Querry, Reg, and their hearts’ desire can’t stop Lord Thimbleroy from draining Halcyon’s magic, they won’t live long enough to regret their unresolved romance.</description>

  <description>FBI Special Agent Aaron Pearce and his lover Mark Beecher are taking a well-deserved vacation relaxing on the beaches of Barbados Island. They spend lazy days in the sun, on scooters seeing the sites, or in their hotel room making love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Mark sees a young girl in a bar who may be in danger, he begins an informal investigation into her situation, even as Pearce reminds him they are not citizens and have no legal power on the island. Mark is determined, however, and, while investigating on his own, is taken captive by a sex slavery ring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pearce panics when Mark goes missing. He has a good idea what happened to Mark and who has taken him, but he cannot prove it. While working with the Barbados Royal Police Force, Pearce realizes he has become the detective’s prime suspect, and understands he needs to conduct his own personal investigation if he has any chance of finding Mark before he is either sold into sex slavery or murdered.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He wanted to learn about beauty. He never expected to learn about love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billionaire Chandler Harrison’s third marriage is now history, and he’s left with his ex-wife’s parting barb, 'You have no appreciation of beauty.' Determined to prove her wrong, Chandler hires artist Neil Sweeney to add a mural to his office wall. He doesn’t even care what the picture is, as long as it’s beautiful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neil Sweeney is an ex-tagger, a free spirit, and a bit of a hippie. He’s never met anybody as uptight as Chandler, but when it comes to warming up Chandler’s cold, stark office, Neil has plans involving more than art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chandler begins to find himself strangely moved by the mural developing on his office wall. He’s especially moved by the artist himself. Chandler has denied his homosexual urges for most of his life, but it isn’t long before Neil begins introducing Chandler to all kinds of new things. As Neil’s masterpiece comes to life, so does Chandler’s appreciation for art, colour, and the best kind of beauty of all—love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This story has been previously released as part of the Promoted by the Billionaire anthology by Total-E-Bound.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Mia Taylor has a huge heart, but just how much pain can one heart endure? Mia was living the picture perfect life, engaged to her high school sweetheart and working at her dream job at an upscale salon in New York City. She had it all. Until the day her past, present and future were taken away, leaving her to face the world scared and alone. Trying to pick up the pieces of her broken life, while mourning the devastating loss of her fiancé she just goes through the motions as an empty shell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Travis Montgomery, Olympic swimmer and totally gorgeous. He has several medals under his belt and just as many women. Mia is well aware of his womanizing reputation and refuses to be his next conquest, but finds herself coming alive again  whenever she’s around him.  They agree to be “just friends,” quickly finding that they are unable to fight the attraction between them.  Mia’s life becomes complete once again with Travis in it; but nothing good lasts forever, at least not in Mia’s world. Torn apart by an ugly secret, Mia’s heart is broken once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the unthinkable happens and Travis needs Mia the most, she must reach deep inside to find forgiveness for the one man who will always hold the key to her shattered heart. But will doing so only break it further; this time beyond repair?</description>

  <description>In 1918, the world seems on the verge of apocalypse. Americans roam the streets in gauze masks to ward off the deadly Spanish influenza, and the government ships young men to the front lines of a brutal war, creating an atmosphere of fear and confusion. Sixteen-year-old Mary Shelley Black watches as desperate mourners flock to séances and spirit photographers for comfort, but she herself has never believed in ghosts. During her bleakest moment, however, she’s forced to rethink her entire way of looking at life and death, for her first love—a boy who died in battle—returns in spirit form. But what does he want from her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring haunting archival early-twentieth-century photographs, this is a tense, romantic story set in a past that is eerily like our own time.</description>

  <description>Hilary Kent, a Londoner all his working life, retires to Wiltshire after an estranged cousin unexpectedly leaves him an inhabitable tower surrounded by an overgrown physic garden – and that's when graduate student Tom Laurence suddenly erupts into his life, convincing him that together they can restore the ancient garden to its former glory. Tom's cheerful friendship is the best thing that's ever happened to Hilary and he's perfectly content with that until, to his astonishment and confusion, it seems that Tom's affection for him is beginning to grow into something more … something he feels he probably shouldn't allow.</description>

  <description>A Delectable novella&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When artisan ice cream maker Jericho Brown first meets food writer Cameron Clay at a charity tasting event, they get along like strawberries and chocolate sauce. Jay's unique flavors thrill more than Cameron's jaded palate, but after a delicious encounter in Jay’s delivery truck, where extra-creamy frozen treats are not the only delights sampled, Cameron loses Jay’s contact info—and any hope of a real date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate, Cameron convinces his editor to host an artisanal ice cream contest in hopes of drawing out the elusive genius. But more complications threaten to intervene. Will Jay even enter the contest? Or will the chance of a happily ever after melt away?</description>

  <description>I didn't mean to let everything get so bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never had control over the variables in my life, and that was okay. That's just the way it was. But the drugs were supposed to be my constant, my escape, my refuge. They weren't supposed to pull me under and hold me down, bring me to the brink of death and keep me in that in-between state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They weren't supposed to turn on me, just like everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Logan May Reynolds, and this is my story.</description>

  <description>GENRE:  ADULT CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE &lt;br&gt;Please be advised that this book is NOT suitable for Young Adult readers due to language and explicit sexual situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hale Simmons dreams of climbing out of her impoverished life, going to college, and getting herself a titanium crash helmet, so she can eventually bust through the Plexiglas ceiling of her crappy life.  But for now, she’s just a 18-year-old girl with a flimsy hope, barely getting by with her alcoholic father, Jerry.&lt;br&gt;But for Hale, ‘crappy’ suddenly takes a nosedive, when Jerry becomes the sole witness to a horrible accident.  It is an event which means to effect everyone, especially Hale, who wasn’t even involved.&lt;br&gt;	While the depth of the accident has just begun to unfold, Otto Maree, a prominent business man and old family friend, stands to lose everything because of it.  Otto is desperate for Hale’s father to stay quiet about what occurred the night the two men met for a drink.  Out of mutual moments of desperation, the two fathers forge a deal.  Jerry is desperate to gain financial stability for both himself and Hale, and Otto Maree is more than willing to pay to keep his secret just that. &lt;br&gt;	But deals like this need to be made of the strongest vows and bound with the most faithful of loyalties.  Otto proposes a marriage between Hale and his playboy-son, Oscar, in order to assure that the secret remains ‘in the family’.  The mystery surrounding the accident continues to grow and Hale struggles against her own mysterious feelings that begin to develop for Oscar, who turns out to less of a playboy, but just as fiercely loyal and dedicated as his father.  &lt;br&gt;       As the pressure around her continues to escalate, Hale realizes that she’s got to decide if this arranged marriage is really just a big mistake or an amazing twist of fate that has been waiting around for this particular accident to happen.</description>

  <description>I had the perfect life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful and loving husband.Three gorgeous little girls.  &lt;br&gt;Successful career.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing missing was the white picket fence.  I really wanted that fence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, I lost that life.  I lost my husband.  And I lost myself.  But, eventually, I found my way through the darkness.  I’ve made peace with my new life. I have my girls, and that’s all that matters. They are my world.  I have no illusions of ever falling in love again or getting whisked away on a white horse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; came back into my life. On a freakin’ motorcycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no way I’ll let him turn my life completely upside down.  &lt;em&gt;Absolutely&lt;/em&gt; no way.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How long can I keep pretending that I’m happy with my life being right-side up?</description>

  <description>"Older Man/Younger Man" is a memoir of the relationship between a middle-aged man and a man thirty years his junior, from their first meeting, through the challenges of living together across a wide age-gap, to a climactic confession of shame and regret, the terror of loss from a life-threatening disease—and, ultimately, the triumph of love. This is a passionate, bittersweet story of a powerful love that transcends gender, bridges generations, defies convention, and brings to the partners the richness of spiritual fulfillment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relationship between an older man and a younger man is one of the last taboos left in our culture's sexual closet. "Older Man/Younger Man" is the first book to address an inter-generational gay male relationship as a path of spiritual redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What makes this book unique and special is its presentation of the pairing between an older man and a much younger man as a healthy, successful relationship and as a spiritual journey.</description>

  <description>Life's not always about the journey, but who takes you on the ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Midsummer Night's Steam story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stint in the Air Force left Ryan MacRae with a bitter memory of life in the closet. Jeff Allstein is a mechanic who has too much to lose if his private life becomes public. The heat of their attraction boils over on a stormy summer night, but satisfying that need only makes them both crave more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their searing connection makes it hard for Ryan to understand the road blocks Jeff continually puts down. Ryan will have to buckle up if he's going to find love at the end of his custom ride.</description>

  <description>Balancing freedom versus responsibility poses enough of a challenge for a college freshman without the added trauma of separation from his identical twin. Away from home for the first time to attend Vandercroft College for Visual Arts in Omega, Georgia, Andrew Dyer finds himself miles away from the life he loves and the family he treasures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three months earlier, Andrew's twin brother had disappeared, the victim of an apparent abduction. The trail went cold quickly; the police exhausted every possible lead, with no trace of Jonah ever found. With the start of a new school year, Andrew's parents insist that he carry on with his college plans, if for no other reason than to take his mind off his missing brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the beginning, the plan works. Andrew enjoys his classes, his freedom, and he even finds himself falling for Bruno, a fellow student. A sudden rash of violent murders and a case of mistaken identity lead Andrew to believe that Jonah has resurfaced—but changed in ways that Andrew never could've anticipated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story contains graphic sexual content intended for an adult audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Special Content Alert: Twincest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Word Count: 25,000&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Set against the glorious Cotswold countryside and the playgrounds of the world, Jilly Cooper's Rutshire Chronicles, Riders, Rivals, Polo, The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous, Appassionata and Score!, offer an intoxicating blend of skulduggery, swooning romance, sexual adventure and hilarious high jinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riders, the first and steamiest in the series, takes the lid off international showjumping, a sport where the brave horses are almost human, but the humans behave like animals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brooding hero, gypsy Jake Lovell, under whose magic hands the most difficult horse or woman becomes biddable, is driven to the top by his loathing of the beautiful bounder and darling of the show ring, Rupert Campbell-Black. Having filched each other's horses, and fought and fornicated their way around the capitals of Europe, the feud between the two men finally erupts with devastating consequences during the Los Angeles Olympics.</description>

  <description>Set in the very English suburbia of 1962 where everyone has tidy front gardens and lace curtains, Junction X is the story of Edward Johnson, who ostensibly has the perfect life: A beautiful house, a great job, an attractive wife and two well-mannered children. The trouble is he's been lying to himself all of his life. And first love, when it does come, hits him and hits him hard. Who is the object of his passion? The teenaged son of the new neighbours. Edward's world is about to go to hell. "Both a haunting tale of sexual obsession and a stunning portrait of an ordinary man caught up in the throes of an illicit love and teetering on the brink of self-destruction, told with pinpoint psychological insight and mouth-watering prose, this is a splendid example of the storyteller's art, reminiscent of James Baldwin." - Victor J. Banis, author of The Man from C.A.M.P.</description>

  <description>Two years after her best friend was involved in a car accident that caused a traumatic brain injury, Lottie Anders is ready to start her freshman year of college. Ready to move on. Ready to start forgetting the night that ripped her life apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Her plans come to a screeching halt when not one, but both brothers responsible for the accident end up back in her life again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Zack is cruel, selfish and constantly rubbing what happened to her friend in Lottie's face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Zan is different. He listens to her awkward ramblings. He loves &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt; as much as she does, and his dark eyes are irresistible. His words are few and far between, but when he does speak, she can't help but listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The trouble is, Zan was the driver in the accident, and now Lottie's discovered he lied to her about what happened that night. Now she must decide if trusting him again will lead to real forgiveness, or deeper heartache.</description>

  <description>Two years ago, Sean O'Neill's wife, Caitlin—the ace net-runner called Irishgirl—was stolen from their bed. Now, he knows where she is, but getting her back is only the first step in a long journey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caitlin has been trained as a sex slave, her former skills as a net-runner and cyber-thief totally stripped from her, along with her identity and most independent thought. Powerful and wealthy social elites, playing their own dangerous high-stakes games, have hired Sean to retrieve her and again make her what she once was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But two years is a long time to be out of the net and out of normal society. A lot of new programming has been laid down. Now, giving Irishgirl a hard reboot may take everything Sean has in him, and more...</description>

  <description>My life has always been safe. I like it that way. I grew up in a fake society where plastic hearts rule. If our hearts are made of plastic, they can never be broken. My parents have expectations and I do everything I can to meet them, even if it means giving up on my own dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, all I want is to be free to make my own choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dane Wright is everything I have been warned to stay away from. We met one night while I was with my perfect, parent-approved boyfriend and I haven’t stopped thinking about him. I don’t want to like him. I am doing everything I can to ignore his pull, but my heart seems to want what it cannot have, what it has never had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can he measure up? He may think I am too good for him, but maybe he is too good for me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is a series of choices and I have never been able to make my own. Until one day, when my heart decides to make a choice for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for mature readers due to sexual content and language</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a story about fate or destiny. This is a story about pain, sorrow, and suffering. This is an impulsive whirlwind romance between two lovers that are not meant to be together. Theirs is not a world with sunshine and roses. Instead, their love blossoms in a secret world full of crime, violence, and death. Their story is about what can be born from nightmares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danielle “Danny” West is the daughter of Deuce West, President of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. A sweet and beautiful girl, she loses her way, searching for things that are always out of her reach. Erik “Ripper” Jacobs is the Sergeant of Arms in the Hell’s Horsemen. Once a man who always had a smile on his face, his life takes a turn for the worst when a tragedy befalls him, leaving him scarred and broken. During a midsummer night, Danny and Ripper’s paths cross, forever changing their lives. Hastily, their lust turns to love until another tragedy forces them apart. On a journey that is marred with ugliness and chaos, Danny and Ripper must discover if their unforeseen connection can find the beauty in their world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Danny and Ripper’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything has beauty. Even the ugly. Especially the ugly.&lt;br&gt;Because without ugly, there would be no beauty.</description>

  <description>He was just hanging out before the club opened when all of a sudden he found himself transported to medieval Scotland (anytime between 400 and 1750). How was he received? How did he get there? Does he find someone who wants to make him stay in the past? Someone who wants to go back to the present with him? What happens to this kilted club boy when he gets sent back to when a kilt was the regular daily wear? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Wearing only a red tartan kilt, held up by a silver belt, the young man, born in 1987 from the tattoo drawn across his chest, waits for the nightclub to open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's 'Love is Always Write' event.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Blue Notes Series Novel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cary Redding is a walking contradiction.  On the surface he’s a renowned cellist, sought after by conductors the world over. Underneath, he’s a troubled man flirting with addictions to alcohol and anonymous sex. The reason for the discord? Cary knows he’s a liar, a cheat. He's the melody thief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cary manages his double life just fine until he gets mugged on a deserted Milan street. Things look grim until handsome lawyer Antonio Bianchi steps in and saves his life. When Antonio offers something foreign to Cary—romance—Cary doesn’t know what to do. But then things get even more complicated. For one thing, Antonio has a six-year-old son. For another, Cary has to confess about his alter ego and hope Antonio forgives him.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Cary thinks he's figured it all out, past and present collide and he is forced to choose between the family he wanted as a boy and the one he has come to love as a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note:  The Blue Notes Series can be read in any order. Each is a stand-alone story from the same classical music universe.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Blue Notes Novel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blame it on jet lag. Jason Greene thought he had everything: a dream job as a partner in a large Philadelphia law firm, a beautiful fiancee, and more money than he could ever hope to spend. Then he finds his future wife in bed with another man, and he's forced to rethink his life and his choices. On a moment's notice, he runs away to Paris, hoping to make peace with his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Jason's leave of absence becomes a true journey of the heart when he meets Jules, a struggling jazz violinist with his own cross to bear. In the City of Love, it doesn't take them long to fall into bed, but as they're both about to learn, they can't run from the past. Sooner or later, they'll have to face the music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;1st Edition published by Dreamspinner Press, December 20111&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Hy Breasil is grimmer than it used to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the Architect closed the door, there were regular crossings, and a great war decimated both humans and Ferishers. The native fae who refused to treat with the invaders faded; their bodies withered and died, stranding them as hungry, angry spirits that haunt the countryside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That means there’s always trouble brewing in Dorstaad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Janus Mikani and Celeste Ritsuko work for the Criminal Investigation Department, keeping citizens safe from things that go bump in the night. He’s a hardboiled cynic with an uncanny sixth sense; she’s determined to justify her promotion as the first female detective in her division. Together, they’re trying to keep a black tide from drowning the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the second body surfaces, murdered with the same type of infernal device, the entire CID must face the truth. There’s a madman on the loose, twining magic and blood… and only Mikani and Ritsuko can unravel the intricate, lethal conspiracy before the Royale killer completes his macabre plan, unleashing old, forbidden magic on an unsuspecting populace. If the maniac succeeds, it could mean the end of everything…</description>

  <description>A temporary arrangement? Don't bet the ranch on it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Innamorati, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the tender age of seven, newly orphaned Micah Jiminez lost everything--and got lucky. The Delaney family opened their hearts and their home, treated him like one of their own. One Delaney in particular, though, became more than a brother to Micah. The handsome and protective Tucker is the man to whom he wants to give his love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after a single passionate night together, Tucker rebuffs him and hightails it to Dallas to pursue his dreams. Leaving Micah to pick up the pieces of his broken heart--and feeling like a fool.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The impending death of the Delaney patriarch brings an unsavory relative out of the woodwork, threatening Micah's beloved adopted family. They're going to need all hands in the fight to keep The Bar D from being pulled out from under them all--including Tucker. Micah steels himself to convince the man he can't forget to come home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To his everlasting surprise, it's Tucker who comes up with the perfect solution: a marriage of convenience--to Micah. His gut tells him Tucker's motivation involves nothing more than saving the ranch. Now he just has to convince his fragile heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title has been revised and expanded by more than 10,000 words from its original published version.</description>

He'll do what he has to, but he knows he'll never find a love like the one he's lost. Alric has problems of his own, but is willing to go along with the wedding to help defend his kingdom from the forces ready to tear it apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Alric is gravely injured, Gareth discovers the secret of Alric's magic, and discovers that he has feelings for Alric that he's been trying to deny. They may be able to heal Alric's wounds, but can they defeat the enemy that lurks behind the scenes, waiting for them to make one false move?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: ISBN appears to be the same as another book.

  <description>In a world where two kingdoms are constantly at war, Prince Rinin, heir  to the throne of Kari Kingdom, has been demanded as a war conquest by King Merinej of Jede. The choice is simple: the prince will travel to his enemy's kingdom and share the king’s bed, or else the war continues. But Rin will  not lower himself to be a whore, so he demands a contract requiring the king to be faithful.  In return, the prince will risk his life by giving the king a child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where Rin expected nothing more than a business arrangement, he receives affection, yet the more surprising realization is the willingness of his own heart to return the same. But even his king cannot save Rin from those who wish him harm, and their joining might be over before it can fully bloom.</description>

  <description>Tyler Curtis is the quintessential rock star, with a notorious bad boy reputation as legendary as his awesome talent. Jordan Braxton, on the other hand, leads a quiet existence as a website designer and shares a house with his sister, Rebecca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rebecca wins tickets to see Curtis in concert, and drags an unwilling Jordan along to the show, his ordered world is about to be turned upside down. Tyler’s life is spinning out of control, but reality is far different to the myth a controlling manager has built up around him. Will Jordan get to know the real Tyler, and can they both survive the fallout that ensues?</description>

  <description>Jerry McKenzie is a reclusive and antisocial artist, quite content to ride his horses and work in his studio, keeping to himself. It's not any kind of life for a child, and when Jerry finds out he’s been named his orphaned nephew’s guardian, he panics. He doesn't know what to do with a child and isn't sure he can give William the affection and the love the boy so desperately needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Jerry meets David Loewenberger, the new teacher William becomes immediately attached to, and he starts to see how they could make a family together: a family to replace the one William lost, a family David had given up on ever finding... a family Jerry never knew he wanted.</description>

  <description>When the forest behind a Minnesota pawn shop turns out to be the doorway into a faerie paradise, Miles Larson doesn't see any reason to complain. He's bankrupt, single, and living in a trailer in his backwoods hometown after being laid off from his big city job: he could use a little downtime in a homoerotic dreamland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Miles soon learns that in the faerie world, nothing is quite as simple as it seems. The beautiful faerie man who has captured Miles's heart might also be after Miles's soul. The frightening beast who chases him through the forest is actually a noble-hearted human under a terrible curse. And at the center of it all is the deathly beautiful Lord of Dreams, a faerie so powerful that if Miles so much as looks at his face, he will be lost in dreamland forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only hope for Miles's escape is a magic flute, an enchanted instrument that holds the answer to the faerie lord's defeat. But even if Miles is smart and strong enough to wield it, will he dare? When the cold light of truth dawns, if there is no reality beneath the love he's found in the faerie realm, Miles will have to return to his own world—alone.</description>

  <description>"Finding love can be a bumpy ride. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His job: downsized out of existence. His marriage: on the rocks. It doesn t take a lot of arm twisting for Tim Knight to agree to get out of London and take over his injured brother s mountain bike shop for a while. A few weeks in Southampton is a welcome break from the wreck his life has become, even though he feels like a fish out of water in this brave new world of outdoor sports and unfamiliar technical jargon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The young man who falls literally through the door of the shop brings everything into sharp, unexpected focus. Tim barely accepts he s even "in" the closet until his attraction to Matt Berridge pulls him close enough to touch the doorknob.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There s only one problem with the loveable klutz: his bullying boyfriend. Tim is convinced Steve is the cause of the bruises that Matt blows off as part of his risky sport. But rising to the defense of the man he s beginning to love means coming to terms with who he is in public in a battle not even his black belt prepared him to fight. Until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains an out-and-proud klutz, a closeted, karate-loving accountant and a cat who thinks it s all about him. Watch for a cameo appearance from the "Pricks and Pragmatism" lovers. May inspire yearnings for fresh air, exercise, and a fit, tanned bike mechanic of your very own.</description>

  <description>Austin and Jay want a Dom in their lives, but not a third person in their bed. When their Dom moves away, replacing him turns out to be trickier than they’d thought and the two of them are getting desperate. Enter Liam, a friend of their former Dom, deliciously sexy and stern, ready to spank them into shape – and straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s all going so well, but can Liam separate his growing attraction to his two young subs from what they do during their sessions? And can Austin and Jay handle the discovery that Liam means more to them than he was ever supposed to?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Austin’s younger sister April ready to do anything she can to make life difficult for the three men, is it going to be possible for Austin and Jay to prove to Liam that there’s room in their life – and their bed – for him?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I went to Thailand to mend a broken heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Didn't work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, I saw things I’ve never seen before, ate things I’ll never eat again, and spent far too much time drinking horrible Thai whiskey and having sex with beautiful boys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I lived my life more intensely in six weeks than I had in the previous six years, and very quickly I found that I couldn't keep these crazy experiences to myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I wrote letters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long letters. Short letters. Gross letters, silly letters, sad letters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These letters.</description>

  <description>Jesse Reagan has had more than his share of tragedy, and he may have been dealt another blow when, once again, cancer threatens the sister who raised him. Faced with the possibility of being left behind, Jesse vows to care for her young son, though he’s not convinced he can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Trip Cantrell returns to town, he’s blindsided the instant he’s reunited with his kid brother’s lifelong friend, Jesse. His inability to find happiness in the years he’s been gone, suddenly makes sense. Love’s been waiting at home all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life begins to look promising, except for the fact that neither have come out of the closet publicly, and that’s not even their biggest problem. Someone has a secret so shocking they may never find a way past it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will they be accepted in their small Texas town, or will secrets, lies, and the threat of tragedy destroy everything?</description>

  <description>Army Medic, Private Michael Crest, is quite content in his life with the exception of one thing—he’s in need of a good man and has his sights set on another medic, Specialist Jared Prophet.&lt;br&gt;The problem? Jared’s in deep denial about his sexuality.&lt;br&gt;After an unexpected, erotic exchange, Jared decides his only recourse is to distance himself from Michael and plans a trip to his family’s lake-house with friends, which would have worked, if one of his friends hadn’t invited Michael to tag along.&lt;br&gt;As a tropical storm hits the Texas Gulf Coast, the two men give into unbridled passion. But more than the weather gets rough when the storm passes and Jared learns his parents are among the missing.&lt;br&gt;Can the lovers endure the fallout or will unearthed truths prove more devastating than any natural disaster?&lt;br&gt; After all, just because they aren’t gonna ask, doesn’t mean they want you to tell…</description>

  <description>Vampire, Tristan Deveraux, savored the night with his young progeny, Caleb, by his side. Satisfying his shameless desires, he took what he wanted without reprisal or regret, until Gauge Roberts darkened his door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gauge, an ex-Navy Seal, offered more than muscles and brawn when he became Tristan’s personal security coordinator. Surrendering to an undeniable attraction, the dominating soldier scratched an itch both had ignored far too long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A remarkable bond is quickly formed between the three very different men, allowing each to fulfill individual needs while maintaining separate but equal relationships, until a surprising enemy threatens to destroy it all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will they survive the deadly fight, or is heartbreak the only price for satisfying their kind’s immortal thirst?</description>

  <description>Lauren Grahame has spent her whole life thinking something special was going to happen. She didn’t know what it was, she just knew it would one day be hers. But she learned the hard way that special wasn’t on offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, after divorcing her cheating husband, Lauren searched for nothing special and she thought she found it when she landed a job as a waitress in a biker bar in Carnal. It was perfect: a nothing job in a nowhere bar in Nowheresville.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Tatum Jackson walked in. Part-owner of the bar, he took one look at high-class Lauren and wanted nothing to do with her. And he made this known, loudly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tate’s angry insults seared in her brain, Lauren decides the feeling is mutual and she doesn’t want anything to do with the gloriously handsome Tate Jackson. The clash of the bartender and barmaid begins but, even though Tate makes his change of mind clear (in biker-speak, a language Lauren is not fluent in), Lauren is intent on going her own way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until a serial killer hits Carnal and Lauren finds out Tate isn’t a bartender, he’s a bounty hunter. He stakes his claim for Lauren before he goes on the hunt for a killer but Laurie doesn’t speak biker nor does she understand bounty hunters and Tate comes back from the hunt to find his old lady has moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life throws curveball after curveball at Laurie and Tate. As secrets are revealed, women are brutally murdered, and Lauren tries to find her inner biker babe.</description>

  <description>Farm lad Iain Munro knows his love affair with Tavish MacIntyre, future Laird of Creachann-Dubh, is dangerous—discovery could mean disgrace and death. But they’ve been in love since they were boys, and they’ve never been able to resist each other, dishonorable though it is to deceive their families.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young men now, their sexual explorations have deepened and their love for each other has strengthened. But Iain’s father fears for his eldest son’s future, and Tavish faces dangers and duties of his own: his demanding mother would see him respectably wed, and his interfering sister knows too much—and has schemes of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing a lifetime apart, Iain and Tavish must leave their childhoods behind for good as they choose between honor and love, innocence and happiness, and their vows before God and to each other.</description>

  <description>Paul Hammond is dead. That's what tough and sexy LAPD Detective Daniel Moran tells his lover, Hollywood actor Sean Fairchild--and Sean wants to believe him, but what about those threatening postcards in Hammond's handwriting? The last thing Sean needs is someone doubting him. But then, what does Sean really know about his new boyfriend? Dan is a dark horse--and maybe Sean is betting too much on this relationship. He can't afford to take foolish chances. It not just Sean's career at stake or his relationship or even his sanity--it's his life. [Publisher's note: this book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: m/m homoerotic sex practices.]</description>

  <description>As his birthday approaches, Matthew Westlake fears more than just growing a year older. He fears never seeing another year at all. Each birthday brings a close call with death, leaving holes in his memory, recurring nightmares, and one more glimpse of his guardian angel. This birthday Matt must stand against ancient evils that have hounded him since birth, because he is a Gifted One—a seventh son of a seventh son. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within Matt rests the unlocked potential of a force for good, but it also makes him a target. Being the Gifted One and dodging demonic attacks aren’t Matt’s only problems, though. He’s fallen in love with his protector, the Archangel Gabriel, and Heaven will condemn that love to save Matt’s soul. But Heaven doesn’t count on Gabriel loving Matt in return, defying divine law and placing them in danger from demons and angels alike.</description>

  <description>When Rory Macintosh’s roommates find out that their studious and shy friend has never been with a guy, they decide that, as an act of kindness they’ll help her lose her virginity by hiring confident, tattooed bad boy Tyler Mann to do the job…unbeknownst to Rory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyler knows he’s not good enough for Rory. She’s smart, doctor smart, while he’s barely scraping by at his EMT program, hoping to pull his younger brothers out of the hell their druggy mother has left them in. But he can’t resist taking up her roommates on an opportunity to get to know her better. There’s something about her honesty that keeps him coming back when he knows he shouldn’t…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn between common sense and desire, the two find themselves caught up in a passionate relationship. But when Tyler’s broken family threatens to destroy his future, and hers, Rory will need to decide whether to cut her ties to his risky world or follow her heart, no matter what the cost…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I'm going to give you memories to last a lifetime, Genevieve Cain. I promise you that."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a loser ex-boyfriend threatening her dream business, Sweet Seduction, Genevieve Cain is forced to go to a lawyer to finalise things once and for all. Gen knows she's only good for one dream in her lifetime, so when she meets senior partner, Dominic Anscombe, in the foyer of the law firm's building, she dismisses any delusional ideas her mind creates involving his very fine body. But Dominic is intrigued by Gen's run-away mouth and if there's one thing to say about Dominic Anscombe, he knows what he wants and when he finds it, he sets out to take it, claim it and possess it - completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidnappings, shootings, dream-shattering moments, hot investigators and just as hot lawyers, everything comes to a head when Genevieve sacrifices something so precious for something even more so. And it wasn't the sacrifice she thought she'd make. The sweetest of sacrifices, the most worthy offering. But can she believe Dominic has fallen as hard for her as she has for him in such a short time? And can she allow herself a second dream in her life, by letting him in?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love at first sight has never been so dangerous and so very delicious at the same time.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Strangers in reality, inseparable in dreams…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of suffocating under her boss’s scrutiny, whale biologist Zoe Morgan finally lands a job as director of a tagging project in Hervey Bay, Australia. Success Down Under all but guarantees her the promotion of a lifetime, and Zoe won’t let anything—or anyone—stand in her way. Not the whale voices she suddenly hears in her head, not the ex who won’t take no for an answer, and especially not the gorgeous figment of her imagination who keeps saving her from the fiery hell of her dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gavin Cassidy hasn’t been called to help a human Wyldling in over a year, which is fine by him. Still blaming himself for the death of his partner, he keeps the guilt at bay by indulging in every excess his rock star persona affords. That is, until he’s summoned to protect Zoe from hungry Fyre Elementals and learns his new charge is the key to restoring order in the dying Dreaming. He never expects to fall for the feisty Dr. Morgan…nor does he realize he may have to sacrifice the woman he loves to save an entire country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Not suitable for readers under the age of 18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**The author will donate all profits from the sale of the JUST BREATHE trilogy to programs that educate people about whales and the challenges they face.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;STRINGS is not suitable for slut shamers, uptight stone throwers, Holier-Than-Thou prudes, humorless virgins, persons with chronic neck or back pain, pearl-clutching bitties, those who disparage crude humor or vulgarity in their many forms, closed-minded people with sticks up their asses, or anyone under the age of 18. The vile, base language and shocking, unholy sexual acts contained herein are not condoned by anyone with a lick of sense and should certainly not be reproduced without proper training and protection. The potty-mouthed and perpetually horny "heroine" (the term is used loosely) of this book does not resemble a normal, well-adjusted, or remotely believable person in any way, shape, or form. The author acknowledges that the characters in this book are shallow and two-dimensional; the plot is both ridiculous and insipid. She makes no apologies for any of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Readers are strongly advised to wear latex gloves whilst reading to minimize contamination risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free-spirited musician Letty Dillinger adheres to a strict, “no strings attached” policy when it comes to men. After a wild night of unabashed sex in a fancy hotel room, she never expects to see the adventurous stud she dubs “Shades” again. When her all-girl rock trio books a tour at the last minute as the opening act for their archenemies, Letty’s shocked to discover she knows the competition’s new lead singer. Intimately. Shades is no longer a one-night stand. Now he’s the guy she has to one-up on stage every night for the sake of her career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing close quarters on a bus with her sexy nemesis and his bad-boy buddies puts Letty’s Golden Rule to the test. On this tour, guitar strings aren’t the only things being played. And when heartstrings are pulled too hard, they’re bound to snap sooner or later.</description>

  <description>Some statistics say that 40% of all homeless teens are GLBT. They’re on the streets after their families have thrown them away, told them that they don’t matter, that they’re not normal. Well, guess what? Those families are wrong. This collection of stories by ten talented authors spans the spectrum (historical, paranormal, transgender, cutter, gay) to show that – it’s okay, there are people out there that care, and these teens are perfect just the way they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All royalties from this anthology are being donated to Lost-n-Found Youth in Atlanta, Georgia. A wonderful charity working with these teens, helping them find their new place and get on their feet.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When everyone reads minds, a secret is a dangerous thing to keep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Kira Moore is a zero, someone who can’t read thoughts or be read by others. Zeros are outcasts who can’t be trusted, leaving her no chance with Raf, a regular mindreader and the best friend she secretly loves. When she accidentally controls Raf’s mind and nearly kills him, Kira tries to hide her frightening new ability from her family and an increasingly suspicious Raf. But lies tangle around her, and she’s dragged deep into a hidden world of mindjackers, where having to mind control everyone she loves is just the beginning of the deadly choices before her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindjack Trilogy&lt;/strong&gt; (novels):&lt;em&gt; Open Minds, Closed Hearts, Free Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindjack Origins&lt;/strong&gt; (shorts): &lt;em&gt;Mind Games, The Handler, The Scribe &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Reading Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14059393.Mind_Games" title="Mind Games"&gt;Mind Games&lt;/a&gt; (prequel short story to Open Minds)&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12727768.Open_Minds" title="Open Minds"&gt;Open Minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15928450.The_Handler" title="The Handler"&gt;The Handler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15928642.The_Scribe" title="The Scribe"&gt;The Scribe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12971480.Closed_Hearts" title="Closed Hearts"&gt;Closed Hearts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12971486.Free_Souls" title="Free Souls"&gt;Free Souls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href="http://www.mindjacktrilogy.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;MindjackTrilogy.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Davis always assumed they would wind up back together, until Jack calls and invites Davis to his wedding to Tadd Austin, a prominent architect in Chicago. Jack's only known Tadd for two weeks, so whatever Jack feels for Tadd couldn't possibly compare to what he shared with Davis. There's no way in hell Davis can stand by and watch the life he always expected to get back slip away to some guy Jack barely knows. Tadd Austin, indeed...more like Toad Ass-ton, Davis thinks. &lt;p&gt;With his best friend, fashion designer Deseree Wildwood in tow, Davis has to shed his sweet, guy-next-door persona, and re-vamp his image into a self-confident, hot piece of eye candy. He's going to the wedding with only one goal in mind: to do whatever it takes to win back Jack. The Toad is toast! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in Chicago, Davis discovers it isn't going to be as easy as he thought. Not only is Tadd very un-Toad-like, but a mysterious British playboy named Alex Parker manages to interject himself into the mix. Only true love will survive as the tug of war ensues in this Bermuda love triangle from hell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Simon's years of hiding and keeping his identity a secret are shattered just as soon as The Hooded Crows play at his bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the last six years, Simon has struggled to keep his identity a secret along with a past that, so far, has stayed right where it belongs. Beaten to the edge of his life, he left everything behind when he fled to Washington. Including his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when the shrill ringing of his phone wakes him in the middle of the night, the last person he expects to hear on the other end of the line is his baby sister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After living together for over five years, David figured there wasn't much more to learn about Simon Taverdy. That is, until he overhears Simon talking on the phone. Tied to this life by a family of his own, David refuses to pack their things and leave, even if it means putting Simon's life in danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With only four weeks left until Christmas, going home for the holidays takes on new meaning, especially when it involves the cops and an abusive ex who's still on the run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, can Simon and David survive the fallout of his past, or will he bolt again to the middle of Nowhere?</description>

  <description>Saylor Grayson makes herself sick. Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She  ate her first needle when she was seven. Now, at nineteen, she’s been kicked out of college for poisoning herself with laxatives. The shrinks call it Munchausen Syndrome. All Saylor knows is that when she’s ill, her normally distant mother pays attention and the doctors and nurses make her feel special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Drew Dean, the leader of a local support group for those with terminal diseases. When he mistakes her for a new member, Saylor knows she should correct him. But she can’t bring herself to, not after she’s welcomed into a new circle of friends. Friends who, like Drew, all have illnesses ready to claim their independence or their lives.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time, Saylor finds out what it feels like to be in love, to have friends who genuinely care about her.  But secrets have a way of revealing themselves. What will happen when Saylor’s is out?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kristina Douglas’s sexy new series introduces a realm of fallen angels and ruthless demons, where an eternal rebellion is brewing . . . and one unsuspecting woman can change the fate of the Fallen forever.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She was just an ordinary mortal . . .&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re dead” is &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;not what Allie Watson wants to hear. Unfortunately, it explains a lot. Like the dark, angelically handsome man who ferried her to this strange, hidden land. The last thing she remembers is stepping off a curb in front of a crosstown bus. Now she’s surrounded by gorgeous fallen angels with an unsettling taste for blood—and they really don’t want her around. Not exactly how she pictured heaven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. . . until death catapulted her into a seductive world she never imagined.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raziel is unsure why he rescued Allie from hellfire against Uriel’s orders, but she stirs in him a longing he hasn't felt in centuries. Now the Fallen are bracing for the divine wrath brought by his disobedience, and they blame Allie for the ferocious Nephilim clawing at the kingdom’s shrouded gates. Facing impossible odds at every turn, the two must work together to survive. Raziel will do anything to defend his spirited lover against the forces of darkness—because Allie may be the Fallen’s only salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Love plumbs deep below the surface. In 1946, Sarah, a grieving war widow goes to the carnival with friends and is riveted by the tattooed man in the freak show, adorned in head to toe body art. Later she discovers the man hiding in her hayloft, escaped from imprisonment by the evil owner. She shelters Tom on her farm, fighting a powerful attraction while learning about his mysterious past and gentle nature. When a child goes missing, Tom uses his psychic gift to find her but his assistance doesn't relieve the locals' mistrust of such an exotic stranger. Small-town prejudice tears the lovers apart and a very real threat from the carnival owner endangers them. Can the lovers rise above obstacles of fear and hatred to create the family both have always craved?</description>

  <description>In the year 2050, America has changed. Profoundly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homosexuality is a crime, cursing is a punishable offense, and lifestyle legislation keeps American citizens on a prescribed moral path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The country lives in a Moral Age, all thanks to The Moral Authority, the nation’s fourth branch of government, which has held dominion for the past thirty-five years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet the Moral Age comes at a price. Americans either live like mindless cattle or in fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told from three points of view, Mark, the brash young hero who finds true love in the most desolate of places; Isaac, the renegade, who searches for redemption; and Samuel the dictatorial megalomaniac intent on maintaining his power, Moral Authority exposes what happens to a nation that continues to restrict, instead of broadening, civil rights.</description>

  <description>Donovan Holloway, advertising executive, newly made vice president of the company where he's worked for twenty years, grew up in a free love hippie commune, taking care of the parents who should have been taking care of him. He's worked hard to put himself through school and achieve the American dream. All he's ever wanted was a normal family life—house in the suburbs, two cars, two kids, a shaggy dog. A family to come home to—to care for, and to care for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mischa Blake is the green eyed, liberally-pierced, black-haired, Mohawk-wearing spoiled youngest son of a Hollywood producer and his actress wife. Mischa has made a terrible mistake. In a fit of childish pique, he's accepted a dare from his older brothers. The dare? Live on his own, supporting himself completely for a year without accessing his trust fund. No problem. Except Mischa has never worked a day in his life, hasn't finished college, and has absolutely no skills that he can bring to the table. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when he sees Donovan's ad for a housekeeper/gardener, he has nothing to lose by applying, because really...how hard can it be?</description>

  <description>His Grandma always said he'd come to no good. Chances Are, she's right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Aaron "Chance" Dumont:&lt;br&gt;"I'm Chance, this is my place. You want me; this is where you can find me."&lt;br&gt;The problem with that, of course, was that it wasn't my name. My name was actually Aaron Dumont.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I picked up the name Chance as a kid when my grandma kept telling me "Chances are you'll come to no good, just like your pa." She had said it so often, it just kind of stuck. I've been Chance ever since. When she passed away and left me the remains of her estate, I sold everything but a few special items then invested it all in a nest egg for a rainy day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I figured that's what she'd intended it for anyway. She'd said as soon as I joined the police force back in the eighties. "Chances are you'll come to no good there. It's a dangerous job and you're an accident waiting to happen."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was right too.</description>

  <description>After the death of their father, Jordan moves home to help her brother put him to rest. He breaks the news one night that evidence has come to light that they might not actually be related. Which puts a whole new spin on the vivid sexual fantasies they’ve had for years. Fantasies about each other. There’s a very un-sibling-like attraction between Jordan and Gareth and it’s bubbling to the surface more and more with each day they spend together. A little knowledge can be powerful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question becomes, do they wait to sort it all out? Jordan wants to learn the pleasure of pain, and she knows her brother can teach her. Gareth is more than happy to give instructions, because he just wants Jojo, he’s wanted her for a very long time. So do they wait, or do they proceed, because…what if they’re wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warnings: This title contains pseudo-incest, BDSM, spanking, anal sex, explicit sex and language.</description>

  <description>Kyle Miller is a rare breed. Though born to conservative parents and raised in small-town Oklahoma, Kyle realized young that he had to escape rural America. Now he's living in New York City, working as an ER doctor, and paying off his massive student loans. He's never been on a plane and never seen a movie, but he is worldly enough to recognize attraction when it smacks him in the forehead. Not that he knows how he managed to crack heads with Joseph, who's a good foot shorter than Kyle's six and a half feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joseph is Kyle's polar opposite in other ways too, well-off where Kyle is poor, and self-assured while Kyle is insecure. He's also determined to show Kyle what a great guy he is and bring the confidence Kyle shows in the ER out in his everyday life. But Kyle's hectic work schedule and inexperience with relationships won't make for an easy romance.</description>

  <description>Aaron is a lonely, unloved boy when he first meets James. Their friendship seems like a dream come true—or perhaps just a dream, because no one else can see or hear James. Aaron stubbornly clings to his new friend, however, even when the friendship makes him an object of scorn and ridicule. No matter the years that pass, or the challenges they face, Aaron refuses to give up on his best friend—but life might just find a way to take James from him anyway.</description>

  <description>Blue Echohawk doesn't know who she is. She doesn't know her real name or when she was born. Abandoned at two and raised by a drifter, she didn't attend school until she was ten years old. At nineteen, when most kids her age are attending college or moving on with life, she is just a senior in high school. With no mother, no father, no faith, and no future, Blue Echohawk is a difficult student, to say the least. Tough, hard and overtly sexy, she is the complete opposite of the young British teacher who decides he is up for the challenge, and takes the troublemaker under his wing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of a nobody who becomes somebody. It is the story of an unlikely friendship, where hope fosters healing and redemption becomes love. But falling in love can be hard when you don't know who you are. Falling in love with someone who knows exactly who they are and exactly why they can't love you back might be impossible.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Anna Van Housen has a secret.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gifted illusionist, Anna assists her mother, the renowned medium Marguerite Van Housen, in her stage show and séances, easily navigating the underground world of magicians, mediums, and mentalists in 1920’s New York. As the illegitimate daughter of Harry Houdini—or so Marguerite claims—sleight of hand illusions have never been a challenge for Anna. The real trick is keeping her own gifts secret from her opportunistic mother. Because while Marguerite’s own powers may be a sham, Anna possesses a true ability to sense people’s feelings and foretell the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Anna’s powers intensify, she begins to experience frightening visions of her mother in peril, which leads her to explore the powers she’s tried so long to hide. And when a mysterious young man named Cole moves into the flat downstairs, introducing Anna to a secret society that studies people with gifts like hers, she is forced to confront her past and rethink everything she’s ever known. Is her mother truly in danger, or are Anna’s visions merely illusion? And could the great Houdini really be her father, or is it just another of Marguerite’s tricks?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Teri Brown comes a world bursting with magic, with romance, and the temptations of Jazz Age New York—and the story of a girl about to become the mistress of her own destiny.</description>

  <description>Paralyzed by the past and terrified of the future, Tabitha Kelly is broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a public sex scandal at her college, Tabby moves to a new city with a new school, convinced she can start over. But she soon realizes the changes are not enough. Tabby must take action to help her heal and move on from the past. &lt;br&gt;And though it sounds crazy, she believes a one-night stand is the best way to take back what’s hers.  If she can choose where, when, and most importantly, who … maybe she can regain control.&lt;br&gt;First, she needs a willing participant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She finds more than that when she meets Noah Adler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, she can’t go through with it. And when she tries to forget about the plan—and the guy—it becomes impossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah quickly weaves his way into her new life and her heart.  But as he comes dangerously close to discovering her secret, Tabby’s at risk of losing it all.</description>

  <description>Maia Pierce, a top agent for a private security firm and a widely known rule breaker, was good at her job. In her last mission, her risk-taking had finally caught up with her and she had now incurred the wrath of a Russian drug lord bent on destroying her. With assassins after her, one man had offered her his protection. But Jack McCord may be an other kind of danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex-Navy SEAL Jack McCord had everything: a thriving defense company, good looks, and no shortage of beautiful women. But what he coveted the most hadn’t wanted anything to do with him. Maia Pierce, his brother’s bodyguard, was the most intriguing woman he had ever met and he wanted her. When Maia got into trouble, he saw an opportunity to offer a no-strings attached arrangement and as she resists the idea, he is only left with one choice. He abducts her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack didn’t expect to fall hard. Now that he had, he has to convince Maia that she could be feeling the same in her heart. But the danger that Maia finds herself in, and the secrets she keeps from Jack threaten to derail their happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Strong sexual content and language. 18 years+.</description>

Then an American heiress falls in his lap, literally, and he must find a way to keep her at a distance to protect not only his secret, but everyone around him from an assassin sent to kill him.</description>

      <![CDATA[No rating because I didn't finish this one. ::Sigh:: I guess this really cements that steampunk is not for me. It was actually a bit more sci-fi than steampunk, but I didn't didn't connect to the plot. There was also some Christian elements, which makes this book REALLY not for me. Oh well.]]>

  <description>Up until he buys an old truck, Elijah Morgan lives life according to his family’s plan, never feeling like he belongs. Desperate to find his own path, he heads out on the open road, only to end up stranded in Nebraska. Not wanting to ask for his parents’ help, he takes a job with tough, independent farmer Chase McKenzie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite their age gap, the attraction between Chase and Elijah soon becomes undeniable. They give in to their desire, but that night changes everything and threatens the secret Chase guards so carefully. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the summer heats up, so does their relationship. When autumn arrives, Elijah is due back at college, and he’ll have to choose whether to continue his education and follow in his family’s footsteps… or to stay in Nebraska with the man he loves.</description>

  <description>Alejandro and Otto find themselves cast into a world of the unexpected. There with a cast of characters worthy of Pedro Alamadovars' attention, their story begins. Even in the insular world of ballet, the cold war Russia, still has plans for world domination.</description>

  <description>Captain Tristan Kelley enjoys the luxuries of Regency service, as well as the pleasure of his Prince's bed. It's an easy life, if not a happy one. When the Prince decides to take a trip through the perilous Blind Space, Tristan must go with him, but somebody in the Prince's guard is a traitor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blind and held prisoner, Tristan finds himself at the mercy of Valero, a pirate who bears no love for the Regency. Valero is determined to seduce Tristan, and Tristan fears his resolve won't last. His duty is clear, but so is his desire. As the days tick by with no word or ransom from the Regency, Tristan begins to question what loyalty means to his Prince, the Regency he's sworn to, and to the man who holds him captive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tristan begins to realize that being a prisoner may actually set him free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;42,240 Words&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for three years and then be granted her freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilirating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one of the other contestants turns up dead... quickly followed by another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.</description>

  <description>Percy’s given up. He’s given up and wants to be as far away as possible from the place that has been the source of his troubles all his life. But to his disappointment, he finds himself in the last place he expected. And a chance encounter with a redneck and a stubborn hound dog aren’t helping, either. That is… until they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Invincibility can be found in the strangest places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This short story by JF Smith imagines that, perhaps, very big things can happen in very small moments.</description>

  <description>"I’m intrigued.  Tempted beyond what I’ve ever been before.  To know her, to open her up.  To break her."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In love, sometimes what you fear most is exactly what you need.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laura Drake is an author.  She writes bestselling paranormal romances that continue to top the charts.  She is sharp.  She is confident.  She is in control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she doesn’t exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samantha Jansen is the woman behind the wig, the woman most of the world doesn’t know exists.  She is shy.  She is insecure.  She is nothing like her main character or her alter ego.  She is scarred—deeply scarred—by a past she can’t let go of and a present she can’t make peace with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samantha’s dreams are consumed by one man, the broken hero from her books.  Mason Strait is both her wildest fantasy and her most terrifying nightmare. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Samantha meets Alec Brand, a corporate consultant, it is as though Mason has come to life.  Alec is handsome to a fault, as elegant as he is arrogant, and more intense than any man has a right to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samantha is soon sucked into a world that mirrors the fiction she writes.  Just like her main character, Daire Kirby, Samantha finds herself unable to resist the forbidden lure of Alec.  And just like Daire, she also finds that she is faced with taking a chance on a man who could either set her free or destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scale tilts toward destruction when Samantha finds out that Alec is as much a work of fiction as Mason.  And he has scars of his own, scars that could ruin them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This book may be read as a stand-alone, as the story of Alec and Samantha comes to a conclusion in this book**</description>

  <description>Surgical Tech student, Bryan Mullally, has been pining for his best friend, Staff Sergeant Aaron Briggs since they met in middle school. When Bryan's exhaustion from juggling school, work, and helping support his sister and nephew catches up with him, his secret slips out, and he wholeheartedly expects the ultimate rejection. As it turns out, Bryan hasn't been the only one keeping secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the new—and very physical—phase of their relationship, Bryan realizes their lives haven't changed all that much. When Bryan recognizes that Aaron still looks at him the same way he always did, even when he says, "I love you," he finally understands the old adage, "The more things change, the more they stay the same."</description>

  <description>Part of the  &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11278174-first-time-for-everything"&gt;First Time For Everything Daily Dose 2011 collection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Patrick Hinsen wants is a little action, a little release, and a little bit of courage to approach the new guy in Human Resources. Instead of hitting the bar, he decides to give anonymous phone sex a try, thinking nothing of envisioning Carter, the smooth talker on the other end of the line, as the new HR guy. It’s all fun and games until it starts affecting his work. Finding himself drifting off in sexy fantasies at the office is bad enough. It’s downright crazy when he learns that the hot new HR rep’s name is Robert Carter. When Patrick finally invites Robert out to a hockey game, the similarities start stacking up—and their fledgling relationship may flounder when the coincidences become too numerous to ignore.</description>

  <description>Book 2 in the Hard Rock Harlots Series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: BEATS is specially formulated for horn dogs, porn oglers, smut peddlers, BDSM junkies, M/M and M/M/F addicts, DP dabblers, and lovers of A2M backdoor sexy times. If you don’t fall into these categories, can’t stomach hot man-on-man action, or if you have no idea what the above acronyms mean, please back away from BEATS now. This isn’t the book you’re looking for. Failure to heed this warning could inadvertently throw unauthorized users into a persistent vegetative state, or at the very least, require administration of a defibrillator to the chest and/or groin area. Nobody wants that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For months, shy drummer Jinx Hardwick has been silently crushing on her tall, dark, and scary bandmate, Toombs Badcock. Drawn to his frightening ink and scars, she yearns to uncover the shadowy secrets lurking behind his silver eyes, but Jinx is too intimidated to even look at him, let alone talk to him. When she stumbles upon Toombs and their manipulative lead guitarist Rax in a compromising position, Jinx realizes her chances of winning Toombs’s heart aren’t just a long shot—they’re nonexistent. To make matters worse, Jinx’s family needs her at home. She’s about to back away from it all—Toombs, the band, her dreams of fame and fortune—when Rax makes her an offer she can’t refuse: a no-holds-barred night alone with Toombs. There’s one small catch. She has to go through Rax to get it.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Genre: LGBT Erotic Contemporary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disowned and cast out of his home, eighteen year old Declan Mayo turns to the only thing he can think of to help him get back on his feet. Working at the Chicken Ranch, a rural brothel that caters to women and gay men, seems like the perfect solution. He isn't about to let a lack of sexual experience stop him from taking what he sees as a way off the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling in love with one of his clients wasn't in the game plan, but Declan can't seem to help himself. Killian Hamilton is sweet and kind, with a stutter Declan can't help but find adorable. Surely, if anyone could overlook Declan's choice of employment, it would be a kindhearted man like Killian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Declan didn't figure on Killian's connection to one of the brothel's regular clients, and now his love life's about to blow up in his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>When Dante di Salvatore, former prostitute and adopted son of one of Florence’s reigning nobles, is bitten by the ancient vampire goddess Lillith, his mortal life is over. Once enslaved by the vampire queen’s malign influence, Dante allies himself with Rouen, a young man of dazzling beauty and great influence who is enamored with Dante. But they cannot truly be together unless Dante changes Rouen into a vampire, and for Rouen, accepting the dark gift may ultimately cost him his immortal soul. Soon the great city of Florence will be taken to account for her sins as the streets are scourged of everything the fanatical preacher Serenola deems unnatural.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But many silent, mostly unseen creatures of the night are coming together from the disparate corners of the earth to do battle one last time against Serenola, evil disguised as good. What Dante does not realize is that he, above all others, holds the key to not only his own salvation, but the preservation of all of vampire kind—and perhaps even the human race.</description>

  <description>Drew Evans is a winner. Handsome and arrogant, he makes multimillion dollar business deals and seduces New York’s most beautiful women with just a smile. He has loyal friends and an indulgent family. So why has he been shuttered in his apartment for seven days, miserable and depressed? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’ll tell you he has the flu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we all know that’s not really true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katherine Brooks is brilliant, beautiful and ambitious.  She refuses to let anything - or anyone - derail her path to success. When Kate is hired as the new associate at Drew’s father’s investment banking firm, every aspect of the dashing playboy’s life is thrown into a tailspin. The professional competition she brings is unnerving, his attraction to her is distracting, his failure to entice her into his bed is exasperating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, just when Drew is on the cusp of having everything he wants, his overblown confidence threatens to ruin it all.  Will he be able untangle his feelings of lust and tenderness, frustration and fulfillment? Will he rise to the most important challenge of his life? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Drew Evans win at love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tangled is not your mother’s romance novel.  It is an outrageous, passionate, witty narrative about a man who knows a lot about women…just not as much as he thinks he knows.  As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing he never wanted in life, is the only thing he can’t live without.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This straight-A student has a dirty little secret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian Blake dreams of being a kindergarten teacher, but making the grade means maintaining a squeaky clean image: no drinking, no drugs, no swearing, no sex. And definitely no falling for his new roommate—tattooed bad-boy Max, who may or may not be a drug dealer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of all, it means no working at a porn store. But Christian’s aunt has cancer, and her beloved Rear Entrance Video will go bankrupt if Christian doesn’t take over managerial duties. Soon enough, Christian finds himself juggling sticky twenty-five cent peepshow booths, a blackmailing employee, and a demanding professor who likes to make an example of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there’s Max, who doesn’t know anything about the store, but hates Christian’s preppy sweater vests and the closet Christian forces him into when they’re together. Max just wants Christian to be himself—even though Max is keeping secrets of his own. Christian struggles to find the impossible balance between his real life and the ideal one he thinks a teacher needs to live . . . all while trying to keep his aunt’s dream alive without losing his own.</description>

  <description>Kuriko Mai is a stein with an issue. She never remembers sex. Nor does she recall meeting the men she finds in her bed. Cursed with flawed programming, she’s all but given up hope of having a normal life. However, after years of watching her suffer, her boss Frank can’t stand it anymore, and he’s determined to make her remember any way he can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frank has always loved Kuri. And when he finds himself in a heated embrace with her, he can’t walk away—even knowing she may not remember him in the morning. But when it’s obvious Kuri recalls moments of the passion they shared, the two decide to become lovers in hopes Frank holds the key to ending her malfunctioning programming. Their plan backfires when their erotic experience opens a floodgate of memories so painful, Kuri breaks down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to move forward, Kuri has to face her past. She just doesn’t know if she can risk the pain loving Frank could cause.</description>

  <description>Silence is only skin deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen year old Daniel Colton is the guy all the girls want to date, and the man all the guys want to be. Moody, with an explosive temper, closed off and sullen, he’s also beautiful, tatted in delicious ways, with a pierced eyebrow and spiky black hair. It’s rumoured he has piercings in other places, too. Is he really mad, bad and dangerous to know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel lives with his older brother, Zef, and their home is party central. You want drugs, a good time, liquor, no questions asked? Colton’s is the place to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Daniel and good girl Lisanne Maclaine have to work together on an assignment, Lisanne finds there’s a lot more to the college’s bad boy than his reputation. He’s intelligent and funny and good company. And then she discovers his secret, why he’s so closed off to everyone, and determined to keep people at arms’ length. But being his secret-keeper is harder than she ever dreamed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended for readers 18+ due to sexual references and sex scenes, some coarse language, drug references and drug use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: 154,726&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Kami Glass loves someone she’s never met . . . a boy she’s talked to in her head ever since she was born. She wasn’t silent about her imaginary friend during her childhood, and is thus a bit of an outsider in her sleepy English town of Sorry-in-the-Vale. Still, Kami hasn’t suffered too much from not fitting in. She has a best friend, runs the school newspaper, and is only occasionally caught talking to herself. Her life is in order, just the way she likes it, despite the voice in her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that changes when the Lynburns return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lynburn family has owned the spectacular and sinister manor that overlooks Sorry-in-the-Vale for centuries. The mysterious twin sisters who abandoned their ancestral home a generation ago are back, along with their teenage sons, Jared and Ash, one of whom is eerily familiar to Kami. Kami is not one to shy away from the unknown—in fact, she’s determined to find answers for all the questions Sorry-in-the-Vale is suddenly posing. Who is responsible for the bloody deeds in the depths of the woods? What is her own mother hiding? And now that her imaginary friend has become a real boy, does she still love him? Does she hate him? Can she trust him?</description>

  <description>Ernest just turned thirty. It's time for retirement, freedom from the tedious drudgery of his job as a data clerk. Time to explore parts of the city he's never seen before, and hopefully meet some people other than his Deacon or his health monitor. And at the end of the month? Time to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will runs the counter at the historic coffee shop, and when he talks, he sounds just like an old-time data feed. He's nothing like anyone Ernest has ever met—which isn't saying much—but still, something about him simply doesn't parse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----------&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cover art by:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://bishonenworks.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;P.L.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The sexy second installment in the Inside Out erotic romance trilogy, following &lt;em&gt;If I Were You&lt;/em&gt;—in the seductive tradition of &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fascinated by the dark fantasies in the journals she’s discovered, and the two men who have now found a place in her life, Sara McMillan finds herself torn between her new life and her past. Now, more than ever, Sara identifies with the lost journal writer, Rebecca, and is certain that something sinister has happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the arms of the sexy, tormented artist Chris Merit, Sara seeks answers about Rebecca and ends up discovering things about herself she never knew existed. Chris forces Sara to reconsider who she is and what she truly wants from life, but not before his dark desires threaten to tear them apart. Her boss, Mark Compton, offers her the shelter to understand just what those needs mean to her, and what they might have meant to Rebecca, but can she trust him to lead her to a final conclusion to Rebecca’s story?</description>

  <description>(This book includes mature content, including sex and language)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22-year-old Camryn Jacobs lost the love of her life once and vows to never kiss another guy unless she's in love with him. When she meets Teague, their attraction to one another is off the charts, and for the first time in two years, she wants to disregard her rule. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Camryn makes a bet that he can't go just one week without kissing her. She's protecting her own fragile heart, but her wit and smart mouth end up driving Teague crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Teague is equally skilled at her challenge, their friendship turns complicated. He's not at all what she assumed, and he makes her feel things she never expected to feel. But sharing her true reasons for the no-kiss bet hurts too much and she keeps him in the dark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teague has his own secrets to hide, starting with his last name. It's the reason he left town--to lick his wounds until he can piece his life back together. His time with Camryn proves that it might actually be possible, but with the threat of his family and his past ruining all that he's finally gained, can he really take that risk again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loving might be easy; learning to trust again could be too difficult to achieve...</description>

He ends his affair with his lover, Jorge Villagomez, and marries Rebecca to establish a life with her as a respected San Antonio businessman. They have a son and he tells himself he is happy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Eleven years later, Jorge returns to San Antonio, and his path crosses with Honor’s once more. The flame of their passion never died, and neither did Jorge’s love for Honor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Jorge approaches Honor to design his studio, Honor believes he can walk the line between friendship and lovers. But when a sudden crisis threatens to take Jorge from him forever, Honor must choose between his duty and his heart. Most of all, he’s forced to decide what he’s willing to lose in order to be true to who he really is.</description>

  <description>What happens when two men who have been together for seventeen years fall out of love? Sivan Cruz, a set director in San Francisco, and Walter Wainwright, a big shot Bay Area lawyer, find out the hard way. Walter loves Sivan with all his heart but rarely talks about it, and Sivan needs to hear the words. The language of the love they have shared for so long, that has enabled them to build a life together and raise two children, stops working. They become—still. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sivan asks for a divorce, Walter doesn’t know how to say no. They separate, but while Sivan sees the relationship as over, Walter sees only a temporary setback. He has never lost his passion for Sivan and decides he has to say something before he ends up loving his husband in silence for the rest of his life.</description>

  <description>Lucien Durand and Colin Ferguson have lived and loved as partners in life and art for more than twenty years. But happily ever after is never easy. Over time, Lucien begins to resent how Colin's work overshadows his own art, and their relationship falls apart. Colin leaves with nothing but a backpack, and Lucien goes on alone, getting some counseling, developing a practice in raku pottery, and waiting for what would happen next. He never expects that Colin will send his nephew James to train as a potter. With James staying in Lucien's home, a door will open between the former lovers, firing their hearts.</description>

  <description>All Jason Zachary wants is to keep the loneliness and despair at bay. He escapes to the clubs where drugs and a warm body for the night offer fleeting comfort. But when he wakes one morning, dazed after another blackout, to find himself in bed with a dead body, his life careens him into the arms of Detective Alexander Spider. For Jason, Spider becomes an addiction, a drug that makes him feel alive and safe; his body craves Spider's control, and Jason falls hard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Alex Spider sees the darker side of humanity daily, and he isn't looking for connections, only to drown himself in encounters with nameless subs willing to let him play his bondage games. His attraction to Jason begins as lust for one more golden boy, but their games of pain and pleasure grow into a tenuous trust, arousing feelings in Spider that are the first light he's seen in a long time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Spider races to solve a brutal homicide, the daily grind of the job takes its toll, and Spider's control slips dangerously. A killer closes in, and Spider must confront his own inner darkness, while Jason struggles to save himself by making some hard choices.</description>

  <description>Makenna James thinks her day can't get any worse, until she finds herself stuck in a pitch-black elevator with a complete stranger. Distracted by a phone call and juggling too much stuff, the pin-striped accountant caught only a glimpse of a dragon tattoo on his hand before the lights went out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caden Grayson is amused when a redhead literally falls at his feet. His amusement turns to panic when the power fails. Despite his piercings, tats, and vicious scar, he's terrified of the dark and confined spaces. Now, he's trapped in his own worst nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To fight fear, they must both reach out and open up. With no preconceived notions based on looks to hold them back, they discover just how much they have in common. In the warming darkness, attraction grows and sparks fly, but will they feel the same when the lights come back on?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sometimes you have to lose it all to find what you really need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photographer Kay Turner is dealt a double whammy when she flies home for her grandmother’s funeral to find her boyfriend with another woman. Now with two losses to mourn, she retreats to her newly inherited beach house to clear her head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything at the beach is familiar: the sounds of the ocean, the scent of her grandmother’s perfume—and the irresistible smile of James Margolis. The man Kay spent her adolescence pining for is every bit as charming as she remembers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James always thought of Kay as “a nice kid”, but he feels something very different for the woman she’s become. Especially when he asks if she’d be willing to part with some of her grandmother’s recipes for his new restaurant—and they wind up sharing much more than culinary secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as their relationship deepens, Kay finds herself caught between the demands of her dream career as a travel photographer, and a chance for happiness with the one man she’s wanted for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product Warnings: This foodie romance contains sensual scone baking, a heroine who discovers one bad apple hasn’t spoiled her appetite, and a delicious hero you can’t help but crave. Blend well, serve hot.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Nick Bedford, closeted coach of California Pacific College’s men’s rowing team, is struggling with professional ethics. He denies his attraction to Morgan Estrada, a rower on the crew, though the heated glances between them drive Nick wild. Then Morgan makes a move... and though Nick panics, Morgan gets what he wants: Nick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safely assured that he’s not preying on a younger man, Nick gives in to his feelings for Morgan. They take pleasure in sharing their daily routine, and the sex sets the sheets afire. Everything seems perfect until an anonymous complaint is filed against Nick right before the biggest race of the year. It’s exactly what Nick has feared most—and it may be enough to capsize the fledgling relationship.</description>

  <description>Fifty years ago the Commander came into power and murdered all who opposed him. In his warped mind, the seven deadly sins were the downfall of society. He created the Hole where sinners are branded according to their sins and might survive a few years. At best. &lt;br&gt;Now LUST wraps around my neck like blue fingers strangling me. I’ve been accused of a crime I didn’t commit and now the Hole is my new home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkness. Death. Violence. Pain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now every day is a fight for survival. But I won’t die. I won’t let them win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hole can’t keep me. The Hole can’t break me. &lt;br&gt;I am more than my brand. I’m a fighter. &lt;br&gt;My name is Lexi Hamilton, and this is my story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes we choose love, but sometimes, fate chooses for us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alyssa has started a new job, and from day one, she’s been haunted by dreams of a man she’s never met but can’t seem to forget. Then Alyssa meets her boss and her world comes to a grinding halt. It’s him. But as impossible as that is, things are about to get even stranger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark is a man with secrets. Plagued by guilt and regret, he has spent countless years simply existing. They say you don’t know what you have until it’s gone, and no one knows that better than him. He’s lost a piece of himself he thought he could never get back. Until the day he met Alyssa for the first time…again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When unexplainable events occur, the two learn that some actions have consequences so severe that even a powerful love may not overcome them.</description>

  <description>Gene Sage has only ever wanted to sing, but his band, Evolution, is pushing him toward the big time. He finds it hard to focus on making musical history when he’s dreaming of graveyards and seeing ghosts. And while all he can think of is hiding who he is from a world unforgiving of anyone different, he discovers he’s also the ultimate snack for vampires and demons. When Gene literally runs into—over—his idol, Kerstrande Petterson, rock god, vampire in hiding, and music cynic, his life falls over the edge into chaos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaded by the world and nearly a decade in the music business, Kerstrande thinks Gene wants to use him to make Evolution immortal in more than one way, but he can’t seem to brush aside the young singer’s enthusiasm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting involved with Kerstrande drags Gene into otherworldly power struggles. Between the ghosts stalking them, the media painting supernaturals as villains, and a vampire out of control in the city, the only way for Gene and Kerstrande to survive is for Gene to embrace his powers—and his destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This is a teen novel.</description>

  <description>For Tommy Bradley, a hand working on the Lost Cow Ranch in rural Texas, admitting his sexuality is impossible, even if his bosses, Luke and Simon, are gay—Tommy has spent his entire life hiding the truth from his homophobic parents. Then Tommy meets pastor Noah Taylor in Luke’s father’s hospital room, and his difficult secret becomes that much harder to keep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah is unlike any man of God—or any man—Tommy’s ever met. For one thing, his congregation is made up primarily of GLBT individuals and their families. For another, he isn’t afraid of the attraction he feels toward Tommy, and he makes his intentions very clear. But Noah won’t hide his sexuality or his love from the world, and he won’t start a relationship with Tommy while Tommy hides his, either. Faced with the choice of losing Noah or coming out to his parents, Tommy takes his first steps out of the closet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tommy isn’t the only one facing challenges. Thanks to an outpouring of hatred from Pastor Jackson and a group of ranch owners, Noah must cope with the possible loss of his church and his livelihood.</description>

  <description>Can you ever really outrun your past?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Krissy Mullins, an overworked, obsessive-compulsive publicist has been giving it her best shot for the past ten years. Throwing herself into her work and devoting all her time to her teenage starlet client, Krissy finds little time for anything else. But as fate would have it, her world is turned upside down when she falls in love with laid-back California native, Ben Torres. Unfortunately, her only frame of reference on love and marriage is her parents and they weren’t exactly the poster children for a happy relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Krissy attempts to navigate the precarious world of love, acceptance, and compromise, her past comes flooding back like she never expected. An ex-boyfriend returns from a life she has tried to forget, stirring up feelings in Krissy she had thought were long gone. Pulled in opposite directions as her past and present collide, she makes a rash decision that will forever change her life.</description>

  <description>When Noble, a common thief, rescues a cursed prince to clear his own name, the last thing on his mind is falling in love. True love, however, is at the top of Prince Danson's to-do list; hence why he had himself cursed and locked away in a tower in the first place. The trying journey home brings them closer together, but are the secrets from their past powerful enough to rip them apart forever?</description>

  <description>There’s complicated. And there’s Rowen Sterling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After numbing pain for the past five years with boys, alcohol, and all-around apathy, she finds herself on a Greyhound bus to nowhere Montana the summer after she graduates high school. Her mom agreed to front the bill to Rowen’s dream art school only if Rowen proves she can work hard and stay out of trouble at Willow Springs Ranch. Cooking breakfast at the crack of dawn for a couple dozen ranch hands and mucking out horse stalls are the last things in the world Rowen wants to spend her summer doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Jesse Walker saunters into her life wearing a pair of painted-on jeans, a cowboy hat, and a grin that makes something in her chest she’d thought was frozen go boom-boom. Jesse’s like no one else, and certainly nothing like her. He’s the bright and shiny to her dark and jaded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowen knows there’s no happily-ever-after for the golden boy and the rebel girl—happily-right-now is a stretch—so she tries to forget and ignore the boy who makes her feel things she’s not sure she’s ready to feel. But the more she pushes him away, the closer he seems to get. The more she convinces herself she doesn’t care, the harder she falls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her dark secrets refuse to stay locked behind the walls she’s kept up for years, Rowen realizes it’s not just everyone else she needs to be honest with. It’s herself.</description>

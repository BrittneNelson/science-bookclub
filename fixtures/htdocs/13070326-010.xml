  <description>All Shane Perkins ever wanted to be was a hero. But after a career-shattering decision to go down fighting, Shane comes home from the hospital to four empty walls, a pile of money, and a burning desire for someone to miss him the next time he gets hurt in the line of duty. He ends up an officer in the small town of Levee Oaks, and, addicted to the promise of family, he makes an effort to reconcile with his flighty, troubled sister. Kimmy makes her living as a dancer, and her partner steals Shane's breath at first sight. Mikhail Vasilyovitch Bayul dances like an angel, but his past is less than heavenly. Since he left Russia, he's made only two promises: to stay off the streets and stay clean, and to take his mother someplace beautiful before she dies. Making promises to anybody else is completely out of the question-but then, Mikhail has never met anybody like Shane. Earnest, brave, and self-deprecating, Shane seems to speak Mikhail's language, and no one is more surprised than Mikhail to find that keeping promises is Shane's best talent of all.</description>

  <description>Having annoyed the council, Grunk is assigned the job of Director of Human/Dragon Relations. Unfortunately for Grunk, he hates the city, he'd rather be in his dragon form than his human one, and he already hates the job even though it’s only his first day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he meets his assistant, Kyfan, and he's instantly smitten. When he finds out that Kyfan has never really flown and rarely spends any time in his dragon form, Grunk is shocked and insists on changing that, immediately. After all, flying with the lovely Kyfan's way better than sitting behind his desk in his office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turns out that Kyfan is a lovely little dragon and once they've flown together, Grunk knows that they share a bond and he prepares to make his claim. The fact that it's going to annoy the council is only a bonus.</description>

  <description>Since finding her father’s body at the bottom of the basement stairs, Annette’s been drifting through her days, watching cars pass down the rural Ontario crossroads beside her house. Her brothers have no great ambitions, but Annette remembers a time when she did. She just can’t remember what they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets her neighbour, Sadie, a tattooed, world-weary, newly single portrait artist. Something about Sadie awakens something in Annette—the essence she captures in her subjects, perhaps, or the way the old familiar crossroads seem so fresh and promising from the view out Sadie’s window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annette begins to help Sadie, cleaning brushes and filing invoices between long lazy afternoons of conversations and shared silences. Soon, though, Annette wants more from her enigmatic neighbor, and their slowly heating friendship melts into passionate nights. Somewhere along the way, Annette discovers that her lover has illuminated for her, as with the people Sadie paints, not just her essence but her own endless worlds of possibilities.</description>

  <description>After a vicious attack by gay bashers, Glenn left the city for a small town, worked at home, and hid in his apartment, determined no one would ever again know he was gay. Chad, openly gay, arrived in town to discover the job he came for fell short of promises and the man he must work with hates gays and harasses him constantly. When Chad and Glenn meet as next door neighbors, it’s instant attraction. Can it ever grow into more than sex, hiding behind closed doors or will Chad find living in deception too hard to take? The answer comes when Glenn is attacked again, and Chad’s biggest fear is, that as before, Glenn will run, leaving the chance of love behind.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Blood sings to blood, Froi . . . &lt;br&gt;Those born last will make the first . . . &lt;br&gt;For Charyn will be barren no more.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years after the curse on Lumatere was lifted, Froi has found his home... Or so he believes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiercely loyal to the Queen and Finnikin, Froi has been trained roughly and lovingly by the Guard sworn to protect the royal family, and has learned to control his quick temper.  But when he is sent on a secretive mission to the kingdom of Charyn, nothing could have prepared him for what he finds.  Here he encounters a damaged people who are not who they seem, and must unravel both the dark bonds of kinship and the mysteries of a half-mad Princess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in this barren and mysterious place, he will discover that there is a song sleeping in his blood, and though Froi would rather not, the time has come to listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gripping and intense, complex and richly imagined, &lt;em&gt;Froi of the Exiles&lt;/em&gt; is a dazzling sequel to &lt;em&gt;Finnikin of the Rock&lt;/em&gt;, from the internationally best-selling and multi-award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Looking for Alibrandi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Saving Francesca&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On the Jellicoe Road&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Piper's Son&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Vitala Salonius, champion of the warlike game of Caturanga, is as deadly as she is beautiful. She’s a trained assassin for the resistance, and her true play is for ultimate power. Using her charm and wit, she plans to seduce her way into the emperor’s bed and deal him one final, fatal blow, sparking a battle of succession that could change the face of the empire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the ruler of a country on the brink of war and the son of a deposed emperor, Lucien must constantly be wary of an attempt on his life. But he’s drawn to the stunning Caturanga player visiting the palace. Vitala may be able to distract him from his woes for a while—and fulfill other needs, as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucien’s quick mind and considerable skills awaken unexpected desires in Vitala, weakening her resolve to finish her mission. An assassin cannot fall for her prey, but Vitala’s gut is telling her to protect this sexy, sensitive man. Now she must decide where her heart and loyalties lie and navigate the dangerous war of politics before her gambit causes her to lose both Lucien and her heart for good.</description>

  <description>A remarkable debut novel from Jeffrey Luscombe-a compelling series of linked stories of a young man's coming-out, coming-of-age, and coming-to-terms with his family and fate. Josh Moore lives with his family on the 'wrong side' of Hamilton, a gritty industrial city in southwestern Ontario. As a young boy, Josh plots an escape for a better life far from the steel mills that lined the bay. But fate has other plans and Josh discovers his adult life in Toronto is just as fraught with as many insecurities and missteps as his youth and he soon learns that no matter how far away he might run, he will never be able to leave his hometown behind.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the author of &lt;em&gt;Happy Birthday or Whatever&lt;/em&gt;, an outright hilarious and heartfelt collection of personal essays about everything from underwear to musical theater.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie Choi wants to tell you a few things: She hates musical theater. She thinks sandwiches are boring. She likes camping, except for the outdoors part. She daydreams about cannibalism. At fifteen, her father made her read the entire car manual before allowing her to sit in the driver’s seat. And she once chased down a man who stole her handbag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this is to say that Choi is one part badass and one part curmudgeon, with a soft spot for savage bears. But mostly she wants to ask the world: WTF?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in Choi’s strikingly original and indignant voice, &lt;em&gt;Shut Up, You're Welcome&lt;/em&gt; paints a revealing portrait of Annie and her family in all their quirky, compelling, riotous glory. Each of Choi’s personal essays begins with an open letter to someone (her naked neighbor) or something (the San Fernando Valley), that she has a beef with. From the time her family ditched her on Christmas to her father’s attachment to an ugly table, Choi weaves together deeply personal experiences with laugh-out-loud observations, all of which will charm you, entertain you, and leave you wanting more.</description>

  <description>Helen is a disembodied spirit who "attaches" herself to humans in order to possess their bodies.  Unable to remember the circumstances of her death, and with no idea why she's in this precarious state of limbo, she knows this much: she's been haunting the living world for 130 years.  But when Helen inhabits the body of a high school teacher, everything changes.  For though he remains quite unaware of her presence, a certain boy in his class is clearly able to see Helen.  This realization, and Helen's subsequent introduction to him, rocks her world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uncomfortable with the boundaries of her existence, Helen continues to test them and takes hair-raising risks -- often for love.  Moved by her passions, she is stymied by limits placed on her that she doesn't yet understand and is unable to control.  Despite the supernatural realm it explores, &lt;em&gt;A Certain Slant of Light&lt;/em&gt; is nothing sort of chilling in its evocation of a world that's starkly real, and a newfound love that's positively sublime.</description>

  <description>While attempting to escape the agonizing memories she associates with Christmas, twenty-nine-year-old widow Megan Snow builds a snow family outside the mountain cabin she once shared with her husband-and collapses in tears against the snowman at the sight of what she'll never have.Called to life by the power of Megan's tears, snow god Owen Winters appears unconscious on her doorstep in the midst of a raging blizzard. As she nurses him to health, Owen finds unexpected solace in her company and unimagined pleasure in the warmth of her body, and vows to win her heart for a chance at humanity.Megan is drawn to Owen's mismatched eyes, otherworldly masculinity, and enthusiasm for the littlest things, and her heart opens enough to believe he's a Christmas miracle. But this miracle comes with an expiration-before the snow melts and the temperature rises, Megan must let go of her widow's grief and learn to trust love again, or she'll lose Owen forever.</description>

  <description>Gracie has just finished her freshman year of college in Memphis when she takes a job at a local pizza joint in her home town of McKenzie, Tennessee. She is the epitome of innocence when she meets Noah. Noah is unabashedly handsome, intriguingly reckless and just cocky enough to be sexy. Gracie’s instincts tell her to stay far away from him and based on the stories she hears from her co-workers he leaves broken hearts in his wake. But still, she can’t explain her fascination with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah puts aside his bad boy ways when what he thought was a summer crush has him unexpectedly falling in love. But soon after Gracie transfers to UT Knoxville to be with Noah, their unexpected love becomes riddled with anger, deceit and humiliation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake, Noah’s former roommate and Gracie’s best friend, can no longer be a bystander. Gracie’s world falls out from beneath her and when she breaks she turns to Jake for strength. As Jake talks her through a decision she’s not yet strong enough to make, together they uncover a truth so ugly neither of them is prepared for its fallout. Will Jake pull her to the surface or is Gracie Jordan finally In Too Deep?</description>

  <description>Jonah was confused. He thought he should be happy with his life. He had loving, supportive parents, he excelled in school, had great friends, and the most beautiful girlfriend he could have ever asked for. Jonah was always level-headed, so he didn’t find it odd that when Bailey said she wanted a more physical relationship with him, he chose to wait. He didn’t want to rush into something so important, even though they’d known each other for years. He loved Bailey, that was certain, but he didn’t understand why she kept pushing him to have sex. He wasn’t ready…well…not until he met his brother’s new roommate…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke was older and wiser, but deeply buried in the closet. When he meets Jonah, desire takes a strong hold, and suddenly both of their lives are spinning out of control. Luke has his life planned out and he’s not ready to risk coming back out of the closet until he’s through college and settled in his career. But, when Jonah forces the issue, and history repeats itself, Luke tries to protect Jonah the only way he knows how…he runs, leaving Jonah alone and heartbroken.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note: Alternate cover edition for ISBN# 9780473214296&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You may not be aware, ma douce, but not all vampyre have a kindred, some will live out their existence without such beauty in their lives. I have waited five hundred years for you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vampires, shape shifters, ghouls and magic users abound in a world where the Norms, (those humans without paranormal abilities) are ignorant of the creatures of the night and the supernatural species that live alongside them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucinda Monk is a bank teller by day and a vampire hunter by night, but she wasn’t always a part of this world. Thrown into a heady mix of powerful people and sensual beings, she’s had to find her way practically blindfolded in amongst the creatures of the night. But she’s a capable and realistic kind of girl. Her motto: never show fear. But, there's something different about Lucinda, something those creatures she hunts, want. In order to stay one step ahead of the enemy she has to let the enemy in. In all his compelling, seductive and delicious ways. Sleeping with the enemy has never meant so much before. But, can she trust him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the urban streets of the city, to the dark alleys and sinful bars that promise a wickedness a girl from the farm has never before been exposed to, Lucinda gets drawn irreversibly into the dark side of life. And if the Master of the City had his way, she would always be his. For eternity.</description>

  <description>Skylar is used to the way people think of him as frightening, mean, and dangerous. Snakes are not the most popular shifters around and the fact he grew up wild doesn't help. He knows the way he's chosen to live alone in the woods only makes things worse, but he didn't think it meant people thought him capable of killing a couple of wolf puppies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to find the real monster who left them to die, Skylar calls up the only wolf he knows, a man he always wished would see him as more than a snake …</description>

  <description>Entertainment journalist, Ryan Pierce, meets the infamous bad-boy rocker, Dagger Drummond, and walks away with a great interview and a scandalous news bit that has the potential to turn the music world on its ear. Exposing the story would boost Ryan's career, but it would also come with the risk of ruining Dagger's privacy – and possibly his Rock God status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unlikely friendship that develops between Dagger and Ryan brings Ryan to question more than just his journalistic oath to report the news. It also forces him to take a look at himself and newly discovered feelings – feelings that make Ryan blind to the risk of becoming front page news himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Ryan find the courage to make a life decision to give himself true happiness with Dagger or take the path that would likely lead to heartbreak and destroy his career forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;** Fall For Me is currently a Finalist for the 2013 Rainbow Award in the gay erotic romance category.</description>

  <description>Economics professor Ryuu Tanaka suffers through the embarrassment of playing softball with his students to get closer to the man sitting under a nearby tree. Ryuu finds Daniel to be more attractive, more intelligent, and more mysterious than any human being has a right to be. Despite the fact Daniel isn't gay, possibly isn't all there, and isn't interested in any future conversations, Ryuu has no intention of letting Daniel walk out of his life for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avoiding arrest as a stalker is only the first hurdle Ryuu must overcome to be with Daniel. Once he does, their friendship quickly turns into a love that has Ryuu planning long nights with the perpetually horny and submissive Daniel bound and at his mercy. But Daniel's failing mental stability forces Ryuu to delve into Daniel's past. Ryuu learns Daniel's real last name, the possibility of a child and that the man in his bed may not be Daniel at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryuu is desperate to keep the certifiably insane Daniel from slipping into his fantasy world with Armor, the version of Ryuu Daniel has created in his mind, but a homicidal student with a crush has other plans.</description>

  <description>I’m Jude Parks, writer of gay romances. Even though I’m good at what I do, the irony is that I haven’t exactly been lucky in love. My friend Jeannie says it's because I settle for Mr. Right Now instead of holding out for Mr. Forever. I say I’d rather regret what I have done than what I haven’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I only came to Romantic Voyages, the biggest romance convention in the country, for business. Yet in no time I got mixed up with a gorgeous cover model, weeping artists, drag queens, and crazy housewives—and became the prime suspect in a murder investigation. Well, they say any press is good press.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I should've stayed home. But then I never would’ve met Tommy Smith, the craziest, most outrageous, silly, sexy man I've ever known—a man who makes me wonder if it may be worth holding out for Mr. Forever. A man who might turn my rotten luck around. But only if we survive the weekend and I clear my name….</description>

  <description>It's a long way back to happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean and Kyle have enjoyed six perfect years of what their friends called a "disgustingly happy" relationship. But what happens one sunny Tuesday morning in October might be more than even the most loving couple can survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the bell rings that morning in chemistry teacher Sean Farnham's first-period class, a terrifying sound fills the halls--gunshots. Without considering the consequences, Sean runs to tackle the shooter, sustaining a bullet wound to his leg. Despite his actions, he is unable to save the lives of the principal and two students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Architect Kyle DeRusso hears about the shooting on the radio, and in the flash of an instant finds his life irrevocably altered. Everything--especially his heart--hangs suspended in a nightmare until he finds out Sean is alive. It doesn't matter that Sean will be left with a permanent limp. Kyle's just relieved the worst is over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is it? Putting that day behind them isn't as simple as it sounds. As Sean struggles to make something positive out of the tragedy, Kyle fights to save their relationship from the dangers of publicity--and Sean's unwillingness to face how the crisis has changed him.</description>

  <description>There’s a dead man in Miki St. John’s vintage Pontiac GTO, and he has no idea how it got there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Miki survives the tragic accident that killed his best friend and the other members of their band, Sinner’s Gin, all he wants is to hide from the world in the refurbished warehouse he bought before their last tour. But when the man who sexually abused him as a boy is killed and his remains are dumped in Miki’s car, Miki fears Death isn’t done with him yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kane Morgan, the SFPD inspector renting space in the art co-op next door, initially suspects Miki had a hand in the man’s murder, but Kane soon realizes Miki is as much a victim as the man splattered inside the GTO. As the murderer’s body count rises, the attraction between Miki and Kane heats up. Neither man knows if they can make a relationship work, but despite Miki’s emotional damage, Kane is determined to teach him how to love and be loved — provided, of course, Kane can catch the killer before Miki becomes the murderer’s final victim.</description>

  <description>LGBT Upper YA Urban Fantasy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*CAUTION : This title contains cursing, graphic violence, and references to sex.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abandoned as a baby and left in an orphanage for supernatural children, Octavian Julius McKellter— “Jay” to everyone who doesn’t want a punch in the face—now seventeen, is working full-time as a zookeeper at the Bayou Zoo and Aquarium while struggling to finish his GED. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bayou Zoo, staffed entirely by supernaturals, is one of many zoos across the country secretly housing magical creatures deemed too dangerous by the supernatural community to remain in the wild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jay ‘s job is made more complicated when accidents start happening too often to truly be accidents and habitats in Area Five—the covert section of the zoo which houses the magical creatures— are sabotaged, allowing some of the creatures to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working closely with Colin, a fellow zookeeper, to determine who’s causing the problems and why, is both a dream come true and a nightmare for Jay. Being gay isn’t something Jay’s prepared to accept with enthusiasm. Colin’s the first male he’s ever been attracted to, and the guy doesn’t even have the decency to be effeminate, which Jay thinks would somehow be easier to accept. Colin’s tall, strong, and everything that’s masculine.  And Jay can’t stop thinking about what it would feel like to press their lips together or draw his fingers down Colin’s tightly-packed abs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because someone’s bent on exposing supernaturals to the world by releasing the Bayou Zoo’s magical creatures, even if it means a little death and destruction in the process, there’s little time for Jay to worry about the ramifications of his shifting sexuality or the way Colin looks without his shirt on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping his sexuality a secret seems like just as big a job as keeping the entire Supernatural community and its captive magical creatures shrouded from the human world. As the sabotage attempts escalate, Jay must juggle his budding relationship with Colin, discovering who’s behind the disruption in Area Five, and staying alive while capturing loosened, deadly Gryphons, Gnomes and Harpies.</description>

  <description>The past pulls. The future shoves. The present just begs for a time-out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislynn Currington is searching for an escape from her tumultuous past, one that includes a severely broken heart and a very complicated relationship with a mother who uses criticism as her preferred mode of expressing love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Quinn is a driven businessman who, even after surviving a serious life-changing event, remains hell bent on avoiding any form of serious attachment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some define insanity as doing things repeatedly while expecting a different outcome. What will Aislynn and Jace need to do to break this endless loop?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of their undeniably intense sexual attraction, witty banter, and love for high-end coffee machines, Aislynn and Jace learn to bravely battle through the challenges of falling in love at the most inconvenient time, in a place they did not plan to be, and with the person they can’t seem to stop running into.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cursive's multiple layers of drama, romance, passion, and humor are tightly bound together by an unforeseeable major twist that will keep the reader engaged and connected until the very end.</description>

  <description>The award-winning author of Finnikin of the Rock and Jellicoe Road pens a raw, compelling novel about a family’s hard-won healing on the other side of trauma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning author Melina Marchetta reopens the story of the group of friends from her acclaimed novel Saving Francesca - but five years have passed, and now it’s Thomas Mackee who needs saving. After his favorite uncle was blown to bits on his way to work in a foreign city, Tom watched his family implode. He quit school and turned his back on his music and everyone that mattered, including the girl he can’t forget. Shooting for oblivion, he’s hit rock bottom, forced to live with his single, pregnant aunt, work at the Union pub with his former friends, and reckon with his grieving, alcoholic father. Tom’s in no shape to mend what’s broken. But what if no one else is either? An unflinching look at family, forgiveness, and the fierce inner workings of love and friendship, The Piper’s Son redefines what it means to go home again.</description>

  <description>Dustin Davis spent years wishing for a prince but kissing frog after slimy frog. When he sees Archer Kyriakides for the first time, Dusty thinks his luck has finally changed. Archer could be &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. The One. But their hot and cold romance leaves Dusty confused: why does it feel right one moment and wrong the next? It doesn’t make sense—until the day Dusty meets Archer’s identical twin, Asher, and realizes he’s been seeing them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asher Kyriakides dreams of being a fashion photographer, but he’s stuck with a job he hates and an irresponsible playboy brother whose habits drive him absolutely insane, especially when he finds out Archer is dating the cute little blond Asher can’t seem to forget. Torn between loyalty and desire, Asher does nothing but try to warn Dusty away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Archer finally goes too far, Dusty turns to Asher for comfort, and Asher knows he can’t refuse. It isn’t long before they realize they’re falling fast, but more than one thing stands in their way, not the least of which is Archer, who isn’t quite ready to stop being a thorn in his brother’s side.</description>

  <description>Sequel to Chaser &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The character you loved to hate in Chaser becomes the character you will simply love in Raining Men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been raining men for most of Bobby Nelson’s adult life. Normally, he wouldn’t have it any other way, but lately something’s missing. Now, he wants the deluge to slow to a single special drop. But is it even possible for Bobby to find “the one” after endless years of hooking up? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bobby’s father passes away, Bobby finally examines his rocky relationship with the man and how it might have contributed to his inability to find the love he yearns for. Guided by a sexy therapist, a Sex Addicts Anonymous group, a well-endowed Chihuahua named Johnny Wadd, and Bobby’s own cache of memories, Bobby takes a spiritual, sexual, and emotional journey to discover that life’s most satisfactory love connections lie in quality, not quantity. And when he’s ready to love not only himself but someone else, sex and love fit, at last, into one perfect package.</description>

  <description>The night is not safe for mortals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denise MacGregor knows all too well what lurks in the shadows – her best friend is half-vampire Cat Crawfield – and she has already lost more than the average human could bear. But her family’s dark past is wrapped in secrets and shrouded in darkness – and a demon shapeshifter has marked Denise as prey. Now her survival depends on an immortal who craves a taste of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is Spade, a powerful, mysterious vampire who has walked the earth for centuries and is now duty-bound to protect this endangered, alluring human – even if it means destroying his own kind. Denise may arouse his deepest hungers, but Spade knows he must fight his urge to have her as they face the demon nightmare together…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because once the first drop of crimson falls, they will both be lost.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;An immortal war has been brewing in the darkness . . . And now one woman has stumbled into the shadows.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chicago private investigator Kira Graceling should have just kept on walking. But her sense of duty refused to let her ignore the moans of pain coming from inside a warehouse just before dawn. Suddenly she finds herself in a world she's only imagined in her worst nightmares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the center is Mencheres, a breathtaking Master vampire who thought he'd seen it all. Then Kira appears, this fearless, beautiful . . . &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; who braved death to rescue him. Though he burns for her, keeping Kira in his world means risking her life. Yet sending her away is unthinkable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with danger closing in, Mencheres must choose either the woman he craves, or embracing the darkest magic to defeat an enemy bent on his eternal destruction.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Dating the Prince of Darkness has its challenges...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leila's psychic abilities have been failing her, and now she isn't sure what the future holds. If that weren't enough, her lover, Vlad, has been acting distant. Though Leila is a mere mortal, she's also a modern woman who refuses to accept the cold shoulder treatment forever–especially from the darkly handsome vampire who still won't admit that he loves her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like choosing between eternal love and a loveless eternity...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon circumstances send Leila back to the carnival circuit, where tragedy strikes. And when she finds herself in the crosshairs of a killer who may be closer than she realizes, Leila must decide who to trust– the fiery vampire who arouses her passions like no other or the tortured knight who longs to be more than a friend? With danger stalking her every step of the way, all it takes is one wrong move to damn her for eternity.</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, Rori Simon left town shy, unattractive and with zero self-esteem. Now she’s back, older, stronger and finally loving herself—and it shows. Hot men are soon knocking at her door, including Jude Callahan, the bad boy who starred in her teenage daydreams…and her adult fantasies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jude can’t believe the sexy, confident woman before him is actually Rori! She’s gotten under his skin like no other woman has…and brings out secret desires he can’t resist. He wants to dominate Rori with every fiber of his being. Wants to own her and pleasure her. To cherish her as he makes her his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rori discovers she likes being controlled. She also knows Jude is not a one-woman man. Everything changes when she meets Zach Helm. Edgy, sensual Zach knows just what she needs, and before long, she’s in love. Jude watches them together and wonders if he’s lost his chance forever…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS IS A REVISED AND EXPANDED EDITION FROM THE ORIGINAL 2005 VERSION.</description>

  <description>Life's a gamble--and lately David Schwartz's partner has been losing so much that David must close their restaurant, the hippest little place in Portland. He sells everything and moves back home, but at thirty-five, he's not eager to sleep alone in his childhood bedroom or to be supported by his father for the second time in his adult life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David's had enough. He needs to start over, maybe with someone like the elusive man he's been seeing in his dreams. An old friend offers him a job catering a movie set in Puerto Vallarta. It's been years since David's alcoholism spun out of control along the highways of Mexico. Determined to experience Mexico sober, he stuffs his few remaining possessions in a backpack and takes the next flight down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Mexico prepares for Christmas, David lights Hanukkah candles, celebrating the return of the sun and wishing for true love. On the first night of Hanukkah, David meets a tall, dark stranger who rocks his world in a secluded moonlit cove. Is this the mystery man of his dreams--the answer to David's prayers? And what must David sacrifice to make his dreams come true?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Symbols have power...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aren Montrell has heard tales of the Oestend wraiths - mysterious creatures which come in the night and kill anyone who's not indoors. Aren's never had reason to believe the stories, but when he takes a job as a bookkeeper on the BarChi, a dusty cattle ranch on the remote Oestend prairie, he soon learns that the wraiths are real. Aren suddenly finds himself living in a supposedly haunted house and depending on wards and generators to protect him from unseen things in the night. As if that's not enough, he has to deal with a crotchety old blind woman, face "cows" that look like nothing he's ever seen before, and try to ignore the fact that he's apparently the most eligible bachelor around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aren also finds himself the one and only confidante of Deacon, the BarChi's burly foreman. Deacon runs the BarChi with an iron fist and is obviously relieved to finally have somebody he can talk to. As their relationship grows, Aren learns there's more to Deacon and the BarChi than he'd anticipated. Deacon seems determined to deny both his Oestend heritage and any claim he may have to the BarChi ranch, but if Aren is to survive the perils of Oestend, he'll have to convince Deacon to stop running from the past and finally claim everything that's his. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book is set in an alternate reality and contains scenes of violence, mild D/s and bondage, and a M/M/M m nage scene.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Carrick Masters and Edward Boyd have already found true love—it’s the happy ever after that’s eluding them. Between Carrick’s job as an orthopedic surgeon and Ed’s career as a defense attorney, they have hardly any time to spend together, and what time they do have seems to be poisoned by resentment. Carrick and Ed know they need to refocus to make their marriage work, but they seriously need more than a spicy once-a-week date night to get them back on track.</description>

Parker, who has never been attracted to a man, is drawn to Dr. Jace Cross, the psychiatrist leading the class. But how can that be, since Parker is straight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace accepted the fact that he was gay many years ago, and he's comfortable in his sexuality, but he's been single for some time now. He throws himself into his work to fill the lonely void.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although sparks fly whenever they're together, Parker's reluctant to embrace these feelings he has for another man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the sexy doctor help him discover who he truly is</description>

  <description>When yakuza underboss Shigure Matsunaga meets Kenneth Harris at a boring social event, he’s surprised to find himself attracted to the blond gaijin with the mismatched eyes. Shigure is even more pleased when he discovers Ken not only speaks Japanese fluently, but is fluent in Japan's ways, even the more violent of the martial arts. Ken’s expertise at kendo is not his most striking quality—it’s the passion beneath his quiet, almost fragile exterior that ignites Shigure's lust, and the two come together as explosively as they spar.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shigure is a dangerous man in a dangerous position. He’s been trying to keep the peace with the Daito-kai—Shigure's hated rivals—but the danger on the streets is escalating, threatening those Shigure most wants to protect. He may claim to love his gaijin, but before he can keep Ken safe, Shigure will have to overcome hostility from his people, a hidden enemy, and, the most insidious opponent of all, his own hard-won pride.</description>

  <description>Adrian is more than happy as high-class escort for a number of regular clients. When his boss and dear friend asks him to entertain his nephew, Adrian readily agrees, but meeting Dan challenges him in ways he'd never imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan is scarred inside and out from an accident that destroyed a promising future. Despite Adrian's loveless lifestyle and Dan's withdrawal and anger, the two men forge a deep--if unnerving--connection. Soon they find themselves questioning the choices they've made and the futures they've mapped out for themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet even bright young men like Adrian and Dan fear the unknown and take comfort in the familiar. Neither may be strong enough to step away from the life they know and toward the one they dare not hope for. But while it's true that love can't heal all wounds, it is the surest balm for where you hurt the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"(This title is part of the 2012 Rentboy Collection.)"</description>

  <description>Nakagawa and Yokota are two boys very much in love with each other. Yokota is more open with his feelings, but Nakagawa is easily embarrassed of public displays of affection. Though they may be outwardly different, their feelings for each other are the same - their connection is such that they liken themselves to Do-Seibutu (Same-Cell Organisms).</description>

  <description>Novella: The only thing extroverted Nate loves more than baseball is his quiet, reserved Casey. The feeling's mutual, thanks--but it isn't all fun and games. A wedding planner, Casey's booked solid during the summer months and thanks to a certain poem about the Mudville Nine, cringes at the thought of ball games. Fair's fair--with seven older sisters who redefined “wedding drama”, Nate freezes at the thought of tying the knot. Casey might wish things were different, but he wouldn't trade Nate, his big heart, or his skills between the sheets for a wedding worthy of a Rockefeller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After losing a strip poker bet, Casey's promised forfeit is spending a full day at a softball tournament. He's sure there's more going on than a simple sports wager and wonders what Nate's up to, but he's curious enough to jump in and commit. And so, finally, is Nate, who's planning a surprise involving an engagement ring and a proposal from the pitcher's mound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things don't go quite according to scheme for the odd couple when Nate takes his lover out to the ball game. And who knows what might happen when Casey's called up to bat?</description>

  <description>Todd Burton has had enough of small-town Buckman. His abusive stepfather calls him a fag; his friend Austin makes him realize he may be gay, but Todd doesn’t want to admit his stepfather is right; and he dreams of being a chef. Three good reasons to flee his hometown and pursue greener pastures. But when Todd reaches the big city, his luck runs dry. Soon he can’t pay his rent and gets evicted. In the middle of a snowstorm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe Richards is a wealthy businessman with enough wounds of his own to make him afraid of ever being intimate again. But when he sees Todd outside his building, freezing to death, he takes pity on him and takes him in from the cold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To their mutual surprise, Todd and Gabe find themselves drawn to each other. “One night” turns into a week. Maybe letting a man in from the cold can melt the ice around Gabe’s heart—and maybe getting evicted will turn Todd’s luck around.</description>

  <description>When Liam Marshall's best friend, Alex, loses his fight with colon cancer, he leaves Liam one final request: buy a ticket to Ryde, on the Isle of Wight, and scatter Alex's ashes off the pier. Liam is tired, worn out, and in desperate need of a vacation, but instead of sun, sea, sand, and hot cabana boys, he gets a rickety old train, revolting kids, and no Ewan MacGregor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liam would have done anything for his friend, but fulfilling Alex's final wish means letting go of the only family Liam had left. Lost, he freezes on the pier... until Sam Owens comes to his rescue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam's family has vacationed on the Isle of Wight every year for as long as he can remember, but he's never met anyone like Liam. Determined to make Liam's vacation one to remember, Sam looks after him-in and out of the bedroom. He even introduces Liam to his entire family. But as Sam helps Liam let go, he's forced to admit that he wants Liam to hang on-not to his old life, but to Sam and what they have together.</description>

  <description>He’s searching for a story but finds so much more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brad Torrence is next on the chopping block at the newspaper where he works. Hungry for any source he can find, he runs across an ad in the classifieds: For Sale: Nursery Items, Never Used. It’s the lead he’s been looking for. Thinking a piece about the loss of a child will give him the edge he needs to keep his job, Brad follows up. He doesn’t expect a single man to answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rather than being offended, Cory Wolfe finds sharing the story of his grief and pain liberating. He’s even surprised by the spark that strikes, and one story leads to another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brad digs into his stories and Cory’s life, eager to know everything about the man who’s caught his attention. But when a lead points him to the hospital where Cory works, he unearths a mystery that might have been safer left buried. Brad’s search for a story could prove deadly….</description>

  <description>When Prince Leon disappears and his people are unable to find him, they turn to the dragons for help. Nyle is the unlucky dragon tasked with finding the missing prince, a duty he dreads as it forces him into the confounding human world and away from his collection of pretties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Locating a missing prince should be a simple matter, but if Nyle has learned anything about humans since being forced out among them it's that they needlessly complicate everything. When he finally locates the errant prince, however, what Nyle finds is a treasure worth all the complications—worth protecting at all costs.</description>

  <description>Task Force Iota, Book Two Sequel to 18% Gray James Ayala thought life would be smooth sailing once he escaped from a Red Idaho reeducation camp and returned to Blue Oregon. He was supposed to get answers about the biocybernetic chip that made him empathic, face the man who implanted it, and then ride off into the sunset with his new boyfriend, Matt Tennimore. Life, however, has other plans: the bad guy dies without giving them any answers, they left their horse in Idaho, and Gramma Anais finds a parasite on James's implant-one that forces James into isolation. Matt just got James back to Oregon where he wanted him, and extraneous brain hardware or not, he has no intention of letting him go. But James hesitates to move in with him. Despite his hurt, Matt has to man up and do his job, leaving James behind, while the rest of the team struggles to find the real mastermind behind the implant and the parasitic "Trick"-before it takes over James's brain. But will it be too little, too late to save him?</description>

  <description>Almost-thirty-year-old Alex Harrison is a well-known actor with good friends. Sure, he’s a bit emotional at times, but he’s also rich, gorgeous, successful—and, yeah, lonely. When his astrologer tells him to be on the lookout for his soul mate, he’s convinced she means his ex-boyfriend, Jeff, despite the plethora of evidence to the contrary. But he’s not so blind that he doesn’t notice quiet, handsome Ben Anderson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben’s just twenty-five and something of a free spirit. He left his home in Virginia on a whim to be a rafting guide for a wilderness lodge in Oregon, and he’s glad he did, or he’d never have met Alex. Despite the heat flashing between them, somehow their signals keep getting intercepted. Can these star-crossed lovers find their way to the love destiny has planned?</description>

Rick is a man who knows what he wants, and he is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure he gets it. When a gorgeous redhead walks into his local bar, wearing sexy heels and a mini skirt, he knows exactly who wants. But, looks can be deceiving, and sometimes you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17608991.Dirty_Drag_2__The_Night_Drags_On" title="Dirty Drag 2: The Night Drags On"&gt;Dirty Drag 2: The Night Drags On&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If you liked Dirty Drag and wanted to follow along when Ashley left the bar with Rick, well then this story is for you. The night didn’t just end in some swanky bar bathroom. No, the night continued with Ashley, our cheeky drag queen, taking Rick up on his offer to take him home. The fun ensues and things get wet – um, wait you’ll have to read it to see if that’s true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When reality sets in the following morning, Ashley has a huge problem. What is he going to wear home? For Ashley, drag simply does not work during the day. Ashley’s second biggest fear is getting caught in day drag and arrested for looking like a cross-dressing hooker. If you want to know how Ashley gets out of this jam, you’ll have to read it and see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real question on everyone’s lips is, after one night with Ashley, has Rick had enough? Or is the lure of Ashley’s snark more addicting than a sweet luscious Oreo? One way to find out, read this book! Come on, it’s free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17877549.Dirty_Drag_3__Beyond_The_Drag" title="Dirty Drag 3: Beyond The Drag"&gt;Dirty Drag 3: Beyond The Drag&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; picks up right after the shocking conclusion of book two. Ashley is on a new mission to impress Rick and show him he can be serious about a relationship. If he's able to open up and let a few things off his chest and can avoid making a boob of himself in the process, he might just succeed. This is the final story for Rick and Ashley, and it’s a finale you don't want to miss.</description>

  <description>Adam More, a successful wedding planner, has been having nightmares featuring the Bush family and characters from &lt;em&gt;Gone with the Wind&lt;/em&gt;. His partner, Steven Worth, a columnist with &lt;em&gt;The Gay New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, is understandably concerned. However, everything comes to a comic point when Adam decides he can no longer promote marriage for heterosexuals until he can legally marry Steven, who, through his column, ignites a marriage boycott among the many gay florists, hairdressers, chefs, waiters, and musicians who keep the wedding industry humming.</description>

  <description>Some things should stay buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Repressed scholar Percival Endicott Whyborne has two skills: reading dead languages and hiding in his office at the Ladysmith Museum. After the tragic death of the friend he secretly loved, he’s ruthlessly suppressed any desire for another man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when handsome ex-Pinkerton Griffin Flaherty approaches him to translate a mysterious book, Whyborne wants to finish the job and get rid of the detective as quickly as possible. Griffin left the Pinkertons following the death of his partner, hoping to start a new life. But the powerful cult which murdered Glenn has taken root in Widdershins, and only the spells in the book can stop them. Spells the intellectual Whyborne doesn’t believe are real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the investigation draws the two men closer, Griffin’s rakish charm threatens to shatter Whyborne’s iron control. When the cult resurrects an evil sorcerer who commands terrifying monsters, can Whyborne overcome his fear and learn to trust? Will Griffin let go of his past and risk falling in love? Or will Griffin’s secrets cost Whyborne both his heart and his life?</description>

  <description>When Jason Smith wins a contest he doesn’t remember entering, he earns a visit with The MeatGrinder, aka Trent Peterson. Trent expected a rabid fan; instead, he gets Jason, who knows nothing about wrestling, doesn’t care about the prizes, and would prefer to skip the official wrestling demo, please. Trent should be annoyed, but by the end of the day, Trent knows he wants more than one day with Jason. Now he just has to convince Jason that Trent is more than his alter ego.</description>

  <description>They are creatures of extraordinary beauty and incredible power. Messengers of God or protectors of the human race, these mysterious creatures of light can also take human form—and can experience the emotions, lusts, and desires of a man. Some of the top writers of gay male erotica tackle the daunting subject of angels and the mixture of spirituality and sexuality, passion and desire that occurs when an angel feels desire for a beautiful human male. These stories mix heat with tenderness, amazing sex with spirituality, and earthy sensuality with an other-worldly heat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll never look at angels quite the same way again.</description>

  <description>Doug Heavy Runner left the life of an openly gay Miami police officer and returned to his home on the Salish-Kootenai Indian Reservation when his mother got sick. In the two years since she passed, he’s carved out an empty life as a small-town deputy, relying on out-of-town one-night stands to keep him sane. Then he meets Detective Christopher Hayes, and they share a wild night so incredible Doug breaks his own rule and allows a one-night stand to grow into a weekend of amazing sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Christopher travels from San Diego to Montana to deal with his abusive brother’s suicide, he doesn’t expect to find the man he spent the weekend with to be handling his brother’s case. He certainly doesn’t mind spending more time with Doug—but then an arsonist destroys the house Christopher inherited from his brother, and Christopher and Doug discover they are the primary suspects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they investigate, they discover Christopher’s dead brother has set them on the trail of a psychotic pedophile who will stop at nothing to silence his last victim. However, the search for the victim goes horribly wrong, leaving Doug hospitalized and Christopher at the mercy of the killer….</description>

  <description>In the resplendence of William the Conqueror's London court, the lovely Saxon captive Lady Nicholaa was forced to choose a husband from the assembled Norman nobles. She chose Royce, a baron warrior whose fierce demeanor could not conceal his chivalrous and tender heart. A resourceful, rebellious and utterly naive, Nicholaa vowed to bend Royce to her will despite the whirlwind of feelings he aroused in her. Ferocious in battle, seasoned in passion, Royce was surprised by the depth of his emotion whenever he caressed his charming bride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a climate of utmost treachery, where Saxons still intrigued against their Norman invaders, Royce and Nicholaa revelled in their precious new love ... a fervent bond soon to be disrupted by the call of blood, kin and country!</description>

  <description>Liam Wade is facing the biggest change in his life since marrying his best friend, Janelle, and adopting her daughter. Janelle has long since passed on, losing the battle to live a few days after her daughter is born, leaving Liam a father, in need of finding a mother for his daughter Emma. He's rich, successful, and Leigh is the perfect, approved, wife for him. Before he settles down to give his daughter the best family he can, he wants one week away to think.

  <description>When hockey star Linc Carpenter is banned from playing his beloved sport, he starts over in Tampa. Master of the mixed metaphor, Linc knows he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. He's a lousy bartender, but doesn't know what else to do until he gets a shot at being a private investigator. If he can prove that wealthy fashion designer Quentin Faulkner is cheating on his wife, this case will earn him big money. Faulkner's bodyguard, Brady Williams, proves to be the biggest hindrance to completing his assignment, other than his own ineptitude. Linc is shocked when Brady admits to being attracted to him. He's even more shocked when Brady turns down immediate sex because he's looking for so much more. Will their new relationship survive the dangers of this case?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word Count: 24,872 (approx.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Genre: LGBT Contemporary Western&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourth generation rancher, Ray Ford has lived a lie for nearly forty years. Having seen what can happen to an openly gay cowboy in small town America, and not willing to risk his ranch Ford Creek's legendary reputation, he keeps that part of himself tightly locked down. Everything changes one Sunday morning when Ray, out of character, picks up a handsome hitchhiker looking for work. Hiring the enigmatic cowboy stretches the bounds of Ray's control and, suddenly, he finds himself asking just what he'd be willing to risk for a chance at true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis Morgan learned a hard lesson early in his life -- love is conditional. Even though he's a world-class horse trainer in high demand, he lives the life of a drifter, moving from ranch to ranch like the wind. He'll play when the opportunity arises, but he won't invest himself emotionally. But when he takes on the job training horses at Ford Creek Ranch, the stoic rancher with the sexy five o'clock shadow just might change all that -- if Travis can take the risk and stick around long enough to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Chris James is Fate’s favorite plaything. When She took his parents in a car crash, Chris narrowly escaped the grief with his life, and he has the scars on his wrists to prove it. Seven years later, just as his life is finally turning around, Fate smashes his universe once again, taking his partner and two-year-old daughter and leaving behind a bloodbath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After nearly a year of investigation, with no bodies, no motive, and no clues, the police are giving up. Enter Jason Kingsley, a wickedly handsome private investigator with a troubled past and a disconnected puzzle piece he could never find a place for. Jason has his work cut out for him: his search leads down a road that was never meant to be traveled, where a ruthless and hidden enemy lurks and dark secrets await. With passion drawing them together and sinister forces threatening to tear them apart, Chris and Jason race against time to unravel the mystery and get to the shocking truth that lies behind it all: The Heart of the Jungle.</description>

  <description>David Underwood needs to go to AA – Alpha-lovers Anonymous. His last attraction to an alpha male got him into an abusive relationship, and now ogling two hot members of the Australian volleyball team on Laguna Beach gets him harassed yet again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Australian Gareth Marshall needs to come out. A lifetime of hiding his orientation from his best friend and volleyball partner, Edge, as well as everyone else around him, has left him hurt and frustrated. When Gareth gets a load of David posing nude as the Michelangelo statue in the famous Laguna Pageant, he knows his days in the closet are numbered. And David is more than willing to help him take the first step out of the dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Gareth’s teammate, Edge, has secrets of his own, and David's ex-lover will never be happy without David under his thumb. With everything stacked against him, can a gay Laguna man find happiness with an alpha male – or two?</description>

  <description>The world has only recently emerged from a three-hundred-year war which saw half of the world’s population wiped out and the rise of five superpowers. Despite the hundreds of millions who died, the Borders War was nearly bloodless because of the sonicrifle—weaponized sound waves, tuned to their highest frequency, and harnessed to kill. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merq Grayson has known only war. He is an orphan, a skilled Peacemaker, soldier, and sniper. And it is his destiny to right the wrong created by his grandfather six generations removed—the man who invented the sonicbullet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armise Darcan is his enemy. A sniper and Dark Ops officer who fought for the People’s Republic of Singapore in the Borders War, Armise may be the only person on the planet strong enough to keep Merq from completing his mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their loyalties are to conflicting countries and diverging agendas, and despite the very real threat to their lives if they’re discovered, Merq and Armise keep finding their way into each other’s beds. It is a drive which Merq is sure will kill him one day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how much time either of them has is questionable. As Opposition is pitted against Revolution, the Borders War reignites, and Merq and Armise have to decide where, and with whom, their real loyalties lie.</description>

  <description>When seventeen-year-old Jude Walker confesses to his priest that he’s gay, and in fact has an unhealthy attraction to the priest himself, the last thing he expects is compassion. Father Gray surprises him with his understanding and Jude accepts his offer of help in overcoming his condition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sebastian Gray extends an offer of help to a troubled teenager, the last thing he expects is that it is Jude that will save him. Yet Jude steadily breaks through the priest’s barriers, bringing him out of his self-imposed exile and into the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two find surprising parallels between their lives and obsession gives way to affection, both men begin to understand that their love may cost them their souls. Jude stands to lose his family to the truth of his affections, and Sebastian could fail in his original task: saving Jude no matter what the cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This is a stand alone novel that is an adult spin-off of the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/66252-lux"&gt;Lux Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You do not need to read a Lux book to read Obsession and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s arrogant, domineering, and... To. Die. For.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter is a ruthless killer. And the Department of Defense has him firmly in their grasp, which usually doesn’t chafe too badly because he gets to kill bad guys. Most of the time he enjoys his job. That is, until he’s saddled with something he’s never had to do before: protect a human from his mortal enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serena Cross didn’t believe her best friend when she claimed to have seen the son of a powerful senator turn into something... unnatural. Who would? But then she witnesses her friend’s murder at the hands of what can only be an alien, thrusting her into a world that will kill to protect their secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter stirs Serena’s temper and her lust despite their differences. Soon he’s doing the unthinkable—breaking the rules he’s lived by, going against the government to keep Serena safe. But are the aliens and the government the biggest threats to Serena’s life… or is it Hunter?</description>

  <description>Varro Dacien spends his life riding toward the next adventure. Brian Christie, his best friend and touchstone, the one person who’s always truly seen him, plays sidekick on these madcap adventures and subsequent trips to the hospital until he can’t take it anymore. While Brian can see Varro, Varro has never caught on that he’s breaking his best friend’s heart.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without Varro, Brian builds himself a life that’s all about just getting by, doing his best to ignore the hole in his heart and his life. Without Brian to balance him, Varro pushes harder and takes more risks to reach that ultimate high. His job racing high-octane bikes on suicide-level courses makes it easy to get that rush… until it’s no longer enough and Varro realizes it’s not the race, but who’s waiting at the finish line that truly matters. Now he just has to convince Brian to be there.</description>

  <description>Weathermen are predicting an incredible blizzard for New York City, but with old snow melting on the sidewalk, Seth Roland is a little skeptical. Despite moping over his ex-boyfriend Evan, who recently dumped him, Seth pretends all is well as he steps into his regular local bar, where he’s surprised by a blast from his past. Enter Kieran O'Malley, Seth’s very first boyfriend, in the city for a conference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It might have been just a chance meeting, but first a train derailment and then the predicted blizzard keep Seth and Kieran in close proximity. It’s enough time for old feelings to surface, rekindled attraction to take hold, and new hopes for a future together to fill them both. But once the storm passes, the real challenge begins. Will Seth and Kieran work to make the relationship last, or will they let it melt away like snow in the sun?</description>

  <description>When Finn’s boss sends him to a museum in Brooklyn, the last person he expects to see is his old rival, Troy. Finn still blames Troy for sending his career off the rails, but Troy has research Finn needs. Troy also has an intriguing story; the museum he curates is haunted by the ghosts of two men who died under mysterious circumstances in 1878. Troy strikes a deal: he’ll help Finn if Finn helps him find out what happened to the men who died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From diaries, police reports, and newspaper articles, Finn and Troy piece together the lives of the two dead men—and the romance that bloomed between them—and it becomes clear that the men were murdered. It also becomes clear that the ghosts are real and are capable of manipulating the dreams, thoughts, and actions of the living. When Finn and Troy start falling for each other, Finn worries that it’s all an illusion concocted by the ghosts to keep them working together to solve the mystery, but Troy is convinced the love between them is real. But how can he get rid of a couple of ghosts and prove it?</description>

  <description>Sabrina Chandler has had a rough go at love: just before her high school graduation, she found her boyfriend in the arms of her so-called best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyler Anderson, the town’s sexy bad boy, stepped out of the shadows then to save her pride. Drawing strength from him, she left everything behind and sought a new life for herself, far away from the pain and shame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward ten years: Sabrina is settled in Miami, happy at last—until her best friend urges her to attend her high school reunion and face her painful past once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And…maybe meet the mysterious Tyler once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Sabrina find the courage to face the demons in her past, let go of the pain, and move forward into happiness? Or will insecurity and self-doubt ruin her one chance to get the love she’s not sure she even deserves?</description>

See &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16083219-sacred-bloodlines"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For as long as Gabe can remember, his life had been plagued by haunting images and tragic events. It seemed like everyone he knew or loved was doomed for a life of misery or death. He was starting to come to the same conclusion everyone else had--he must be cursed. Until one day, in a subway tunnel, everything suddenly changed. A horrific disaster led him to a strange new person named Uri.&lt;br&gt;     Uri introduced Gabe to an exciting new world filled with angels, demons, magic, and best of all, a beautiful girl named Sophie. This chance at a new life had everything Gabe always longed for: a family, friends, and possibly even love. He soon discovered, though, that this life came at a steep price. One he feared might cost him his life.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;This is a newly edited version; the first edition was released under MLR Press in 2010&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stefan Sanchez’s number one reason to flee Boerne, Texas twelve years ago, was closeted deputy Chet Blain. Since then he has lived in Los Angeles, become a successful author of children’s books and managed his sexual relationships with a certain cool cynicism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Stefan returns to Texas for the funeral of his best friend, Tommy, he is confronted by painful memories: His infamous father, shot as a traitor, his alcoholic mother, and Chet, who seems to want to start their old painful relationship all over again. Added to this is a missing widow, drugs in the trunk of his rental car, and a hunky Secret Service agent who seems determined to make Stefan’s business his business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all ends in a mad chase across the infamously haunted Devil’s backbone where ghosts from the past and personal demons in the present all conspire to give Stefan a chance to close the book on his childhood forever… or die trying.</description>

  <description>Cameron Winters is a freak. Fortunately, no one but her family knows the truth... that Cameron can read minds. For years Cameron has hidden behind a facade of normalcy, warned that there are those who would do her harm. When gorgeous and mysterious Lewis Douglas arrives he destroys everything Cameron has ever believed and tempts her with possibilities of freedom. Determined to embrace her hidden talents, Cameron heads to a secret haven with Lewis; a place where she meets others like her, Mind Readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Cameron soon finds out some things are too good to be true. When the Mind Readers realize the extent of Cameron’s abilities, they want to use her powers for their own needs. Cameron suddenly finds herself involved in a war in which her idea of what is right and wrong is greatly tested. In the end she’ll be forced to make a choice that will not only threaten her relationship with Lewis, but her very life.</description>

  <description>&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1342508-human-frailties-by-jaye-mckenna---10-200-member-early-bonus-story" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkness has been a part of my life since I can remember.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never understood why it was so hard for me to be part of the bright world. The Internet couldn’t satisfy my need, so I went to this arcane little book shop. The old hag behind the counter gave me a book, where she said I might find the answers to my questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supposedly, this book opened your power to summon entities to obtain knowledge. One in particular drew my attention. Its name was unpronounceable, but I could not bring it to me without saying its name aloud. Its symbols― a black dog, a pumpkin on fire, and a heart surrounded by thorns― were a potent siren song. They simply drove me crazy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I finally untied my tongue and called, it didn't come to me. Instead, it took me to a sinister realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forget my questions. All I want to do now is drop to my knees and worship him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man stands against a fog-shrouded landscape lit by a full moon shining through thin clouds, his long, black hair whipped by the wind. His stance is open but ambiguous― it could be welcoming or threatening― and one foot rests upon a glowing jack-o-lantern. Under his open robe he wears only leather pants and high boots. In one hand he holds a staff topped with a skull; above the other hand float glowing, arcane symbols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genre: fantasy, other world&lt;br&gt;Tags: sorcerer, angels/demons/gods, magic users, soulmates or bonded, slave, prisoner, psychic ability, snarky banter&lt;br&gt;Word count: 39,489&lt;br&gt;Content warnings: dubious consent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Of humanity there are darker tales. Stories that take some squinting to see through. Unconventional stories. Tales that threaten to break the heart by cruel twists of fate, the dogs of war, or demons that are all too real; whether they be of unrequited love or a karmic slap in the face. Happy endings take a time in coming, and some never arrive. But through all the darkness there is light, a glimmer of hope and wonder…if one has the will to see it.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;He enters my cell daily at ten pm. He leaves in the morning at six am. He never says a word. Never moves from where he sits right beside the thick steel door. He does not beat me. He doesn't take me to the tiled room at the end of the corridor. He doesn't goad me, smirk when I wince afterwards, cry, or scream. I'm not sure what he does when I drift off, into deep, exhausted, pain-drenched sleep. I think he just watches. A fixture, a security, so they may state that I'm not left unattended. Sometimes I wish...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the cell is sparse and cold, at least this one has a bed. The figure resting there is too thin; too still, the prominent bones the result of long starvation, the stillness the product of too much anguish and abuse. He watches, though. An anxious, intelligent mind still occupies this frail and failing body, one that watches and wonders about the new guard occupying his cell each night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genre: science fiction&lt;br&gt;Tags: futuristic, dystopia, security, guard, prison-captivity, dark&lt;br&gt;Word Count: 10,361&lt;br&gt;Content warnings: violence, medical experimentation, attempted rape, semi-explicit descriptions of past abuse and torture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE:  This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>*WARNING FROM THE AUTHOR:&lt;br&gt;Six Degrees of Lust is both an ensemble novel and the first installment in the By Degrees serial. This means there are several point of views and the story will continue. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New York City FBI team leader Samuel Shaughnessy lives for his immediate family and his job. After a marriage gone wrong he has stuck to a firm rule when it comes to relationships: he doesn't have them. Sexually active and emotionally unavailable keeps him satisfied, especially now that he is in hot pursuit of a serial killer targeting gay men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former firefighter Machlan O'Bannon now manages a successful sports bar in Houston and after years of waiting he's ready to stand up and be the man he always wanted to be: out, proud and drama-free. His politically-aligned family wants to keep him locked in the closet, but Mac just wants to meet the man of his dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One man is as high strung as the other is laid back. A chance meeting brings the two men together, and one night of passion ignites a fire neither can fight. Their lives are not only miles apart, but as different as day and night. They don't want to get involved...but will they be able to stay apart?</description>

  <description>What could be hunkier than a cowboy? Not much, according to Martin Du Bois. He convinces two friends that a visit to the rodeo is every gay man’s wet dream, and so the three of them gaily (and I do mean gaily) set off to watch cowboy asses in action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A visit to a bar after the event gets Martin closer to the action than he ever thought possible, and he meets Jesse Cumberland, the man who caught his eye in the ring and made his rhinestones sparkle. Instant attraction leads to a one-night stand that gets under Martin’s insouciant skin and causes him to rethink his determination not to get involved emotionally. When Jesse invites Martin to his ranch, the visit is almost derailed by Martin’s realization that they lead very different lives. As a flaming city queer, he sees no way to fit with the solid, athletic Jesse. It’s up to Jesse to see if he can change Martin’s mind.</description>

  <description>What starts as a vicious prank one dark summer night leads sixteen year-old Chelsea Mallory plummeting into a MESSED UP world of obsession, a clandestine fraternity, a lost fortune, murder and ultimately a scramble to save her own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His eyes are blue like midnight. That is the first thing Chelsea notices about smooth talking, insanely hot Levi Bennett. Then, there is the way her stomach is hijacked by a pack of butterflies doing a full-on hip hop dance every time she sees him. How can anyone, even a sensible girl like Chelsea, be expected to think straight under those circumstances? Chelsea’s infatuation leads her to play the bait in a cruel practical joke on her friend Toby; a prank that leaves Chelsea’s hands bloody and Toby missing. Amid the mysterious disappearance, Chelsea realizes that she has gotten in over her head with Levi; a guy who knows exactly how to keep Chelsea where he wants her. Struggling to navigate her way out of a seemingly hopeless situation, Chelsea discovers that the real threat to her safety is not Levi after all, but an evil man and his army of boy soldiers who will stop at nothing to find a coveted treasure. Chelsea must learn that although she may be young, and she may be small, when she uses her brain she can kick some serious ass.</description>

  <description>It's Dade's last summer at home. He has a crappy job at Food World, a "boyfriend" who won't publicly acknowledge his existence (maybe because Pablo also has a girlfriend), and parents on the verge of a divorce. College is Dade's shining beacon of possibility, a horizon to keep him from floating away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then he meets the mysterious Alex Kincaid. Falling in &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; love finally lets Dade come out of the closet - and, ironically, ignites a ruthless passion in Pablo. But just when true happiness has set in, tragedy shatters the dreamy curtain of summer, and Dade will use every ounce of strength he's gained to break from his past and start fresh with the future.</description>

  <description>This is a tale about two medieval English knights—Sir William Corbet, aka the Lion, and Sir Christian Brandon, aka The Crow.  In a time when duty was everything, personal honor was more valued than life itself, and homosexuality was not tolerated by the church or society, how can these two men reconcile their deepest, most secret yearnings to love another man?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir Christian was raised in a household where he was hated for his unusual beauty and for the sake of his parentage.  Being smaller than his six brutish half-brothers, he learned to survive by using his wits and developing a gift for strategy.  He feels little loyalty to the system that’s abused him since birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir William, a large and fierce warrior, has pushed his unnatural desires down all his life.  He’s determined to live up to his own ideal of a gallant knight.   But when he takes up a quest to rescue his sister from her abusive lord of a husband, he’s forced to undertake a journey with Christian.  It’s a partnership that will test every strand of his moral fiber, and, eventually, even his understanding of the meaning of duty, honor, and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story is offered for free as part of Love Has No Boundaries Event. This event is sponsored by the m/m romance group on goodreads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story can be read online for free here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1354989-the-lion-and-the-crow-by-eli-easton-6-4" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a 32,000 word stand-alone novella.</description>

  <description>First I was a sorcerer. Then I was a hermit. For so long—for years that seemed to go on forever—I couldn't bear to be touched. I put up not just walls but whole stone bunkers to keep everyone out, emotionally, and physically as well. I was protected from people, from ghosts, from specters real and imagined. Sure, I was alone. But I felt safe. Only, after a while, I wasn't sure any longer whether a totally "safe" empty life was really worth living.&lt;br&gt;Then Tobin came along. Out of the blue, out of my past, with a summons from the king that he wouldn't let me ignore. I tried to cling to my isolation, but he wouldn't give up on me. Tobin never believed in walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1351037-nor-iron-bars-a-cage-by-kaje-harper---6-1-download-link-inside" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Desperate to avoid his matchmaking parents and the sudden influx of zombies, William Stamson leaves his home town of Seattle to find a new place to settle down. As a void, a person who can't perform magic, he doesn't fit in with his powerful family and he longs to move out from beneath their large shadow. When he finds an old Victorian mansion in a quiet small town, he falls in love and, despite it sitting beneath a powerful ley line intersection, snaps it up. Cassius Grant is a magical enforcer who is sent to get rid of the house's interloper. However, one look at William and Cassius knows his life will never be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He can find a use for his lover’s hands…except when he needs help the most.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kellen is short on cash—at least until his first novel starts to sell—but he has plenty of friends. None of them, unfortunately, share his love of books. For that he turns to IM chats with Mike from his online book group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though he manages to coax the shy, socially inept pathologist into a real-time meeting, Kellen has no intention of letting his new friend become more than a casual lover. Shaky finances and ailing mother aside, self-sufficiency is Kellen’s prime directive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike considers himself a nerd of the highest order—short, bespectacled, prone to blurting out the wrong thing at the worst possible time. Meeting Kellen face to face is the biggest risk of his life, and he wonders if they’ll get more body parts together than just their faces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First meeting leads to first date—first everything for Mike—and soon Kellen’s faced with breaking his just-friends-with-benefits rule. Yet as his elderly mother wanders deeper into senility, Kellen wonders if it’s better to lean on Mike rather than fall.</description>

  <description>Commander Rick McConnell and Colonel Elijah Masters have been secret lovers for years. They nurtured their very private relationship with planned vacations and leaves, always meeting somewhere different—always escaping off the grid. It worked for them—career officers with a desire to serve their country and a passion for each other. The repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell provides them with the tremendous opportunity to come out to their friends and loved ones—Rick wants to seize the day, but Eli isn’t so certain. His hesitation leads to a fight, an ultimatum, and a breakup. Rather than confront their issues, Eli takes a foreign assignment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year’s separation changes both of them. The last person Eli expects to see when he steps off the plane is Rick, but the physician wants another chance with the only man he’s ever loved and he has a plan.  Will bitterness, recriminations, and loss keep them apart or can these two officers rediscover the faith and loyalty that bound them for so long?</description>

  <description>“She who wields the mark is the barrier between man and monster. She is the daughter of gods, the mother of man, protector of all. Vigilati Usque Ad Mortem”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Isla Macallen wanted was a simple existence on her little Scottish island, free from her mother’s insanity and the prying eyes of neighbors. What she got was embroiled in a war for the souls of mankind. A war of good versus evil, of witches versus demons, and Isla learns that she alone can end it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Jeremiah Rousseau was a self-proclaimed nomad, traveling the world researching paranormal phenomena. He doesn’t expect his research to lead him to Scotland, and to the woman who will turn his world upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together with a facetious shapeshifting animal spirit guide, Jeremiah and Isla discover that she is part of an ancient bloodline bred to protect the gateways between the human world and the spirit world, to keep evil demons from destroying them. They must find the key to defeating Alastore, the demon king, and closing the gate before Samhain, when the veil between the worlds is lifted. As the war for their souls wages around them, Isla and Jeremiah will risk it all for love—a love neither had ever thought possible.</description>

  <description>One… Two… Three… Four…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I Declare War&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serah always believed the world around her was perfect. As a Power, one of the warrior angels, she has spent her existence defending the innocent from evil. After tragedy strikes, tearing Serah's brother from her life, she's given the task of stopping the approaching apocalypse before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only one thing, though: she has to venture to Hell to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucifer—or Luce, as he prefers to be called—has been biding his time in Hell, longing for revenge against those who oh-so-easily cast him into the pit. When the heavenly beauty shows up at his gate, he's just as captivated by her presence as she becomes of him. The attraction between them is palpable, and Serah's willpower slowly slips. How can this charming creature, this scarred Archangel, be the one annihilating the world she so loves?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the war wages on, the world entwined in chaos, Serah starts questioning everything she ever knew. When the light and dark, hot and cold, finally collide, she has to make a choice—a choice that sets her world on fire, black and white exploding into colorful flames.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serah has questions. She wants answers.&lt;br&gt;Luce just wants to play a game.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Rylee Thomas is used to being in control. But she’s about to meet the one man that just might make her enjoy losing it…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am the exception to the rule. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world full of willing women, I’m a challenge to the roguish and achingly handsome Colton Donavan. A man used to getting exactly what he wants in all aspects of life. He’s the reckless bad boy constantly skating that razor thin edge toward out of control, on and off of the track. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton crashes into my life like a tornado: sapping my control, testing my vulnerabilities beyond their limits, and unintentionally penetrating the protective wall around my healing heart. Tearing apart the world I rebuilt so carefully with structure, predictability, and discipline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can’t give him what he wants and he can’t give me what I need.&lt;/em&gt; But after a glimpse beneath his refined exterior into the dark secrets of his damaged soul, can I bring myself to walk away?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our sexual chemistry is undeniable. Our individual need for complete control is irrefutable. But when our worlds collide, is the chemistry enough to bring us together or will our untold secrets and battle of wills force us apart?</description>

  <description>For Tobin and Delia, everything was always equal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bargain, a trade, a deal to be struck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A kiss for a kiss.&lt;br&gt;Your shirt for mine.&lt;br&gt;Break my heart, I’ll break yours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their disastrous split was no different. Tobin’s spent the last year pretending Delia never existed, and Delia’s been in D.C., pretending to be anything but the country girl that she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When tragedy brings her back to town, Tobin and Delia realize that time apart hasn't healed either one of them. But staying away from each other is harder than they imagined, especially in small town Louisiana, and old feelings are quickly brought back to the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the mess they’ve created, is there anything to be salvaged of a love that they both thought would be forever?</description>

  <description>When Aidan logs onto the Internet one night during winter break, he hardly expects to meet tall, dark, and handsome Jake - let alone discover over the course of their chats and emails that Jake may actually be...well...pretty much perfect.  However, with Jake studying abroad 8,000 miles away, Aidan soon finds himself struggling with the intense feelings that he's developed for a man he's never actually met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    With an ocean between them and all of the doubts and questions that come with the distance, will their relationship ever find wings?  And when they finally meet in person, can their online romance become an IRL happily ever after?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>For a Dom and his sub, a yellow rope becomes the tie that binds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cranky submissive…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke Walker is tired. He spends long hours between his job as a teacher assistant at an elementary school and helping out his family at their restaurant. Coupled with the fact his degree is going to waste, he’s discouraged and fatigued by too much work and endless southern heat, and not enough time spent with his live-in partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An understanding Dom…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gage Holt has been on both sides of the fence. He believes that in order to be a good Dom, one has to understand being a sub. Unfortunately, he’s had some bad experiences in pursuit of that knowledge and suffered a great deal. But that’s in the past now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A long weekend…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three little days…Gage is determined to see that his man gets what he needs in every way he can give it to him. For the next seventy-two hours, he’s going to pamper his boy—in his way.</description>

  <description>The first in New York Times bestselling author Michael Grant's breathtaking dystopian, sci-fi saga, Gone is a page-turning thriller that invokes the classic The Lord of the Flies along with the horror of Stephen King.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the blink of an eye, everyone disappears. Gone. Except for the young.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are teens, but not one single adult. Just as suddenly, there are no phones, no internet, no television. No way to get help. And no way to figure out what's happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunger threatens. Bullies rule. A sinister creature lurks. Animals are mutating. And the teens themselves are changing, developing new talents--unimaginable, dangerous, deadly powers--that grow stronger by the day. It's a terrifying new world. Sides are being chosen, a fight is shaping up. Townies against rich kids. Bullies against the weak. Powerful against powerless. And time is running out: On your birthday, you disappear just like everyone else...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Grant's Gone as been praised for its compelling storytelling, multidimensional characters, and multiple points of view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supports the Common Core State Standards</description>

  <description>Sixteen year old Jacob Smithson has quite a temper. He's picked on by other kids because he likes boys, and recent fighting has kicked him out of public school. As a last resort, his parents have placed him in the St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Boarding School for Boys. It's at his first mass at St. Thomas where he sees Avery Dendritch, a senior who serves as altar boy during the service. When they meet, the attraction between them is hard to deny. The two become fast friends, and as the school year progresses, their friendship deepens into something more. For the first time, Jacob has found a place where he belongs ... and someone with whom he's falling in love. But the other students gossip about their growing relationship, and while Avery can ignore them, Jacob cannot. As the rumors and slurs start up again, can he curb his temper, or will his penchant for fighting get him expelled from St. Thomas, as well?</description>

  <description>Columnist Drew Walsh made his career by publicly criticizing conservative, anti-gay politician Richard Granger. So when a rumor surfaces that Granger’s son Jonathan might be gay, Drew finds himself in the middle of a potential scandal. Under the guise of an interview about Jonathan’s new job teaching in an inner-city school, Drew’s job is to find out if the rumors are true. Drew’s best friend Rey is also Jonathan’s cousin, and he arranges the meeting between Jonathan and Drew that changes everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After just one interview, it’s obvious to Drew that the rumors are true, but he carefully neglects to mention that in his article. It’s also obvious that he’s falling for Jonathan, and he can’t stay away after the article is published. Still, Jonathan is too afraid to step out of the closet, and Drew thinks the smartest thing might be to let him go—until Jonathan shows up drunk one night at his apartment. The slow burn of their attraction doesn’t fade with Jonathan’s buzz, but navigating a relationship is never easy—especially in the shadow of right-wing politics.</description>

  <description>Fans of both contemporary romance and women's fiction will love this smart, witty, and beautiful novella from national bestseller Sharla Lovelace. If you like Susan Elizabeth Philips, Susan Mallery, or Sarah Addison Allen you're going to fall in love with this author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has nothing but time . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-four hours. That’s how long Andie Fremont has to say yes—or no. At forty-four with a daughter in college, she’s no young kitten with starry-eyed ideas of what love is. Still, when the man who is everything she should want pops the question with a ring he knows isn’t her style, during a party she didn’t want to have, Andie balks. Something tells her that it isn’t right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking to clear her head, Andie hits the Texas highway in search of an answer. And when she stumbles upon an old roadside diner she decides waffles might be it, at least for now. What she didn’t expect to find was Jesse Montgomery. The man who stole her heart and broke it all in one day, two decades earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Texas-size storm takes shape outside, the electricity between Andie and Jesse builds inside. Suddenly Andie is faced with more than just yes or no. As the storm clears there are two men who will want answers.</description>

  <description>When Jeff agreed to be the sperm donor to his best friend Beth, he never expected a tragedy to leave his newborn and three year old motherless. That's exactly what's happened, though, and it's totally thrown his life into chaos: his lover has left him, his house isn't anywhere near childproof and his boss feels the restaurant has been patient enough with the time off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donny has always known he wanted to be in childcare, and he just finished his degree in early childhood education. He didn't count on people being less than thrilled to hire him when they find out that not only is he a male nanny, but a gay one at that. Job hunting has been frustrating to say the least, so when he knocks on Jeff's door and is greeted by the sounds of things breaking and a pair of screaming children, he thinks, just maybe, he can begin this particular interview with a trial by fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becoming the nanny to Jeff's children just might be a dream come true for Danny, and exactly what Jeff needs, but are either one of them ready to really be a family?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For as long as he could remember, he wanted her… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Raised by a single mother, Adam Collins resolved to take no chances with a girl’s future—or his own. That’s why, as hard as it was, he resisted everything he felt for Marissa Brooks. Then one night a reckless challenge left a fellow student dead and changed both their lives forever. As penance, Adam took the boy’s place in the Marines, where he could disappear into discipline and duty, and left Marissa behind to struggle with her dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Twelve years later, Adam is back in Walkers Ford to serve as the best man in his friend’s wedding. The years haven’t diminished the electric connection he has with Marissa. But Adam’s mistake continues to haunt him, and Marissa is stumbling under the weight of her family’s legacy. Together they wrestle with demons and dreams, but if there’s any hope for a future together Adam has to not only find a way to forgive himself, but also ask others for forgiveness—especially from the woman whose heart he broke.</description>

  <description>Death rides a pale horse, and she is a beauty. Since man first buried his dead, she has watched over them. With her hand she raises those select few, those disturbed and maimed, to new life. These risen souls are duty bound to protect the souls still buried and resting. The souls restless and walking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebastien Crowle is such a watchman. But as a villain so profane and perverse enters the scene with a crime the likes of which Sebastien has never seen, can he stop the villain and confront the ghosts of his own past as they begin to rear their heads?</description>

  <description>Gregory put his past up for sale on Craigslist. He never expected Chad, a gorgeous black-haired devil, to waltz in and take it all. He doesn’t leave him empty-handed though, giving him friendship and new memories to fill the space. Torn between his past and the chance at a real future, Gregory has to decide if he can let down his defenses and open himself up to the chance of getting hurt again. But Chad isn’t going to wait forever and Gregory only has one chance to convince him to stay, but he’ll have to &lt;em&gt;say everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;16,000 words</description>

  <description>Half-human and half-Wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the Wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their Dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful—and passionate—of the Elder Races.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the most feared and respected of the Wyrkind, Dragos Cuelebre cannot believe someone had the audacity to steal from him, much less succeed. And when he catches the thief, Dragos spares her life, claiming her as his own to further explore the desire they've ignited in each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pia knows she must repay Dragos for her trespass, but refuses to become his slave—although she cannot deny wanting him, body and soul.</description>

  <description>2788. Only the handicapped live on Earth. Eighteen-year-old Jarra is among the one in a thousand people born with an immune system that cannot survive on other planets. Sent to Earth at birth to save her life, she has been abandoned by her parents. She can’t travel to other worlds, but she can watch their vids, and she knows all the jokes they make. She’s an “ape,” a “throwback,” but this is one ape girl who won’t give in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jarra makes up a fake military background for herself and joins a class of norms who are on Earth for a year of practical history studies excavating the dangerous ruins of the old cities. She wants to see their faces when they find out they’ve been fooled into thinking an ape girl was a norm. She isn’t expecting to make friends with the enemy, to risk her life to save norms, or to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover Illustration (C) Himitsuhana(less)</description>

  <description>For some, existence without their mate might seem like the end of their world--for the members of Verdantia’s Tetriarch, it would be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love triangles often create disastrous relationships, but the unlikely members of the Tetriarch face worldwide disaster without the successful bonding of their trio.The inhabitants of the sentient planet, Verdantia, are poised on the precipice of extinction following a brutal invasion by an off-world, nomadic horde. Verdantia’s capital, Sylvan Mintoth, must have its failing energy shield restored, or the planet is doomed. The Elders know the shield can draw energy from only one thing—a very arduous and grueling coupling of two specific people who were pre-chosen by the planet Herself and promised by prearranged marriage contract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conte Camliel Aristos deTano, Ari, has long spurned the marriage forced upon him.  His contractual bride, Princess Fleur Constante, is the beautiful future queen. She was but six years old when the contract was signed. Though young and inexperienced, she is willing to risk everything, including her own sanity, to save her planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verdantia draws strength from the duo, but the sentient planet whispers to Ari that a third is necessary – Ari’s aide de camp, Visconte Doral deLorion, an angelically handsome, skilled assassin who silently surrendered his heart to Ari long ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trio struggles to make this surprising partnership harmonious, pushing through pride, scars of past abuse, fears of inexperience and distrust. To save Verdantia, they must overcome their individual weaknesses and realize their full potential. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the tetriarch and their combined synergy, can harness Verdantia’s immense power to shield its citizens from invasion.</description>

  <description>Landon and Daniel have been best friends since grade school. Through thick and thin, they’ve always been able to rely on each other. So it only seems natural for Landon to step in and offer assistance when Daniel has a run of bad luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving in together and splitting the bills seems like a simple solution to Daniel’s financial problems. However, sharing close quarters makes it difficult to keep less than platonic feelings on the down low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The line between friends and lovers blurs during a late night moment of weakness fueled by alcohol, leaving both men on uneven ground. Just when they think they have things worked out and might have a shot at something more than friendship, a sudden, shared windfall provokes all new complications that could end more than the new physical side of their relationship.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by female architect Julia Morgan, this is  the riveting tale of a race against time to rebuild two luxury hotels after the  1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed 400 city blocks and left 250,000  homeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan’s fictional protegee Amelia Bradshaw and  client J.D. Thayer will sacrifice anything to see the city they love rise from  the ashes; in the process, they can’t help but lose their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>**Mature Content Warning** 17+ for language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;(A re-imagining of my young adult book, The Fallen Star, told as a New Adult Paranormal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty-one year-old Gemma, life has never been normal. She knows nothing about her past and has been haunted by the same monsters in her nightmares for the last few months.  Unemotional and numb to life, she feels disconnected from everyone. Until the very first day she cries. After that, nothing in her life is the same. &lt;br&gt;Her emotions slowly surface and she starts experiencing love, happiness, and anger, feelings she never knew existed. But they leave her confused and she doesn’t know whether to embrace them or run away from them.&lt;br&gt;Her life only gets more complicated when she meets Alex. Sexy, arrogant, and secretive, Alex can get under Gemma’s skin like no one can. Yet she’s drawn to him by an invisible connection she has no control over. She’s also seen him before. In her nightmares. &lt;br&gt;Every part of Gemma’s mind is screaming at her to stay away from Alex, but every other part of her is begging to get close to him. But the closer she gets, the more she realizes Alex knows more about her than he originally let on.&lt;br&gt;As secrets about her past unravel, Gemma’s life becomes threatened. She needs to figure out what’s going on, before she winds up dead. But the only person she can turn to for answers is the one person she isn’t sure she can trust.</description>

  <description>ONCE UPON A TIME&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a young man who was terribly handsome, extraordinarily charming and suitably rich. He enjoyed life and all that it had to offer, even if he was growing weary of being alone. One evening, he saw a beautiful woman through a storefront window and he knew that his life would never be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE FATES HAVE OTHER IDEAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before he had the opportunity to meet her he was in a car accident and lost his vision with no knowledge of when – or if – it would return. For several weeks, the image of the gorgeous enchantress was the only light in his dark world; he knew that he had to meet her. So he contrived a reason to go into her store, using his blindness to his advantage as he introduced himself to his dream girl. Sparks flew and he fell madly, passionately in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BLIND ATTRACTION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because in a world where image is everything sometimes it takes losing your sight to finally be able to see clearly.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;I was hoping you could tell me the story of these two beautiful men?&lt;br&gt;They have known each other for many years. They were close friends for a long time, but life just got in the way and their competitive careers and busy lives meant they somehow fell out of touch. They never forgot about each other, and they have both been waiting for this moment for years.&lt;br&gt;I’d like to see an emotional reunion, maybe a hint of hurt/comfort in there somewhere if you can fit it in, but most of all just a whole lot of love (I’m a hopeless romantic!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;The black and white photograph shows a bed, from directly above, with two young men all the way over to the right side, visible from the waist up. Their torsos are bare. They lie facing one another, and their embrace is tender and loving more than it is passionate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Tristan ‘Trip’ Hagan is a Husky shifter who was born to be the Hagan Clan’s next Alpha, a position of honor and nobility, a position he never wanted and was all too happy to pass onto his younger brother. But when they discovered his brother couldn’t have pups, the responsibility of continuing the Hagan Alpha line fell back to Trip. Under the weight of the Hagan Council’s demand to fulfill his duty, Trip settled down and produced an heir, but after years of struggling to uphold his family’s traditions, Trip found the courage to do what no other Hagan Alpha had done in the history of the clan: he came out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years later, and Trip is living a happy life with his cheeky pup and their own little makeshift family. True mates within canine shifter clans are very rare, but Trip has had one since he can remember. Despite losing his heart to Boone twenty years ago, Trip holds little hope of ever getting to bond with the sexy Enforcer, as it’s against clan laws for pure-bloods to bond with half-breeds. With the call from their feral halves to seal the bond growing stronger by the day, can Trip and Boone find a way to be together without losing everything?         &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice.

  <description>It’s a different world. Space has been colonized, the wealthy fly to work rather than drive, and slavery is legal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason’s family has been ripped apart by tragedy. The only way he can save the ones left is to offer himself up as a bondmate. The more he’s willing to give, the higher the price he can command. And Jason is willing to give a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devin is wealthy and heartbroken after the wife he adored walked out on him. He isn’t looking for love. All he wants is a relationship he can control. Buying a bondmate seems like the perfect solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet when he purchases Jason’s contract, Devin gets more than he bargained for.</description>

  <description>Needing an escape from her past, Avery chooses a college where no one knows her. Keeping a low profile was the plan, falling for the intense frat boy, Jase wasn’t. Yet she can’t deny how alive she feels when he’s near. Even as common sense implores her to stay away, her body begs her to get closer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jase, numb from his own family drama, has grown bored with weekends fueled by nameless girls and countless bottles when he meets Avery. Helping her cope with her past is better than dealing with the bullshit his own life’s served up. Determined to drive away the painful secret she’s guarding, he appoints himself her life coach, and challenges her to new experiences.  Getting close to her and being the one to make her smile are simply perks of the job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Avery’s past boldly saunters in, refusing to be forgotten, can Jase live with the truth about the girl he’s fallen for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for 17+ due to mature themes and sexual content.</description>

  <description>Danika hasn’t had an easy life. Being insanely attracted to bad boys has never helped make it easier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One look at Tristan, and every brain cell she possessed went up in smoke. This man was trouble with a capital T. It was a given.&lt;br&gt;She knew better. Bad boys were bad. Especially for her. Considering her history, it was crazy to think otherwise. So why did crazy have to feel so damn fine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For as long as she could remember, Danika had been focused on the future with single-minded purpose. Tristan came along and taught her everything there was to know about letting go, and living in the present. She fell, hard and deep. Of course, that only made her impact with the ground that much more devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad Things is about Tristan and Danika, and their train wreck of a love story. This series can be read as a standalone, or with the Up in the Air series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad Things is a full length novel, at roughly 105,000 words.&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>Kestrel and Rory are the very best partnership in Wester Fleet's elite Mountain Rescue Team.  They've trusted one another with their lives for five years. They're closer than brothers - but Rory's feelings for his handsome, daredevil partner are far from fraternal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows better than to tell Kes the truth. Climbing partnerships are a delicate balance of love and practicality, and the Fleet MRT has a strict non-fraternization code.  Rory could lose everything by a confession.  And Kes is an enigma - sometimes distant, sometimes seeming to crave the very devotion Rory longs to give him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kes is all set to become the MRT's next leader. He's a shoo-in for the job, except for his impatience with amateur climbers and his inability to hold his tongue.  When he and Rory are given the job of guiding two important visitors across the Fleet range, it's a test of his tact to say the least.  But nothing about this mission is as it seems, and soon Kes is facing the most terrifying challenge of his life.</description>

  <description>He was just looking for experience. What he got was an unexpected romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Greg's best friend places a personal ad on his behalf, he doesn't know whether to be angry or grateful. Though bisexual, he'd only ever been with a woman. But when his sexy neighbor across the hall answers his ad claiming to offer the experience Greg seeks, Greg jumps at the chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack's first sexual experience was a painful one, and he vowed to never hurt anyone the way he'd been hurt. So when Jack sees Greg's ad, he knows he can give the man he's secretly lusted after what he wants and leave him with fond memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as things heat up in the bedroom, a trust builds in their hearts. Now they must see past their differences and future plans or lose a once in a lifetime love. (Approximate length: 13K)</description>

  <description>This is a full-length, 110k word novel and is the first book in the Knitting in the City series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three things you need to know about Janie Morris: 1) She is incapable of engaging in a conversation without volunteering TMTI (Too Much Trivial Information), especially when she is unnerved, 2) No one unnerves her more than Quinn Sullivan, and 3) She doesn't know how to knit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After losing her boyfriend, apartment, and job in the same day, Janie Morris can't help wondering what new torment fate has in store. To her utter mortification, Quinn Sullivan- aka Sir McHotpants- witnesses it all then keeps turning up like a pair of shoes you lust after but can't afford. The last thing she expects is for Quinn- the focus of her slightly, albeit harmless, stalkerish tendencies- to make her an offer she can't refuse.</description>

  <description>After reliving the same day sixty-two times, Repeater Peat Harris is about to give up on his latest case: saving Jake Schwinn. In the past, Peat has solved some seriously twisted crimes, caught the bad guys, and kept an emotional distance. But this time, his heart’s involved, a definite must-never-do on Repeats, and he can’t just walk away—even if that means putting himself into the bullet’s path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year ago, Jake’s best friend was gunned down, and Jake has been playing bait to catch the killer. But now a wicked-looking hottie named Peat is warning Jake that he’s about to die—again—unless they can catch the shooter. Yeah, right. Then Jake starts to remember the previous Repeats and how he and Peat hooked up….</description>

  <description>Jeff Dawkins’s last partner left him with a mortgage he can’t afford and nonrefundable tickets for a month’s vacation in Europe. Despite a reluctance to travel, Jeff decides to go on the trip anyway. After all, he’s already paid for it. He packs a Kindle loaded with gay romance novels and arrives in Venice full of trepidation. There he meets the handsome and charming expat Cleve Prieto, who offers to serve as his tour guide. Jeff has serious misgivings—he wasn’t born yesterday, and something about Cleve doesn’t sit right—but anything is better than wandering the canals alone. With Cleve’s help, Jeff falls in love with Venice and begins to reconcile with his past. For the first time, Jeff finds himself developing strong feelings for someone else. But he can’t be sure who that person is because Cleve’s background remains a mystery embroidered with lies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a dark figure from Cleve’s past appears, and Jeff must choose whether to let Cleve flee alone or to join him on a desperate run through central Europe. Maybe Jeff will finally be able to see behind Cleve’s masks—if he survives the journey.</description>

  <description>When Andrew Riley arrives in Seattle to work at an underprivileged school at the request of his cousin, Amanda, he finds himself sharing accommodations with her current boyfriend—his estranged high school friend, Jacob Chase. Living in close quarters and working with Jacob at the school brings Andy’s old crush on Jacob back to the surface, but for the same reasons then as now he can’t let it be known: Jacob is straight, very uptight, and now involved with Andy's cousin. Add to that the fact Andy's guilty over a betrayal to a lost love because of his infatuation for Jacob and he's convinced he shouldn't tempt fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob Chase has loved Andy his whole life, but nothing scared him more than when he thought Andy might return that love. Denying his feelings broke his heart, but there was no way Jacob could accept his homosexuality. So he did what all good southern boys were brought up to do: got married and had a child. Only that led to him cheating, his wife running off with their son, and Jacob trying to atone for his mistakes by living the straight and narrow with Amanda. But with Andrew is back in his life can he keep up the facade? Can finally surrendering to love show him where his future really lies, or will it destroy his chances of ever having his son in his life? Can they both get over the hurt they've caused in their search for one another?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forever young. &lt;br&gt;Forever beautiful. &lt;br&gt;Forever outcast. &lt;br&gt;Forever lonely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life as a deaf vampire is hard. It's seen as a flaw. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being deaf is viewed as a weakness. They're foolish to underestimate me. Like Rudolph, I was never invited to play in any vampire games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one foggy winter’s night, everything changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A young man with impossibly blue eyes stares out at the viewer. It’s the eyes that have it, because this man cannot hear, a disability gained only after he was turned— into a vampire. It’s going to take one hell of a man to bring out the master vampire within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;I’ve always had a thing for moles. Don’t know what it is about them, they just do it for me. I’ve been through a bit of a dry spell, so it kind of grates that my roommate’s asshole of a brother is a wet dream come true. Better to stay away and keep to myself— but then this happens, drunk and smirking, this is what he shows me.&lt;br&gt;Yes, I want him all over me, but this can only end in tears, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;He pulls back his jacket and shirt with one hand, revealing a rock-hard abdomen and hirsute chest. His pink bow-tie hangs to one side, and his pants are undone. A constellation of moles scatters across his body, inviting…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event.

  <description>18 year old Sophie Jean is pretty good at acting normal. Sure, she’s not exactly happy, but happiness is nothing compared to being like everyone else. She can pretend she’s not allergic to the sun. She can hide what her ex-boyfriend did to her. She can cover up the scars she’s made for herself. Ignore anything. Forget anything. Then Myles enters her life, and he has more than a few secrets of his own. When accident after accident keeps happening to Sophie, she can’t help noticing that he’s everywhere. That he knows too much. That she’s remembering too much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s one thing covering up her own dark past, but does she really need to worry about people finding out just how much Myles likes her? Or that despite how much she doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes, she kind of likes him back? Not to mention the fact that she now has to conceal that Myles drinks blood-that he says he’s about four hundred years old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She almost forgot about that part.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Sophie has no plans to ruin the normal life she has created for herself. She can deal with this little glitch, no problem. Even if word has gotten around to the wrong vampire about Sophie and Myles, even if she’s putting the few people she loves at risk. Suddenly, those who were monsters before are just people, and the monsters? They’re real. Now being a normal human being is the least of her problems. Now she has to stay alive.</description>

  <description>After the death of his aunt, Phillip Wynne is left adrift. He isn’t sure how to mourn the woman who raised him with so little affection. His only solace is his childhood friend, Ryan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan has always been the one bright thing in Phillip’s life, but while Ryan lives out and proud, Phillip is terrified by the feelings Ryan inspires in him. For years he’s kept them locked away, but when Ryan suddenly confesses his love, Phillip discovers that denying his own feelings might be the only thing scarier than finally owning up to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two young boys around age six or seven exchange a sweet, innocent kiss behind a caption that reads “No matter what age.

  <description>While on business in a small town near Chicago, Wheeler Reynolds hears a tale about a traveling circus killed nearby in a horrific train wreck over ninety years ago. Haunted by the story, Wheeler falls asleep thinking someone is calling his name… and wakes up in 1918.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wheeler believes it’s his mission to stop the accident from occurring until he meets Nicola Tenaglia, an aerialist for the circus. Time becomes his enemy as he quickly falls into a whirlwind affair. When they are discovered, events spin out of Wheeler’s control, and he and Nicola are separated. Then the train begins to pull away. Nicola’s time is running out….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Bittersweet Dreams title: It's an unfortunate truth: love doesn't always conquer all. Regardless of its strength, sometimes fate intervenes, tragedy strikes, or forces conspire against it. These stories of romance do not offer a traditional happy ending, but the strong and enduring love will still touch your heart and maybe move you to tears.</description>

  <description>A year after the body swap that let brat Jayk and his dom, Amon, experience each other’s lives for a day, the pair is ready to be married in a small, stress-free ceremony. Things are going smoothly until they meet Jennifer and Ron Gaines-Brake—a quarrelsome couple with a laundry list of troubles whose wedding is at the same venue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jayk and Amon are drawn into the other couple’s drama, their own doubts and fears about marriage start to surface. And when they accidentally switch bodies with Jennifer and Ron the day before the wedding, their simple, stress-free celebration starts looking more and more like a nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the couples attempt to deal with each other’s families, secrets, and last minute wedding preparations, things spiral out of control. Add to the mix a missing cat, a vigilant police officer, an intimidating dildo, and a cake like no other, and it’s anybody’s guess whether the weekend will end in bells or bedlam.</description>

  <description>Photographer Skyler Spencer comes to Key West for his brother’s wedding expecting to take some pictures, act as best man, and maybe spend a little time getting to know his brother’s fiancee and her twin sister. Then he learns that not only is the twin a man rather than a woman, but it’s a man he’s met before–under less than appropriate circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Casey Baker doesn’t expect the guy he once had a memorable encounter in a club bathroom with to turn up as his brother-in-law to be, but he’s able to deal with the surprise. Dealing with the strong attraction they feel for each other is a lot more difficult, but Casey figures a short, hot fling will take care of that. Too bad he’s not good at staying detached, and Skyler’s not good at commitment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When mother nature and the past combine to put the wedding in jeopardy, Skyler and Casey have more than just their own confused feelings to deal with. Will the weekend end with two sets of broken hearts?</description>

  <description>A minor penalty that is not called until the offending team gains control of the puck. As long as the non-offending team maintains possession, the referee allows play to continue and signals a delayed penalty by raising his arm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Evan Mason, an NHL hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks. I spend my nights roughing up two hundred pound defensemen and, at times, spend more time in the penalty box than I do on the ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s my job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night changed everything I thought I once knew about my life on, and off, the ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brutally beaten girl left to die in an alley.&lt;br&gt;I don’t know why or how but something made me stay that night after taking her to the hospital. I didn’t know her, nor did I have an obligation to stay but something inside of me rooted me there telling me I should stay. Saving a life is worth something. At least I thought so. And I wouldn’t have been me if I just simply left her there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any man who put his heart and soul into a game of hockey couldn’t just walk away when someone needed them. She had no one else right now. The same guy who saw determination where there was desire, now saw hope where there was once despair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t leave. That wouldn’t be me. No, not a man that put all he had into something some called just a game. I couldn’t walk away from her holding onto life, weak and powerless to something she had no control over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I stayed. In a room full of family members praying for their loved ones to pull through, I prayed for a girl I didn’t know and had never met before, to have a beating heart. While others’ sorrows turned to grieving pain, I sat waiting on the words of the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No bond is stronger than the ones you’ll bleed for.</description>

  <description>Thanks to fate and his own lack of good sense, eighteen-year-old Danny Shay is headed into what looks to be the worst summer of his life. It starts with a minor meltdown at work that leaves Danny under house arrest with a cast on one leg and an ankle monitor on the other, courtesy of the San Diego Police Department. On top of that, he’s battling a chronic case of virginity, with no relief in sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and there’s one more little glitch. A serial killer is stalking the city, murdering young men. And when strange sounds are heard in the house behind Danny’s, the neighborhood kids think they’ve found the killer. But not until Danny learns he's next on the madman's list do things really begin to get desperate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn! And Danny had plans to come out this summer—maybe even get laid! He doesn't have time for ankle monitors and serial killers!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then ginger-haired Luke Jamison moves in next door. Not only does Luke solve a few of Danny's more urgent problems, he also manages to create a couple more that Danny never saw coming. Gee. If he can survive it, this summer might not be so bad after all.</description>

  <description>His practice newly established, metaphysician Ned Mathey can’t afford to turn away any clients. But the latest Londoner to seek Ned’s magical aid gives him pause: Mr Edgar Nevett, an arrogant banker, is the father of the bully who made Ned’s life hell at boarding school. Nevertheless, Ned accepts the commission to ensure the Nevett family silver bears no ancient or modern curses, and then prepares to banish the Nevett family to unpleasant memory again. Until Edgar Nevett is killed by an enchanted silver candlestick—one of the pieces Ned declared magically harmless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calling on his old school friend Julian Lynes—private detective and another victim of the younger Nevett—Ned races to solve the murder, clear the stain on his professional reputation, and lay to rest the ghosts of his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assisted by Ned’s able secretary Miss Frost, who has unexpected metaphysical skills of her own, Ned and Julian explore London’s criminal underworld and sodomitical demimonde, uncover secrets and scandals, confront the unexpected murderer and the mysteries of their own relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Death by Silver veteran authors Melissa Scott and Amy Griswold introduce a Victorian London where magic works, influencing every aspect of civilized life, and two very appealing detectives.</description>

  <description>Two years before he goes to Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau, 25, leaves Concord, Massachusetts, to live in New York, where the new America is bursting into life. But before he even gets there he falls in love—with a young man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's 1843, a repressive puritanism still hangs over Concord, Massachusetts, and Henry Thoreau wants out. When his mentor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, gives him an opportunity to move to New York City, Henry leaves Concord with no thought of ever returning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his journals, 250-some pages about his trip to New York have been ripped out, the only substantial number of pages missing from the forty-seven journal volumes. What was so scandalous that Thoreau—or, more likely, his literary executor—decided no one should see it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And why did Thoreau stay only six months in New York?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thoreau’s biographers go out of their way to convince us that the writer was heterosexual, although he never married and wrote freely in his journal about the beauty of men. His poem "Sympathy," one of the few published in his lifetime, is a love poem to a boy who was his student. (About that poem, one celebrated biographer went so far as to say, “When he wrote 'he' Thoreau really meant 'she,' and when he wrote 'him,' he really meant 'her.'”) By denying Thoreau's real sexuality, scholars have reduced him to a wooden icon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thoreau in Love imagines the time of the missing pages, when Thoreau emerged from his shell and explored the wider world and himself before he returned to Concord, where he would fearlessly live the rest of his life and become the great naturalist and literary giant.</description>

  <description>Sequel to Chaser &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The character you loved to hate in Chaser becomes the character you will simply love in Raining Men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been raining men for most of Bobby Nelson’s adult life. Normally, he wouldn’t have it any other way, but lately something’s missing. Now, he wants the deluge to slow to a single special drop. But is it even possible for Bobby to find “the one” after endless years of hooking up? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bobby’s father passes away, Bobby finally examines his rocky relationship with the man and how it might have contributed to his inability to find the love he yearns for. Guided by a sexy therapist, a Sex Addicts Anonymous group, a well-endowed Chihuahua named Johnny Wadd, and Bobby’s own cache of memories, Bobby takes a spiritual, sexual, and emotional journey to discover that life’s most satisfactory love connections lie in quality, not quantity. And when he’s ready to love not only himself but someone else, sex and love fit, at last, into one perfect package.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;The sea air would be good for me. That’s what the doctor had said. The sea air and the sun. “A few quiet weeks on the coast is what you need. Go for a swim. Explore the beaches and the caves. Maybe you’ll find a mermaid. Or…” he added with a wink, “some hidden treasure, like in your adventure books.”&lt;br&gt;He was teasing me, I know, but a part of me burned with the idea that maybe… there would be something there, something special, something hidden.&lt;br&gt;Of all the things to find washed up on the beach, I was not expecting this half-drowned man. Nor what followed after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A handsome blond wearing a cape and embroidered tunic is on one knee. He’s clutching a smaller man protectively to him. The smaller man is bound hand and foot and wears knee breeches and a long shirt. The blond wields a sword, which he has just used to cut the rope that is twisted around the smaller man’s arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Brandon plays baseball for Virginia Tech. Although his coach is confident he has a successful career ahead of him, Brandon's not so sure. What if he doesn’t make it? What will he have to fall back on? He wishes he were smarter. He looks at his friend's roommate and thinks he’d give anything for that confidence and those brains. Because brains and confidence? That’s sexy! If only he could get Corey to notice him, come up with a plan that would appeal to Corey's inner geek… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corey's program of study and academic standing are sure to land him a good job in his chosen career field: cryptology. Those popular kids? They think that because he’s a “geek” he’s missing out on life, but they’re wrong. He’s got his eye on the prize and doesn’t need the distractions of a social life. So why is he having such a hard time ignoring his roommate's flirty friend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's &lt;strong&gt;"Love Has No Boundaries" &lt;/strong&gt;event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Stone Harrison never knew he had an aunt; he certainly never expected her to bequeath him one of the largest spreads in central Nevada. But something about Copper Lake Ranch and its foreman, Luke Reynolds, speaks to him, offering a chance for the home he’s never really had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke wants Stone to succeed as a rancher and put the legacy of his shiftless father behind him, but he’d also like Stone to share his bed. Unfortunately, Stone is convinced that the world is a harsh place that will never accept two men sharing their lives. Much to Luke’s dismay, he refuses to risk Luke’s life despite the intense attraction they share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tension between them escalates when a series of calamities strikes Copper Lake. An unexpected and unwelcome visit from Stone’s dandified cousin, James, only makes things worse. Stone’s ability to run the ranch comes into question, but the threat of losing it means less to Stone than the threat to Luke’s life. Stone will do anything it takes to protect the man he loves—even if it makes him a murderer.</description>

  <description>REAL UGLY (Hard Rock Roots #1) - A New Adult Rock Star Romance&lt;br&gt;Mature - Ages 18 and Up. Contains sex, drugs, violence, and rock 'n' roll.&lt;br&gt;From the Amazon Bestselling Author of 'Losing Me, Finding You' and 'Keeping Never'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"These are real people with real problems. This is real life, and it's real f*cked up."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turner Campbell is an asshole.&lt;br&gt;I f*cking hate him.&lt;br&gt;But I can't get enough either.&lt;br&gt;He sings like an angel and f*cks like a devil.&lt;br&gt;If I could, I'd run away and never look back because to tell you the truth, I think this man might be the death of me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp; &amp;amp; &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naomi Knox is a bitch.&lt;br&gt;I can't f*cking stand her.&lt;br&gt;But I can't stop thinking about her either.&lt;br&gt;She looks like an angel and plays like a devil.&lt;br&gt;If I could, I'd f*ck her good and forget all about her, but to tell you the truth, I think this woman might be my last saving grace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;REAL UGLY EXCERPT:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gasp goes up on my right and Turner appears out of nowhere, snatching my mic from its stand and grabbing Hayden around the waist. He makes a little 'come on' gesture at me and then leans forward and grabs my lips with his.&lt;br&gt;I don't stop playing; I can't. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't stop the burst of f*cking power that's just taken hold of me. I'm both a victim and a master to it as it draws my hands along the neck and plucks strings with a violent fervor that both scares and amazes me. Hot wet heat takes over my mouth and pulls the rest of the inner me out, and then I'm kissing Turner back hard and fast and furious while the world's most intense riffs are just pulled straight through me, cutting me up and bleeding me over the stage.</description>

  <description>Caroly Evardt never expected to find herself patronizing a male prostitute. Then again, she never expected to be weeks from her thirtieth birthday and still a virgin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a friend mentions that a gorgeous male model in Paris sells his body as well as his image, Caroly's intrigued. Finally, a chance to sample the gifts of a beautiful man—no strings, no stakes, no fear of rejection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she soon discovers that Didier Pedra amounts to more than a striking face and talented body. He's a kind, charming, damaged man, and after a few evenings of pleasurable education, Caroly's interest blossoms into something far deeper than mere lust. Her simple arrangement is suddenly feeling downright dangerous . . .</description>

  <description>Magic in Strega Bluff is like parking meters in other cities. The quaint New England town is home to a large community of witches, warlocks--and many secrets. Jade Hansen loved living there until the untimely death of her parents. After a much-needed sabbatical, she returns to find the peaceful hamlet turned upside down. A string of murders haunts the city and everyone is potential a target, but even worse, they are all suspects. A family secret puts Jade in the middle and her loved ones in danger. Dodging an evil warlock set on revenge, she is in a race to stop the killer before it’s too late.</description>

  <description>When Nowhere is Safe&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people avoid the dreaded Whitechapel district. For Honoria Todd, it's the last safe haven. But at what price?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blade is known as the master of the rookeries—no one dares cross him. It's been said he faced down the Echelon's army single–handedly, that ever since being infected by the blood–craving he's been quicker, stronger, and almost immortal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Honoria shows up at his door, his tenuous control comes close to snapping. She's so...innocent. He doesn't see her backbone of steel—or that she could be the very salvation he's been seeking.</description>

  <description>Fed up with his desk duty in the Imperial Arcane Library, book hunter Colin Bliss accepts a private commission to find The Sword’s Shadow, a legendary and dangerous witches’ grimoire. But to find the book, Colin must travel to the remote Western Isles and solve a centuries’ old murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be nothing more than an academic exercise, so why is dour — and unreasonably sexy — Magister Septimus Marx doing his best to keep Colin from accepting this mission — even going so far as to seduce Colin on their train journey north?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Septimus is not the only problem. Who is the strange fairy woman that keeps appearing at inconvenient times? And who is working behind the scenes with the sinister adventuress Irania Briggs? And why do Colin’s employers at the Museum of the Literary Occult keep accusing Colin of betraying them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Colin digs deeper and deeper into the Long Island’s mysterious past, he begins to understand why Septimus is willing to stop him at any price — but by then, it’s too late to turn back.</description>

  <description>Dru and Thom have been together for three years, and despite Thom’s occasional bouts of insecurity and Dru’s fear of rejection, their relationship is rock solid. Then Dru’s long-lost friend, Skye, suddenly reappears, shocking them both. Skye suffered years of inconceivable abuse before escaping it, and while he’s back on track, he has nowhere else to go as he begins to rebuild his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dru, Thom, and Skye each want to belong somewhere, to belong with someone—or someones—with no fear of being hurt, set aside, or left behind. It’s a challenge with daunting odds, especially for Skye, who’s never loved before. He’s determined not to come between his two friends who so clearly belong together, and it will be up to Dru and Thom to conquer their fears and convince Skye to stay.</description>

  <description>Harriett Clark is Captain Joshua Kane's most beautiful possession and his most frustrating acquisition. For while agreeing to trade her wanton body to escape a locked jail cell, she stubbornly refuses to barter the key to her heart. &lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: The Acquisition is a revised and re-edited version of a previous book by the same name. This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM/spanking, exhibitionism.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;My friend Ulysses has always been a bit of a klutz but he seemed to be getting his act together better recently. Burdened by that name, he’s always allowed himself to be bullied and take a back seat to everyone else. Added to that, he trips over his own feet or stutters when he meets a hot guy. This spectacular fall is just one more thing to make the poor guy think he’s doomed. He was getting ready to go on a blind date tonight and now I just had to call the paramedics instead. What’s a guy to do when he just can’t stay grounded?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Picture is of sexy dark haired man taking a shower. He’s tangled in the transparent shower curtain and falling ass over teacups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What she’s wanted…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Sydney Warren is a successful painter of erotic landscapes—just the artful fantasies of a woman whose own life has been stripped of passion. Though she has stayed loyal to her boyfriend, Max, he’s unable to ignite the sparks they once shared, leaving Sydney wanting. Then comes the stranger, a work of art himself, and everything changes.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is what she’s getting…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; With chestnut hair, mesmerizing green eyes, and the perfect body, Colm Hennessy is every woman’s fantasy. He too is aroused, and more intrigued by the beautiful artist than he expected to be—because it wasn’t supposed to happen this way. For there’s something about Colm that Sydney doesn’t know...&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in the ultimate game of control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Colm is only pretending to be a model. He’s been hired by Max to seduce her—a twisted scheme to test her fidelity. But Max never imagined that Colm would feel something real. As Sydney and Colm’s intimacy grows, as passions neither expected are unleashed, the stakes in a cruel game are raised—and desire isn’t the only thing set to spiral out of control.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Kiersten White, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Paranormalcy&lt;/em&gt;, is back with &lt;em&gt;The Chaos of Stars&lt;/em&gt;—an enchanting novel set in Egypt and San Diego that captures the magic of first love and the eternally complicated truth about family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isadora's family is seriously screwed up—which comes with the territory when you're the human daughter of the ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris. Isadora is tired of living with crazy relatives who think she's only worthy of a passing glance—so when she gets the chance to move to California with her brother, she jumps on it. But her new life comes with plenty of its own dramatic—and dangerous—complications . . . and Isadora quickly learns there's no such thing as a clean break from family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending Ally Carter's humor and the romance of Cynthia Hand's &lt;em&gt;Unearthly, The Chaos of Stars&lt;/em&gt; takes readers on an unforgettable journey halfway across the world and back, and proves there's no place like home.</description>

  <description>What if everything you think you want isn't what you actually need...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Shelly Monroe is a woman who doesn't shy away from going after what she wants, but lately good sex has been hard to find. Shelly's become increasingly frustrated with the men she's been dating and the men she believes are the right choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joshua Daniels is certainly not even close to the right choice. In fact he is exactly the wrong choice. For one thing, he's Mason Langley's best friend and best man. Second he's too much of a risky complication for Shelly to even consider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then why can't she stop thinking about how delicious he looked that first night she met him at Exquisite? Why is it so imperative to keep her lusty desire for a man that doesn’t meet her preconceived mold hidden from Lena and Mason, her trusted friends?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems unreasonable that being with a man completely wrong in theory could somehow feel so right. Then why is it the more she sees him the more enticing he becomes?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sparks fly between jaded film TA, Shane, and tough-acting freshman, Angel. Shane gives Angel the sex he craves, but struggles to be the man he needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane’s too old for Angel. Even if Angel weren’t a freshman in Shane’s Intro to Film class, the kid would be too closeted, too confused, too darn changeable and needy. But when Shane sees the pain lurking behind Angel’s tough exterior, he can’t help but reach out to him and give in to the desire in those scared, brown eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pacific Rim University may as well be another planet from the Oakland neighborhood where Angel grew up. Angel’s fought all his life to get respect, and to stay hard in the eyes of his friends back home. Always the weird kid, Angel was the guy who never hooked up with girls. Meeting his very sexy, very male Film TA, Angel starts to understand why. He refuses to admit he’s gay, but he lives for every one of Shane’s smiles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Shane takes Angel to task for his insolent attitude, Angel can’t resist pushing his TA further. He wants Shane to show him, force him, make him accept all the feelings battling around in his mind and his body. But Angel doesn’t just need sex. He needs a man who can help him navigate the new and very raw landscape of his feelings.</description>

  <description>Book one in the Poker Night Series A pizza delivery never felt so good. Zac Grainger's life is pretty quiet. Other than coaching high school football, the only excitement he gets is playing poker with his close friends every other Saturday. That is until he opens the door to the hottest pizza delivery man he's ever seen, and man, does Zac want a piece of that pie. Eric Stanton spends long hours as an intern at one of the largest hospital in San Francisco. To help keep a roof over his head, he also has a part-time job as a pizza delivery driver. When a gorgeous customer tries to flirt with him, Eric's too tired to reciprocate. Just when Eric wonders if he'll get a second chance with the guy, an order is placed requesting him personally. Tired or not, perhaps things are looking up.</description>

  <description>When Seth, a Keeper of the Gods, finds the two men he is destined to live eternity with, he must defy the very Gods themselves to save his mates and preserve the existence of man and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discovering love with the one person who is fated to compliment everything that you are is blessing enough, but what do you do when another knight in shining armor sweeps you off your feet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie found a second chance at life when Loland rescued him from the ignorance and abuse of those who should have protected him. For years they struggled together to cope with Jamie's powers of precognition and his ability to absorb energy from living things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After centuries of waiting for his other half, Seth finally met Loland, a man that embodied all he'd ever dreamt of in a mate. Meeting Loland's lover, Jamie, and finding that they are both his mates only made the pot sweeter. But while exploring the love they find as mates and the D/s relationships they crave, all three must challenge the will of the Gods and the twisted plans of Jamie's mysterious family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, Seth knows there is nothing he wouldn't do to save the lives and love of his mates.</description>

  <description>On the day of his mother’s funeral, ten-year old Sidney Wilks is silently comforted by the presence of one man, ranch hand Grady Nash. Little did Sidney know that Nash would become the only stable figure in his life for the next forty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later, after an evening of typical college fun, Sidney is involved in a serious car wreck. It’s Nash who once again steps in to rescue Sidney and nurse him back to health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While trying to get close enough to Sidney to help him heal, Nash’s feelings begin to change towards the twenty-one year old. For him, loving Sidney was nothing new, but when his body begins to desire the small man, Nash is forced to re-evaluate his protective instincts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What kind of future could the two men possibly have? Nash’s life is centred on horses and cattle, while Sidney has dreams of escaping the small-town Kansas life to build skyscrapers. How can two men who want opposite lifestyles come to a compromise, or will Nash be forced to allow Sidney to spread his wings without him?</description>

  <description>Book one in the Perfect Timing Series All Luke had to do was come after Justin. How difficult could that possibly be? There was only one thing that stopped sex with Justin being completely perfect for Luke. The timing. That wasn't so perfect. In fact, the timing really sucked and not in the fun, fellatio related way. Justin was five years younger than Luke and relatively inexperienced. Luke had enjoyed more lovers than he could count or remember - he knew he was good at sex. There was no good reason why Justin should outlast him every time they hooked up. All Luke had to do was come second, set his mind at ease, and everything would be perfect between them. Hell, if he could do that, he might even consider the serious relationship idea Justin seemed so taken with. How difficult could that possibly be?Please note: The stories in this collection are linked solely by theme. Each story can be read on it's own and the stories can be read in any order.</description>

  <description>Dear Diary: Book One &lt;br&gt;2nd Edition &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris Bishop has everything a high school senior could want—a loving family, a perfect girlfriend, and a bright, shining future. At his dad’s suggestion, he spends a summer working at a law firm to gain experience, but he never bargained on meeting Josh. Josh is handsome and green-eyed and just what Chris doesn’t want—or does he? Some things Chris has admitted only to his digital diary, but by the time prom comes around, he needs to make a decision: risk the pain of honesty about himself and his feelings for Josh, or play it safe and lose what matters most. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1st Edition published by XoXo Publishing, June 2011</description>

  <description>Harvard Medical School graduate Dr. Adrian Cook is $120,000 in debt…rural Montana is desperate for doctors and will forgive $100,000 in student loans in exchange for five years of service…but what kind of social life can a young, gay, doctor expect in Red Wheel, Montana, population 5,162? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrian is skeptical, but the financial incentive is too much to pass up, so the born and bred New Englander makes the journey west. On his first day in town, Adrian meets both Dr. Clayton Cody, Bear Paw Hospital’s incredibly hot, medical director, and Randall Banks, a quietly captivating, half-Cheyenne, park ranger. Suddenly, life is looking up—until Adrian learns that Red Wheel is harboring painful secrets and he’s caught in the middle of a dangerous blackmail scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with his new, best friend, Karen, Adrian must learn the truth about Randall and Clayton, while trying to keep his own life from shattering.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I will tell you a story of magic and love, of daring and death, and one to comfort your heart. It will be the truest story I have ever told. Now listen, and tell me if it is not so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keturah follows a legendary hart deep into the forest, where she becomes hopelessly lost. Her strength diminishes until, finally, she realizes that death is near--and learns then that death is a young lord, melancholy and stern. Renowned for her storytelling, Keturah is able to charm Lord Death with a story and gain a reprieve--but he grants her only a day, and within that day she must find true love. Martine Leavitt offers a spellbinding story, interweaving elements of classic fantasy and romance.</description>

  <description>**New Adult featuring mature situations and sexual content - recommended for ages 18+**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad girl,Georgia King, is trying to survive after spiraling into a darkness that nearly took her life. With her college dreams on hold she's trying to get healthy--trying to still the craziness inside her.  She has no room for someone like Ben Lancaster and if he was smart he'd stay away. Because everyone knows Georgia is bad news--she ruins people--and if Ben isn't careful, he'll be next in line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Lancaster is a young, hot shot hockey player on his way to the top. Newly signed to the Philadelphia Flyers, he's living the dream. The girls. The money. The fame. He thought he had everything he wanted until he met Georgia. Suddenly he wants more--he wants her. He'll do whatever it takes to get her and Ben Lancaster always gets what he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the girl who's different from anyone he's ever known is hiding secrets. And as the dog days of summer pass, only time will tell if Georgia's secrets can be healed. Or if her bruised soul is strong enough to resist Ben Lancaster...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Ben Lancaster had just tattooed himself onto my soul and the thing about tattoos?  They’re painful to remove."--Georgia King.</description>

  <description>Rick and Ernie have found the perfect loft apartment on Chicago’s west side. But before they are even settled, Rick begins having strange “dreams” that seem all too real. A young man, emaciated, with sad brown eyes, appears to him, frightening and obsessing him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From their next-door neighbor, Paula, Rick learns of the gay couple, Karl and Tommy, who lived there before them. Paula had been close to them and Tommy’s mysterious disappearance still pains her. When she shares a photo of her with Tommy and Karl, Rick is shocked and troubled. Tommy is the man who has appeared to him in his dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dreams and the revelation put Rick on a quest to discover the truth about Tommy’s disappearance. It’s a quest that will lead him to Karl, Tommy’s lover, who may know more about Tommy’s disappearance than he’s telling, and a confrontation with a restless spirit who wants only to, finally, rest in peace...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;This is a dystopian class-based society where being a slave boy is a prized position. For those not born into the wealthy class, there are few options for work. A position as a slave boy means security and safety from a life of poverty and the danger of the streets.&lt;br&gt;Dystopian - set in a world similar to ours but with a few tweaks. Usually a bit darker or a more frightening version of what our society could become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;An agile young slave is bent backward over the knees of his doting master; his bindings are loose and their arrangement is “in the cards”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Experienced dominant Marcus has a stalker. On the plus side, the boy following him around his local leather club is gorgeous and a self-professed submissive. Unfortunately, he’s also inexperienced, bratty, and liable to drive Marcus insane with his incessant chatter and questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bret Daniels fell head over heels with Marcus the moment he first saw him. He’s willing to do whatever it takes to get Marcus’s attention and prove his worth as a submissive. He might not be a traditional sub, but he knows he has a lot to offer a dom who can handle his quirks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Marcus gives in and agrees to do a scene with Bret, sparks fly. One scene quickly becomes another, and another. But will it be a case of once a brat, always a brat? Bret intends to prove to Marcus that—expectations and experiences aside—he deserves his master’s collar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title is part of the Kinky Cupid universe.</description>

  <description>Ben Hudson had a thing for shy, sexy Reese Monroe from the moment he first saw her three years ago. Back then, she was married and living in Boston—two very good reasons for the Miami detective with a bad boy reputation to stay away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that was then…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Reese is divorced and moving to Florida, where her mother has rented her a small beach house—one that happens to be owned by Ben. Living right next door, he can’t get Reese’s soft curves out of his mind. He’s waited three long years to touch her in all the ways he’s been dreaming about, and this time he won’t let anything get in his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Reese, Ben’s sudden advances are thrilling, but leave her stunned. With her limited experience in the bedroom, she never expects a man with such a wicked reputation to go after her. She knows she should be on guard, but he’s a temptation she can’t resist. And when trouble follows her down from Boston, threatening her life, Ben may be the only one who can help her.</description>

One spontaneous choice whisks Angela across the world to the pseudo paradise of Spain’s Mediterranean Riviera where she has another choice to make: live cooperatively as one of billionaire Marco Ruiz’s slaves, or die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Douglas’s future was seized and choked when deliberate tragedy struck his Scottish family at the age of sixteen.

It turns out to be a mission which will put his desire for control to the ultimate test, and make him wish for things he never knew he wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*AUTHOR'S NOTE*    Escape from Paradise is a work of fiction intended for adult readers, containing graphic sexual scenarios and strong language.</description>

  <description>When it rains it pours….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard-nosed and self-reliant Dallis O'Brien has had her fair share of devastation. Her father's tragic accident sparked what seemed like a domino effect of heartbreak and loss. Unable to shake the fear of enduring any more pain, she builds walls around her heart, hoping to heal on her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dallis' road to recovery is disrupted when she meets Grayson Rivera, a tattooed, coffee shop owner who, by appearances alone, isn't her typical match. Stubborn and hesitant to let him in, Dallis finally succumbs to Grayson's persistence, where he challenges her to face her loss while also having the walls of her heart broken down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Grayson's assistance, Dallis must decide if she is willing to learn how to be weak in order to be strong.</description>

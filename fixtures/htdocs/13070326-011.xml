  <description>Insightful to a fault, Gabe Ashton knows Nick Flynn’s gay even if Nick doesn’t. And after seeing how the townie looks at his "buddy," Gabe knows Nick is in love with a guy who’ll never love him back. So Gabe invites Nick to campus parties and to hang out with new people. But soon their friendship turns physical, and Gabe wonders if he’s in just as much denial as Nick is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick’s straight—or so he’s always assumed. But he can’t deny that the things he’s doing with Gabe are hot. More than that, he likes Gabe in a way he’s never liked anyone else. Well, anyone else except his high school friend, John.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hardest thing to give up is a fantasy, and the hardest thing to face is the truth. But if Nick wants the man standing in front of him, he’ll have to give up the one he never had.</description>

  <description>For the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melanie has no desire to meet the members of the rock band, Sole Regret, but her groupie of a best friend gets them both backstage and then rushes off with the band’s lead singer. Left alone at an after party with a bunch of scary tattooed and pierced metal-heads, sheltered Melanie is relieved when the only normal-looking guy in the room insists on keeping her company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time Melanie discovers that Gabe is the band’s drummer and not as normal as she assumed, she has already made a complete fool of herself. She can’t help but be interested in him, not as a rock star, but as the sexiest man she’s ever encountered. Strangely attracted to his hidden tattoos and body piercing, she wonders what it would be like to spend a night with a bad boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe is more than willing to show sweet Melanie there’s more to him than meets the eye. All she has to do is try him. Will they only share a single night of passion? Or will their hearts entangle as quickly as their bodies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contains explicit sex, graphic language, and a hot rock star with a naughty and inventive mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe and Melanie's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Book 6: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17832488.Tell_Me" title="Tell Me"&gt;Tell Me&lt;/a&gt; and Book 11: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490402.Trust_Me" title="Trust Me"&gt;Trust Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released).</description>

  <description>*Includes a bonus chapter from Devoured from Lucas Wolfe's POV!*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kylie Wolfe and bassist Wyatt McCrae have been bad for each other for the last several years, but it’s impossible for them to end their toxic push and pull. Not when their attraction is constantly fueled by lust and proximity—she’s her older brother’s Lucas’s assistant and Wyatt is his best friend and band mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Your Toxic Sequel makes a move to record a new album in Nashville, Kylie decides to make the latest break with Wyatt official by getting the hell out of town. She’ll spend a week in New Orleans. A week to immerse herself in the Mardi Gras scene. One week to not think about the last time she was in New Orleans, seven years ago with Wyatt. Seven days where she won’t have to see Wyatt every day just to fall ridiculously in love with him all over again—where, if she wants to, she can have a normal, no-strings attached fling that won’t end in heartbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad Wyatt ruins everything by showing up, as gorgeous and demanding and awful for her as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wyatt refuses to let Kylie give up on him. Not without reminding her why they both fell so far and hard in the first place. Not without making her savor the good memories and what could be their last chance with each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Read more about Kylie and Wyatt in ABSORBED, a FREE Devoured mini-serial told from Lucas Wolfe's POV.</description>

  <description>Photographer Stuart Grange was happy with his suburbanite life until his partner was killed in a plane hijacking. Now he’s suddenly the face of gay rights in America and trying to deal with his new responsibility while coping with his overwhelming grief. He’s got his hands full without the complications of a new love, but his heart’s not waiting for him to catch up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commercial pilot Dustin McDonough knows what it’s like to deal with loss. He has his own set of scars, physical and emotional. He’s trying to give Stuart the time and space he needs to be ready to move on, but he’s in love for the first time in years, and he’s determined not to lose again.</description>

  <description>St. Bride's College, Cambridge, England, 1905. When Jonty Stewart takes up a teaching post at the college where he studied, the handsome and outgoing young man acts as a catalyst for change within the archaic institution. He also has a catalytic effect on Orlando Coppersmith. Orlando is a brilliant, introverted mathematician with very little experience of life outside the college walls. He strikes up an alliance with the outgoing Jonty, and soon finds himself having feelings hes never experienced before. Before long their friendship blossoms into more than either man had hoped and they enter into a clandestine relationship. Their romance is complicated when a series of murders is discovered within St. Brides. All of the victims have one thing in common, a penchant for men. While acting as the eyes and ears for the police, a mixture of logic and luck leads them to a confrontation with the murderercan they survive it?</description>

  <description>Music. Topher Manning rarely thinks about anything else, but his day job as a mechanic doesn't exactly mesh with his rock star ambitions. Unless he can find a way to unlock all the songs in his head, his band will soon be on the fast track to obscurity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the South by Southwest music festival and a broken-down car drop New York critic Stanton Porter into his life. Stanton offers Topher a ticket to the Bruce Springsteen concert, where a hesitant kiss and phantom vibrations from Topher’s cell phone kick off a love story that promises to transcend ordinary possibility.</description>

  <description>He watches her from across the crowded dance club, a sensual black-haired stranger who stirs Gabrielle Maxwell’s deepest fantasies. But nothing about this night—or this man—is what it seems. For when Gabrielle witnesses a murder outside the club, reality shifts into something dark and deadly. In that shattering instant she is thrust into a realm she never knew existed—a realm where vampires stalk the shadows and a blood war is set to ignite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucan Thorne despises the violence carried out by his lawless brethren. A vampire himself, Lucan is a Breed warrior, sworn to protect his kind—and the unwitting humans existing alongside them—from the mounting threat of the Rogues. Lucan cannot risk binding himself to a mortal woman, but when Gabrielle is targeted by his enemies, he has no choice but to bring her into the dark underworld he commands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, in the arms of the Breed’s formidable leader, Gabrielle will confront an extraordinary destiny of danger, seduction, and the darkest pleasures of all. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The most tragic love story in history . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliet Capulet didn’t take her own life. She was murdered by the person she trusted most, her new husband, Romeo Montague, a sacrifice made to ensure his own immortality. But what Romeo didn’t anticipate was that Juliet would be granted eternity, as well, and would become an agent for the Ambassadors of Light. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 700 years, she’s fought Romeo for the souls of true lovers, struggling to preserve romantic love and the lives of the innocent. Until the day she meets someone she’s forbidden to love, and Romeo, oh Romeo, will do everything in his power to destroy that love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These violent delights have violent ends&lt;br&gt;And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,&lt;br&gt;Which as they kiss consume.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Romeo and Juliet&lt;/em&gt; by William Shakespeare</description>

  <description>There are only eight breeding female werecats left . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And I'm one of them.&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I look like an all-American grad student. But I am a werecat, a shape-shifter, and I live in two worlds.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite reservations from my family and my Pride, I escaped the pressure to continue my species and carved out a normal life for myself. Until the night a Stray attacked.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd been warned about Strays -- werecats without a Pride, constantly on the lookout for someone like me: attractive, female, and fertile. I fought him off, but then learned two of my fellow tabbies had disappeared.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brush with danger was all my Pride needed to summon me back . . . for my own protection. Yeah, right. But I'm no meek kitty. I'll take on whatever -- and whoever -- I have to in order to find my friends. Watch out, Strays -- 'cause I got claws, and I'm not afraid to use them . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;This peaceful moment reflects the love and compassion that these two have for each other. How did they meet and find one another? What stage is their relationship, and what sorts of experiences and emotional growth have they had together?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A photo depicts two men: their faces close together, eyes closed, radiating contentment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>When a Lamborghini Diablo car pulls into the quick oil change shop on Cleveland’s west side, Tom Russell work immediately assumes this is his old lover, Wells, a beautiful, wealthy, east side snob, come back to torment him. But it’s worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The driver is Wells’ arrogant, obscenely rich cousin Law Castille, who invites Tom on a little subtle revenge, accompanying Law as his guest to Wells’ wedding. But dance with the devil, and there's hell to pay. Tom thinks Law is toying with him, but Law’s visit to the poor side of a rustbelt town was never about revenge. It was never about cousin Wells at all. Law has come for Tom.</description>

  <description>Scarlet of Lysia is an honest peddler, a young merchant traveling the wild, undefended roads to support his aging parents. Liall, called the Wolf of Omara, is the handsome, world-weary chieftain of a tribe of bandits blocking a mountain road that Scarlet needs to cross. When Liall jokingly demands a carnal toll for the privilege, Scarlet refuses and an inventive battle of wills ensues, with disastrous results. Scarlet is convinced that Liall is a worthless, immoral rogue, but when the hostile countryside explodes into violence and Liall unexpectedly fights to save the lives of Scarlet's family, Scarlet is forced to admit that the Wolf is not the worst ally he could have, but what price will proud Scarlet ultimately have to pay for Liall's friendship?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Hot and steamy in The Big Easy isn't the life Darcy Butler wants. Until he meets a smooth talking bad boy who makes him question his entire belief system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darcy Butler is a fish out of water (or in his case a Duck out of Oregon), and he is suffocating in the humid New Orleans' heat. Dissatisfied with his career, his life, he is homesick and heartbroken. But above all Darcy is straight. Or so he believes until he meets the drop-dead gorgeous photographer he wants to hire to revamp the art department of the e-magazine he co-owns with his former lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb Mitchell, bad boy extraordinaire lives life on the edge. He's been around the world covering murder and mayhem. Back in New Orleans to tend his dying mother, Caleb is worn down by grief and his own mortality. He seeks the diversion of playing art director of a small local e-magazine to help keep him sane. He doesn't expect the instant attraction to the bright-eyed editor/owner. That Darcy is deeply closeted and possibly straight doesn't matter to Caleb. Because when Caleb wants something, there is nothing going to stand in his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not even Darcy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A jealous ex, the hot summer nights, and the secrets Caleb carefully hides behind iron lace tattoos could just be Darcy's undoing.</description>

  <description>Houston nightclub Rave is famous for nearly-naked male dancers and beautiful bartenders. It's a club for hedonists and playboys. Like Peter, a young man with a strict rule about one-night stands. He breaks that rule for Lucien, the owner of The Den, a rival gay nightclub where there are no boundaries, no taboos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anything goes at The Den, including vampires. When Peter finds out about Lucien's vampire nature, he figures he should have stuck to his rule. He's not a vampire fan, after all, and Lucien pulls him into a dark world of vampires, werewolves and feuding in-laws. Peter resists Lucien as long as he can, but when he gives in, he does it in a big way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter and Lucien begin a very dangerous dance of sensual heat and deep emotion, one that causes them nothing but trouble. No one approves of the human and vampire match, including the Council, old enemies and even older friends. Peter and Lucien have to struggle to stay together and protect those they love. Can they beat the forces that will try to tear them apart forever? And can they face what will become of Peter if they stay together?</description>

  <description>Jamie Makepeace isn't sure what to do with his work or his love life. Laid off at his job and at odds with his ultra-conservative boyfriend, Micah, he's searching for something to fill the empty spots. When he meets Ben Gallagher, a cake decorator, Jamie knows he's found a friend. Taking a chance, Jamie turns to art for his new career, and Ben becomes his muse. He creates an entire show based on the man who is always there for him. The problem with Ben is that he's been hurt by love in the past, and might not be willing to risk his friendship with Jamie for something more. Can Ben get past his fear and see that all that Jamie has to offer before it's too late?</description>

  <description>Thirteen years ago, Eli went on a summer trip with his mother and never came back. Now, existing in a new life as Jacob Somerville, he’s again running from fear and memories, only to end up where he started. As Jacob struggles to reconnect with his father and brothers, he realizes that his lover, Craig Zhao, was the only thing filling his empty heart and standing between him and ghosts of the past. It will take the power of love—from his family, from Craig, and from himself—for Jacob to see that his life truly is filled with the promise of what can be.</description>

  <description>Vampire Alexei Novik may have the teeth and the coffin, but he’s given up the lifestyle for an old fixer-upper in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Weary of his past, Alex plans to keep to himself, but it seems his sexy, new neighbor, Tate, can’t take the hint—a good thing, since it turns out he’s handy for all kinds of things around the house. Tate even gets along with Alex’s werewolf friends, though one of them pointedly reminds Alex that their friendship is a bad idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a platonic relationship is a bad idea, the growing attraction between Tate and Alex is a disaster waiting to happen. Loving Tate will draw him into Alex’s dangerous world, and Alex is torn between having the relationship he’s always craved and keeping Tate safe. Tate won’t take no for an answer, however, and seems to handle everything Alex can throw at him without blinking. Just when he thinks things might turn out all right after all, Alex’s past catches up with him—forcing him to make a terrible choice.</description>

  <description>Bailey McMillan’s life is a mess. The general public blames him for his former employer’s nuclear pollution, resulting in professional disgrace. Humiliated, he takes a job as an editor at a science magazine run by his best friend, John. That part isn’t so bad; Bailey is fond of John, who seems to find Bailey’s abrasive nature amusing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, working for John also leads to writing an astrology column in exchange for getting free rein in some op-ed articles—and then being sued over one. The (totally coincidental) accuracy of the column offers opportunity for further professional disgrace if anyone discovers its author—and then Bailey digs himself a little deeper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to prove astrology is bogus, he agrees to an experiment to date someone from each star sign. As if that wasn’t bad enough, Bailey’s got a stupid crush on John, who stubbornly insists on a detailed breakdown of every date—bad and otherwise. Bailey’s luck has to improve sometime… right?</description>

  <description>[Siren Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, werewolves]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, Darren Hart was rescued from a fall by a gorgeous man that tells him an outlandish tale. Once he returns to civilization, his memories blur and he begins to believe the voice in his head is a figment of his imagination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Darren is a successful veterinarian who believes he is just a bit crazy. After years of therapy and medications, he has learned to live with the sexy voice in his head. He even carries on conversations and occasionally fantasizes about the voice. When he's attacked, Darren doesn't know what to think, but when the voice comes to rescue him in the form of the most gorgeous man he's ever met, Darren is positive he's lost his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the run from a killer, Darren has to come to terms with the fact that the voice is real and has a name. Asher Stone is the alpha of a werewolf clan and claims that Darren is his alpha mate. Can Darren believe in Asher's promise that they were meant to be together or will an unknown assailant kill him before he realizes that being the alpha mate is what he desires most in the world?</description>

  <description>Michael Jones, a young gay artist and part-time prostitute will do anything to stage his first exhibition. When he falls in love with rich financier, Jack Hutchinson, he seems set to achieve his goal. But as Mikey becomes caught between the unforgiving territory of smoky-bar Hackney and the green-garden luxury of upper class London, we discover the intense mindscape of a man obsessed with his dreams as he attempts to free himself of his past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a net of antagonistic relationships and inner battles encroaches upon him, the consequences of Mikey's uncompromising pursuit emerge in thrilling tragedy, leaving him having to fight for all he holds dear, and in the only way he knows how. Within a plot thick with the flesh of individual struggle, a backbone of page-turning tension carries Mikey's plight through the charcoal grey London which rubs itself so close to his skin, entrapping him in a dark kaleidoscope of sex and crime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pushing him to the full expression of his haunting richness, Brooke alerts us to the psychological discourse and emotional minefield of a troubled man struggling to establish a sense of self and place in urban England.</description>

  <description>Ford McKinney leads a charmed life: he's a young doctor possessing good looks, good breeding, and money. He comes from an old Savannah family where his parents, attentive to his future, focus their energies on finding their son--their golden boy--a girl to marry. But how charmed is this life when Ford's own heart suspects that he is not meant to spend his life with a woman? His suspicions are confirmed when he meets Dan Crell. &lt;br&gt; Dan is a quiet man with a great voice. Behind the tempered facade of the shy hospital administrator is a singer who can transform a room with his soaring voice, leaving his listeners in awe and reverence. Ford catches one such Christmas concert and his life is never quite the same; he is touched in a place he keeps hidden, forbidden. When Ford and Dan begin to explore the limits of their relationship, Dan's own secrets are exposed--and his mysterious and painful childhood returns to haunt him. &lt;br&gt; In Comfort and Joy Jim Grimsley finds a marriage between the stark and stunning pain of his prize-winning Winter Birds and the passion of critically acclaimed Dream Boy. In this, his fourth novel, he considers pressing questions. How does a man reconcile the child he was raised to be with the man that he truly is? What happens when an adult has to choose between his parents and a lover?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;How many secrets can you hide in plain sight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sprout Bradford has a secret. It’s not what you think—he’ll tell you he’s gay. He’ll tell you about his dad’s drinking and his mother’s death. The green fingerprints everywhere tell you when he last dyed his hair. But neither the reader nor Sprout are prepared for what happens when Sprout suddenly finds he’s had a more profound effect on the lives around him than he ever thought possible. &lt;em&gt;Sprout &lt;/em&gt;is both hilarious and gripping; a story of one boy at odds with the expected.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ice fell upon the world nearly a hundred years ago, and if civilization didn't rightly collapse, it surely staggered and fell ill a while. In the small town of Moline, Virginia, folks struggle to survive, relying on hybrid seed sent by the faraway Departmet of Reintroduction and Agriculture and their own faith in God and hard work. But when a mated pair of dragons starts hunting the countryside, stealing sheep, and attacking children, the townsfolk quickly learn that they don't have the weapons or the skills to fight off such predators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Anderson is a farmer's son who has explored the world through books. When he meets the new healer in town, Callan Landers, he doesn't quite know what to make of the strange warmth stealing over him. It's not until he surprises Callan with another man-and both men are promptly arrested for sodomy-that David finally realizes the truth about his own feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When David and Callan stumble over a secret in a nearby abandoned town, their personal problems fade before government politics and corruption that threaten lives. It seems the dragons aren't the worst dangers facing Moline.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Trusting a psychic flash might solve a mystery…and lead to love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspector Robert Court should have felt a sense of justice when a rag-and-bones man went to the gallows for murdering his cousin. Yet something has never felt right about the investigation. Robert’s relentless quest for the truth has annoyed his superintendent, landing him lowly assignments such as foiling a false medium who’s fleecing the wives of the elite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oliver Marsh plays the confidence game of spiritualism, though his flashes of insight often offer his clients some comfort. Despite the presence of an attractive, if sneering, non-believer at a séance, he carries on—and experiences a horrifying psychic episode in which he experiences a murder as the victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s only one way for Court to learn if the young, dangerously attractive Marsh is his cousin’s killer or a real psychic: spend as much time with him as possible. Despite his resolve to focus on his job, Marsh somehow manages to weave a seductive spell around the inspector’s straight-laced heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gradually, undeniable attraction overcomes caution. The two men are on the case, and on each other, as they race to stop a murderer before he kills again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Graphic language and hot male/male sex with light BDSM themes. Despite “Descriptions of Murderous Acts” perpetrated by an unhinged killer, resist the temptation to cover your eyes—you’ll miss the good parts!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Anthony Hunter wonders what the hell he's gotten himself into when he agrees to manage an unproven candidate's campaign for governor of California. As soon as he meets the gorgeous, charismatic - and married - politician, attraction gives Anthony's rock-solid professionalism a run for its money, and Anthony knows he's in way over his head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse Cameron doesn't like the idea of putting himself out there as a happily married, wholesome candidate, but his retired senator uncle insists it'll give him an edge over a challenging rival. The only problem is that Jesse's marriage is over, existing only to maintain his heterosexual facade. Oh, and there's that minor detail about his undeniable attraction to his smoking hot campaign manager. Or the fact that the attraction is very, very mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before long, temptation explodes into a sizzling, secret relationship, but under the microscope of the media and the relentless scrutiny of the voting public, Anthony and Jesse can only keep their secret for so long. And this is one scandal a campaign won't survive...</description>

  <description>Lornyc Reagalos, future High Lord of the city of Katraman, enjoys his life as a student, even if he has to keep his relationship with Methian Hadral, heir to the throne of Xenetra, a secret. Unfortunately, Lornyc isn’t just any royal student—he’s also the grandson of an infamous magic user named Romanus Reagalos, and his grandfather’s wild youth is about to catch up with him. Unknown to anyone else, Romanus saw fit to sign his grandson into the life of a valet. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;Methian’s&lt;/em&gt; valet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contract—and the strain it puts on his relationship with Methian—is just the start of Lornyc’s troubles. Though the Reagalos family was once famous for its magic, Lornyc’s father never showed any aptitude, and Lornyc hasn’t either—though that doesn’t make the next contract, the one that says Lornyc must learn to use his latent powers, any less binding. When Lornyc learns of a plot to remove his father from power, he finds himself racing against time. If he can’t master his magic and identify the leader of the plot, he stands to lose everything he knows and loves: his parents, his rank, and Methian.</description>

  <description>Kevin Flaherty’s life really sucks. He’s already been laid off from his job, compelled to sell his motorcycle, and now faces eviction from his apartment. Things can hardly get worse. Now, forced to work a low-paying job at a car wash and barely surviving, Kevin is too embarrassed to even tell his friends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hotshot lawyer, Michael Bennett, comes into the car wash to have his Maserati cleaned. Kevin knows Michael well. When Kevin was fifteen, an openly gay twenty-one-year-old Michael was Kevin’s dream. But when the teenaged Kevin made his move, Michael rejected the young man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nine years have passed and Michael is surprised how attracted he is to Kevin. He soon takes him out, then takes him home. This time the beautiful man is not too young. When he learns of Kevin’s situation, a smitten Michael makes it his job to clean up the disaster that Kevin’s life has become. But his take-charge, bossy way irritates a sensitive Kevin, who starts a fight, ending in the breakup of their budding relationship. A breakup neither of them really wanted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they repair their fractured relationship or will their differences and hurt feelings keep them apart for good?</description>

  <description>Lillyport House was one of Britain's most haunted residences. Originally home to Viscount Eldon Davenport, one of history's most controversial poets, the house was sold by Davenport's parents after he was found dead of a gunshot to the head, the pistol that killed him in his hand. Reclusive painter Cameron McKenzie is the latest owner of Lillyport, and he doesn't believe in ghosts, at least until he accidentally raises Eldon from the dead. Enter parapsychologist Malcolm and psychic Trudy, each with their own agendas. Malcolm wishes to sever the link between Cameron and Eldon, while Trudy is attempting to keep them together. Will she be able to unravel Lillyport's secrets or does the answer to Eldon's survival depend on Cameron, a painting, and a guilt-ridden 19th century stable boy?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mélusine — a city of secrets and lies, pleasure and pain, magic and corruption — and destinies lost and found.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Felix Harrowgate is a dashing, highly respected wizard. But his aristocratic peers don't know his dark past — how his abusive former master enslaved him, body and soul, and trained him to pass as a nobleman. Within the walls of the Mirador — Melusine's citadel of power and wizardry — Felix believed he was safe. He was wrong. Now, the horrors of his previous life have found him and threaten to destroy all he has since become. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mildmay the Fox is used to being hunted. Raised as a kept-thief and trained as an assassin, he escaped his Keeper long ago and lives on his own as a cat burglar. But now he has been caught by a mysterious foreign wizard using a powerful calling charm. And yet the wizard was looking not for Mildmay — but for Felix Harrowgate." Thrown together by fate, the broken wizard Felix and the wanted killer Mildmay journey far from Melusine through lands thick with strange magics and terrible demons of darkness. But it is the shocking secret from their pasts, linking them inexorably together, that will either save them, or destroy them.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; This edition is no longer available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah Carver is a Marine Staff Sergeant and veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan. After one scorching night with his former Platoon Commander, Kellan Reynolds, Jonah lost touch with him and has regretted it ever since. When an investigation into government corruption and the murder of U.S. troops ends in the killing of a V.I.P. on Jonah's watch, the FBI arrive to take over and see the investigation through. With them, is Kellan Reynolds. Once more in each other's company, the sparks fly, just like they did before. Jonah begins to believe in second chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is very quite that easy, though. The subjects of the investigation will stop at nothing to bring it to an end. Jonah must keep everyone in his charge alive while he helps the FBI and Kellan find the proof they need to put a stop to the corruption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kellan is kidnapped by the subjects of the investigation, Jonah has to find him and rescue him. If he doesn't, not only might the investigation unravel, but he'll lose Kellan for a second time...this time, for good.</description>

  <description>For eighteen years, Nathan Truman and Quinn Anders were best friends. One born of wealth and privilege, the other born to working people, Nathan and Quinn shared everything. Sports, music, first kiss, first love. &lt;br&gt;For sixteen years, Nathan has tried to forget Quinn. Tried to forget the stolen moments they’d shared as kids. He joined the Marines, married, not once but twice, went into law enforcement. He forgot. &lt;br&gt;For sixteen years, Quinn couldn’t stop remembering. He fell into addiction, found music, lost himself, and became a country music superstar. He never forgot.&lt;br&gt;Sixteen years after their one night together, tragedy conspires to reunite them. &lt;br&gt;The murder of Quinn’s father sets them on a collision course not only with their past but with a killer. Nathan and Quinn struggle to deal with their past while the present slowly crashes around them. Brought together by grief, their tentative new beginning may very well come to a sizzling end, leaving them both out in the cold forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: May contain subject matter sensitive readers will find objectionable. Male/male sexual situations. Anal sex. Violence.</description>

  <description>Neil Affleck is working in the Highlands of Scotland, researching his doctorate on wolves in myth and folklore. The solitude gives him time and space to get over the shock of having been duped by fraudster Phillip, who he met on an Internet dating site. His peace is disturbed when he finds a young, half-naked man in the grounds of his cottage, unconscious and covered in cuts and bruises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan Grayling is an outcast from his pack, defeated in a fight for dominance by his brother Lennox, the new alpha wolf. Driven by the impulses of a strange new male he scents on the wind, he makes his way to Neil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their attraction is strong, the sex wild, but werewolves mate for life. Can broken-hearted Neil learn to trust this feral stranger, and what will happen when he learns that another wolf lives in this environment – a wolf who has a plan to make Neil his?</description>

  <description>Stewart Folger lives in the Appalachian Mountains, where people take care of their family and follow the Bible. He feels that Appalachian pull in his blood, but that hasn’t tamed his wild side. A youth full of pranks left him with the nickname Stunt and a preference for danger in and out of bed. Other than a few contrary moonshiners who hate him for philosophical reasons since he’s a forestry technician and federal employee, he doesn’t have a problem in the world. Then one day he runs into Alex Soto, a man out for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just out of prison, Alex knows firsthand that the justice system doesn’t treat poor and rich equally, so he’ll have to go outside the law to avenge his brother’s death. When an innocent man lands in the middle of his plans, he doesn't know what to do… other than take him hostage. Unfortunately, he never planned on having to deal with Stunt or with the twisted logic that passes for reasonable in Stunt’s mountain home.</description>

  <description>Due to heavy subject matter, this book is recommended for ages 17+. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the USA Today Best Selling Author of A Beautiful Lie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison Snow is your typical teenager. She has a family that loves her, friends that make her laugh, and she's wrapped up in the excitement of graduating high school and going off to college to pursue her dream of becoming an author. When her mother, who also happens to be Addison's best friend, dies unexpectedly, her world comes to a crashing halt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Death changes everyone... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make the pain go away, Addison and her father travel down separate, dark paths. She chooses to end her grief forever, while he drowns his sorrows in the bottom of a bottle. How do you learn to live again when the most important person in your life is gone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison struggles to pick up the pieces of her life. Instead of getting back to being the carefree teenager she once was, she's stuck handling all of the responsibilities that should have been her father's. She has no time to grieve, no time for emotions, and no time for happiness...until Zander Reinhardt walks in. All it takes is one little handwritten note on a napkin to kick-start her back to life and help her realize that maybe there's more to that life than pain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can it really be that simple? Can she really trust this man who makes her feel alive again for the first time in a year?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;We’d both gone missing at one point, but Claire had one thing I didn’t. Someone to notice. So why was I the one still here and she the one still gone?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen year old Megan Smith has spent the past year working in a small town diner in the middle of nowhere. Life is quiet, simple, &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;. Then comes the news that her look-a-like has gone missing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still damaged both physically and mentally, Megan's not looking to be noticed. Wherever she goes from here, it's a road she needs to take alone. But when Nickolas Ellis takes the job as the new nightshift cook, it scares her how easily her defenses crumble down, down, down for him. But there are secrets she can't bear to share with just anyone, unspeakable acts that continue to haunt, and when the similarities of Claire’s abduction couples with the fear of an unwanted visitor in town, the urge to run before it all happens again intensifies, threatening the only happiness Megan's ever found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Romantic Suspense / Dark Realistic Fiction&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended for 17+ for mature and &lt;u&gt;disturbing situations&lt;/u&gt;, language and &lt;u&gt;sexual content&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Book one in the Alliance Series Retribution: Is love worth the cost? Rave Anders lost everything - his job, his lover, and part of his soul. Accused of a crime he didn't commit, it's taken him years to build up a respectable intergalactic transport business. Pulled into a web of intrigue and espionage, Rave is forced to face ex-lover Kain Sims, the one man he no longer trusts. On a mission for the Alliance, Kain must convince Rave the fate of a world rests in both their hands. Kain needs Rave to help to destroy a deadly weapon before it can be used to eradicate a planet. But that's the easy part; the hard part is making Rave believe he never wanted to leave him in the first place. Can they save a world and reclaim the love they once shared, in a galaxy of deception?</description>

  <description>More than anything, Joel wants to be a Rithmatist. Chosen by the Master in a mysterious inception ceremony, Rithmatists have the power to infuse life into two-dimensional figures known as Chalklings. Rithmatists are humanity’s only defense against the Wild Chalklings — merciless creatures that leave mangled corpses in their wake. Having nearly overrun the territory of Nebrask, the Wild Chalklings now threaten all of the American Isles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the son of a lowly chalkmaker at Armedius Academy, Joel can only watch as Rithmatist students study the magical art that he would do anything to practice. Then students start disappearing — kidnapped from their rooms at night, leaving trails of blood. Assigned to help the professor who is investigating the crimes, Joel and his friend Melody find themselves on the trail of an unexpected discovery — one that will change Rithmatics — and their world — forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bestselling author Brandon Sanderson brings his unique brand of epic storytelling to the teen audience with an engrossing tale of danger and suspense—the first of a series. With his trademark skills in world-building, Sanderson has created a magic system that is so inventive and detailed that that readers who appreciate games of strategy and tactics just may want to bring Rithmatics to life in our world.</description>

  <description>They had this thing. When neither was in a relationship, they… visited. With sex. And booze or the big game, and laughing together. But mostly sex. There was something easy and safe about going to bed with a man you trusted with your back during the day, trusted to save your life and get you back out of a burning building no matter what.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what happens when Colton and Ry start to realize maybe they're more serious than they thought? How do they handle the next step—and Colt's angry ex?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;Jayne Cobb, of Firefly fame, struck me as a man deep in the closet, striving to be hyper masculine, and completely misogynistic, simply to hide his attraction to men. I’m thinking Kinsey three or four. This would also explain his extreme dislike of the shy Dr Simon (who we now know was played by a gay man).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’d love to see a post Serenity, space opera treatment of someone like Jayne’s self-realization. Now what would be his type… hmmm… what man would finally drive him wild enough to face up to his repressed desires. It should include all of the attendant emotional turmoil (inside monologue) of someone with his low IQ and high survival instincts, and yet include the outside language of someone who was trained to say as much with as few words as possible. This man has depth, but the waters are pretty murky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyone take the challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;The original request included a promotional shot of Jayne Cobb, a character from Firefly. He is gruff with a face shadowed by stubble, and he is crouched and holding a gun. The request wanted “a man deep in the closet, striving to be hyper-masculine, and completely misogynistic, simply to hide his attraction to men.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;We’ve hated each other for three years. Since we were supposed to be rivals and everyone expected us to fight, we just did it. But then we met under completely unexpected circumstances and realized that neither of us is the prick we thought the other one was. Eventually, we became friends and now I cannot imagine a life without him. Just a few people know that we only fight for publicity now and actually like each other very much.&lt;br&gt;But during our last “fight” something went awfully wrong. He grabbed me in front of the cameras and kissed me! And I liked it! Now, everyone asks me if we are gay or if that was some kind of prank. But I really don’t know! I need to talk to him but he doesn’t react to my phone calls. The only thing I know is that I don’t want to lose him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two men stand whisper-close, one second from a kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

Under different circumstances, she would enjoy the situation immensely, but her captor isn't interested in play. Or pity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the reality of her impending peril unfolds, Nora becomes Scheherazade, buying each hour of her life with stories-sensual tales of Søren, Kingsley and Wesley, each of whom has tempted and tested and tortured her in his own way. This, Nora realizes, is her life: nothing so simple, so vanilla, as a mere love triangle for her. It's a knot in a silken cord, a tangled mass of longings of the body and the heart and the mind. And it may unravel at any moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in Nora's world, no one is ever truly powerless-a cadre of her friends, protectors and lovers stands ready to do anything to save her, even when the only certainty seems to be sacrifice and heartbreak....</description>

  <description>Gabrielle Willis is smart.  She's funny.  And oh yes, she's a bit klutzy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gabrielle left sunny California bound for the energy of Manhattan, she was willingly leaving the life she had known for the new life she would create.  But was she really leaving something behind or was she running away?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the outside, Gabrielle Willis has it all under control.  A new life in Manhattan, a great roommate, and a good job.  But she is haunted.  Haunted by a memory she's tried to forget and by a family who's abandoned her.  But what happens when what's on the outside is only an illusion and in perfect contradiction to what's buried deep within?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Dane Rhodes.  He's gorgeous, smart, and sexy as hell.  Just what Gabby wants, or so she thinks.  But when she meets Brad Dixon, the sweet guy with the crooked smile, he begins to make her see that the very thing she is trying to run from is the very thing that just may push her to see the light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**New Adult Contemporary Romance. Due to language &amp;amp; sexual content, this book is recommended for readers 17 &amp;amp; older**</description>

  <description>Since the day he was dropped off at a Federation camp by parents who used him to gain political favor, cybernetic killing machine Soldier Fourteen existed only to carry out his orders. But when commanded to kill a baby girl, he defies his commander and deserts the Federation, seeking a place in the universe for himself and the defenseless innocent he’s promised to protect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;This man is a protector, a fierce and rugged man with a checkered past and an absent family… and yet he holds our new daughter with such tenderness and care. He loves my entire clan of a family nearly as much as he loves me, and despite his horrid birth family, he has become the brother, the son, the cousin, the uncle that they never knew they were missing.&lt;br&gt;He loves us all, and protects us all… even when the proverbial s*$% hits the fan.&lt;br&gt;Please tell our story, how he came to be so gentle and loving of my family, OUR family, yet can be so fierce, so distant, from the rest of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A sepia tone photograph shows a handsome man, bare-chested, who sits cradling a baby in both hands. He has short hair and a muscled body, and he gazes adoringly at the baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>The spell was simple …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CRUENTUS PROTECTUM. Defend the Blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what do you do if your blood is your enemy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victoria Warrick has always known she was different. An outcast at school, she is no stranger to adversity. But when she receives an old journal for her seventeenth birthday, nothing prepares her for the dark secrets it holds—much less one that reveals she’s a witch with unimaginable power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s more, when she meets the dazzling but enigmatic Christian Devereux, she has no idea how much her life is about to change. Enemies will hunt her. Friends will turn on her. The terrible curse that makes her blood run black will stop at nothing to control her. And Christian has a sinister secret of his own …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without knowing whom to trust, can Victoria survive her blood’s deadly desires?

  <description>Former model Brent Phillips now works the other side of the camera. He makes his money on senior portraits but wants to create an art exhibition. His only problems are lack of a central image and a three-week deadline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Brent’s friends, who resolve to discover the perfect model for his project. They find him in Tristan Greer, a college student who left home after coming out and is trying to make ends meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though initially reluctant, Tristan agrees to work with Brent to capture the image Brent wants—a gay version of Herb Alpert’s Whipped Cream album photo. It turns out the camera loves Tristan, and the photographer may as well.</description>

  <description>Struggling to put her life back together after a tragic mountaineering accident kills her college sweetheart, twenty-one-year-old Holly Treadwell is trying to set aside her grief, forge ahead in school, and find herself again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carter Hansen, a guy who brings back horrible memories from the night of the accident, finds his way back into her life, Holly’s unsure if she should let him in. He terrifies her in more ways than one and invokes feelings in her that she thought were buried forever. Regardless of her fears, she knows she must face him in order for her heart to heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone tells Carter that what happened on the mountain that night was just a terrible accident, but even then, he can’t help but carry around the guilt and is unable to forgive himself. He’s drawn to Holly and being near her helps ease his conscience and gives him the release he needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Holly and Carter’s relationship grows, they begin to realize that the more time they spend with one another, the more their wounds begin to heal—her grief and his guilt. But when Holly learns the details about the night of the accident—what everyone has been keeping from her—it will rip open old wounds and tear apart what they’ve both worked so hard to overcome…</description>

  <description>Kit Mason works at Eddy’s, a boutique where the clothes are chic, the paycheck’s weak, and Kit has no qualms about snagging rich older men looking to pay for play. When Cory St. James walks in, he checks all Kit’s boxes: he’s middle-aged, the entrepreneur of a pharmaceutical company, and already has a kept boy at home—what’s one more? Kit sets out to seduce Cory and bulldozes through his denials, but when Cory finally gives in, his lover, Sasha, catches them with their pants down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sasha isn’t the pampered toy Kit expected. In fact, Kit may have misjudged him. And the consequences that ensue when Sasha catches Kit and Cory together leave him alone. Unwilling to be weighed down by guilt, Kit decides to look after Sasha himself, even if Sasha can’t stand the sight of him and there are a few things about Kit's past he doesn't want Sasha to know. But Kit isn't willing to do all the work when it comes to forcing Sasha to rebuild his life. It’s a slow process of growing trust and learning to stand on their own—and together.</description>

  <description>Emerson Blackburn really screwed up this time. He's finally pissed off Jonah, the sweet, patient, funny boyfriend he's loved as long as he can remember, to the point that Jonah isn't even speaking to him. Emerson hasn't felt this awful since the summer after graduation when Jonah ruined their college plans by running off on a cross-country trip without even saying goodbye. Jonah isn't just angry. He's furious and hurt. Devastated, even, because he's completely in love with Emerson, but although they've been together for a year, Emerson still doesn't trust him. The full weight of their past mistakes drags Jonah and Emerson into memories of happier-and lonelier-times, but wallowing in their guilt isn't solving the problems. The only way to move forward is to learn from the past... but someone still has to be the first to apologize.</description>

  <description>Ingram is a coward and weakling—at least according to his father, the king, and the royal court. He cannot use a sword, he faints at the sight of blood, and even his brilliant abilities as a strategist are not enough to overcome his failings. When his father loses a bet to the notorious Lord Mallory over the matter of a dragon slaying, he pays his debt by ordering Ingram to marry him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then his father reveals that he is putting Ingram to a greater purpose, giving Ingram one last chance to prove he is not worthless. All it requires is betraying his new husband.</description>

  <description>Sun. Sand. Sex. Icaria has it all and Kent is taking advantage of every single bit of it. His holiday passes in a blur of bright days and hot men until he meets the man who rules them all. Stavros Laskaris owns most of Icaria and when Kent catches his attention, he becomes one more thing to posses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot Greek summer vacation takes a dark turn when it turns out that Stavros isn't planning on letting him leave Icaria. From sexual confidante to prisoner of a man beyond the law – even the laws of nature, Kent find himself in a whole new world, a world where he is bound to a man who forces him to recognize his true nature and wolf form. Kent must learn to submit to his alpha, or pay the price for being a disobedient whelp.</description>

  <description>THE STORY YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kyle Calloway died, he took a part of Nell with him. She wasn’t the only one left to pick up the pieces, however; Kyle’s death left a gaping hole in the hearts and lives of his parents and his older brother Colton, and ultimately broke the will of the girl he loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE STORY YOU NEVER IMAGINED...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becca de Rosa is Nell’s best friend. When Kyle died, Nell was so devastated that no one could reach her, not even her best friend Becca. As she tries to help Nell through her grief, Becca’s own life is thrust into turmoil, and everything she knows is changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Dorsey asked Nell out the week after her sixteenth birthday, but that date never happened. Instead, he ended up going out with Nell’s best friend, Becca. He had no way of knowing, then, how that one date would send him on a life-long journey with Becca. He had no way of knowing the tragedies and triumphs he would experience, or that in Becca, he might find the love of a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE HEARTACHE YOU’LL NEVER FORGET...</description>

  <description>New Adult. MA 17+ Content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Kylie’s dad dies in a freak accident, he leaves her with nothing other than her crazy step-mother, Darla, and the ability to play guitar. When Darla kicks Kylie out and she loses her job all in the same day, she hops a bus to Nashville determined to make her late father’s dreams come true. Waitressing and saving her pennies to record a demo, her big break comes when she’s asked to join a tour going down the tubes with once platinum album-selling country music superstar Trace Corbin. But touring with Trace is hardly a dream come true since he’s pretty much drinking his career down the drain. If Kylie can’t pull Trace out of his rut, he’ll pull her and her dreams down with him.</description>

  <description>We all dream about getting that phone call or e-mail from someone we used to love, apologizing for their bad behavior.  A soured affair with his college boyfriend, Elgin, set Theo on the path to promiscuity, and he’s only recently yearned to settle down – with Jack, his boyfriend of two years.  But Jack recently asked for a break, and while Theo is worrying about what this means, he gets a three-page correspondence from Elgin. How will Theo respond to Elgin's approach, and what will it mean for his relationship with Jack?</description>

But when an accident takes Tim from Sebastian, the lone wolf is thrown into aimless wandering that leads him to a new pack-and another shifter, Eshan Low. But Eshan has a troubled past, and despite his hopes and wishes, that past has a steel grip. Embroiled in a fight for justice, Sebastian is willing to do anything not to lose another mate, and just this once, luck might smile his way.</description>

  <description>Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A groundbreaking work from a master, &lt;em&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/em&gt; is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.</description>

  <description>Welcome to the South - where the tea is sweet and the accents are sweeter. This Southern way of life is all Charlie has ever known.  It’s not until she loses the only person who pushed her to break free of the Southern Belle mold that she starts living the life she needs and not the life her parents forced on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jhett has lived on the edge for as long as he could remember - constantly teetering back and forth between being a rock star and living a normal life.  His rebellious and sometimes arrogant attitude is known to get him into trouble, especially with the girls who hang on his every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie never thought that a trip to pack up her brother’s apartment would leave her feeling even more unsettled about the grainy details of her brother’s death.  Her quest for information leads her straight to his old hangout and into arms of Jhett, who suspiciously knows more about her situation than he ever should. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a few questions remain - Can you trust someone based on their word alone? And if you make a promise, how far will you go to keep it?</description>

  <description>Richard Papen arrived at Hampden College in New England and was quickly seduced by an elite group of five students, all Greek scholars, all worldly, self-assured, and, at first glance, all highly unapproachable. As Richard is drawn into their inner circle, he learns a terrifying secret that binds them to one another...a secret about an incident in the woods in the dead of night where an ancient rite was brought to brutal life...and led to a gruesome death. And that was just the beginning....</description>

  <description>Love, jealousy, rejection, violence, goal-scoring, duct tape, and explosive devices… just a part of daily life at Stockborough Rovers Football Club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billy Logan, star striker for the British Premier League football club, has everything a young man could want—except a life. And then handsome Spanish top-club player Adriano Márquez is signed to Stockborough and Billy’s life is turned upside down and every way around. It’s love at first sight, and amazingly it turns out to be the same for Adriano.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But given the nature of their profession, admitting to their love affair is not an option, until a spoiled contest winner forces the issue in a spectacular fashion and Billy has to save the day. But there is another lurking problem for the star-crossed lovers…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bitter Tommy Horton idolizes Billy and has been stalking him. Fantasies of sex with the footballer grow in strength until he’s driven to declare his adoration but when he discovers Billy and Adriano’s love affair, Tommy goes off the rails and hatches a plot to get his revenge on both men—and he’s not planning a love pat… Oh hickory dickory dock, he’s not!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The first installment in this fierce and sensual new paranormal romance series features demonic gladiators, ruthless mafia villains, and a proud race on the brink of extinction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, Audrey MacLaren chose to marry her human lover, making her an exile from the Dragon Kings, an ancient race of demons once worshiped as earthly gods. Audrey and her husband managed to conceive, and their son is the first natural-born Dragon King in a generation—which makes him irresistible to the sadistic scientist whose mafia-funded technology allows demon procreation. In the year since her husband was murdered, Audrey and her little boy have endured hideous experiments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shackled with a collar and bound for life, Leto Garnis is a Cage warrior. Only through combat can Dragon Kings earn the privilege of conceiving children. Leto uses his superhuman speed and reflexes to secure the right for his two sisters to start families. After torture reveals Audrey’s astonishing pyrokenesis, she is sent to fight in the Cages. If she survives a year, she will be reunited with her son. Leto is charged with her training. Initially, he has no sympathy for her plight. But if natural conception is possible, what has he been fighting for? As enemies, sparring partners, lovers, and eventual allies, Leto and Audrey learn that in a violent underground world, love is the only prize worth winning.</description>

  <description>Druid Atticus O’Sullivan hasn’t stayed alive for more than two millennia without a fair bit of Celtic cunning. So when vengeful thunder gods come Norse by Southwest looking for payback, Atticus, with a little help from the Navajo trickster god Coyote, lets them think that they’ve chopped up his body in the Arizona desert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the mischievous Coyote is not above a little sleight of paw, and Atticus soon finds that he’s been duped into battling bloodthirsty desert shapeshifters called skinwalkers. Just when the Druid thinks he’s got a handle on all the duplicity, betrayal comes from an unlikely source. If Atticus survives this time, he vows he won’t be fooled again. Famous last words.</description>

  <description>After twelve years of secret training, Atticus O’Sullivan is finally ready to bind his apprentice, Granuaile, to the earth and double the number of Druids in the world. But on the eve of the ritual, the world that thought he was dead abruptly discovers that he’s still alive, and they would much rather he return to the grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having no other choice, Atticus, his trusted Irish wolfhound, Oberon, and Granuaile travel to the base of Mount Olympus, where the Roman god Bacchus is anxious to take his sworn revenge—but he’ll have to get in line behind an ancient vampire, a band of dark elves, and an old god of mischief, who all seem to have KILL THE DRUID at the top of their to-do lists.</description>

  <description>Gage Synclair, international, hard-hitting investigative photojournalist, is preparing for the final special report of his career…a story of deception and murder six long years in the making. And after ten years in some of the worst parts of the world, he’s ready to settle life down and open an art gallery in his hometown of Chicago. The only thing getting in his way, he needs to find a competent electrician to finish the job before his grand opening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trent Cooper, electrical contractor, is surprised by the last minute request for a fast-paced electrical remodel, wanting nothing more than to get his foot in the door with Layne Construction. Being gay in the construction industry isn’t easy, nor is being father to his two young adopted children. Trent keeps his life in separate zones to avoid a short circuit. But when the gallery owner propositions him on the first day, Trent can’t help but think his worlds are a little too close for comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will their high-voltage passion spark everlasting love or will their lives break the circuit between them forever?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"The last of your line will be in the embrace of a dragon."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aric, Crown Prince of Astria, has been brought up to believe that all dragons are evil. But when he speaks with one, he finds himself questioning those beliefs. The dragon tells him to find a sword in Sherwin Forest to save not only his kingdom but also his sister, Georgia, who must otherwise wed the prince of a neighboring kingdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the start of his quest, Aric dons a disguise and meets Denys, an archer and herbalist who lives alone at the edge of the forest. Denys agrees to guide Aric into the forest, but then Georgia appears, revealing Aric’s true identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Aric learns he is not the only one keeping secrets. Denys has a few of his own that could change both of their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Blake Davis is in the closet. And he’s going to stay that way. Because if his father finds out he’s gay, Blake could lose everything he’s worked so hard to achieve during the last six years as CEO of Trinity Publishing, the fastest rising star in the publishing firmament. Not that coming out wouldn’t solve a couple of problems. Maybe then his father would stop trying to set him up with yet another empty-headed, social-climbing girlfriend. And better still, Blake could stop using that escort agency when he wants a night of hot sex with a cute guy…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Parkinson has had a tough life so far, but he’s back on his feet. Okay, so he’s working as an escort – with ‘benefits’– to pay off his student loans, but that does have its advantages, such as the really hot guy who hired him. Yeah, Blake rocked his world last night – several  times. So imagine how Will feels when he arrives to be interviewed for his dream job as PA in a publishing company, and the guy who’s hiring is….. Blake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then things get really complicated….</description>

  <description>Fearless, smoking hot, and single: meet the Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel. These firemen might be heroes, but it's their bad luck in love that makes them legendary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;News producer Melissa McGuire and Fire Captain Harry Brody couldn't be more different, though they do have one thing in common: they're both convinced they're perfectly wrong for each other. But when Melissa's matchmaking grandmother wins her a date with Brody at a Bachelor auction . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparks fly. Passion flares. Heat rises. (You get the picture.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add a curse, a conniving nightly news anchor, a stunningly handsome daredevil fireman, a brave little boy, a couple of exes, and one giant fire to the mix, and Melissa and Brody's love may not be the only thing that burns.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;First I didn’t see the body through all the rain and darkness but when I drew near I saw him. Thought he was dead with all the blood. But he wasn’t and I considered for a moment to end the job because really… it would have been a mercy kill. He wouldn’t survive those injuries and even if he did he would be a vegetable. I mean… look at that head wound!&lt;br&gt;But something in the way he was dumped on the back of my property in his ripped police uniform and the word FAG scrawled on his chest made me help him.&lt;br&gt;So now I’m here. His guardian angel, kind of ironic considering what I did in the past. I watch over his recovery, standing in the shadows where no one can see me. &lt;br&gt;The docs don’t think he will ever walk or speak again. The massive head trauma caused too much damage but I think he has a strong will. I saw his eyes. There is still life and reason in him. And I will help him to get back on his feet and will wait for the day when he thanks me with his own voice. As soon as he’s strong enough I’ll bring him home with me where he can heal because he has no one else.&lt;br&gt;And after that? I’m going after those fuckers who tried to off him. Because they know he is still alive…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the center of the photo is a dark-haired man sitting, head down, with his arms around his knees. Behind him is another man, blond and muscular, with his arms wrapped completely around the other man’s body. Their faces are hidden, but the impression is one of protectiveness and affection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>Stalking and restraining orders are a thing of Alayna Wither’s past. With her MBA newly in hand, she has her future figured out—move up at the nightclub she works at and stay away from any guy who might trigger her obsessive love disorder. A perfect plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what Alayna didn’t figure on is Hudson Pierce, the new owner of the nightclub. He’s smart, rich, and gorgeous—the kind of guy Alayna knows to stay away from if she wants to keep her past tendencies in check. Except, Hudson’s fixed his sights on her. He wants her in his bed and makes no secret of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avoiding him isn’t an option after he offers a business proposition she can’t turn down and she’s drawn further into his universe, unable to resist his gravitational pull. When she learns Hudson has a dark history of his own, she realizes too late that she’s fallen for the worst man she could possibly get involved with. Or maybe their less than ideal pasts give them an opportunity to heal each other and finally find the love their lives have been missing.</description>

One night together only made it worse. After seducing Akira, it became apparent that their love affair was hopelessly one-sided, and heartbroken, Lana fled her beloved island paradise.&lt;br&gt;Eight years later, Lana finally returns home, planning to stay briefly, and only for business, but her plans go quickly awry when she runs into the man she could never get over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At just under 34,000 words, this story is a novella. &lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18+</description>

  <description>Chad is a detective in a college town plagued by a serial killer who is targeting gay couples in BDSM relationships. His chief asks the handsome young officer to pose as the submissive partner in one such relationship to attract the killer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dom, a gorgeous college professor agrees to the charade, but warns Chad he will have to strictly obey him when they play in the clubs, or when they interact with his friends at his home. His friends know him to be a strong, experienced Dom and won't be fooled easily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to pull it off, Chad will have to be trained properly, and this will challenge all he knows about himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As his barriers break down and he finds out what it means to be submissive, he learns to love his place at his Dom's feet, not realizing he's attracting the notice of a savage killer.</description>

Now, she turns her "impressive" talents to a novel of modern romance - and breathless intrigue...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been years since her child's father dumped her, and since then Kara McMillan has kept men at bay - although every day she aches more for a lover's touch.  But to get that, the hard-boiled journalist must become vulnerable - a feeling she vowed never to have again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his dangerous good looks, charm, and power, Senator Reece Sheridan could have just about any woman he sets his piercing eyes on.  But he's intrigued by only one.  This Kara, this gutsy investigative reporter, has a sensuality that arouses him to no end.  If she's a firebrand in print, he guesses, she must be just as fiery in bed...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this is no fling.  A sudden political scandal - and attempts on Kara's life - could very well drive them apart.  Or maybe, just maybe, adversity could draw them into a bond even more intense than their steamy sexual embraces.</description>

  <description>The Shadow Worlds are dying. Can two sworn enemies manage to get past their differences and ignore their burning attraction to each other long enough to save them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brandon is a Weaver, a member of an old, powerful race. His discovery that Master Weavers are disappearing, presumed murdered, is a shock. Even more so when he realises that the person responsible is not actually a person at all, but a Revenant, and worse, the creature also known as the Abomination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things are not quite how they seem, however.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaime is a Revenant, a creature born from death and designed to do his Master's bidding. He's been living in the shadows for years. Now, the Shadow Worlds are dying, Weavers are disappearing, and Jamie is no longer the only Revenant to survive their Master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can these two men ignore the hatred, and the passion, that burns between them, and work together to find out just what is happening to the Universe around them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They must uncover age old secrets of the Weavers, and defeat enemies who are closer to them than they'd realised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;** Reader Advisory: This book contains scenes of non-consensual sex including the account of a gang-rape, not intended for titillation. **</description>

  <description>Dallas, along with a few friends, is attending a singing contest to cheer on a friend who is a drag performer. Except he falls in utter lust with the hostess of the club, Peter, AKA Pepper Prince. Finagling a date, they spend hours talking into the night and Dallas gets a second date. Even though they're hitting it off, Peter is skeptical of Dallas' honesty and acceptance of Pepper's inclusion in his private and professional life. Can romance win the heart of a man who's been hurt in the past for simply being the person he is? History says no, but Dallas isn't like anyone Peter knows, and is determined to prove it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story is also available in Mixed Tape Series Volume #2.</description>

  <description>No one told Trey Grey that life could be dark and unpredictable. With the death of his father when he was eight, his mother’s departure from Earth on a syringe full of Heroin and the brutal abuse of his stepfather, Trey learned these lessons all too well on his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now at twenty years of age, he is nearing the completion of his accounting degree and can finally glimpse the end of his life as a prostitute, the only profession he has ever known. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wracked by nightmares of Willie’s years of abuse, and controlled by severe obsessive-compulsive disorders as a result, he seems to have a tentative handle on his own life. That is, as long as he keeps a death-grip and no one touches his Camaro, kitten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even the best laid plans can be torn to gory bits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His savior comes in the unlikely form of a spiky-haired blond named Justin, after a night of drunken debauchery that neither of them seems able to forget. Justin might just need Trey as much as Trey needs him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trey travels through his fearscapes and begins to find his own forgiveness, but at what cost to the manic-depressive Justin? Will they be able to live through the trauma of each other’s lives and find their own version of normal?</description>

  <description>The Good Guy: Haint-working runs in Dan Miller’s blood. Not everyone can help the restless dead cross over, especially when the haunting threatens the Living. But the death of his parents six years ago forced Dan to give it up in exchange for raising his brother and sister, all the while struggling to keep their rural NC farm afloat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when the flamboyantly goth Leif Helsvin shows up on Dan’s doorstep looking for help with an evil necromancer named Runar, Dan’s first instinct is to turn him down. With two teenagers to look after, he’s already got all the trouble he can handle. Besides, the sexy Leif is too much of a temptation, and Dan is firmly in the closet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bad Boy: Pierced, tattooed Leif never has sex with the same guy twice. It keeps things simple, especially since his oath to stop Runar has him constantly drifting from one town to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this time, it looks like Leif is going to need help, in the form of the very down-to-earth Dan. Since Nice Guys are off the menu, Leif just has to keep his hands to himself for as long as it will take to stop Runar’s latest scheme. But as Leif finds himself drawn deeper into Dan’s life, he quickly realizes he’s not just in danger of breaking the rules, but breaking his heart as well.</description>

  <description>Ever since he’d been part of the pot in a high-stakes poker game, elfin outcast Kai Gracen figured he’d used up any good karma he had when Dempsey, a human Stalker, won the hand and took him in. Following the violent merge of Earth and Underhill, the human and elfin races were left with a messy, monster-ridden world and Stalkers were often the only cavalry willing to ride to someone’s rescue when something shadowy and dark moved into the neighbourhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There certainly were no shortage of monsters or people stupidly willing to become lunch for one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a hard life but one Kai liked. And he was good at it. Killing monsters was easy. Especially since he was one himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an accident retired Dempsey out, Kai set up permanent shop in San Diego, contracting out to the local SoCalGov depot. It was a decent life, filled with bounty, a few friends and most importantly, no other elfin around to remind him he wasn’t really human. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was until a sidhe lord named Ryder arrives in San Diego and Kai is conscripted to do a job for Ryder’s fledgling Dawn Court. It was supposed to a simple run; head up the coast during dragon-mating season to retrieve a pregnant human woman seeking sanctuary with the new Court then back to San Diego. Easy, quick and best of all, profitable. But Ryder’s “simple” run leads to massive trouble and Kai ends up being caught in the middle of a deadly bloodline feud he has no hope of escaping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one ever got rich by being a Stalker. But then hardly any of them got old either. The way things were looking, it didn’t look like Kai was going to be the exception.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note: This is an alternate cover edition, asin:B00AUV1R42&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years before Trip Wiley could be seen on movie screens all over the world, he could be seen sitting in the desk behind me in my high school English class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was back in 1990, and I cite the year only to avoid dumbfounding you when references to big hair or stretch pants are mentioned. Although, come to think of it, I am from New Jersey, which may serve as explanation enough. We were teenagers then, way back in a time before anyone could even dream he’d turn into the Hollywood commodity that he is today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case you live under a rock and don't know who Trip Wiley is, just know that these days, he’s the actor found at the top of every casting director’s wish list. He’s incredibly talented and insanely gorgeous, the combination of which has made him very rich, very famous and very desirable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And not just to casting directors, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can’t confirm any of the gossip from his early years out in Tinseltown, but based on what I knew of his life before he was famous, I can tell you that the idea of Girls-Throwing-Themselves-At-Trip is not a new concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should know. I was one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And my life hasn’t been the same since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Remember When is the first book in an NA romantic comedy trilogy, but there is NO CLIFFHANGER. It is intended for mature teen readers and immature adult ones due to some high school sex scenes, underage drinking, questionable language and 1980s flashbacks.**</description>

  <description>Matt Pulaski and Declan Foster are DEA agents in San Diego. When Declan nearly dies during a raid, Matt volunteers to keep an eye on his adrenalin junkie partner. Declan’s near death experience causes him to reevaluate his life. In his bucket list are some urges that he’s been suppressing. Fortunately, Matt is willing to help. Declan’s newly recognized feelings come as a surprise, and he’s pretty confused. Being a DEA agent is no walk in the park. Danger is always around the corner and bigotry doesn’t tend to be too far away even if things are changing.</description>

  <description>Theo Bourne, a powerful Phantom, has returned to Columbus to escape his past. He didn’t plan on sleeping with it. But the one-night stand he had with Carlos is proving to be unforgettable in every sense of the word, mainly because Carlos is his new partner on the Preternatural Task Force. Theo wants to put as much space between him and the very evident sexual desire he has for Carlos, so that means immersing himself in their latest case — the gruesome murder of two lycanthropes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carlos Ramirez has been pining for Theo for a very long time and he isn’t about to let him go. Theo’s heart is guarded by a protective ten-foot layer of ice, though. It’s going to take a lot of charm and a lot of coaxing for this werecoyote to melt the ice. Especially since it feels like every time he starts to warm up to his cold hearted partner, the case takes an unexpected and deadly turn.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;His deadliest enemy will become his heart’s desire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caius doesn’t feel like much of a Christian. He loves his life of learning as a monk in the far-flung stronghold of Fara, but the hot warrior blood of his chieftain father flows in his veins. Heat soothed only in the arms of his sweet-natured friend and lover, Leof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Leof is killed during a Viking raid, Cai’s grieving heart thirsts for vengeance—and he has his chance with Fenrir, a wounded young Viking warrior left for dead. But instead of reaching for a weapon, Cai finds himself defying his abbot’s orders and using his healing skills to save Fen’s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, Fen repays Cai’s kindness by attacking every Christian within reach. But as time passes, Cai’s persistent goodness touches his heart. And Cai, who had thought he would never love again, feels the stirring of a profound new attraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet old loyalties call Fen back to his tribe and a relentless quest to find the ancient secret of Fara—a powerful talisman that could render the Vikings indestructible, and tear the two lovers’ bonds beyond healing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains battles, bloodshed, explicit M/M sex, and the proper Latin term for what lies beneath those cassocks.</description>

  <description>In A World Where Everyone Kills For Money&lt;br&gt;Two People May Die For Love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassilia Abernathy is a brilliant but nerdy twenty-one year old girl living a tortured existence. Following the untimely death of her mother ten years ago, she’s been little more than a slave to her stepfather Roger, and his three daughters, Trina, Ramona, and Annalise. Although Cassilia serves them dutifully, they treat her like trash, all the while keeping a life-changing secret from her…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cody Rath is a falling star. A football player with aspirations to play professionally, his career stalled when he defeated the state’s top school. Now, the only way he can regain his status and a shot at his dreams is to essentially throw the next game against the favored opponents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this modern, adult-oriented retelling of the Cinderella story, two young adults will take on a villainous, corrupt society, one that only exists to sustain itself and cares little for those who are injured or killed. They will fight for their future, and each other, in this coming-of-age tale.</description>

  <description>Novel (50,000 words)&lt;br&gt;Genre(s): Historical Gay Erotic Romance&lt;br&gt;US Army Captain Frank Hawthorne returns to Germany, against orders, to testify at the Nuremberg trials. He’s attempting to save the life of Johann von Biehn, a former Nazi Officer. No one at the trials knows that three years ago, at the height of the war, Frank had been sent to kill the very man he is now defending—and that Johann is the love of his life. Frank must not reveal what happened between them during the war, but that leaves Frank with hardly any evidence to counter Johann's notorious career as a Nazi. (M/M - For content labels and excerpt, see details on publisher's site.)</description>

  <description>Considering she’s a girl who calculates everything, Addie Battes knew the statistical probability of being abducted in her lifetime—too bad she never analyzed the odds of falling in love with her captor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While stopping at a crowded rest area one summer night, seventeen-year-old Addie accidentally catches a truck hijacking in progress. Desperate to rid the crime of its only witness, one of the thieves kidnaps Addie. Yet surprisingly, when a renegade thief attempts to silence her for good, Addie is saved by the very man who abducted her. Now, forced on board a cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, Addie finds herself surrounded by international smugglers who want nothing more than to throw her overboard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All except the artistic and intriguing Charlie Hays, whose strange protectiveness convinces Addie to trust him, even when common sense tells her otherwise. Yet, despite her doubt, and his unrelenting temper, their relationship develops into something much more. But, Charlie’s scorned colleague has stowed away, and as he seeks revenge against his coworker, Addie and Charlie are forced to put their new love—and lives—at risk.</description>

  <description>New Adult contemporary romance. Due to sexual content and heavy subject matter, this book is intended for mature readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you’re broken, I’ll fix you…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m only twenty-one and already damaged goods. A slut. A failure. A disappointment to my picture-perfect family as long as I can remember. I called off my wedding to William Bailey, the only man who thought I was worth fixing. A year later, he’s marrying my sister. Unless I ask him not to…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If you shatter, I’ll find you…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now there’s Asher Logan, a broken man who sees the fractures in my façade and doesn’t want to fix me at all. Asher wants me to stop hiding, to stop pretending. Asher wants to break down my walls. But that means letting him see my ugly secrets and forgiving him for his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With my past weighing down on me, do I want the man who holds me together or the man who gives me permission to break?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Shades of Milk and Honey&lt;/em&gt; is an intimate portrait of Jane Ellsworth, a woman ahead of her time in a world where the manipulation of glamour is considered an essential skill for a lady of quality. But despite the prevalence of magic in everyday life, other aspects of Dorchester’s society are not that different: Jane and her sister Melody’s lives still revolve around vying for the attentions of eligible men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane resists this fate, and rightly so: while her skill with glamour is remarkable, it is her sister who is fair of face, and therefore wins the lion’s share of the attention. At the ripe old age of twenty-eight, Jane has resigned herself to being invisible forever. But when her family’s honor is threatened, she finds that she must push her skills to the limit in order to set things right--and, in the process, accidentally wanders into a love story of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This debut novel from an award-winning talent scratches a literary itch you never knew you had. Like wandering onto a secret picnic attended by &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jonathan Strange &amp;amp; Mr Norrell&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shades of Milk and Honey&lt;/em&gt; is precisely the sort of tale we would expect from Jane Austen…if only she had been a fantasy writer.</description>

  <description>In a world not unlike our own, Jerna Setiq has a perfect life, a beloved wife and two adored children, with his past desires and needs firmly put behind him. But when he's falsely accused of child abuse and imprisoned, he's cast into hell, with no apparent means of redemption, or regaining all that he's lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the most unlikely of places, in the most unpromising of circumstances, fate offers Jerna his second chance and a path to freedom. With the cruelly fascinating Tolomi, a dominant in need of education and a patient submissive, Jerna dares to satisfy the long denied passions of his dual nature - but will he risk losing what has become so dear to him, all over again? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Remastering Jerna" is a complex, erotic story of redemption, love, and the contract of trust in a relationship of control and submission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 114,879 (approximate)</description>

  <description>Dylan Gallaher is a biomechanical engineer specialising in artificial limbs - something in which he has a personal interest after losing his right hand in a motorbike accident years ago. He has a great career, a new job, and wonderful opportunities. But he's also lonely and feeling disconnected from his loved ones in a new town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's why when Max Symonds crashes into his life, Dylan welcomes the distraction. Max is fun loving, artistic and devoted to his twin brother, Toby. He thinks Dylan is attractive, and Dylan finds it hard to resist his persistent advances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Max is unaware of the dark secret behind his relationship with his brother, and Dylan must help them accommodate a strange new reality, while trying not to lose his heart in the process.</description>

  <description>In a world where paranormals are persecuted, medical researcher Jodimai hon Belwin works to find a 'cure' for paranormality so 'paras' can lead normal lives again. His society is dominated by religious bigotry as much as paranoia over paranomal abilities, so he struggles to keep his homosexuality secret for the sake of his family and his career. But unbeknownst to him, he has another secret, and when that secret is suddenly uncovered, his comfortable life comes to a horrifying end. Now his fate rests with the much-hated paranormals, and in particular, a mysterious dark-eyed man with powers Jodi can barely comprehend, and many shocking secrets of his own. Part of the 'Periter' universe, and a sequel to 'Walk a Lonesome Road', but stands alone. No previous knowledge assumed or needed.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Take me down to Vampire City...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vampires live only for lust and pleasure in the eternal twilight of Vamp City. But the city's magic is dying. The only person who can restore it? A beautiful woman from the mortal world...one who knows nothing of the power she wields.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn Lennox is searching for a missing friend when she stumbles into a dark otherworld that only she can see—and finds herself at the mercy of Arturo Mazza, a dangerously handsome vampire whose wicked kiss will save her, enslave her, bewitch her, and betray her. What Arturo can't do is forget about her—any more than Quinn can control her own feelings for him. Neither one can let desire get in the way of their mission—his to save his people, hers to save herself. But there is no escape from desire in a city built for seduction, where passion flows hot and blood-red.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Vamp City...&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She hired him to take her virginity...but now she wants even more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lori might be a popular romance writer, but she's never been anything but a flop with sex and love in her personal life. Still a virgin at twenty-six and increasingly frustrated by her inexperience, she decides to take matters into her own hands. She hires a talented, sexy male escort to take care of her inconvenient virginity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She assumes one time with Ander will be enough, but she never dreams how much pleasure he can make her feel. Once isn't nearly enough. Twice isn't enough either. Soon, she becomes one of his regular clients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lori knows that nothing would be as foolish as falling in love with her paid escort, but she's never been wise with her heart. And, despite his professionalism, he doesn't seem entirely immune either.</description>

  <description>In college, geeky med student Cole Winston fell for his best friend, Brad Kelly. The bold, brash charmer was everything Cole wasn't: confident, popular, and straight. Unfortunately Cole's secret blew up in his face, and he walked away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Years later, when Brad needs help, he calls Cole. Now a respected trauma surgeon, Cole has learned not to risk his heart and is ready to be Brad's friend again. Things go well until Brad asks Cole to be his best man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With both his parents dead, Brad never would have survived college or his brother's rounds of drug rehab without Cole. The five-year gap in their friendship was painful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now Brad's got his best friend back, a kick-ass job, and is engaged to the CEO's daughter. Life is great…until a hot encounter at his bachelor party leaves both men reeling. The sexual tension between the two is off the charts. Brad has commitments he needs to keep, but how can he go through with the wedding when he can't stop thinking about Cole?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And how can Cole stand beside his friend and watch him get married, especially now that he realizes he still loves Brad?</description>

  <description>At the Coastal Carolina Highland Games, baker Martin Fletcher receives an unexpected visitor in the form of Fergus, Lyall McLannan’s escaped sheltie. When Fergus accidentally causes Martin to sprain his ankle, Lyall comes to the rescue, helping Martin run his booth at the Games. Unfortunately, Lyall doesn’t know a thing about baking, but he manages to avoid both disaster and Martin’s wrath by attracting patrons with his and Fergus’s showmanship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Martin accepts Lyall’s invitation to stay in his RV during the fair, getting to know the lawyer-turned-Highlander he’s watched from afar. Martin is captivated by Lyall’s charm… and the tantalizing view of him in a kilt. Entranced by Martin’s dedication to his work and love for Fergus, Lyall sets out to woo him with starlight and bagpipe music, because he’s discovered opposites can attract and love can be found in the most unexpected circumstances.</description>

  <description>Novel (101,000 words)&lt;br&gt;Genre(s): Erotic Gothic, Suspense, BDSM&lt;br&gt;The House of Silence is an elite male bordello catering to the obscenely rich. No matter how extreme or mundane the fantasy, the House of Silence is rumored to serve. Master Charon employs a group of versatile, beautiful young men–some lewd, some innocent, many with tragic pasts and hidden secrets of their own–who depend on him for safety. This volatile mix erupts when danger threatens. (M/M - For content labels and excerpt, see details on publisher's site.)</description>

  <description>Recovering from a near fatal injury, vampire Harley Scott just wants some peace, quiet and a long night filled with darkness. The wilds of icy Canada sounds like the best place to make that happen-- if he can make it past blizzards, werewolves, and -- oh, yeah, a death squad of fellow vampires on his trail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story has been previously published.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Note from the author--This book is intended for a mature reading audience and isn't suitable for younger readers.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fate hasn’t always been friends with Isabelle West. In fact, fate has been a downright bitch. Isabelle has learned the hard way how hard life can be when fate isn’t by your side. It can hand you dreams on silver platters, but it can snatch them right back and hand you nightmares. One thing Isabelle knew for sure fate was consistent with was taking away everything she ever loved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the last two years Isabelle has been slowly clearing the clouds of her past. Happiness is finally on the horizon. She has a thriving business, great friends, and her life back. All she has to do is jump over the last hurdle…her ex-husband. When problems start causing her to fear her new life, and memories that are better left forgotten start rushing to the surface the last thing she needs is a ghost from her past to come knocking on her door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Axel never thought he would look into the eyes of Isabelle West again, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to now. He’s carried his anger for so long he isn’t sure he can just turn it off, but when he is faced with protecting her and an unexpected desire to have her again, life gets a little more complicated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How will Axel and Isabelle deal when all their cards are put on the table and everything they thought was true blows up in their faces?</description>

  <description>Judas Coyne is a collector of the macabre:  a cookbook for cannibals...a used hangman's noose...a snuff film.  An aging death-metal rock god, his taste for the unnatural is as widely known to his legions of fans as the notorious excesses of his youth.  But nothing he possesses is as unlikely or as dreadful as his latest discovery, an item for sale on the Internet, a thing so terribly strange, Jude cant help but reach for his wallet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will "sell" my stepfather's ghost to the highest bidder...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a thousand dollars, Jude will become the proud owner of a dead man's suit, said to be haunted by a restless spirit.  He isn't afraid.  he has spent a lifetime coping with ghosts--of an abusive father, of the lovers he callously abandoned, of the band-mates he betrayed.  What's one more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what UPS delivers to his door in a black heart-shaped box is no imaginary or metaphorical ghost, no benign conversation piece.  It's the real thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And suddenly the suit's previous owner is everywhere:  behind the bedroom door...seated in Jude's restored vintage Mustang...standing outside his window...staring out from his widescreen TV.  Waiting--with a gleaming razor blade on a chain dangling from one bony hand...</description>

  <description>Actor Colin Colton is tired of dealing with the paparazzi. One night he snaps and breaks the camera of pushy Zach Jarlson. Within a few hours, guilt sets in and he replaces it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin has a contentious relationship with the press--especially Zach. Then one day, trapped in a cable car together, they discover something more....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They go from enemies to friends and lovers...and then back again, as a sex tape of the two hits the market for a cool two million. Colin thinks Zach made it, and Zach thinks it was Colin. And neither man is ready to take it lying down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin tracks Zach to a cabin in the woods as heavy snow cuts off all access. Their private interlude reveals the truth--and the real culprit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Colin still has to convince Zach he wasn't just a fling. Gun-shy after being outed by the press, Zach disappears from Colin's life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just what does a guy have to do to convince his paparazzo he's serious about having a real relationship?</description>

  <description>After kicking his abusive boyfriend to the curb, Joshua Perry wants nothing more than to focus on his career. He might be drawn to powerful, dominant men, but he's tired of these guys thinking they own him. Then his new boss comes strolling into the office, looking good enough to lick, and the well-dressed alpha tests Joshua's new resolve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb isn't oblivious to Joshua's interest, but something isn't right. Joshua is distracted, and every time he looks at his phone, Caleb fears his new assistant might pass out right where he stands. He's trying not to push, but every instinct tells him Joshua needs his help. Now, if he can just convince the fiercely independent blond of this, things would be just fine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kicking his lover out on the street wasn't the road to freedom Joshua had expected it to be. The Enforcer won't take no for an answer, and he'll go to any lengths to get Joshua back into his bed, no matter how violent. Can Caleb convince Joshua to accept his help before it's too late? Or will Joshua's desire to stand on his own two feet cost him everything in the end?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The sweeping plains held the promise of a lifetime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linnea&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eager to begin her first teaching position, lovely Linnea Brandonberg stepped off the train looking as grown up and worldly as her eighteen years would allow. The golden fields and fragrant wheat of Alamo, North Dakota, were as new and different as the Westgaard family with whom she would live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teddy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Farm life in 1917 was hard and bitter—but tiny, spirited Linnea was determined to brave its challenges. And as World War I threatened to take those she held dear, Linnea grew to womanhood in the arms of Teddy Westgaard, a man who thought he'd never find love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story of passion. A story of heartache. A story of a way of life that will long be remembered—with people and places as real as the emotions of the heart.</description>

  <description>Waking up in Vegas was never meant to be like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evelyn Thomas’s plans for celebrating her twenty-first birthday in Las Vegas were big. Huge. But she sure as hell never meant to wake up on the bathroom floor with a hangover to rival the black plague, a very attractive half-naked tattooed man, and a diamond on her finger large enough to scare King Kong. Now if she could just remember how it all happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing is for certain, being married to rock and roll’s favourite son is sure to be a wild ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; If you'd asked me what love was two years ago, I probably would've said, 'It's this amazing feeling that obsesses and possesses you; it's what me and my husband currently have.' If you ask me that same question today, I'll say, 'Please get the hell out of my face.’ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Gracen's life is picture perfect. Her career as a marketing director is on the brink of being legendary, and her marriage to her high school sweetheart has never been stronger. No, wait. It has. It used to be amazing and fulfilling, but one day Claire realizes that she's been living a lie and her best friend and husband have committed the ultimate betrayal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Broken and depressed, Claire is in need of something new—new city, new job, new friends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she happens to attract the interest of the sexiest man she's ever met, a man significantly younger than her, she immediately turns him down—only to later discover that this man is Jonathan Statham, self-made billionaire and CEO of Statham Industries. Her boss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonathan Statham is unlike any man she's met before. He's used to getting whatever he wants—whenever he wants, and he isn't about to take no for an answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexy, unpredictable, and charmingly clever, Mid Life Love is a story that will captivate you, entertain you, and force you to fall deeply in love with the characters.</description>

  <description>Forty years ago the Spirit of Vengeance—a Purpose—took William Morgan as its host, demanding he avenge the innocent by killing the guilty. Since then, Will has retreated behind Gar, a façade he uses to avoid dealing with what he’s become. Cold, impassive, and devoid of emotion, Gar goes about his life alone—until his tidy, orderly world is upended when he meets Ryan, a broken young man cast out by his family. Spurred to action for reasons he can't understand, Gar saves Ryan from death and finds himself confronted by his humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spending time with Ryan helps Will claw out from under Gar’s shadow. He recognizes Ryan is the key to his reclaiming his humanity and facing his past. As Will struggles to control the Purpose, Ryan challenges him to rethink everything he knew about himself and the spirit that possesses him. In the process, he pushes Will to do something he hasn't done in decades: care.</description>

  <description>Atlanta is a city plagued by magical problems. Kate Daniels will fight to solve them—no matter the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mercenary Kate Daniels and her mate, Curran, the Beast Lord, are struggling to solve a heartbreaking crisis. Unable to control their beasts, many of the Pack’s shapeshifting children fail to survive to adulthood. While there is a medicine that can help, the secret to its making is closely guarded by the European packs, and there’s little available in Atlanta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate can’t bear to watch innocents suffer, but the solution she and Curran have found threatens to be even more painful. The European shapeshifters who once outmaneuvered the Beast Lord have asked him to arbitrate a dispute—and they’ll pay him in medicine. With the young people’s survival and the Pack’s future at stake, Kate and Curran know they must accept the offer—but they have little doubt that they’re heading straight into a trap…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;I’ve been searching for so long. People think I’m dominant or that I want to top. What I really want and need is strong man who won’t abuse me, someone who will let me trust. I would do anything for a man like that. I’m so tired. All I want is to be Daddy’s Boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;One very naked, heavily muscled, man with his back to the camera. The words “Daddy’s Boy” are tattooed across his back from shoulder to shoulder. His legs are spread and he is obviously standing over another man who appears naked from the waist down. The man below him has a large ruddy cock that is nestled between Daddy’s Boy’s ass cheeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>It's one thing to fall head over heels into a puddle of hazelnut coffee, and quite another to fall for - gasp - the wrong guy. Straight-A junior Julia may be accident prone, but she's the queen of following rules and being prepared. That's why she keeps a pencil sharpener in her purse and a pocket Shakespeare in her ... well, pocket. Julia also believes in fate, and that Mark, her childhood crush, is her MTB - her meant-to-be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this spring break, Julia's rules are about to get defenestrated (SAT word: thrown from a window) when she's partnered with her personal nemesis, class clown Jason, on a school trip to London. After one wild party, Julia starts receiving romantic texts ... from an unknown number! Jason promises to help discover the identity of her mysterious new suitor if she agrees to live a little along the way. And thus begins a wild-good chase through London, leading Julia closer and closer to the biggest surprise of all:  true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because sometimes the things you least expect are the most meant to be.</description>

  <description>Lucky Morgan has had her share of heartbreak. She is devastated when her boyfriend dumps her after sleeping with him and she vows to herself that she won't be used again. She decides that the next guy she dates and sleeps with, will be her one true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zane Beaumont is the mysterious and snooty guy that comes into her diner every Friday night with a different girl. He's the type of guy she's learned to avoid: carefree, fast, handsome, rich, and sarcastic. Unfortunately, she can't stop thinking about the devilish gleam in his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lucky's car breaks down one night after a party, it is Zane who comes to her rescue. As Zane attempts to sweep Lucky off of her feet, she soon realizes that nothing is as it seems and that Zane may very well be the guy for whom she changes the rules. That is until she meets Braydon.</description>

  <description>They say that opposites attract. But what happens when one has been devastated by betrayal and the other is so jaded that his heart is made of stone? Enter the world of Friday Harbor, an enchanting town in the Pacific Northwest where things are not quite as they seem and where true love might just have a ghost of a chance….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Nolan is as bitter and cynical as they come. One of the three Nolan brothers who call Friday harbor home, he's nothing like Sam or Mark. They actually believe in love; they think the risk of pain is worth the chance of happiness. But Alex battles his demons with the help of a whiskey bottle, and he lives in his own private hell. And then a ghost shows up. Only Alex can see him, Has Alex finally crossed over the threshold to insanity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoë Hoffman is as gentle and romantic as they come. When she meets the startling gorgeous Alex Nolan, all her instincts tell her to run. Even Alex tells her to run. But something in him calls to Zoë, and she forces him to take a look at his life with a clear eye and to open his mind to the possibility that love isn’t for the foolish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ghost has been existing in the half-light of this world for decades. He doesn’t know who he is, or why he is stuck in the Nolans’ Victorian house. All he knows is that he loved a girl once. And Alex and Zoë hold the key to unlocking a mystery that keeps him trapped here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoë and Alex are oil and water, fire and ice, sunshine and shadow. But sometimes it takes only a glimmer of light to chase away the dark, and sometimes love can reach beyond time, space, and reason to take hold of hearts that yearn for it…</description>

  <description>A Steel City Story&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homeless pickpocket Kai Alwright steals a cell phone and some cash one day only to find the owner texting him, appealing to his better qualities. The request to return the phone stings Kai’s pride; he rides his rusty bicycle all the way to the stables north of the city, where Attila Keleman, the phone’s owner, offers him a new start in the form of a job and a roof over his head. Soon Kai discovers a natural talent for work with horses, and he makes every effort to separate his new existence from his promiscuous past on the streets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attila is a reclusive horse trainer whose dressage trophies gather dust, and whose broken heart has been walled off. His undiagnosed Asperger’s makes life around people a challenge, but though he prefers the company of horses, Attila finds Kai’s presence tolerable—even refreshing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a client who rides at the stable with her daughter finds out Attila is “still gay,” she tries to run Kai off—and she doesn’t stop there. Mortified, her adult daughter runs away and falls victim to a dark figure from Kai’s past. Kai joins Attila in a rescue mission that tears the civilized masks off their hidden pasts.</description>

  <description>Staff Sergeant Corey Yarwood is an instructor at the Basic Reconnaissance Course. His last deployment ended in horror, but he can’t remember those events. Battling severe PTSD, Corey’s drinking is growing out of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean Chandler walks into a dive bar, and into Corey’s life. An actor and a musician, Sean has the empathy and compassion to sooth Corey’s pain, and the strength to support him as he struggles to heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corey’s lost memories are pivotal to a civilian murder, and a military investigation. Remembering could mean salvation, or destruction. Will the truth be too much for Sean to handle?</description>

  <description>Thirty-three year old Philip Hampton is an award winning freelance writer and investigative journalist. His younger brother, Billy, an A-list New Yorker, is on the brink of stardom in the international art market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned as children, the two brothers are the only family either has until Billy is murdered.  Shattered by his brother’s death, Philip vows revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During a visit to Billy’s studio, Philip discovers Billy’s final painting. Certain that the painting somehow holds clues to Billy’s murder, Philip begins to unlock the painting’s secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He finds himself drawn into a frantic search for the treasures from the largest art theft in history—the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Heist of 1990. Discovery of the treasure is Philip’s only hope of solving the murder, attaining retribution, and healing from emotional and sexual trauma from his childhood.</description>

  <description>A pretty blonde vampire is trying to kill me. Sure, that sounds like the beginning of a soft-core porno, but in this case it’s a freaking nightmare. She breaks down my door, kills my roommate, curses at me like a sailor, and then starts following me around like a stalker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And did I mention she’s trying to kill me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s worse, I think I might be turning…gay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t think life could get any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shit! I shouldn’t have said that.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; You learn your wisest lessons from your enemies. Assuming, of course, you survive the encounter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kendras is a casualty of war: injured, penniless, and quite possibly the last surviving member of the only family he's ever known—the elite fighting force known as the Scorpions. When a steel-eyed stranger offers him medicine and shelter in exchange for submission and a secret task, Kendras has no choice but to accept. He is a Scorpion; he’ll do whatever it takes to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But his true goal is to rebuild the Scorpions. Neither Steel’s possessive nature nor Kendras’s shattered foot can keep him from finding the last of his brothers... or the mysterious leader of the Scorpions, a man who held Kendras’s heart long before Steel tried to take it for himself. The goal is simple, the situation anything but. To rescue his leader and escape from Steel for good, Kendras must fight through a morass of politics and intrigue, where enemies are allies and even allies have hidden agendas.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Maybe it was the Shenanigans gift certificate that put her over the edge. When children's librarian and self-professed nice girl Jane Jameson is fired by her beastly boss and handed twenty-five dollars in potato skins instead of a severance check, she goes on a bender that's sure to become Half Moon Hollow legend. On her way home, she's mistaken for a deer, shot, and left for dead. And thanks to the mysterious stranger she met while chugging neon-colored cocktails, she wakes up with a decidedly unladylike thirst for blood.  &lt;p&gt; Jane is now the latest recipient of a gift basket from the Newly Undead Welcoming Committee, and her life-after-lifestyle is taking some getting used to. Her recently deceased favorite aunt is now her ghostly roommate. She has to fake breathing and endure daytime hours to avoid coming out of the coffin to her family. She's forced to forgo her favorite down-home Southern cooking for bags of O negative. Her relationship with her sexy, mercurial vampire sire keeps running hot and cold. And if all that wasn't enough, it looks like someone in Half Moon Hollow is trying to frame her for a series of vampire murders. What's a nice undead girl to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Simon has an offer for his stressed out roommate, but is this stubborn sub already too far gone for Simon’s methods?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max’s high pressure job as a surgeon is getting to him and he’s starting to suffer for it. His roommate Simon has a solution for him, but is Max ready to give up control or will this Dom have to work for it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon’s not used to dealing with such stubborn subs, but he can’t sit back and let Max’s health and sanity continue to decline in the name of his work. Enough is enough already and if Max doesn’t accept what he’s offering, then Simon might just have to come up with something even more drastic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a night of passion between these two strong willed men exposes Simon’s secrets, it might be he who has to learn to trust and let go of the control he so desperately seeks.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Vamps in Chicago!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’d think headlines like that would have provoked the fine citizens of the Windy City to take up arms against us bloodsucking fiends. Instead, ten months later, we’re enjoying a celebrity status reserved for the Hollywood elite—fending off paparazzi only slightly less dangerous than cross and stake-wielding slayers. Don’t get me wrong, Joe Public isn’t exactly thrilled to be living side-by-side with the undead, but at least they haven’t stormed the castle yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that will change once they learn about the Raves—mass feeding parties where vampires round up humans like cattle and drink themselves silly. Most civilized vampires frown on this behavior, putting mere mortals at ease with their policy of asking a person’s consent before taking a big gulp of the red stuff. However, that doesn’t make good copy for a first time reporter looking to impress his high society family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So now my “master,” the centuries old, yet gorgeously well-preserved Ethan Sullivan, wants me to reconnect with my own upper class family and act as liaison between humans and vampires—and keep the more unsavory aspects of our existence out of the media. But someone doesn’t want people and vamps to play nicey-nice—someone with an ancient grudge.</description>

  <description>Times are hard for newly minted vampire Merit. Ever since shapeshifters announced their presence to the world, humans have been rallying against supernaturals—and they're camping outside of Cadogan House with protest signs that could turn to pitchforks at any moment. Inside its doors, things between Merit and her Master, green-eyed heartbreaker Ethan Sullivan, are tense. But then the mayor of Chicago calls Merit and Ethan to a clandestine meeting and tells them about a violent vamp attack that has left three women missing. His message is simple: get your House in order. Or else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merit needs to get to the bottom of this crime, but it doesn't help that she can't tell who's on her side. So she secretly calls in a favor from someone who's tall, dark, and part of an underground vamp group that may have some deep intel on the attack. Merit soon finds herself in the heady, dark heart of Chicago's supernatural society—a world full of vampires who seem to be ready to fulfill the protesting human's worst fears, and a place where she'll learn that you can't be a vampire without getting a little blood on your hands.</description>

  <description>Clouds are brewing over Cadogan House, and recently turned vampire Merit can’t tell if this is the darkness before the dawn or the calm before the storm. With the city iself in turmoil over paranormals and the state threatening to pass a paranormal registration act, times haven’t been this precarious for vampires since they came out of the closet. If only they could lay low for a bit, and let the mortals calm down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s when the waters of Lake Michigan suddenly turn pitch black-and things really start getting ugly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chicago’s mayor insists it’s nothing to worry about, but Merit knows only the darkest magic could have woven a spell powerful enough to change the very fabric of nature. She’ll have to turn to friends old and new to find out who’s behind this, and stop them before it’s too late for vampires and humans alike.</description>

  <description>Merit, Chicago’s newest vampire, is learning how to play well with others. Other supernaturals, that is. Shapeshifters from across the country are convening in the Windy City, and as a gesture of peace, Master Vampire Ethan Sullivan has offered their leader a very special bodyguard: Merit. Merit is supposed to protect the Alpha, Gabriel Keene—and to spy for the vamps while she’s at it. Oh, and luckily Ethan’s offering some steamy, one-on-one combat training sessions to help her prepare for the mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merit must accept the assignment, even though she knows that she’ll probably regret it. And she’s not wrong. Someone is gunning for Gabriel Keene, and Merit soon finds herself in the line of fire. She’ll need all the help she can get to track down the would-be assassin, but everywhere she turns, there are rising tensions between supernaturals—not least between her and a certain green-eyed, centuries old master vampire.</description>

  <description>Matt Sullivan understands labels: law student, athlete, heterosexual. He has goals: graduate and begin his career in law. One fateful night, Matt tags along with his gay roommate to a dance club and everything changes. Matt finds himself attracted to the most beautiful man he's ever seen. All labels go flying out the window.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aaron Mendez doesn't believe in labels, and he’s leery of straight curious men. He makes it clear that he’ll hide his fabulous light for no one. While Aaron can't deny the attraction between him and Matt, he is reluctant to start anything with someone who is still dealing with what this new label means—especially when that someone has a girlfriend.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From the author of the New York Times, USA Today &amp;amp; Wall Street Journal bestselling novel, THE EDGE OF NEVER, comes a story of passion and survival…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things don’t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victor’s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is their story…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(94,000 words | 400 pages)</description>

  <description>Some mistakes from the past haunt us forever... unless fate steps in with a second chance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One 'dear John' letter haunts Bobby Baker's every living moment. It’s the letter he stupidly wrote to his high school sweetheart, Belle, right after he left to join the Army. The letter that he told her that he wasn't so sure if they were ready for forever yet. But before he can let her know that the letter, and his second thoughts, are nothing but a mistake, she up and disappears from the small Georgia town they were both raised in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen years later, Belle unknowingly walks back into Bobby's life when her job as an ATF Agent forces her to work with a group of men secretly headed by the CIA to help her track down whoever is involved in funneling black market weapons to a drug cartel in Mexico. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby will use this mission to try and soothe Belle's hurt feelings while proving to her that their love is still meant for forever. He'll use every dirty trick he's learned since he joined the Army to maneuver her back into his life for the long haul. But Belle's not making it easy as she keeps him at arm's length in the hopes that mistakes of her own never come to light.</description>

  <description>Part crime family, part law enforcement, the Bedlam Boys are the beating heart and the blackened soul of Mt. Riley.  To some, they are saviors. To others, they're terrorists. Led by Nikkolaus Beck, the public Face of the dictatorship, and Julian Work, a man as brilliant as he is insane, they are the force that brings order to the city and peace to its people.But when Nikkolaus finds love with Nate Thomas, a streetwise prostitute with nothing to lose, he unknowingly sets in motion a chain of events that threatens to destroy them all.  Stricken by tragedy, the Dictator declares war on his city, and there's only one man alive who can save it.  Is he willing to take the final step and do what must be done, or will the Bedlam crush Mt. Riley for good?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What - did you think all vamps were pale, thin and brooding? Don't I wish.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gloriana St. Clair is an eternally "full-figured" vampire-she just happened to be bloating when a sexy Scotsman sank his teeth into her. She and said Scot- Angus Jeremiah Campbell III, aka Jeremy Blade-have been on and off again for centuries, currently off. A couple hundred years has taught them how to press each other's buttons-in good ways &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Glory's headed for Austin and a new business venture: Vintage Vamp's Emporium. After all, she loves clothes, and she is an antique. Only problem is, there's a billionaire techno-freak vampire hunter on the loose. Blade's in total he- vampire mode, and wants Glory to move in with him so he can "protect" her. But it's time for this vamp to explore her own powers.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>By the close of 1882, the inhabitants of the American West had earned their reputation as untamed and dangerous. The line between heroes and villains is narrow and indistinct. The concept that a man may only kill if backed into a corner is antiquated. Lives are worth less than horses. Treasures are worth killing for. And the law is written in the blood of those who came before. The only men staving off total chaos are the few who take the letter of the law at its word and risk their lives to uphold it. But in the West, the rules aren't always played according to Hoyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;U.S. Marshals Eli Flynn and William Henry Washington are escorting two prisoners to New Orleans for trial when they discover there’s more to the infamous shootist Dusty Rose and the enigmatic man known only as Cage than merely being outlaws. When forces beyond the marshals’ control converge on the paddlewheeler they have hired to take them downriver, they must choose between two dangers: playing by the rules at any cost or trusting the very men they are meant to bring to justice.</description>

  <description>Grey’s entire life is wrapped around his job as a firefighter. It is all he has ever wanted. That is until his new coworker Mica Cruz saunters through the door with his smoldering dark looks and dimpled grin. Suddenly he finds himself wanting to get to know what Mica looks like out of his gear and between the sheets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mica has one rule…keep his work life and his personal life separate. It was easy enough to follow until he meets Grey and finds that his rule can’t stand up to the fire that Grey ignites. There’s one big thing standing in the way of all of his lust filled musings. Grey is straight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a profession where being gay is often kept quiet Grey must come to terms with his growing attraction to Mica. How much is he willing to sacrifice? Can they come together before someone’s hatred threatens to destroy them both?</description>

  <description>After six happy years together, Todd abruptly leaves Angelo the day their daughter enters the world. Suddenly Angelo finds himself alone with a newborn daughter to raise, and no explanation as to why Todd left him, or the daughter he had so desperately wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between his daughter, and his career as a kindergarten teacher, Angel doesn’t have time for anything else, let alone a relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the handsome, auburn-haired Marcus walks into his kindergarten classroom toting his daughter, Angel isn’t looking for a boyfriend. He has enough on his plate raising a thirteen month old daughter, and keeping his class in line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Marcus doesn’t seem to know the meaning of the word no, and soon worms his way into all facets of Angel's life, turning everything sideways. In a twist of fate, the reason for Todd’s betrayal becomes clear, and Angel finds himself with a new outlook on his own life. But can he really expect Marcus to stay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Book One in the Dark Love series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bookworm David knows the difference between fantasy and reality...until he meets Alex.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphan and loner David Greene has always found solace in the dark romance written by his great-grandmother. The book and a crumbling old house on the edge of town are all that remains of his ancestry and the family he never knew. But when David meets Alex, the new owner of the house, his world spins out of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex is every bit of man and mystery David could have conjured in his wildest erotic dreams, and he is drawn into a strange romance where weirdness becomes the norm. He even begins to sense the spirit of Vincent, the novel’s mysterious anti-hero, who issues a warning about the dangers of involving himself with Alex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Alex begins to manoeuvre and manipulate David’s empty life, the question soon becomes not who is Alex, but what is Alex? And once the truth is out David discovers that the fictional world of his great-grandmother’s novel was never quite so fictional after all.</description>

  <description>Book two in the Uncommon Cowboys Series When cowboy and wolf shifter Cody Marshal wakes on a country road scratched, naked, and lacking his favourite pair of boots he doesn t expect the caring touch of his rescuer, Adrian Le Roy, or the way it makes him feel, man and wolf.Veterinarian Adrian Le Roy knows something is strange when he finds cowboy Cody Marshal sleeping off an apparent bender in the middle of the dirt road leading to Adrian s new practice out west. For one thing, Cody is scratched and bruised and he s completely naked. When he runs off into the woods Adrian can t shake the feeling he s walked into some kind of primal dream.Twice a month Cody wakes up somewhere bare-assed, lacking even his favourite pair of boots. As far as he s concerned, being a wolf shifter sucks. Even worse is his desire for Adrian, his gentle new employer who has no idea the beast he risks inviting into his bed.Reader Advisory: The stories in this series are connected solely by theme. They can all be read as stand alone titles and read in any order.</description>

He's right. A visit to a Sunday morning car boot sale has unhappy and far-reaching repercussions for Andrew. He comes face to face with a feared object from his past, something he never thought he’d see again. Old memories resurface with a vengeance. Driven by guilt and self-loathing he takes flight in order to avoid confronting his fears. All too soon Andy realizes that he’s made a dreadful mistake in leaving Thomas. His life begins to fall apart, as he resorts to old methods of coping with emotional pain. However, Thomas isn't the type of man to just quietly accept the disappearance of his partner.

  <description>Marc, a small pet shop owner and seer, needs help with his store, but his new employee, Galen, brings with him more trouble than expected. Marc tries to keep their relationship professional even if Galen seems insistent on taking it to the next level. And then there is the problem of Galen’s past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keiran, a hard working medical student and Marc’s best friend, has a small problem, a stalker. One night he confronts the man and finds that his stalker vampire, Devlan, is too alluring to turn down. But Devlan isn’t who he seems to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the four men meet up for a night out their lives fall apart. Marc’s premonitions turn out to be wrong and everything points towards one autumn night a couple of years ago. Now they need to figure out what happened that night, before someone dies, again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time is running out. The visions might be false, but they don’t paint a pretty picture, not about their futures and, especially, not about their pasts. They need to reverse the change before it is too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words: 57,067 (approximate)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A split-second of time and Walt’s dreams of Olympic gold were crushed along with his right leg when he was involved in a serious accident on the ski-fields during the preliminary trials. Now he’s teaching beginners on the ski slopes of Crystal Falls Lodge, run by his family in West Virginia, and wondering if he’ll ever crawl out of the pit that his life has become. Eventually, the look of devastation on his sister’s face at how much he’s let himself go, prompts him to try harder to experience life again. First on the list: a trip to town and a haircut.&lt;br&gt;Curt Woodridge is used to traveling light. Ever since he was kicked out of home at eighteen, when his family found out he was gay, he’s been moving from one town to the next, performing in small bars and ski lodges to make his living. He is one of the lucky ones; he was saved from having to live on the streets by his agent and is genuinely happy with the way his life is going. After performing a great set at his latest gig, Curt decides to head into town and look around. He has seven days to kill before he’ll be moving on to the next gig.&lt;br&gt;Neither man is ready for love, and definitely not on the streets of Flat Rock. But when neither of them is looking, quite literally, they fall hard. But how does a man who thought he’d lost everything dare to dream of a life with someone who is leaving town for good in less than a week?</description>

  <description>In a world we think we know, live other races entirely hidden from the mortal perspective.  Creatures of legend, of fable and myth, their very history and nature have allowed them to walk side by side with humans since time immemorial.  They are warriors, they are hunters, and they are Algula.  Vampire.  And in their own midst, a battle is brewing for supremacy, for dominance, that can and will affect all around them.  Old hatred never dies and vengeance is a fiery sword that cuts a bloody swath.</description>

He's only looking for work and a few beers with friends when he meets Blythe Kenner, and suddenly his priorities change.Blythe doesn't trust anyone especially shifters. All he wants to do is bide his time working behind the bar while getting his law degree. That is until Dan walks in and makes it his sole vocation to get under Blythe's skin...and his covers. Blythe never counted on having a shifter as a lover, and complicated doesn't begin to describe how he feels.Dan knows how he feels and he's not going to let Blythe go without a fight. But time is running out. A rival pack isn't happy with Dan's living arrangements, and if Dan can't win Blythe's trust soon, their very lives will be at stake.</description>

  <description>Twenty-seven year old Carrie Thompson-Sherman has the life she always wanted: her PhD, a prestigious fellowship, and an amazing husband. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her life begins to unravel as a jealous colleague puts her fellowship in jeopardy and a haunting secret Ray Sherman carried home from Afghanistan comes to light. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hounded by a federal investigation and the ensuing media feeding frenzy, Carrie and Ray desperately lean on each other, until a disastrous accident puts both Ray and her sister's lives at risk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last hour, Carrie and Ray will each find themselves faced with a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A choice that will change everything.</description>

  <description>The Christian rapture occurs and the now soulless bodies of Christians are left to terrorize all those left behind. TJ flees across Texas with his best friend, Ryan, and the remnants of his family, hoping for happiness, struggling just to survive. As they trek farther and farther South toward the coast, TJ and Ryan find comfort and love with one another. Their relationship is tested and they labor to stay alive and stay together in a world that God has unfortunately started to pay attention to.&lt;br&gt;Words: 63,100 (approximate)</description>

  <description>When I won the annual Eagle Elite College Scholarship lottery, I was thrilled. After all, my grandma had just died and I wanted to take care of my aging grandpa -- he couldn't be a farmer in Wyoming forever. And graduating from Eagle Elite meant opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I wasn't counting on meeting Nixon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor was I counting on the rules of the Elect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Do not touch The Elect.&lt;br&gt;2. Do not look at The Elect.&lt;br&gt;3. Do not speak to The Elect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And worst of all? Don't discover the secret they hide, because in the end, you may just realize... it's about you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This is a New Adult Book, blood, violence, cursing, sexual references, and drug use. Not recommended for those under 17.*</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;I am a bodyguard, an ex-marine. I have not had the time or inclination for relationships, preferring the occasional casual meeting with other men like me. Until now… until him… my new assignment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is utterly shameless. He drives me crazy. How did this happen to me? I’m falling for a twink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;This prompt included two pictures. The first was a chiseled man with dark blond hair and blue eyes. His mouth is curved up in the smallest of smirks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second picture features a young man with dark hair. The only thing he is wearing is a pair of black briefs and he’s bending over a sink displaying his ass to the camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>A stranger in the wings, a traitorous pair of toe shoes, and a traumatic turn dancing with The Great Rubio… For ballerina Ashleigh Keaton, it’s been one hell of a night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s not over yet. When Rubio drags her to a private BDSM party at his friend’s house in the ritzy part of London, she meets Liam Wilder, a lifestyle dominant and frighteningly seductive man. Liam pursues Ashleigh, attracted by her strength and talent, but she has secrets—an abusive past and a crippling fear of intimacy that prevents her from connecting to anyone, especially a kinky playboy reputed to be legendary in bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually he wins her trust and sets out to heal the troubled dancer, awakening her to a world of erotic obedience and sensual abandon in a series of “sessions” at his home. But how pure are his motives? Is he helping her or endangering her fragile soul? Liam hides his own destructive secrets, and so does Fernando Rubio, their temperamental friend. Over time the three become embroiled in a tangle of artifice, fears, and lies that threaten to undo everything they’ve worked for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Ashleigh and Liam find the strength to defeat their demons? Or are they cursed to sleepwalk through life forever, afraid to experience the passion and intimacy of love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This 81K word romantic novel contains reflections on childhood abuse and violence which may disturb some readers.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Megan Miller, a freshman at Carver High and a Double Threat, the perfect combination of smart and popular. She's got the grades, she's got the friends, and she's got the connections. Freshman year should be a breeze, but it's not. How can it be when you have boys, boys and boys on the brain. And really only one in particular. Alex Aguilar...the boy of Meg's dreams. They met at a party and Meg's whole world shifted. The spark was there, there was no denying it. But could that spark lead to more? Can a Senior and Freshman really make a go of it no matter what kind of connection they share? Or will outside circumstances ruin not only Meg's Freshman year, but her chance at hooking the guy of her dreams. Being a Double Threat is supposed to make you special, but is it worth it if you don't get your crush?</description>

  <description>Sometimes you can go home again. Reece Watkins left Montana after high school. A math major, he found a fulfilling career as an accountant in Washington with Mike, the love of his life. But then Mike dies of a heart attack, leaving Reece to reevaluate his own life and realize he’s on the same track. He decides to return to Montana and a slower pace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former football team captain Nick Kenison never left Montana. Instead, he married his high school sweetheart, had two kids, established a contracting business, and discovered he was gay. Now out and proud, Nick drives out to Reece’s to answer a call about roof repairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In high school, they were opposites, but now? The attraction between them is electric. Of course, it isn’t that easy—Reece is still dealing with body issues, self-esteem issues, and grief over Mike’s loss. Nick will have to teach him it’s never too late for love.</description>

  <description>Mia Taylor has a huge heart, but just how much pain can one heart endure? Mia was living the picture perfect life, engaged to her high school sweetheart and working at her dream job at an upscale salon in New York City. She had it all. Until the day her past, present and future were taken away, leaving her to face the world scared and alone. Trying to pick up the pieces of her broken life, while mourning the devastating loss of her fiancé she just goes through the motions as an empty shell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Travis Montgomery, Olympic swimmer and totally gorgeous. He has several medals under his belt and just as many women. Mia is well aware of his womanizing reputation and refuses to be his next conquest, but finds herself coming alive again  whenever she’s around him.  They agree to be “just friends,” quickly finding that they are unable to fight the attraction between them.  Mia’s life becomes complete once again with Travis in it; but nothing good lasts forever, at least not in Mia’s world. Torn apart by an ugly secret, Mia’s heart is broken once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the unthinkable happens and Travis needs Mia the most, she must reach deep inside to find forgiveness for the one man who will always hold the key to her shattered heart. But will doing so only break it further; this time beyond repair?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Expected Publication Date: July 22, 2013</description>

  <description>Publicly, Jason Wadsworth is a young steel magnate. Privately, he is slowly unraveling. Gripped by depression, he is haunted by the memory of Kale, the slave he sold and the man who still holds his heart. Jason clings to his only source of comfort: the belief that he sent Kale away to a better life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As grim as Jason’s life is, Kale has fared worse. Each day is a brutal struggle. All that keeps him going are memories of a happier time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a chance meeting thrusts the two back together, they must try to find the strength to forgive, not only each other, but themselves. They have one chance to right the wrongs of the past, but it requires the strength to seek redemption in each other’s arms. A strength both men may be too spent to summon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Measure of Strength is the sequel to Measure of Devotion and contains adult language and explicit sex.</description>

He'd left Alabama hoping to escape a dull, small-town life, only to return four years later, lugging a duffle full of personal demons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cookesville, Alabama isn’t the most welcoming place on earth, particularly for a gay, Hispanic student wanting nothing more than to earn his degree and get back home to Texas. An image of a somber young man that he knows only by name and the stories told by an adoring sister comes to life when Michael returns home, just as Jay is already half-way to losing his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael’s biggest battle lies ahead, and he’ll need all the help he can get to find his way in a world where he no longer fits in. Jay’s not sure where he fits either, but it could be next to the war-torn soldier who needs his strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proceeds from Amazon sales are being donated to PFLAG.</description>

  <description>What would you do if true love showed up in the wrong package--and knocked your socks off? American actor John Kaiser lives in London where he's found fame as a television celebrity and theatrical star. He unwittingly falls in love with Brian Mallory, a reclusive Scottish millionaire who takes refuge in his London penthouse once a year to conduct business. Brian sees John as a shy, nervous and clumsy new friend, but John hopes they'll be much more than just friends--until he learns of a love rival: curvaceous, blonde, and sexy Carol Lexington. He's devastated when he realizes he can't compete with this beautiful woman. Or can he? And even if he could win Brian's love, what other forces would lie in wait to tear them apart? From the ritzy charity galas of London's elite to an English countryside manor and a stunning, riverfront luxury penthouse, this love story takes you on a journey of humor, happiness, pain, jealousy and bitter betrayal. Filled with quirky best friends, catastrophic events, and undying love and devotion, it's the story of a straight man who falls in love with a gay man who did everything wrong and still got everything right. " Straight Man Gay " does what "Giovanni's Room" and "Brokeback Mountain" couldn't: It takes the shame out of being gay and in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;No one creates realms like &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Anne Bishop. Now in a thrilling new fantasy series, enter a world inhabited by the Others, unearthly entities—vampires and shape-shifters among them—who rule the Earth and whose prey are humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;cassandra sangue&lt;/em&gt;, or blood prophet, Meg Corbyn can see the future when her skin is cut—a gift that feels more like a curse. Meg’s Controller keeps her enslaved so he can have full access to her visions. But when she escapes, the only safe place Meg can hide is at the Lakeside Courtyard—a business district operated by the Others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Shape-shifter Simon Wolfgard is reluctant to hire the stranger who inquires about the Human Liaison job. First, he senses she’s keeping a secret, and second, she doesn’t smell like human prey. Yet a stronger instinct propels him to give Meg the job. And when he learns the truth about Meg and that she’s wanted by the government, he’ll have to decide if she’s worth the fight between humans and the Others that will surely follow.</description>

  <description>Sarah Jennings wants nothing more than a quiet life--alone.&lt;br&gt;Raised by an eccentric mother, their life on the road only taught her how to run away from hard times. When she finds herself in an abusive relationship, this lesson serves her well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight years later, she’s settled back in her hometown and less fearful than she’s ever been in her life. She’s a first grade teacher, and with few friends and less family around, she has what she wants, a quiet life under the radar where she can be free of her past and live quietly. Until one night and one brutal act of violence changes everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Injured and afraid, Sarah wants to run again, but Mark Summors refuses to let her go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark was born and raised in Santa Rosa. He married his high school sweetheart and never questioned his life, until he found his wife with another man. Now divorced, he wants something more. He's passionate about his job, he wants to protect people, and he devotes his life to it. This time he's protecting more than just another client; he's protecting his future. At least, Sarah Jennings will be his future, once he convinces her she loves him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sarah agrees to let Mark help, she doesn’t anticipate just how important of a role he’ll play in her future or how the violence in her past will come back to threaten them both.</description>

  <description>In 1866 on the empty Kansas prairie, two children shared a few desperate moments that changed their lives. For years afterward, each nursed a secret dream—that the other had grown into a special person—brave, good, kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Norah Hawkins and Caleb Sutton cross paths again, dreams die. She is a bitter, suicidal widow. He is a gunman with little conscience and few scruples. Alternately angry, repelled, and attracted, the two form an uneasy partnership to hold land she owns and he covets against a marauding neighbor. Their bargain never included love, or did it?</description>

  <description>It's lonely at the top for Commander Villam Elding, who has always ranked loyalty to the empire and career ambition over romance. He finds it easier to love ideas than people; without military life, he's lost. Even so, it's his close relationship with Kardiell, a popular officer, that tears him from his life. Those with competing ambitions try to take Villam hostage to leverage Kardiell's soft spot for him. In the struggle, Villam crashes the small spacecraft he's riding. All hands perish except he and Luke, his kidnapper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke Sicinik travels the galaxy performing dirty missions for money to send home. Born on a desert colony abandoned by the empire, he has no love for imperial soldiers. He spent his childhood in a monastery which taught the evils of anything impractical or sentimental. Yet when he crawls from the destroyed spacecraft, his first instinct is compassionate: he drags Villam's unconscious body free of the wreckage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stranded together on a wild planet, Villam and Luke know that survival means cooperation. A truce becomes trust, and trust turns to passion, as they struggle to find a new life together -- just the two of them against an entire world.</description>

  <description>Theo and Carlos are called out of vacation when a madman called the Bogeyman begins to butcher small children. It's a race against more than the clock as a third victim is abducted. The FBI has stepped in to put an end to the terror that has seized Columbus, but with very few clues to go on, Theo and Carlos are left scrambling for answers. Rhett Bishop just might be the help they've been looking for, but it comes with a price - one Theo isn't sure is worth paying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deeper they delve into the bloody massacre rocking Columbus, the more things spin out of control. Theo struggles with his own crippling fears and tries to build the courage to ask Carlos one of the most important questions of his life. But things can never go easy for the two detectives, and as they sort through their case, Carlos begins a battle of his own. A contender has stepped up to take Carlos's place as Alpha of the local werecoyote pack. If Carlos isn't careful, he may lose more than his position as pack leader.</description>

  <description>Patrick was twenty-one years old when he found fourteen year old Matt digging through his trash. Little did he know that he was about become the boy’s caretaker. Being a caretaker, however, was no easy task, especially since the kid managed to leave Patrick dumbfounded more than not as the years passed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, at eighteen, Matt presents Patrick with a problem on a whole new level – a problem Patrick may not be able to solve. Matt wants him as a lover. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: This story is "pseudo-incest", but there's only a 7 years age difference and it's the younger one pursuing the older, reluctant one. I hope people will realize that this little story is supposed to be humorous and not serious. Of course, my humor isn't to everyone's liking and I have a feeling the subject might offend some people, but heck, I like this story - even if it's my own ;)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Hunzinger's Mechanical Circus, a rollicking seaside carnival where imagination meets machinery, seems like the only bright spot in the dreary city of Purinton. But a shadow is cast there one day by a tall, cloaked figure striding down the boardwalk and behaving in a most eccentric way -- a man with strange eyes and strange ears and a mark at the base of his throat. He's Fanule Perfidor, commonly known as the Dog King, and he isn't welcome at the Circus. No resident of Taintwell is. They're all Branded Mongrels, and they're officially shunned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it's understandable that Will Marchman, a young patent-medicine salesman, is wary when Perfidor approaches his stand  and begins asking questions. Much to his chagrin, Will is beguiled as well.  When the two men meet again at a public house in the city's seediest district, all prejudice falls away. Lust takes over, then affection. An affair is born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The naive but plucky pitchman soon becomes embroiled in a dangerous quest. Fanule suspects that Alphonse Hunzinger and Purinton's civic leaders are responsible for the disappearance or incarceration of countless Branded Mongrels.  But why?  As Will's passion and regard for his tormented lover grow, he's determined to help Fanule get answers and prevent any further persecution...or worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the aid of a dead and dismembered witch, a vulgar bounty hunter, and a dapper, voracious vampire, Fan and Will take on a group of ruthless enemies. If only they can stay together and stay alive long enough to see their plan through...</description>

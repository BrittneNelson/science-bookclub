  <description>**Author's note - This title is no longer available as an independent story and is now included with Tuck &amp;amp; Cover**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At nineteen, Shane Tucker joins the army. Tucker is gay but not ready to be open about it, and Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell seems like a convenient way to avoid dealing with his sexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The army suits Tucker; he does well from the beginning. Then, during boot camp, he’s assigned a “battle buddy,” Owen Bradford. Owen is a walking, talking wet dream with no concept of personal space. Tucker only survives the constant temptation by venting to his diary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years later, Tucker—now in the Army Ranger program—is paired up with Owen once again. Getting through training while ignoring the sexual tension between him and his battle buddy might be the biggest test of Tucker’s military career.</description>

  <description>After Vorgell the barbarian fucks himself with a unicorn horn, he ends up in a cell with Maddog, a pretty young thief. It’s lust at first sight for Vorgell—but honestly, he can’t help it. Unicorn horn is a potent aphrodisiac, and now he can’t stop thinking about sex. Luckily, Madd is one male witch who knows how to put Vorgell’s new magical body to good use when he tricks Vorgell into a kiss that helps them escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vorgell may desire sex in general—and Madd in particular—but Madd has no intention of being screwed by a man twice his size. He has problems of his own, including an enchanted collar that causes him to desire his most hated enemy. He wants that collar off as soon as possible, but that requires stealing a basilisk egg from the castle they just escaped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawn together by lust and magic, the two men join forces and soon find themselves up to their necks in witches, wizards, and trouble. Vorgell and Madd might just be perfect for each other, but first they have to survive long enough to find out.</description>

  <description>Cornish fudge maker Seb Wright is anticipating and dreading the upcoming tourist season with equal measure. The cash injection is more than welcome, the long hours in the sticky, vanilla scented kitchen less so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few days into the first tentative sparks of summer a shadowy Good Samaritan catches his eye. Vagrant Dex is a new face in town…a beautiful, sullen enigma, and yet with each busy day that passes, Seb finds himself becoming more and more attracted to the mysterious, young man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young man who seems destined to become the heartbeat of a summer he'll never forget.</description>

  <description>Surya Patel is the drummer for the massively popular band, Moonlight. When his label suggests a collaboration with Luck, the band Moonlight toured with the year before, he should be all for it. Except for one thing—he slept with Luck's manager during the tour, and then bolted in the dead of night. He's regretted it ever since, but he knows being around Emmanuel will only lead to disaster. Unfortunately for Surya, the person the label sends to sweet talk him into joining the collaboration is none other than Em himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emmanuel Cortez has spent months trying to forget about the hottest night of his life—the night he slept with Surya. It's been a year, but not even the death of his beloved grandmother and the subsequent drama with his family could keep the memories away. Now it's time to be professional. His job is to convince Surya to collaborate with Luck, nothing more, but a day spent together leads to yet another passionate night. This time Em is the one to leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But unexpectedly Surya has a change of heart. He isn't satisfied with just one night anymore. He wants forever.</description>

  <description>One night, no defenses…&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Calling of Souls story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weston Scott is happy with his simple, quiet life in a small English village. Yet he is haunted by deeply closeted yearnings, a secret he has shared with only one person. His best friend, Mark. As a constant reminder to guard his own heart, Weston wears an emerald ring on his hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Goudy has a secret of his own, one that drove him to live far away in London rather than betray his best friend’s trust: He’s always been in love with Weston. Now he’s back, but not for a friendly visit. Mark’s through denying his emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if he can manage to slip that ring off Weston’s finger for one night, he’s sure things will change. For both of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product Warnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title contains explicit M/M content and tender seduction that strips away all defenses.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>When Madison Morris decides to hire an assistant to help run her naughty bookshop, she gets a lot more than she bargained for. Aggressive Andy doesn't quite make the grade, but continues to push her buttons in other areas, while uptight and utterly repressed Gabriel can't quite take Madison's training techniques. One makes her grasp control, while the other makes her lose it. But the lines are blurring and she's no longer sure who's leading and who's following. In the midst of kinky threesomes and power plays, can Madison work out what she really wants?</description>

How can Kale pass up the chance to set things right with the only man he ever loved, no matter the risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dragon-slayer Kale has loved Holin all his life. Even before he knew what love was. Certainly before he could admit to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boys grew up squabbling, playing, learning to fight dragons together, and exploring their confusing new feelings for each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in a world where dragon-slayers and magicians are sworn enemies, fate tore them apart: Holin developed magic. And Kale has never stopped regretting it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, after years apart, they accidentally meet in a small inn....</description>

  <description>At twenty-two years old, World No.6 and England's No.1, Brian Scagill has the tennis world at his feet. Last year's semifinalist, this year Brian enters England's biggest tournament determined to win. A Grand Slam on home turf is calling to him and he's not going to let anything stand in the way of victory - certainly not a cute Croatian who doesn't even play in the same league. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fooling around with Lexi might be an easy distraction but the last thing Brian needs right now is to be distracted, and there's more than this tournament at stake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serial fiction: Part 1/8 &lt;br&gt;Word Count: 5,200</description>

  <description>A dead body is never a welcome sight, but it’s especially troublesome when Tadd Leventis and Declan Anagnos return home to find one in their foyer. Most people know the dead woman as a curator at the local museum, but Tadd and Declan recognize her as someone from their distant past—Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare. To Tadd and Declan, it's more than a murder. It's a threat to the mortal lives they've worked so hard to build—and a wakeup call that their immortal lives are in danger too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Zeus’s request, they once again don the mantles of Ares and Hermes, but when they start investigating their fellow Olympians, Tadd and Declan discover things are far more complicated than they seem. As the body count rises, tracking the killer becomes more dangerous, and the investigation starts to strain their relationship. Can they patch things up in time to catch the killer, or will the killer catch them first?</description>

  <description>Detective Gabriel Ashby has never looked twice at another man, yet the criminal across from him, the man he’s interrogating, isn’t like any other. Gabe can’t deal with the sudden, intense need he has for one of NYPD’s Most Wanted. Everyone close to Angelo Pagan ends up dead, with the smug gang leader standing amid the rubble. Gabe would love nothing more than to bust Angelo’s ass and lock him up. So why is he seeing the bastard in his dreams at night?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angelo Pagan knows attraction to Gabe is suicide. He’s resolute to ignore the chemistry…until a police raid goes wrong. He critically injures Gabe, changing the trajectory of both their lives. Now the two can’t get close enough. They settle into a forbidden affair threatened by lies and betrayal, living on different sides of the law with no way of breaching the gap between them. With the authorities looking to make an example of Angelo, Gabe has to decide if it’s really worth it to hate the sin but love the sinner.</description>

  <description>Benedict, a successful accountant, who's just been dumped for being boring, is surprised and pleased to learn that he's inherited half ownership in a gay bar from his estranged father, seeing it as a chance to get out of his rut. That's until he meets his new partner, a mouthy, disturbingly hot Brit called Shane, and discovers that the bar's in the red and Shane's not interested in renovations that could drive away their regulars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a late-night confrontation turns into the hottest sex either of them has experienced, they realize there's one way to fit a square peg into a round hole, but are they solving problems or papering over the cracks? As they explore the new dynamic between them, pushing their limits until Ben's shocked at where his desire to dominate Shane takes him, the renovations to the bar begin. They're building something new, something good -- but fear and an unexpected act of violence may tear down what they've created.</description>

  <description>Tommy Kennedy’s family has more money than they’ll ever be able to spend. That money can’t give Tommy back that which he’s lost, though, and that’s made him a very angry young man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli Avery has watched Tommy grow up. He knows a lot about the grim young man, but he’s managed to fall in love with him anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Eli has found Tommy’s name on a mysterious list and knows that if he doesn’t do something soon, Tommy will be lost to him forever--and that’s something he just can’t allow. He sets out to get Tommy off the list and, maybe, win his heart in the process.</description>

  <description>For twenty-one-year-old Sydney, being in love with Kyler isn't anything new. They'd been best friends ever since he pushed her down on the playground and she made him eat a mud pie. Somewhere over the years, she fell for him and fell hard. The big problem with that? Kyler puts the 'man' in man-whore. He's never stayed with a girl longer than a few nights, and with it being their last year in college, Syd doesn't want to risk their friendship by declaring her love.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyler has always put Syd on a pedestal that was too high for him to reach. To him, she's perfect and she's everything. But the feelings he has for her, he's always hidden away or focused on any other female. After all, Kyler will always be the poor boy from the wrong side of tracks, and Syd will always be the one girl he can never have.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when they're stranded together at a posh ski resort due to a massive Nor'easter, there's nothing stopping their red-hot feelings for each other from coming to the surface. Can their friendship survive the attraction? Better yet, can they survive at all? Because as the snow falls, someone is stalking them, and this ski trip may be a life-changer in more ways than one.</description>

  <description>Seduction. Infidelity. Blackmail. Scandal. It can all be bought for the right price and for Sienna Stevens, business is good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because she’s in the business of Great Exploitations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s an Eve, a member of a secret society of women contracted by the wives of wealthy, powerful men for one reason and one reason only: to seduce their husbands. To ensure their pre-nuptial agreement will be null and void thanks to a little loophole known as the Infidelity Clause. To ensure that those wives don’t find themselves on the other side of a divorce without a penny to their name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the Eves, Sienna’s one of the best because she follows the number one rule of the Eves to the letter: don’t let it get personal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the job file of her wealthiest client yet falls into her lap, Sienna realizes that this case could be the one that’s impossible to detach herself from. The payout would lead to her independence, but will the cost be too high in the end?</description>

  <description>Since her parents' bitter divorce, Mclean and her dad, a restaurant consultant, have been on the move - four towns in two years. Estranged from her mother and her mother's new family, Mclean has followed her dad in leaving the unhappy past behind. And each new place gives her a chance to try out a new persona: from cheerleader to drama diva. But now, for the first time, Mclean discovers a desire to stay in one place and just be herself - whoever that is. Perhaps her neighbor Dave, an academic superstar trying to be just a regular guy, can help her find out. Combining Sarah Dessen's trademark graceful writing, great characters, and compelling storytelling, "What Happened to Goodbye" is irresistible reading. &lt;br&gt; Watch a Video&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Alrik is determined to keep sex with Ben simple, but when wolves, shifters and bullets enter their world, all bets are off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Ben Cook has devoted his life to saving the Mexican Grey wolf population from extinction. A year after being shot while looking for a large pack of Mexican greys, he’s determined to try again. When Ben’s sister hires one of the C-7 shifters to protect him on his mission, he feels an immediate and undeniable attraction to the huge blond protector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alrik’s body yearns for his client on sight, but for a shifter who prefers sex without sentiment, Ben presents a problem. Centuries earlier, Alrik learned that love was a worthless emotion that only served to trap those stupid enough to fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alrik is determined to keep sex with Ben simple, but when wolves, shifters and bullets enter their world, all bets are off.</description>

  <description>Death Finds Love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently appointed as Death, Gabriel’s life can’t get much worse. His underworld is in shambles, and he’s racing demons to collect souls in the human world. To add to his mess, he discovers that his predecessor raised an unwelcome Immortal from the dead, one who threatens the Immortal Council that his friend, the Ancient Rhyn, is trying to hold together. When the underworld shuts Gabriel out, he’s convinced he’s hit rock bottom. Until he meets her, and he realizes things can get worse. Much worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now in human form, Deidre – Gabriel’s predecessor and long-time tormenter – is dying from a brain tumor. Rather than mourn, she decides to enjoy the rest of her short life by checking off every box on her bucket list. Little does she suspect that a weekend getaway to the beach will throw her into the hands of Death himself and overturn everything she knows about her world. Deidre has no idea who she was in her past life, but she must learn fast, or she’ll never understand why the Immortals, demons and Death alike are after her. The secret is buried in her head, and the only way to uncover it will kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To survive, she must reach the wounded man behind the mask of Death and show him that the world is filled with more than tragedy and pain.</description>

  <description>Set against the back drop of the cities of Monte Carlo, London and the beautiful snow covered mountains of Switzerland meet three men who are fighting their way through the hidden truths of their complicated pasts. Their lives are intertwined in more ways than they can see and only working through the truths hidden deep within each of them can they free themselves and find the love that they are searching for. Each of them need the other in a way not even themselves can understand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first of three books following the complicated lives of Jamie Burton a three time Winter Olympic gold medallist, Valerio Capelli an Italian bike racing protégé and Scot a billionaire business genius. All three are stunning and sexy in different ways. All three desire the same thing, sex, love and freedom from their pasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Burton is an enigmatic, beautiful, intoxicating person who entices those around him without him even trying. He's someone who appears to have it all. Good looks, good nature, wealth. How appearances can be deceiving. He has a crippling emotional fear of love and relationships stemming from his painful childhood. Mix that with his obsessive compulsion to remain clean and controlled and Jamie has no chance at falling in love. That may change when he meets Valerio Capelli. An innocent curly haired eighteen year old Italian bike racing protégé who lives life to the fullest and races at two hundred miles an hour on the world’s fastest racetracks. He’s warm and relaxed and undecided about his sexuality. Everything Jamie is afraid off but he can't stop the pull this enigmatic creature has over him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just like Jamie Valerio is hiding the truth about his past, only by overcoming his fears and his hidden pain can he truly move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Valerio may be Jamie's future but his past is constantly around him. Meet Scot the intense but stunning business man who appears to have nothing with Jamie apart from their passionate sex life. He’s a billionaire playboy who is controlled arrogant and powerful but weak around Jamie. When they meet both are lost and not just in their lust for each other but from the hidden secrets in their past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sees things in Jamie that even he can't see, the truth shines from his black eyes tempting Jamie back into his arms I a way he doesn’t understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All three have hidden the truth for so long about so many things. All have dark issues which can't be spoken about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s hidden in the fog of Jamie’s mind? What’s missing?&lt;br&gt;Can these two men in his life help free him from his pain? Or will they push him the edge of his sanity in their attempts to make him love?</description>

  <description>Annie is not enjoying her roaring-twenties as much as she should be. She’s been jilted at the altar by Stephen-the-indecisive, is paying off a mountain of wedding debt by holding down two jobs, and her flat is mostly made of cardboard and spackle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then at work she meets a man in need of a date to his ex-fiancée’s wedding. Annie goes, and one wedding and four bottles of wine later, she finds herself getting married in Vegas to Dorian, an erotic illustrator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, it’s all great and romantic, until someone loses an eye, which here means, ‘until Annie gets home, and realizes that her best friend (and boss) Will, has kind of been working up to popping the question himself. Will is not happy to see Annie married, in fact he’s willing to trade his Mohawk and every Ke$ha CD he owns to get Dorian out of the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that wasn’t enough to make things tense at work, Annie’s best-work-friend Yvonne (who knows something really fun you can do with a rugby player, some roller skates and chocolate spread) can’t resist getting involved in Annie’s love life. Neither can Dorian’s kleptomaniac sister Fifi, Dorian’s ex-bride and Annie’s mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In between breaking into cafés, having her door kicked down by the police and trying not to kill each and every one of her friends and relatives, Annie tries to work out how the hell her life got so complicated.</description>

  <description>Eli Thompson is the once golden-boy son of Oak Island’s preacher. Since the death of his mother, Eli has fallen foul of everything his father holds dear – indulging in drink, drugs, women and men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a dark and desperate secret weighing on him, Eli is determined to lose himself to vice, no matter what the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Fisher is a twenty-six year old high-school janitor. He spends his days cleaning the school, and his nights taking care of his seventeen-year-old brother, Cory. With an alcoholic father to support, Daniel’s plate is full, even before one of the school’s students decides to seduce him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eli enters his life, Daniel is too lost in his own despair to consider the consequences of their fling, and as he grows closer to Eli, and to the boy’s damaged former choirboy persona, he realises that all is not as it seems with the teenager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, neither of them knows the secret that connects them and their families. A secret that will eventual break their hearts afresh, and test their new relationship to its limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A secret that lies in their very blood.</description>

  <description>Kendall Monroe is handcuffed to a car in the desert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this life imitating art or art imitating life? The only thing he’s sure of is that the situation he finds himself in is a copy of a scene he filmed earlier, only this time, there is no director yelling “cut” and no crew to rescue him. Terrified for his life, Kendall takes comfort remembering happier times with his long-time lover, Johnny. He hasn’t seen Johnny in weeks since Johnny stayed behind to finish his latest best-selling novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he attempts to survive scorching-hot days and freezing nights, Kendall tries to figure out who did this to him. Could it be Johnny, or the research assistant he suspects Johnny is having an affair with? Both options fill him with bitterness. Or is it a more likely suspect? Kendall has a stalker who sends him flowers and always seems to know where he is. But what does this stranger have to gain by leaving Kendall stranded in the middle of nowhere?</description>

  <description>My name is Tate. He doesn't call me that, though. He would never refer to me so informally, if he referred to me at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We're neighbors, and once, we were best friends. But then, one summer, he turned on me and has made it his mission to screw up my life at every opportunity. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got more sadistic as time wore on, and I made myself sick trying to hide from him. I worried about what was around every corner and behind every door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So I left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I spent a year studying abroad and bathed in the freedom of life without Jared. Now I'm back to finish up high school and get the hell out of here forever. I'm hoping that after a year of breathing room, he's moved on and forgotten all about me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But even if he hasn't changed, I have. I'm not interested in avoiding him or turning the other cheek anymore. We're going to go head to head, because neither of us wants to back down.</description>

  <description>They once faced each other on a battlefield. Now soldier-turned-spy Jonathan Reese must keep watch over the man he’s never forgotten. A close encounter reveals Karl von Binder, the count’s son, also recalls the day he spared Jonathan’s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparks fly between the former enemies and Jonathan begins to lose perspective on his mission. He knows he must maintain distance because the heat he encounters in Karl’s touch stirs him far too deeply for his own good. He can’t keep away -- especially when he suspects someone is trying to kill the nobleman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spy becomes a protector as Jonathan guards the man he’s begun to care for. Together the men try to puzzle out who would benefit from Karl’s death -- and how much they’re willing to trust each other when a torrid sexual fling threatens to become an affair of the heart.</description>

  <description>Calvin Quarry thinks Felix Bracks is a fantastic lover. He fulfills all of Cal’s deepest fantasies, allowing him to fully embrace the wanton side of his sexuality. But Cal’s fantasy shatters when he realizes Felix was the driver in a fatal accident that killed Cal’s best friend back in high school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgiving Felix his past digressions is hard, but when Cal’s young cousin Robby becomes entangled in a dark and dangerous affair, Cal realizes there’s more to both their stories than what meets the eye. As a journalism major, Cal has a duty to not only shed light on the sinister world young Robby has stumbled into, but also to uncover the truth about Felix’s accident so many years before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But those they fight have power, and ways of making them and their families suffer. Cal and Felix have to be willing to sacrifice everything to stop these horrors from happening again. But this wasn’t what either signed up for. This was supposed to be a casual sex hookup anonymously scheduled online. Can they truly trust each other enough to bring the crimes of the past to light, or will their budding relationship be demolished in the process?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Desire. Destruction. Destiny.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas Myrdin knows that intrigue is part of life at court, but that doesn’t make his king’s betrayal any easier to take. Yet heartbreak troubles him less than the apocalyptic visions that haunt him. Fiery premonitions that show the world burning in ruins—and the cause, the king’s daughter. Visions and vengeance awaken a strange new power within him, but not even he is sure if he is the kingdom’s savior, the king’s pawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Adam Wexley harbors a secret longing for the elegant Thomas, but his duty is to protect the newborn princess. When a sudden threat arises, Adam seeks to procure services of Grand Magician Zachary Drake. Even if it means sacrificing his own soul—and his body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drake has seen the worst of kings and courtiers. Now he protects himself with powerful sorcery and the adamant refusal to affiliate with any of the Four Courts. But the grand magician isn’t without weaknesses and Adam may be the one enticement that could draw him to ruin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a rising storm of magic with the power to strip away men’s souls, the thread of desire connecting three men could be the kingdom’s last lifeline…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This story contains men, magic, man-on-man moments, orangutans speaking in sign language, beehive hairdos and an army of soulless janitors that seeks to destroy them all.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Kyle Jackowski, typical sullen emo teen, struggles to find a way to deal with his sexuality and finds himself in trouble with the law… again. But instead of being sent to a juvenile detention center like he expected, he is given a chance to commute his sentence by working on a farm for the summer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Sam, son of the farm owners, who shows Kyle what he feels is perfectly normal and that he doesn’t have to hide from his feelings. In turn, Sam’s parents show Kyle that his abusive stepfather and battered mother are not the norm. With their love and support, Kyle finds his place in the world—by Sam’s side.</description>

  <description>Cory’s life has a deadline, and he’s working hard to make the most of the time he has left. He knows he won’t be able to complete everything on his bucket list, but the first entry is the most important to him. He wants to come out to his intensely religious family so they’ll remember him a little more accurately once he’s gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Tai falls for Cory, he does his best to convince Cory to date him. When he’s turned down flat, he talks Cory into a one night stand, knowing that once he gets under his coworker’s skin, Cory will want more. Much more. Tai knows that a relationship with Cory is going to be complicated, but he has some impressive persuasion techniques up his sleeve. He’s giving Cory the chance to fall in love—one thing that Cory has refused to add to his bucket list because he never thought it could happen</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A standalone contemporary romance novel about love, hate, cruelty and forgiveness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her name is Lana. She wasn’t dealt the easiest cards in life. She wasn’t dealt the hardest. She has an illness, but she doesn’t let it rule her. The first time she laid eyes on her best friend’s twin brother she fell in love at first sight. It didn’t last very long. He was a hateful boy who made her miserable. The happiest day of her life was when he moved away to London six years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Robert. He breaks the ones who love him. He’s always liked to play games with Lana, see how far he could push her. He once thrived on her pain, but no more. Now she’s coming to London to live with his sister for the summer and this time he plans on being her friend instead of her tormentor. But Lana is scarred by his past bullying. She doesn’t trust him, nor does she have any reason to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the two find themselves living under the same roof, they call a truce. This summer will change both of their lives, as they put their history aside and learn one another from scratch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fear takes over, we use cruelty as a mask. Robert and Lana’s story will see their masks slip away as the love they felt on the inside shows its true face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Not suitable for younger readers. Contains strong language and scenes of a sexual nature.**</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;True love can last an eternity . . . but immortality comes at a price. . . .&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the midnight shift at a hospital in rural Maine, Dr. Luke Findley is expecting another quiet evening of frostbite and the occasional domestic dispute. But the minute Lanore McIlvrae&amp;amp;#8212;Lanny&amp;amp;#8212;walks into his ER, she changes his life forever. A mysterious woman with a past and plenty of dark secrets, Lanny is unlike anyone Luke has ever met. He is inexplicably drawn to her . . . despite the fact that she is a murder suspect with a police escort. And as she begins to tell her story, a story of enduring love and consummate betrayal that transcends time and mortality, Luke finds himself utterly captivated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her impassioned account begins at the turn of the nineteenth century in the same small town of St. Andrew, Maine, back when it was a Puritan settlement. Consumed as a child by her love for the son of the town&amp;amp;#8217;s founder, Lanny will do anything to be with him forever. But the price she pays is steep&amp;amp;#8212;an immortal bond that chains her to a terrible fate for all eternity. And now, two centuries later, the key to her healing and her salvation lies with Dr. Luke Findley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part historical novel, part supernatural page-turner, &lt;em&gt;The Taker&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable tale about the power of unrequited love not only to elevate and sustain, but also to blind and ultimately destroy, and how each of us is responsible for finding our own path to redemption.</description>

  <description>A run through the woods turned anything but typical when Levi found the one thing he never expected to find-his mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a week spent in family reunion hell, Levi Travis is more than ready for a little break. But who knew shifting into a snow leopard and loping around in the woods could turn into such a steamy event?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Levi encounters a cougar shifter in the woods, the attraction is so hot it threatens to shoot off sparks. Levi has fantasised about having a stronger man than him want him, and he’s sure the cougar is just such a man. Which is why Levi lets himself get caught, and the intensity of their mating is only equaled by Levi’s confusion when the man shifts back into a cougar then turns tail and runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lyndon Hines has been running for months. Hunted, taunted, he didn’t know what else to do-until he met a man who made him realise that some things were worth fighting for. Two shifters, each a different breed, neither knowing much about their heritage, Levi and Lyndon come together and find the strength to take on the mad man who is out to end Lyndon’s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Advisory: This book is part of a series but can be read as a stand alone.</description>

  <description>When Chip Riley's beloved granny passes away, she leaves him all her money, her land, and a house that needs some tender love and care. She never mentioned the legacy comes with a Native American shifter who intends to claim Chip as his mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Sky has lived since buffalo roamed the land. When his totem spirit, a black cougar, saves a little girl, he doesn’t realize that generations later, her grandson will become his mate, leaving him to take on a modern man with modern ideas. But that’s the least of his problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garon, another shifter with a long-held hatred for Jason, plots to kidnap Chip and lure Jason to his death. Soon Chip finds himself in an untenable position between a rock and a hard place. A leap of faith may be the only way to save himself and the man he’s learned to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;“For now, you stay where I put you.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s the first thing he says to me after I undress, when he presses me up against the glass and positions me just so. I’d ask him to tell me more, but he’s got a fetish for self-denial, and if I push I might not get to touch him at all. That’s the last thing I want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing is, I don’t have to listen to him. What we do together, it’s completely voluntary and pretty undefined. We set up a meeting, he gives me directions, I obey. He’s not paying me, not coercing me, and he knows if he tried to do either I’d be gone. We didn’t meet in a club; it’s remarkable that we met at all, when we live in two very different worlds. He likes to look, to touch, but he almost never gets off. I like the feeling of his eyes on me, I like doing all the things he says, but I want more. How do I push the boundaries when I barely know what they are?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A handsome young man, wearing only tight boxer-briefs pulled slightly down to bare his buttocks, stands at a window, hands flat on the glass, his well-defined muscles on display. It’s early in the morning, overcast, but the man’s not looking outside, he’s facing the camera. His expression betrays many emotions, a shy wariness, annoyance, a touch of hurt, and perhaps a little anger. He’s stunning. You can’t look away. That expression beguiles— what does it mean?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

They have a new apartment, new jobs, a new life.  Everything looks perfect... or is it?&lt;br&gt;Leaving Morewell was a big step for the couple, but for Norah, she moved with the knowledge that there could be more secrets Clint could be keeping, more deception that could bring her whole world crashing down.  She took the step knowing the truth would be lurking in the shadows, waiting for her to find it.

  <description>Aiden has a few simple goals in life—teach his students well, find a stable lover and stop lusting after the sexy local sheriff. He’s pretty sure the guy is straight, after all, his son is one of Aiden’s students. It’s best for everyone if he keeps his eyes (and hands) to himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Knox has other plans. The prickly little tutor who teaches his son is pretty damn sexy and so easy to tease. When they find themselves alone for the evening, he decides he’s only going to get one chance to see if Aiden is always that uptight or if he lets loose when he’s in bed.</description>

  <description>Vee Bell is certain of one irrefutable truth--her sister's friend Sophie didn't kill herself. She was murdered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vee knows this because she was there. Everyone believes Vee is narcoleptic, but she doesn't actually fall asleep during these episodes: When she passes out, she slides into somebody else's mind and experiences the world through that person's eyes. She's slid into her sister as she cheated on a math test, into a teacher sneaking a drink before class. She learned the worst about a supposed "friend" when she slid into her during a school dance. But nothing could have prepared Vee for what happens one October night when she slides into the mind of someone holding a bloody knife, standing over Sophie's slashed body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vee desperately wishes she could share her secret, but who would believe her? It sounds so crazy that she can't bring herself to tell her best friend, Rollins, let alone the police. Even if she could confide in Rollins, he has been acting distant lately, especially now that she's been spending more time with Zane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enmeshed in a terrifying web of secrets, lies, and danger and with no one to turn to, Vee must find a way to unmask the killer before he or she strikes again.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Every future has dirty roots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marooned in the galactic backwaters of the HardCell company, colonist Runt struggles to eke out an existence on a newly-terraformed tropical planetoid. Since his clone-wife died on entry, he’s been doing the work of two on his failing protein farm. Overworked and undersized, Runt’s dwindling hope of earning corporate citizenship has turned to fear of violent “retirement.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an overdue crate of provisions crashes on his beach, Runt searches frantically for a replacement wife among the tools and food. Instead he gets Ox, a mute hulk who seems more like a corporate assassin than a simple offworld farmer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shackwacky and near-starving, Runt has no choice but to work with his silent partner despite his mounting paranoia and the unsettling appeal of Ox’s genetically altered pheromones. Ox plays the part of the gentle giant well, but Runt’s still not convinced he hasn’t arrived with murder in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between brutal desire and the seeds of a relationship, Runt’s fears and Ox’s inhuman past collide on a fertile world where hope and love just might have room to grow.</description>

  <description>Nathan Kohn has been teaching Aquatic Science at St. Genevieve College for 15 years. It’s not a perfect situation, but he's resigned to being a gay man in a straight culture, a Jew among Catholics and single in a world of couples. Until the stunningly attractive Isaac Wolf appears in his classroom. Isaac is a few years older than his fellow students, brilliant, self-composed and Jewish. Wouldn't Nathan's mother be pleased? Except, of course, relationships between faculty and students are forbidden, especially those not sanctioned by the Church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isaac has his own secrets, which Nathan finds out when he visits the racy new club downtown where boys can be bought in the back room. Behind the beaded curtain, the man on his knees turns out to be Isaac. What happens in the club stays there, right? Except Nathan's mind isn't the only thing Isaac blows, and Nathan can't stop thinking about that night. But what kind of future can there be for a college professor and a rent boy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>What would you change?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imprisoned in the heart of a secret military base, Em has nothing except the voice of the boy in the cell next door and the list of instructions she finds taped inside the drain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Em can complete the final instruction. She’s tried everything to prevent the creation of a time machine that will tear the world apart. She holds the proof: a list she has never seen before, written in her own hand. Each failed attempt in the past has led her to the same terrible present—imprisoned and tortured by a sadistic man called the doctor while war rages outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marina has loved her best friend, James, since they were children. A gorgeous, introverted science prodigy from one of America’s most famous families, James finally seems to be seeing Marina in a new way, too. But on one disastrous night, James’s life crumbles, and with it, Marina’s hopes for their future. Marina will protect James, no matter what. Even if it means opening her eyes to a truth so terrible that she may not survive it... at least, not as the girl she once was. Em and Marina are in a race against time that only one of them can win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Our Yesterdays&lt;/em&gt; is a wrenching, brilliantly plotted story of fierce love, unthinkable sacrifice, and the infinite implications of our every choice.</description>

  <description>When mega movie star and two time Academy Award winner, Austin Grainger voluntarily gave up his dazzling film career, his adoring fan base thought he’d lost his mind. For Austin, the seclusion of fifteen hundred acres in the middle of Texas sounds like paradise. No more cameras, paparazzi, or overzealous media to hound him every day and night. Little did the sexiest man alive know when one door closes, another usually opens. And Austin’s opened by way of a sexy, hot ranch owner right next door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kitt Kelly wasn’t your average rancher. He’s young, well educated and has hidden his sexuality for most of his life. When his long time wet dream materializes as his new neighbor it threatens everything he holds dear. No way the ranching community would ever accept him if he came out. With every part of his life riding on the edge, can Kitt risk it all for a chance at love or will responsibility to his family heritage cost him his one chance at happiness?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;Tell me about a day in the life of this sexbot. Maybe it’s the day he’s first been unpacked and settled into his new home! Maybe it’s sometime after he’s settled into a routine. And what IS that routine, anyway? Is he privately owned? Is he on staff at a sexy high-tech brothel? Has he become self-aware enough to run away from the sexy high-tech brothel and follow his heart circuits in search of a better life and someone who can love a synthetic man?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A human-like robot, apparently naked, lies on a bed of packing peanuts. He has just been unboxed, and waits for his new owner’s first orders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>1969 high school freshman Nick Horton has problems. He's an easy target for bullies, a social outcast who dreams of being popular, and he doesn't understand why he's not attracted to girls. After a series of misunderstandings label him a troublemaker, he's delighted to have Jesse and his gang befriend him. But while Nick just wants to explore his growing attraction to Bobby, Jesse promises to give him a new image and transforms the shy loser into an anti-establishment student hero. Thanks to his new reputation, Nick soon finds himself besieged by would-be girlfriends and expectations that he live up to his public image. If it wasn't tough pretending to be straight, now he's got to act cool too! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick's freshman year is a remarkable journey of ridiculous misadventures, unexpected psychedelic explorations, and heartbreaking tragedy. As he struggles to understand his emerging romance with Bobby he must confront the dangerous goings-on at school and the Vietnam War's destructive impact on his family. Is a world still reeling from the sexual revolution and the illicit pleasures of underage drinking and marijuana ready to accept two boys in love? Can Nick and Bobby's relationship survive a world where acid rock rules, status is everything and being gay is the last taboo?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nominated for the &lt;strong&gt;2014 Stonewall Book Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

  <description>What would you do if you lost five years of freedom? If everything you'd ever known was torn away from you, all because the one person you counted on to save you didn't come through?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the cruel reality for Gabriel “Red” Thatcher, convicted at age nineteen for the murder of his father. Now twenty-five and eight months out of prison, Red has nothing to his name and no one to help him. He is carrying close to him a rage hotter than white flames. Had his sister just testified on his behalf in court, he could have been spared the horrible things that happened to him in the doghouse. Things that'll make him never look at intimacy the same way again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Red can't take swallowing his bitter rage alone anymore. Unable to kill the growing loneliness and ire with time, he heads into the Flower District in search of a gay bar to drown his sorrows. There he meets the bubbly, easy-on-the-eyes Silo Winters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Red learns that Silo did three years in prison for an accidental oil fire, he brings Silo home, not so much for a wild romp as to relieve his aching loneliness. Besides if anyone will understand Red's pain it'll be Silo, who's gone through some of the same horrors he has. However, he definitely doesn't count on Silo becoming so much more than a sexy shoulder to lean on. Now, if only Red can learn to let him in.</description>

  <description>Atlanta: it's the promised city for the off-worlders, foreigners from the alternate dimensions of heaven-like Elysia and hell-like Charbydon. Some bring good works and miracles. And some bring unimaginable evil....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie Madigan is a divorced mother of one, and a kick-ass cop trained to take down the toughest human and off-world criminals. She's recently returned from the dead after a brutal attack, an unexplained revival that has left her plagued by ruthless nightmares and random outbursts of strength that make doing her job for Atlanta P.D.'s Integration Task Force even harder. Since the Revelation, the criminal element in Underground Atlanta has grown, leaving Charlie and her partner Hank to keep the chaos to a dull roar. But now an insidious new danger is descending on her city with terrifying speed, threatening innocent lives: a deadly, off-world narcotic known as ash. Charlie is determined to uncover the source of ash before it targets another victim -- but can she protect those she loves from a force more powerful than heaven and hell combined?</description>

  <description>For Captain Harry Thompson, the command of the prison transport ship HMS Banshee is his opportunity to prove his worth, working-class origins be damned. But his criminal attraction to his upper-crust First Lieutenant, Garnet Littleton, threatens to overturn all he’s ever worked for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lust quickly proves to be the least of his problems, however. The deadly combination of typhus, rioting convicts, and a monstrous storm destroys his prospects . . . and shipwrecks him and Garnet on their own private island. After months of solitary paradise, the journey back to civilization—surviving mutineers, exposure, and desertion—is the ultimate test of their feelings for each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These two very different men each record their story for an unfathomable future in which the tale of their love—a love punishable by death in their own time—can finally be told. Today, dear reader, it is at last safe for you to hear it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This is a revised, stand-alone edition of the story originally published in the Hidden Conflict anthology in 2009.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A magical weekend, a breathless declaration, a happy ever after . . . Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Malcolm Kavanagh took his first step toward emotional maturity by declaring his love to Owen Watson, that was just the first chapter in their story.  Anyone who’s ever been in love knows that happy endings take a lot more work than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One problem: Malcolm has never been in love. He doesn’t know the rules of a relationship and isn’t confident enough to trust that his is real. He learns the ropes by sharing his life and his flat with Owen, but relationship boot camp proves a challenge. Everything is a struggle, from accepting Owen’s low-status job to putting his boyfriend above his personal trainer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily, Owen knows a little more about relationships, and labors patiently to survive the first six weeks of their life together. From the art galleries of Cambridge to the tawdry majesty of the Dominion theatre, Owen adapts to England while Malcolm adapts to the whole human race. Maybe, if Owen is patient enough and Malcolm learns to give, the two of them can make it past Relationship Armageddon to a real happy ending.</description>

  <description>No one would suspect shy Lily Calloway’s biggest secret. While everyone is dancing at college bars, Lily stays in the bathroom. To get laid. Her compulsion leads her to one-night stands, steamy hookups and events she shamefully regrets. The only person who knows her secret happens to have one of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loren Hale’s best friend is his bottle of bourbon. Lily comes at a close second. For three years, they’ve pretended to be in a real relationship, hiding their addictions from their families. They’ve mastered the art of concealing flasks and random guys that filter in and out of their apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when they go on a family boat trip, surrounded by open seas and limited male bodies in sight, Lily’s confronted with a big fear. Only one guy onboard can fill her addiction, and she’s sworn off going &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; with Loren Hale ever again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the only person who can truly help her can barely help himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;**This is a New Adult book recommended for readers 18 and up**&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sean and Michael are best friends from the minute they meet and become roommates. But after supporting Sean in the wake of his brother’s death, Michael finds himself questioning his sexuality and thinking about his roommate in a totally unexpected light. After all, he and Sean are straight—or so he thought. Suddenly Michael’s not so sure any more. He turns to their gay housemate, Evan, for advice. Little does he know he’s not the only one seeking Evan’s help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael and Sean are both thrilled to explore their newly discovered feelings for each other, but not everyone shares their enthusiasm. When the reality of homophobia intrudes on their academic and personal lives and threatens their happiness, the adversity should draw them closer. Instead, it drives a dangerous wedge between them and puts their relationship, their futures, and their health at risk.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A Seductive Nighttime World...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Emily Drake's psychotherapy patients tend to be a little unusual. Instead of midlife crises and mother fixations, Emily treats vampires with blood phobias and sex-demons looking for meaningful relationships. But healing these powerful beings requires an important rule: Never trust a shifter. Especially not one like Detective Colin Gyth, whose gold-flecked eyes and predatory air make Emily realize how much she longs to lose control...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A Dark And Dangerous Hunger...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin can't believe the doctor he has to work with on the Night Butcher murder case is the one person who could expose his true identity as a wolf shifter. Smart and sexy, Emily brings out the alpha male in Colin, unleashing a wild desire that takes them both over the edge.... But in the shadows, the Night Butcher waits, eager to spill Emily's blood and taste her terror. And he'll use any means to destroy her, including the one person she has grown to trust...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A childhood of abuse has left Avery so physically and emotionally scarred he believes he shouldn't be alive. His only sanctuary has been his relationship with his older foster brother Sam. Avery finally lets Sam convince him to start therapy to help overcome his crippling anxiety, but even that can't prepare him for the upheaval caused by meeting Noah Yates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah is everything Avery fears.  He's large and physically powerful—and undeniably capable of destroying Avery's hard-earned progress. Although Noah seems to have a tender streak when it comes to him, Avery is terrified of being victimized again. But no matter how many times he tries to push him away, Noah never goes far. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah wants to save Avery,  but can he be the catalyst Avery needs to begin the journey out of the blackness?</description>

  <description>For the past two years, Willow James has been building the perfect life--a life that centers around Dustin Rant, her dimpled, sports-car-driving, cologne-wearing boyfriend. Willow and Dustin have lots of plans. Plans for college, prom, tonight actually. So, when the unthinkable happens, and Dustin breaks up with Willow over a plate of cheese fries at a steak house, she is left stunned and heartbroken. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With less than two months until graduation, Willow has to start a new life from scratch. She'll have to revisit old wrongs along the way and make the most important decision of all: who does she want to be? She’s going to have help from her wacky ex-best friend, her bohemian mother, and an old flame that is suddenly and somewhat inconveniently back in her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;See the man on the left, holding that baby? Yes, that’s me. I worked in a condom company as a quality product supervisor. You would think that it would get me lots of dates, right? WRONG. It seems that once people know where I work, all they want is free condom samples. Damn it. &lt;br&gt;But then I met this guy (you decide HOW) and he has this most amazing baby— I could fall for him, I swear. But then he told me HOW he ended up with the baby. Broken condom. And it’s the condom products from the company where I work. In which I am responsible to supervise the quality.&lt;br&gt;*head desk*&lt;br&gt;How can I possibly have my HEA with him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two men stand close together at a park, laughing toward the camera. The man in front holds a baby in a soft, blue denim dress. The man holding the baby has dark brown hair and the one standing behind him has sandy brown hair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When you reach the edge, you can’t avoid taking a leap of faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Dexter leads a complicated life. In one world he is a consultant criminal psychologist—in another he runs The Edge, a successful corporate training company. He’s also an active Dom in the London BDSM scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A social call to The Underground, a club owned by an old friend, turns into much more when Joe is introduced to a prospective sub. Falling hard for the boy’s tumbling blonde curls, huge blue eyes and desperate need for protection, Joe carefully coaxes him out of his shell. By the end of an intense weekend, unbreakable bonds have been forged and Joe is well on the way to becoming Olly’s Master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe knows that there is trauma in Olly’s past, but it is not until his professional and private lives collide that Joe discovers the truth. He knows he shouldn’t have let Olly out of his sight but it’s too late—Olly’s old Master is back on the scene and he’s not in the mood to forgive and forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Olly’s life on the line, Joe risks everything to save him. Has Joe found his perfect submissive only to lose him in a horrible twist of fate, or will love win the day? They’ve reached the edge and there’s no avoiding a leap of faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains scenes of D/s, including chastity play, and references to past rape and current PTSD. There are also non-consensual plot elements with an aggressive former Master which include kidnapping, bondage and the forcible insertion of a butt plug.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Set in the same world as Scarred and Kilt and Mine to Chase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lacey hunts vampires—vile monsters who leave death and shattered lives in their wake. They murdered her sister and she wants revenge. Until she captures a big, sexy, blue-eyed vamp, and the strong attraction she feels contradicts everything she’s become. But she can’t resist getting closer. Just looking at him makes her mouth water and her thighs clench.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lethal can’t believe the little lass got the better of him. He’s been drugged and chained, but he’s more insulted than concerned. She’s bold, fearless, as she straddles his hips and threatens to use his body, teach him how it feels to be taken without consent. Now he’s intrigued and eager to get her out of her clothes. She swears he’s the enemy, but he’s determined to be her lover.</description>

  <description>Hot on the heels of a nasty break-up, Natalie’s truck dies and strands her deep in Louisiana’s sweltering backwoods. A glow beyond the trees and a haunting melody lead her to what she hopes is salvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shivaree is more than a bar. It’s a mysterious oasis where people go to escape into a cold drink and lose themselves against a warm body on the dance floor. Gabriel is its resident musician, gifted with unnerving talent and intoxicating sexual charisma. The only thing standing between Natalie and the perfect rebound is Gabriel’s possessive and domineering lover, and Natalie’s not afraid of a bully. Certainly not one built like Shane Broussard. She’s ready to discover the perfect remedy for heartache—two hot male bodies, one long, sultry, southern night.</description>

  <description>Swathed in chiffon and lace, Steven Stanhope owns the stage as Stevie Tricks, lip-synching the songs of the famous gypsy queen. But after he escapes an abusive Master/slave relationship, the only collar he'll allow around his neck is black velvet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a four-year absence, Steve is ready to reclaim his life and the property he left behind. But is it safe? Definitely not if his ex is still into leather. To find out, Steve appears at a charity night for the local BDSM community, using the anonymity of his stage persona to mask his identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of his ex-Master, Julius, Steve finds a tangled mess centered around another Master of Leather, Donato Rossi. In order to unravel their ties to the past, Steve and Don must find common ground and work together. In the process, they learn that when it comes to love, sometimes you have to make your own rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Many are called...&lt;br&gt;She alone can save the world and become Death's bride.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cobweb Bride&lt;/em&gt; is a history-flavored fantasy novel with romantic elements of the Persephone myth, about Death's ultimatum to the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if you killed someone and then fell in love with them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an alternate Renaissance world, somewhere in an imaginary "pocket" of Europe called the Kingdom of Lethe, Death comes, in the form of a grim Spaniard, to claim his Bride. Until she is found, in a single time-stopping moment all dying stops. There is no relief for the mortally wounded and the terminally ill....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Covered in white cobwebs of a thousand snow spiders she lies in the darkness... Her skin is cold as snow... Her eyes frozen... Her gaze, fiercely alive...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While kings and emperors send expeditions to search for a suitable Bride for Death, armies of the undead wage an endless war... A black knight roams the forest at the command of his undead father ... Spies and political treacheries abound at the imperial Silver Court.... Murdered lovers find themselves locked in the realm of the living...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look closer — through the cobweb filaments of her hair and along each strand shine stars...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And one small village girl, Percy—an unwanted, ungainly middle daughter—is faced with the responsibility of granting her dying grandmother the desperate release she needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, Percy joins the crowds of other young women of the land in a desperate quest to Death's own mysterious holding in the deepest forests of the North...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And everyone is trying to stop her.</description>

  <description>In Japan, they say there’s a red thread of fate that binds people who are destined to meet, regardless of time, place, or circumstance. It may tangle, it may knot, it may stretch or fray, but it will never break. It is a future as indelible as the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope that isn't true. I pity anyone destined to meet me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Bianca Ray, the past is always catching up, one way or another. Now in her third semester at college, it's doing it again. Too much drinking has led to plummeting grades and rising absences, putting her scholarships in peril. When she makes it clear that she needs help—all over the floor of her history class—she’s given one last chance to shape up: seek therapy and bring her grades up by the end of the semester, or she’s out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Catholic seminarian Daniel McGuire. The last thing Bianca wants is an aspiring priest to counsel her on how to live her life, but the handsome graduate student is different from the holy rollers she fled from at home. Gentle and unobtrusive, he helps her pick up the pieces and find a new way to live: not running from the past, but facing it head on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But opening up her heart to release the pain means that something else can come in. As Bianca and Daniel grow closer, their relationship moves onto dangerous ground and the fragile courage Bianca has built up threatens to fail her. Can she exorcise the ghosts of her past, or will they catch hold and drag her down where not even Daniel can reach her?</description>

  <description>All Parker Anderson has ever wanted is to take over as CEO of Anderson Industries when his father retires. But when his father is ready to leave the company, he doesn’t plan to pass the reins to Parker. Instead, he plans to sell the company, jeopardizing not only Parker’s job but hundreds of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parker finds an unlikely ally in Mason Pike, the company’s resident IT guru. What starts as a flirtation takes them from coworkers to coconspirators in a plan to forcibly buy Anderson Industries out from under Parker’s father. While they focus on the buyout, their budding romance has to be put on hold, but that doesn't stop them from flirting and teasing each other to distraction—and once their master plan comes to fruition, nothing and no one can keep them apart.</description>

  <description>Carson O’Shaughnessy has one task: track down his boss’s flighty nephew, Stassy, and return the kid to Chicago. Then Carson can go back to waiting tables and being productively bitter about his life. He didn’t count on finding a dead body in Stassy’s bed, and he certainly didn’t count on the guy in the flip-flops and cutoffs at the local café helping him get to the bottom of the crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Dale Arden is no ordinary surfing burnout—he’s actually a pretty sharp guy with a seductive voice and a bossy streak wider than the Florida panhandle. When he decides to boss Carson right into his bed, Carson realizes Stassy's not the only one who's been lost. Carson likes to think he’s got his life all figured out, that sex with guys is your basic broom-closet transaction; he may just have to revise his priorities, because nobody plans on taking a left at St. Truth-be-Well and finding love at the Bates Parrot Hotel.</description>

  <description>On holiday in the Austrian Lakes, Simon Lavoisier, an attorney from Britain, tells himself he's just looking for a little holiday fling to spice up his apple strudel. But he's never been good at keeping things casual, and it's not long before he finds himself falling for Matt, the handsome waiter at the Konigshof Hotel with whom he's been passionately dallying. Matt, on the other hand, has learned the hard way the dangers of getting in too deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When secrets and lies from both men's pasts come to the fore, it's anyone's guess as to whether this fledgling romance will hit the peaks - or sink without trace beneath the icy waters of Lake Wolfgang...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not easy for a young gay artist like Jordan Carson to grow up in Jefferson, Wisconsin, where all anyone seems to care about in middle school and high school are the sports teams. But Jordan was lucky. He met Owen Nelson in the second grade, and they’ve been BFFs ever since. Owen is a big, beautiful blond and their school’s champion wrestler. No one messes with Owen, or with anyone close to him, and he bucks popular opinion by keeping Jordan as his wingman even after Jordan comes out at school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their friendship survives, but Jordan’s worst enemy may be himself: he can’t seem to help the fact that he is head-over-heels in love with a hopeless case—his straight friend, Owen. Owen won’t let anything take Jordan’s friendship away, but he never counted on Jordan running off to find a life of his own. Owen will have to face the nature of their relationship if he’s to win Jordan back.</description>

  <description>When trouble strolls in, common sense walks out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a lifetime of rejection by those he loved, Gary returned to the one place that once made him happy and resigned himself to a life alone. Opening his bar--aptly named 'Trouble'--was his way of building a future and reminding himself what he needed to stay away from. So when Trouble--AKA Brock--walks into his bar one night, he's determined to keep his distance. No good could come from falling for Brock's adorable smile and handsome face. Except Brock seems just as determined to win Gary over as Gary is to stay away. And when Gary realizes Brock may be the real deal, he must choose between protecting his heart or taking the ultimate chance on love.</description>

  <description>Lenny's life in the small village of Waldau hasn't changed in years. While friends grew up and moved on, Lenny and his oma remain in the same place. Now Lenny's going to &lt;em&gt;make &lt;/em&gt;things different: a new life, in a new city, and a chance to forget his cousin Julien--the boy he loved, and who left him behind. But just as Lenny's future looks like it’s becoming reality, Julien returns, bringing with him all the sweet, wonderful, and painful memories of their past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What does his cousin want? And is it something Lenny can give him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Cover art by Astrid Paramita Mochtarram)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is available both in Kindle edition and in print.</description>

  <description>Kyle has worked hard at being the invisible student, toiling through high school in the middle of Nowhere, Texas. Brad is the baseball star at Foster High. Both boys are damaged in ways that the rest of the world can’t see. When they bond over a night of history tutoring, Kyle thinks that maybe his life has taken a turn for the not-so-lonely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He finds out quickly that the promise of fairy-tale love is a lie when you’re gay and falling for one of the most popular boys in school, and if being different is a sin in high school, then being gay is the biggest sin of all. Now Kyle and Brad need to come to an understanding amidst the scrutiny of their peers or their fledgling relationship will crash and burn before it ever gets off the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the 2nd Edition. 1st Edition was published as a short story under the same title by Dreamspinner Press.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Is there ever a good time to tell the man with whom you just had mind blowing sex that you're a werewolf and, chances are, come the next full moon, he'll be sporting fur and fangs too?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police Officer Logan Robinson isn't sure. Logan's been in lust with his partner and best friend Dylan Reed for as long as he can remember. But Logan is a werewolf and after accidentally giving his partner the mating bite during sex Dylan will become one too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan is royally pissed when he finds out because Logan conveniently forgot to mention his little affliction until after they'd spent the night humping each other's brains out. As if turning into a creature of the night wasn’t enough, Logan and he are investigating murders that look suspiciously like dog-attacks, but they're not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding a killer is tricky enough. Now it will be almost impossible with their personal issues clouding the investigation. And if Dylan does turn into a four-legged freak at the next full moon, the fur will fly.</description>

  <description>A Collars &amp;amp; Cuffs Story&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the death of his submissive lover two years ago, Leo hasn’t been living—merely existing. He focuses on making Collars &amp;amp; Cuffs, a BDSM club in Manchester’s gay village, successful. That changes the night he and his business partner have their weekly meeting at Severinos. Leo can’t keep his eyes off the new server. The shy man seems determined to avoid Leo’s gaze, but that’s like a red rag to a bull. Leo loves a challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Daniels works at Severinos to scrape together the money to move out on his own. He struggles with coming out, but he’s drawn to Leo, the gorgeous guy with the icy-blue eyes who’s been eating in his area nearly every night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leo won’t let Alex’s hesitance get in the way. He even keeps him away from the club so as not to scare him. And as for telling Alex that Leo is a Dom? Not a good idea. One date becomes two, but date two leads to Leo’s bedroom… and Alex discovers things about himself he never realized—and never wanted anyone to see.</description>

With his only confidant gone, Kyle struggles to deal with the loss, while fighting to keep his hidden sexuality a secret from his parents.  If only he didn’t have to face them alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Army veteran, Ryder Bishop has returned from his final tour in Iraq, when severe PTSD forces him to seek help through a new counseling program back home in Texas.  Just when Ryder thinks he’s reached the end of his rope, he meets Kyle, and their lives take a remarkable turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the grieving brother and damaged soldier find the peace they so desperately need?

  <description>What happens when a family comes between love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nigel and Derrick are perfect together, happy and in love. Two years ago, Derrick Cole took one of his teenage probationers to learn about a new program that helped at risk kids by teaching them how to train shelter dogs. There he met the executive director and founder, Nigel Rutherford. Although the two men came from different worlds, they immediately found common ground in an interest in social issues and a desire to help others. A strong mutual attraction grew over time into the kind of solid loving relationship that so many people only dream about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But getting to this point wasn't easy. Bias and intolerance barred the way, and Derrick's foster father, Ronald Bryant, was at the core. When Ronald dies tragically, the couple is forced to face demons from their past that threaten to destroy everything they've fought so hard for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Death does a lot of things to people.

  <description>IT HAPPENED IN VEGAS.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't be held responsible.  Things that happen there are supposed to stay there, right?  Right?  Yeeeah.  Not so much.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andie's just days away from tying the knot, but there's just ooooone little glitch.  Apparently, she's already married.  Or someone with her name is married to a guy out in Oregon of all places, and the courthouse won't issue her a marriage license until it's all cleared up.  Tripping her way through cow pies and country songs to meet up with a man who gets around places on horseback is her very last idea of how to have a good time, but if she's going to get married, make partner at the firm, and have two point five kids before she's thirty-five, she needs to get to the bottom of this snafu and fix it quick ... before her fiance finds out and everything she's been working toward goes up in flames.</description>

  <description>I can’t remember the last time I felt completely safe. Security seemed more like a luxury to me, reserved for those who were fortunate enough to have picture perfect childhoods. For those who didn’t bear the ugly scars that keep me bound in constant, debilitating fear. I’ve run from that fear my entire life. But when I met him, for once, I couldn’t run anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He scared the hell out of me in a way that excited every fiber of my being. It wasn’t the tattoos or the piercings. It wasn’t the warmth that seemed to radiate from his frame and blanket me whenever he was near. It was just…him. The scary beautiful man that threatened to alter 23 years of routine and rituals, and make me face my crippling fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Don’t worry,” he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. “I’ve got you. I’ll always catch you when you fall.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And just like that, Blaine had staked his claim on the untouched part of me that no living soul had ever moved. He had captured every fear, every reservation, and crushed them in the palm of his inked hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Disclaimer: Abuse is real- verbal, emotional, physical and sexual. It takes place all around us; it doesn’t discriminate against race or gender, wealth or poverty. It affects us all- those of us who’ve had to live through it, or watch it happen, even those of us who’ve only heard about it. We are all affected. We are all forever changed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not a story for the faint of heart; this is the story of one woman’s very real struggle through a world against her, the people who hurt her, her real life demons and the people who showed her that every gray sky, no matter how dark, has a sun waiting to break through.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Inspired by true events***&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Maise O’Malley just turned eighteen, but she’s felt like a grown-up her entire life. The summer before senior year, she has plans: get into a great film school, convince her mom to go into rehab, and absolutely do not, under any circumstances, screw up her own future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life has a way of throwing her plans into free-fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Maise meets Evan at a carnival one night, their chemistry is immediate, intense, and short-lived. Which is exactly how she likes it: no strings. But afterward, she can’t get Evan out of her head. He’s taught her that a hookup can be something more. It can be an unexpected connection with someone who truly understands her. Someone who sees beyond her bravado to the scared but strong girl inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That someone turns out to be her new film class teacher, Mr. Evan Wilke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maise and Evan resolve to keep their hands off each other, but the attraction is too much to bear. Together, they’re real and genuine; apart, they’re just actors playing their parts for everyone else. And their masks are slipping. People start to notice. Rumors fly. When the truth comes to light in a shocking way, they may learn they were just playing parts for each other, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smart, sexy, and provocative, Unteachable is about what happens when a love story goes off-script.</description>

  <description>“You’re the more real to me than any man I’ve ever known … ”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To book blogger Eden, Adam is the embodiment of every literary fantasy she’s ever had. Intelligent, wickedly funny, sexy, and attentive – he and his fascinating life seem right out of a novel. Their whirlwind relationship is so intense and all consuming that soon she can’t imagine being with anyone else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there’s one little thing that’s keeping Adam and Eden from their happily ever after.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’ve never met. She doesn’t even know what he looks like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite how hard she’s fallen for him and how he makes her feel, Eden’s doubts begin to threaten their passionate love affair. Why is he so mysterious? Why does he seem reluctant to meet her? What is Adam hiding?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afraid that she’s being made a fool of, Eden is forced to choose between her heart and her head. Is Adam too good to be true, as her common sense is telling her, or is the truth more startling than fiction?</description>

  <description>Bailey lives in a world where vampires are real, and not everyone’s happy about it, least of all him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of a law introduced before his birth, Bailey is a donor, the one person from his family who has to live in a vampire’s compound, and provide them with blood. A life sentence in all but name. Bailey was eighteen when he first came to a vampire’s home, leaving his brother and sister behind, and, six years later, he hasn’t seen the outside world since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bailey is bought by a rich, incredibly old vampire, and moves to a new house, he finds that not all vampires are the same, and his new boss, Cohen, is not what he’d thought him to be at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Bailey begins to feel an attachment growing between him and the vampire he serves, he also becomes aware of the disappearance of donors, and witnesses hideous executions as the terrorist group The Martyred Lamb fights to eradicate vampires, and all humans who sympathise with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there’s the question of what really happened to his family...</description>

  <description>When trainee hairdresser Mark sees Sam for the first time in the salon, it’s lust at first sight.  Sam is Mark’s living, breathing fantasy guy. He couldn’t be more perfect. Of course, there’s the tiny, insignificant detail that Sam has a girlfriend. Hell…..   A chance meeting on Mark’s favourite beach brings the two men together, and Mark finds himself with a new friend.  As they spend more time together, Mark grows to see Sam less as an object for his lust and more as someone who just… fits. But falling in love with your new best friend—especially when he’s straight—is bound to bring heartache in the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam likes Mark.  As in, he really likes him. And he’d like to get to know him even better. But Sam has secrets. There are things going on in his life that he can’t bring himself to tell Mark about, because the shame Sam feels is too much to bear, and not something he ever wants to share with another living soul. And if Mark ever finds out how Sam really feels about him, and the fact that he’s lied to him….  Sam can’t take that chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one drunken night in the pub changes everything….</description>

  <description>A Man of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicholas Robinson is a chemist decades ahead of his time. Crippled by a riding accident and embittered by his injuries, he shuns the world, focusing on his laboratory and experiments. But when the sale of his country estate, Grantley, leads to an encounter with a vampire, Nicholas realizes there is more in heaven and earth than he ever dreamed possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Creature of Darkness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although three hundred years old, Bancroft Ulwin is young by supernatural standards. Enslaved by his cruel, deformed maker, Ban is forbidden from relations with mortal men unless it ends in death. But his liaison with Nicholas, expressly against his master's wishes, soon expands beyond mere lust to something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Love Predestined&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long ago while still mortal, Ban met Serafino, the only true love of his life. When death separated them, Ban accepted his role as an enemy of human kind. But as he comes to suspect Nicholas is Serafino reincarnated, Ban begins to question everything he once believed. Including his own damnation.</description>

  <description>Letting go is the first step to healing…or bringing it all crashing down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an avalanche of books cuts off access to his living room, university librarian Jasper Richardson can no longer ignore the truth. His ever-growing piles of books, magazines and newspapers can no longer be classified as a “collection”. It’s a hoard, and he needs professional help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professional clutter clearer and counselor Lewis Miller thinks he’s seen it all, but even he has to admit he’s shocked. Not so much by the state of Jasper’s house, but by the level of attraction he still feels for the sexy bookworm he remembers from school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What a shame that Lewis’s ethical code forbids relationships with clients. As Jasper makes slow but steady progress, though, the magnetic pull between them is so strong even Lewis is having trouble convincing himself it’s a temporary emotional attachment arising from the therapeutic process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jasper longs to prove to Lewis that this is the real deal. But first he’ll have to lay bare the root of his hoarding problem…and reveal the dark secret hidden behind his walls of books. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br&gt;Contains a level-headed counselor with a secret addiction, a bespectacled geek with a sweet tooth, a killer “to-be-read” pile, embarrassing parents, a van called Alice, and deliciously British slang.</description>

  <description>Dave is a pretty ordinary guy, he goes to sixth form, plays drums and studies. Adrian however is a typical 'popular' guy, not that he acts like a dick. They're both pretty average high-school aged boys. They both love music, play instruments and struggle with teenage life, hormones and peers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only, those struggles are made harder when circumstances lead to Dave's 'coming out' and the fallout that follows makes for an incredibly difficult roller coaster ride.</description>

  <description>Every High School has their social outcasts. The band nerds, the math geeks, the chess club, the girl that chews her hair, but at Butler High, even the creepy nose picker in the chess club is more popular than Caleo Anima. No matter what he did, his pale skin, snow white hair, and piercing blue eyes always made him an easy target. He used to think that the only way things could get worse would be if someone found out that he was gay, but that isn't even the tip of the iceberg of problems after a mysterious stranger shows up and changes Caleo’s life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hidden amongst our society, a secret and magical race of people known as ‘Leeches’, have been engaging in civil war for decades. Both sides are desperately searching for a weapon with unlimited power that will give them the advantage they need to rule their world. This wouldn’t mean anything to Caleo, except for one problem...He is that weapon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forget making it through High School. Caleo has bigger problems! As the search for him goes on, the world is quickly crumbling around him. He's now fighting for his life and the life of what little family he has left. With the help of new friends, he has little time to try and master his newly found powers as he tries to figure out who he can trust, who is trying to use him, and who just wants him dead. One wrong step and being the awkward pale outcast will be the least of his worries.</description>

  <description>Nick Colton was a spoiled rich kid when he ran away from Seattle, leaving his best friend and lover Alex Diaz behind. Ten years later, he’s back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says he’s there to donate bone marrow for his half-sister, but Alex knows there’s more to it than that. Alex wants to protect himself and everyone else from Nick’s plans, but he needs to spend time with the man in order to figure out what he’s up to. And the more time they spend together, the more Alex realizes that his own attraction to Nick is far from resolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick is bent on revenge, Alex is trying to maintain his straight and conservative lifestyle, but neither of them can forget what they used to have and what they might, someday, be able to have again.</description>

  <description>When twenty-something Gulliver Leverenz abandons sunny L.A. for a fresh start in New York, he’s leaving behind his family, his friends—and one bastard ex-boyfriend who can’t take a hint. With no money, job, or direction, Gully gratefully accepts an invitation to crash with his former fraternity brother Todd. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As luck would have it, Todd lives in Hell’s Kitchen, New York’s hottest “gayborhood,” and is a rising star in the gay nightlife scene, complete with a crew of incredibly hot friends. Not long after, Gully snags a job with a talent agent and even finds himself a new boyfriend. There’s just one catch: Gulliver knows this budding relationship could get him in a lot of trouble. And inevitably, it does just that. Gulliver’s streak of good fortune soon takes a turn for the miserable as his choices unleash an onslaught of catastrophes that leaves him in a tragic and seemingly hopeless situation beneath the skyscrapers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Gully’s tougher than he realizes and is determined to prove, for once and for all, that he has what it takes to make it in New York. By turns exciting, sad, and hysterically funny, Gulliver Takes Manhattan is a refreshingly candid tale of one man’s quest to stake a place for himself in the greatest city in the world.</description>

  <description>Devon rules a rich province of the mighty Raenthe Empire, but in his dreams the young Sovereign does not play the master in bed. Lord of everything, in the depths of the night, Devon just wants to surrender to a stronger power, a dominating man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The star of all Devon’s wet dreams is the magnificent desert man, Xan, the champion gladiator. Devon was the one who sentenced Xan to die in the arena as an example to all his rebellious desert kind. Devon was also the one who pardoned Xan and gave him his freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Xan accompanies Devon as the Sovereign’s guardsman on a dangerous journey into the wild lands, it is raw passion, betrayal and impossible desire that reign over both men.</description>

  <description>Though he’s a sorcerer with a talent for creating blessings, David can do very little with any other magic. He works the night shift for his cousin’s magical supply shop because he’s cursed—his brother did it when they were kids—and now people can’t stand to be near David since he inspires irrational fear. Many experts have tried to remove it, but the curse has proven completely binding. Then David meets Vaughn at his brother's wedding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaughn works for the magical enforcers, picking apart complex curses and making sure sorcerers stay within the law. He has the ability to dampen magical effects around him and loves solving supposedly irreversible curses like David’s. He quickly develops a more personal interest in David. Despite the distance David attempts to keep between them, he finally realizes when Vaughn is injured on the job that he doesn’t want to stay away anymore. But what about the curse?</description>

That’s how Tethyr rewards my loyalty. It’s only the first of my blessings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impressed? Don’t be. When I started out I belonged to the Nightshade, a cruel man with overreaching ambition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was his apprentice. He taught me how to murder, and blood’s been my trade ever since. I’d say we’re the same, but I’d be lying. I found love. And that’s made all the difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Nightshade’s Apprentice is part one of two but can stand alone.</description>

  <description>Maki waited years to discover what dragon spirit the fates gifted him with. He anticipated his first flight, his parents at his side, as he launched himself into the sky for the first time. Best of all, one day he'd find his mate and spend the rest of his life with someone by his side. Unfortunately for him, things didn't go exactly as he'd always planned.</description>

  <description>As an angel of death, Keenan’s job is to collect the souls on his list. He’s carried out his duty for two thousand years and never faltered once. Until he meets Nicole St. James.  When the moment of death comes, Keenan hesitates, and instead of taking Nicole, Keenan touches the vampire who’s attacking her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cast out of heaven for disobedience, Keenan plummets to earth. Six months later, he finally manages to track Nicole to a bar in Mexico. He’s stunned to discover that the woman he remembers has undergone a dramatic change—she’s become a vampire. And when he realizes that she’s the target of all manner of enemies—other vampires, demons, even shifters—he’ll do whatever it takes to protect her, even if all hell breaks loose…</description>

However it has been edited and changed to 3rd person POV)*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell didn’t come soon enough for Gunther “Gunny” Duchene and Macalister “Mac” Jones, career US Marines who met at boot camp in the 1990s. They’ve been somewhere between best friends and lovers in peacetime and wartime both, but as the clock ticks toward Mac’s and Gunny’s retirements, the guys have much more to worry about than coming out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether their relationship will survive outside of the closet they’ve had to shove it into for over two decades is a big question mark. After all, Gunny questions why a hot military man like Mac--who could get any guy he wanted, including a younger, sexier one--would want him. But as Gunny and Mac navigate emotional waters as choppy as any they saw on duty, they just might learn Semper Fi applies to more than their careers</description>

  <description>“So just to be clear,” I said.  My voice shook a little too much for my liking.  “I killed myself.  I’m in some kind of Purgatory.  I am now part of a band of demon-fighting superheroes. We go around saving other people from offing themselves in the real world by protecting their statues in this one. All while trying to earn a second chance at life. Or a chance to end it once and for all.”&lt;br&gt;“That about sums it up.” Marsh said, offering a steaming mug of hot chocolate with marshmallows.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What comes after life? Jayden Schroeder is about to find out. At the end of the road of despair, she ends it all and finds out that living might not have been so bad.  Thrust into a strange and disparate world, Jayden joins a team of warriors from all places and time. Together they battle demons to save the souls of the living, all the while on the run from the end of all things - The Judgment.&lt;br&gt;Will she fight for a second chance to spare those she loves? Or surrender?&lt;br&gt;Dark Night of the Soul is a fantastical journey, both literally and figuratively for Jayden’s soul. Action adventure, fantasy, romance, and dark humor twist together to create an afterlife tale that will keep you thinking long after the final chapter.</description>

  <description>Marcus Aquila is an undercover Metropolitan police officer. His assignment is to infiltrate a slave-trafficking organisation which trades in men, bought and sold to fight in cages, sometimes to the death. When he makes the impulsive decision to intervene during a 'kill fight' involving a fierce young fighter called Esca, Marcus inadvertently finds himself the owner of his very own slave. Now Marcus has to find a way to complete his assignment, as well as gaining Esca's trust, without blowing his cover. The question is, can he do it before the secrets and lies catch up with him, and Marcus loses everything?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fanfic: The Eagle (Modern AU, Esca/Marcus Flavius Aquila)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 65,293</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dying sucks hairy monkey balls, even when you're not the stiff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denton Mills has a secret: he can see dead people. Or rather, how they died. It's quite a drag in a city like Chicago, teeming with the echoes of the no-longer living. Rather than whine about it, Denton has learned to live with his troublesome talent. His adaptability comes in handy when he meets his enigmatic new neighbor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bran Maurell catches Denton's eye right away, but unfortunately Mr. Tall, Dark, and Mysterious is as standoffish as he is alluring. However, after an unexpected introduction from Bran's cat brings the two men together, Denton discovers they have a mutual interest in the spirit world. Herbalist by day, Bran moonlights as a witch, performing house cleansings for a fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Bran, Denton learns that his knack for interacting with the dead qualifies him as a necromancer. It makes good business sense for them to team up and rid Chicago of its pesky spirits one grateful client at a time. Amongst ghostly adventures the attraction between the men is impossible to ignore. They seem like perfect partners—unless Bran's not-so-little secret comes between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; men loving men, ghosts with attitudes, and a portly feline with hidden talents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Denton also plays a small but important role in &lt;em&gt;Spirit Sanguine.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>After a chance encounter in the woods leaves her shaken and reeling, the last thing Taylor McAvay wanted to do was accept an invitation to dinner. Then again, after seeing what Sebastian Baas was capable of, she felt she had little choice. The guy did just save her life, and the feel of his partner’s assault rifle pressed against her cheek still lingered in her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she discovers surprises her. Beneath the armor and fatigues, is a smart, attentive, and sophisticated man. Unable to resist, Taylor finds herself drawn in by the Special Agent’s charm. Everything about Sebastian, from his imposing presence to his hypnotic eyes, pulls her under his spell. When a drive by shooting leaves her apartment riddled with bullets, she falls under his command as well—not to mention the shadow of a lethal, underground organization known as SKALS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her lover has a dark and dangerous side he tries to keep hidden, but when a series of events sends their lives spiraling out of control, she realizes there is much more to him than meets the eye. Whether she wants to leave or not doesn't matter. Taylor soon learns, when it comes to Sebastian and SKALS, there is no escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT your average romance. It's not a feel good story. It's a dark, gritty, sometimes erotic psychological thriller with a heavy emphasis on plot. It also contains elements of dominance and discipline with dubious consent, psychological conditioning, and mental manipulation. There’s also gunfire and violence. If any of this offends you, this may not be the book for you.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;2nd Edition (Battle Buddy and Tuck &amp;amp; Cover combined)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battle Buddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At nineteen, Shane Tucker joins the army. Tucker is gay but not ready to be open about it, and Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell seems like a convenient way to avoid dealing with his sexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The army suits Tucker; he does well from the beginning. Then, during boot camp, he’s assigned a “battle buddy,” Owen Bradford. Owen is a walking, talking wet dream with no concept of personal space. Tucker only survives the constant temptation by venting to his diary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years later, Tucker—now in the Army Ranger program—is paired up with Owen once again. Getting through training while ignoring the sexual tension between him and his battle buddy might be the biggest test of Tucker’s military career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Tuck &amp;amp; Cover&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may have read Tuck’s diary entries, but they don’t tell the whole story. Tuck will argue the point, but he definitely got a few details wrong—not that I blame him. He was, if you remember, a little sexually frustrated at the time. He probably wasn’t thinking straight. I’ll never get tired of teasing him about that. Anyway, here’s what really happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rangers lead the way! – Owen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;First Editions published by Silver Publishing, March 2012 (Battle Buddy) and November 2012 (Tuck &amp;amp; Cover)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Celia Wird and her three sisters are just like other twenty-something girls—with one tiny exception: They're the products of a curse that backfired and gave each of them unique powers that make them, well, a little weird…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Wird sisters are content to avoid the local vampires, werebeasts, and witches of the Lake Tahoe region—until one of them blows up a vampire in self-defense. Everyone knows vampires aren't aggressive, and killing one is punishable by death. But soon more bloodlust-fueled attacks occur, and the community wonders if the vampires of Tahoe are plague-ridden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celia reluctantly agrees to help Misha, the handsome leader of an infected vampire family. But Aric, the head of the werewolf pack determined to destroy Misha's family to keep the area safe, warns Celia to stay out of the fight. Caught between two hot alphas, Celia must find a way to please everyone, save everyone, and—oh, yeah—not lose her heart to the wrong guy or die a miserable death. Because now that the evil behind the plague knows who Celia is, he's coming for her and her sisters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Wird girl has never had it so tough.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; A hidden truth. &lt;br&gt; Mortal enemies. &lt;br&gt; Doomed love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marked as special at an early age, Jacinda knows her every move is watched. But she longs for freedom to make her own choices. When she breaks the most sacred tenet among her kind, she nearly pays with her life. Until a beautiful stranger saves her. A stranger who was sent to hunt those like her. For Jacinda is a draki, a descendant of dragons whose greatest defense is her secret ability to shift into human form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forced to flee into the mortal world with her family, Jacinda struggles to adapt to her new surroundings. The only bright light is Will. Gorgeous, elusive Will who stirs her inner draki to life. Although she is irresistibly drawn to him, Jacinda knows Will's dark secret: He and his family are hunters. She should avoid him at all costs. But her inner draki is slowly slipping away;if it dies she will be left as a human forever. She'll do anything to prevent that. Even if it means getting closer to her most dangerous enemy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mythical powers and breathtaking romance ignite in this story of a girl who defies all expectations and whose love crosses an ancient divide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Shy, closeted college student and part-time barista Soren prefers to keep to himself, despite the urgings of family and friends to break out of his routines and live a little more. He likes things exactly as they are:  school is going well, he has his study-buddy Sloane, long-distance best friend Liz, his online friend Tru, and a ridiculously hot boss to stare at longingly. It might not work for everyone, but it's working for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comfortable routine is upended the day Tru suddenly suggests they meet, and Soren finds himself uncharacteristically agreeing to coffee. When his date proves to be the last person he expects, a simple date is only the start of all the complications Soren has always tried to avoid.</description>

  <description>With the world suddenly teeming with zombies, Charlie and Bobby are fighting to stay alive. Being about as gay as two people can be, they insist on doing it with panache. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with the planet throwing up its legs in submission, there is no reason a couple of style-conscious guys can't look good while saying good-bye to the age of man and ushering in the age of… God knows what. Amoebas, maybe. With their loyal zombie poodle, Mimi, at their side, they bravely face the apocalypse head-on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Death, destruction, and the undead they can deal with. But without electricity, it's the depressing lack of blow-dryers and cappuccino machines that really pisses them off—until Bobby goes missing! Suddenly Charlie has more than fluffy hair and a good cup of coffee to worry about….</description>

  <description>**Contains mild language, adult situations, and sexual content. Mature audiences only.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does someone give their heart away when they don’t have all of the pieces?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that Makenna really wants a second chance at love anyway. She is stuck in her tragic past, secretly living every day for her deceased fiancé, while her new boyfriend, Drew, is gently nudging her into the present. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to appear normal again, she slaps on a happy face and goes through the motions of a normal, healthy relationship—but with the exception of even a single kiss. And she’s okay with pretending, but Drew needs more than she’s willing to give.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprisingly, it’s an innocent letter from a soldier halfway around the world that has her seeing life differently.  Sawyer is at his breaking point, and his depression sucks him in deeper every day. Makenna becomes his only lifeline to home, and he’s hanging on by a very weak thread.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By helping him, Makenna learns to let go of grief before she’s left with only a ghost of the woman she once was, finally freeing her from guilt and showing her that it is possible to love again. But when she discovers that both of the men in her life are hiding something, she makes two shocking revelations.&lt;br&gt;One of them is insanely in love with her, and one of them destroyed her happy ever after. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though a fairytale ending does await her, is she willing to face her own demons to fight for it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**DOES CONTAIN MILD LANGUAGE AND SEXUAL CONTENT.**</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;These men look happy now, but it didn’t start out that way. The attraction was instant and mutual, but one of them held back. Why was he so afraid to admit his feelings for this man? How did he overcome his fear and finally earn his way into the arms of the love of his life after all he’d done to hurt them both?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two men embracing. One man consoling the other and caressing his face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A cowboy's heart has room for anything…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;J-Bar ranch foreman Malloy pretty much keeps to himself—slinking around the edges of everybody else like an old coyote, doing his job and staying private. That is until Crispin Carrasco shows up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lean, muscular, and with a motor mouth that won’t quit, Crispin sparks something in Malloy—something the foreman didn’t know was there. But how does a lone coyote approach the warmth of a fire? And more important, what would happen if that fire burned?</description>

The plan seems promising until Tyler’s bipolar best friend Jenny offers love advice and a local skater takes interest in Tyler as well. Furthering complications, Tyler's estranged mother, a clairvoyant circus clown, returns home to win back the love of her family.</description>

  <description>When you fall in love, it can't all just be hanging loose... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After graduating from art school Nate left the Midwest for sunny Southern California, not quite sure what he hoped to find. It was almost certainly not falling in love with another man. His whole world and assumptions about himself begin to slowly turn upside down on one hot summer day. Seeking respite from the heat and his loneliness at Venice Beach he has a chance encounter with a handsome blond surfer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jez is friendly, easygoing, and just a little bit mysterious. Openly gay, Jez offers Nate a place to stay, and the two men become fast friends. Nate makes new friends, adjusts to his new life, but his unbidden attraction to Jez keeps growing. In their moments of closeness Nate realizes that he wants Jez more than just a friend, but it might be too late. To make Jez his, Nate has to face not only his own fears and insecurities, but his mysterious mate has secrets of his own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Al fresco man-love, a scene-stealing old coot, and a relentless California sun.</description>

  <description>Dr. Cary Drewel is a dentist in trouble. The loanshark who financed his equipment is threatening to break both his arms if he doesn’t make a payment. Hoping to attract the orthodontia-ready Twilight crowd, Cary distributes a flyer advertising his new practice: Vampires Our Specialty!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then sexy Pierce Sharpe walks into the clinic holding one of the flyers. Pierce is starving, unable to eat due to his impacted teeth. But even pale and shaky, Pierce makes Cary’s pulse race and his smock tent. Imagine Cary’s surprise when he asks the man to, “Open, please,” and discovers Pierce just might be the real thing!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edition has been discontinued.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; You learn your wisest lessons from your enemies. Assuming, of course, you survive the encounter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kendras is a casualty of war: injured, penniless, and quite possibly the last surviving member of the only family he's ever known—the elite fighting force known as the Scorpions. When a steel-eyed stranger offers him medicine and shelter in exchange for submission and a secret task, Kendras has no choice but to accept. He is a Scorpion; he’ll do whatever it takes to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But his true goal is to rebuild the Scorpions. Neither Steel’s possessive nature nor Kendras’s shattered foot can keep him from finding the last of his brothers... or the mysterious leader of the Scorpions, a man who held Kendras’s heart long before Steel tried to take it for himself. The goal is simple, the situation anything but. To rescue his leader and escape from Steel for good, Kendras must fight through a morass of politics and intrigue, where enemies are allies and even allies have hidden agendas.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What happens when in order to win, you’re forced to lose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only daughter of an infamous Las Vegas pimp, Raven Morretti grew up an outsider.  Liberated from the neglectful home of her prostitute mother, she finds solace as a mechanic. With few friends, she’s content with the simple life.  Flying under the radar is all she knows, and more than she expects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until she catches the eye of local celebrity, UFL playboy Jonah Slade.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weeks away from his title fight, Jonah is determined to stay focused on everything he’s trained so hard to achieve.  Undefeated in the octagon, he’s at the height of his career.  But resisting Raven’s effortless allure and uncomplicated nature is a fight he can’t win.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah trades in his bad-boy reputation and puts his heart on the line.  But when her father contacts her, setting in motion the ugly truth of her destiny, Jonah must choose.  In a high-stakes gamble where love and freedom hang in the balance, a war is waged where the price of losing is a fate worse than death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the hotheaded Jonah be able to restrain his inner fighter to save the woman he loves?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or will Raven be forced into a life she’s been desperate to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: 112,406 &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Zach Kelly’s life is a shambles. His boyfriend of three years dumped him, and his writing career is going nowhere. On a whim, he heads to Provincetown, Massachusetts, to nurse his broken heart and figure out his next step. He’s expecting to find rest and relaxation on the sandy beaches of Cape Cod. Instead, Zach meets a hunky porn star during a chance encounter at a leather shop he mistakes as a place to buy a belt that is definitely not for whipping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Van Pierce is smitten when shy and inexperienced Zach crashes through a shelf of fetish gear. Though Van’s got an insatiable appetite for men on and off the set, his porn persona, Hart Throb, hides a broken heart. He’s struggling to find the reality the porno set doesn’t offer, and Zach is fighting to find the fantasy that will set his writing on fire. The odd goofball and the suave beefcake may either find love amid Provincetown’s colorful pageantry where summer never seems to end—or more heartbreak than either can imagine.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Neryn is alone in the land of Alban, where the oppressive king has ordered anyone with magical strengths captured and brought before him. Eager to hide her own canny skill—a uniquely powerful ability to communicate with the fairy-like Good Folk—Neryn sets out for the legendary Shadowfell, a home and training ground for a secret rebel group determined to overthrow the evil King Keldec.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During her dangerous journey, she receives aid from the Good Folk, who tell her she must pass a series of tests in order to recognize her full potential. She also finds help from a handsome young man, Flint, who rescues her from certain death—but whose motives in doing so remain unclear. Neryn struggles to trust her only allies. They both hint that she alone may be the key to Alban’s release from Keldec’s rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homeless, unsure of who to trust, and trapped in an empire determined to crush her, Neryn must make it to Shadowfell not only to save herself, but to save Alban.</description>

  <description>Danny Marlaeto’s life has gone to shit. In the past three hours, he’s been attacked by &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; lookalikes, saved by his hot but weird next-door neighbor, threatened with a pair of Manolos, and been told he has to move out of his house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and he has to leave this dimension, too. So there’s that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His neighbor, Soren Greenfield, is not only a gardening fanatic and an avid swimmer, but a guardian — a member of a fierce, loyal league of warriors who have sworn their lives to protect the keys. Unfortunately for Danny, he’s a key, and he possesses a well of magic that can be tapped and manipulated by sorcerers. Soren’s job is to protect Danny from sorcerers, and now that a particularly powerful one (code name: Doctor Doom) has set his sights on Danny (a geeky geology major with inferiority issues, no combat skills, and a smart mouth), Soren is probably going to regret that oath he took to give his life in exchange for Danny’s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together with Danny’s black belt best friend Malia Hesse, they escape to Lohrfast, Danny’s birthplace and Soren’s home, in order to ensure Danny’s safety. Arriving at White Oak, one of the League’s training camps, should be the end of their travel, but there are dangers within the League as well, and when Danny, Soren, and Malia are forced to make a desperate journey to the League’s largest stronghold, Soren’s secrets catch up with them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;Completely debauched, wrecked— he’s floating now, but tomorrow the shame will come. Tomorrow he’ll be disgusted all over again at what he’s done. What he’s allowed to be done to him. More than that… what he’s begged for.&lt;br&gt;And the worst part? He’s so stupid in love with the man he just keeps coming back for more. Because of this moment. This one, right here, when he can believe that he’s loved in return, even if it is only for the night.&lt;br&gt;See, it’s not the acts they engage in that shame him. It’s not the bondage or the submission or the mind-blowing sex— he finds his strength there. It’s his weakness for the man himself that’s destroying him. Because tomorrow he’ll be gone again.&lt;br&gt;He can’t go on like this. He tells himself that every time, swears this time will be the last. He needs for there to be a tomorrow, and a next day, and a next day— for them, together. Not just another tomorrow of loss and heartache and picking up the pieces.&lt;br&gt;But he can’t tell him that… can he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A young guy lies cuffed to a table. Exposed, debauched… and completely vulnerable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What happened to the girl you left behind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1916, French artist Edouard Lefevre leaves his wife Sophie to fight at the Front.  When her town falls into German hands, his portrait of Sophie stirs the heart of the local Kommandant and causes her to risk everything - her family, reputation and life - in the hope of seeing her true love one last time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly a century later and Sophie's portrait is given to Liv by her young husband shortly before his sudden death.  Its beauty speaks of their short life together, but when the painting's dark and passion-torn history is revealed, Liv discovers that the first spark of love she has felt since she lost him is threatened...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Girl You Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; two young women, separated by a century, are united in their determination to fight for the thing they love most - whatever the cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What does it take to rise from life’s depths, swim against the current, and breathe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weighted down by the loss of her parents, Blythe McGuire struggles to keep her head above water as she trudges through her last year at Matthews College. Then a chance meeting sends Blythe crashing into something she doesn’t expect—an undeniable attraction to a dark-haired senior named Chris Shepherd, whose past may be even more complicated than her own. As their relationship deepens, Chris pulls Blythe out of the stupor she’s been in since the night a fire took half her family. She begins to heal, and even, haltingly, to love this guy who helps her find new paths to pleasure and self-discovery. But as Blythe moves into calmer waters, she realizes Chris is the one still strangled by his family’s traumatic history. As dark currents threaten to pull him under, Blythe may be the only person who can keep him from drowning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book is intended for mature audiences due to strong language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: due to mature content recommended for Ages 17+</description>

  <description>Christian Blake dreams of being a kindergarten teacher, but making the grade means maintaining a squeaky clean image: no drinking, no drugs, no swearing, no sex. And definitely no falling for his new roommate-tattooed bad-boy Max, who may or may not be a drug dealer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of all, it means no working at a porn store. But Christian's aunt has cancer, and her beloved Rear Entrance Video will go bankrupt if Christian doesn't take over managerial duties. Soon enough, Christian finds himself juggling sticky twenty-five cent peep show booths, a blackmailing employee, and a demanding professor who likes to make an example of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there's Max, who doesn't know anything about the store, but hates Christian's preppy sweater vests and the closet Christian forces him into when they're together. Max just wants Christian to be himself-even though Max is keeping secrets of his own. Christian struggles to find the impossible balance between his real life and the ideal one he thinks a teacher needs to live . . . all while trying to keep his aunt's dream alive without losing his own.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five year old Jack Falcon doesn’t do relationships, and why would he when he has woman after woman literally throwing themselves at him? For Jack, life is perfect just the way it is. He works hard and he plays harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack’s life changes when he meets Belle. Unlike any woman he’s ever met, there is something about this girl that makes him unable to keep away, something beyond the youthful beauty and her innocent spirit. Belle is strong and independent, a big leap from the usual brainless chicks he tends to attract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack begins a dangerous game. He is determined to seduce Belle, and without realizing it, his feelings for her develop beyond anything he has ever felt before. Things become complicated when he learns there are good reasons as to why he should stay the hell away from her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can you stay away from someone you want to spend every waking minute with? And what do you do when you know eventually you will destroy that person? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their feelings for each other deepen, Jack struggles with his own internal demons which threaten to rip them apart. Jack is torn between following his heart and listening to his head, which keeps telling him he is not good enough for her. She deserves better than what he can give her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How far will he push before they both fall over the edge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Really, I’m not as bad as my reputation makes me out to be. In fact, I’d go as far to describe myself as a decent guy. I just have no interest in a relationship that extends beyond a quick fuck when it suits me. I really don’t see how it’s my fault or problem if a chick falls for my boyish charms. Every woman seems to think she can change me, that she somehow has something all the other notches on my belt didn’t have.”</description>

  <description>Book one in the Pack Discipline Series Dominance and submission mean different things to werewolves than to humans. Once Marsdon and Bennett try things the human way nothing can ever be the same for them again. Werewolf tradition is very clear. The alpha pair is the corner stone of the pack. Equality between the alphas is everything. Alphas mate with alphas. Human leather clubs work to different rules. Dominants mate with submissives. Power is exchanged freely and for the ultimate pleasure of all. Sometimes the most alpha men in the club find happiness with the most omega men. And sometimes the omegas are more than they first appear to be. A wolf might be able to hide his identity and play anonymously in those clubs for a little while, but he can't ignore reality forever. Marsdon and Bennett have lives to get back to, they have packs to return to...they have wolfen traditions to follow. They have just one more night together before they have to lose each other forever. All they can do now, is make the most of it. Reader Advisory: This book contains both human and werewolf styles of dominance and submission.This book also contains blood play and non-sexual violence.</description>

  <description>Aging bull rider Cody Grainger needs bullfighter Johnny Arrow for more than just protection in the ring. Their bond of trust goes beyond the professional and into love, but while their relationship holds up to the need for discretion imposed by their sport and repeatedly having to watch each other put themselves in the way of dangerous animals, other barriers still tear them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one thing, Cody is ten years older than Johnny. But instead of contemplating retirement, he focuses on winning the championship, desperate to stay on top. Johnny is only beginning to find the professional recognition he craves. When frustration leads Johnny to walk away, Cody’s season slumps. While they’re apart, they both slowly realize they are meant to be together. But machismo abounds in the sport of bull riding, and their pride might be an obstacle too big for love to overcome.</description>

  <description>Three years ago, a race of aliens called Narsoreal made contact and gained asylum on Earth. In exchange for technology and medical advancements, the United States government allows the Narsoreal to collect and bond with the country’s “unwanted” citizens. In one city, a Narsoreal bond-matcher has set his sights on a small band of male and female prostitutes in desperate need of salvation. Each of the five has unique needs, but it just might be that there is a Narsoreal ready and willing to meet every one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every day is a struggle for survival, and Shannon often feels like everything is out of his control. He longs for someone to come into his life and offer him some peace, be the one he can lean on, and maybe someday forgive him his past and love him anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AUTHOR’S NOTE: This is the first story in a 5-part series available individually and as a whole sold under the title “The Unwanted” which will be available by the end of 2013. Reading each story in order is recommended.</description>

  <description>How far would you go to save the one you love? Pierce Hollister is a down-to-earth businessman. Most of the time. His romantic side has him secretly dreaming of Mr Right, a family and happy ever after. Noah Conway is a single father who doesn't believe in happy families anymore. When his daughter's life is at stake, he would sell his soul to save her but as a sadistic Dom takes an interest in him, he sells his body instead. A shared session at a BDSM club leaves Pierce intrigued and soon he finds himself willing to do anything in his power to heal the wounds that life has left on Noah's soul. When he realises that the very thing Noah dreads the most might just be what he needs, Pierce sets out on a mission - but maybe it's just not in his power to save Noah. Will Noah be able to battle the demons that haunt him and find the happy ever after Pierce has dreamed up for them?</description>

He is the brother of two of the most powerful members of the Omegrion: the ruling council that enforces the laws of the Were-Hunters. And when war erupts among the lycanthropes, sides must be chosen. Enemies are forced into shaky alliances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Aimee, the woman Fang loves, is accused of betraying her people, her only hope is that Fang believes in her. Yet in order to save her, Fang must break the law of his people and the faith of his brothers. The breech could very well spell the end of both their races and change their world for ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The war is one and time is running out...</description>

  &lt;div&gt;Live fast, fight hard and if you have to die then take as many of your enemies with you as you can. That is the Amazon credo and it was one Samia lived and died by. Now in contemporary New Orleans, the immortal Amazon warrior is about to learn that there’s a worse evil coming to slaughter mankind than she’s ever faced before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shapeshifter Dev Peltier has stood guard at the front of Sanctuary for almost two hundred years and in that time, he’s seen it all. Or so he thought. Now their enemies have discovered a new source of power- one that makes a mockery of anything faced to date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The war is on and Dev and Sam are guarding ground zero. But in order to win, they will have to break the most cardinal of all rules and pray it doesn’t unravel the universe as we know it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE MAYANS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WITH A 2012 PROPHECY...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long before recorded history, there was a Keetoowah warrior so feared that everyone trembled before his wrath. Only a brutal betrayal by the one closest to him could defeat him. But not even death was the end of a man so strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Time Untime approaches...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kateri Avani has been plagued her entire life with dreams she  doesn't understand. Images of places she's never been and of a &lt;br&gt;man she's never seen. Her quest for answers has driven her to Las Vegas, where she hopes to finally silence the demons in her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she never anticipates is coming face-to-face with the warrior who has haunted her her entire life. One who belongs to a world the scientist in her refuses to believe is real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ren Waya came back from the dead to keep the prophecy he began from coming true and ending the world. For thousands of years, he has fought the same evil that once possessed him. But now that evil has found the one person he can't fight. The one person who, against his will, holds the most sacred part of him&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if he doesn't kill Kateri, the deadliest of evils will reemerge and destroy everyone else on the planet. It was a sacrifice he made once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will he be able to make it again?</description>

Still, Jackson doesn’t return Taylor’s feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor has his own admirers, though. Kevin Richards is used to getting what he wants, and what he wants &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; is Taylor, so when Taylor rejects him, Kevin retaliates.

  <description>Stockbroker meets stock breaker. But who’s taming whom?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;London stockbroker Jasper Randolph flies to Jackson Hole with hopes as high as the Grand Tetons. Hope that the getaway will force him to let loose, get dirty, and overcome a deep-seated phobia about horseback riding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He hadn’t counted on an attraction to the dude ranch owner’s son, a man with sun-tousled hair, eyes bluer than Wyoming skies…and a father who’d rather eat tofu than accept his only son’s sexuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moment Calum lays eyes on the uptight, buttoned-down Brit, he’s lost. But with his own saddlebags full of emotional baggage, he knows he should be looking at anything but Jasper’s spotless riding boots and tight-fitting jodhpurs. Trouble is, Jasper makes his heart buck like a wild horse trying to break free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the differences that set them oceans apart, they fall hard and fast. Trouble isn’t far behind, and they’re in for a rocky romantic ride. Especially since there’s growing evidence that someone is willing to do anything—no matter how dangerous—to poison their love. &lt;br&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br&gt;Mix one sun-bronzed cowboy with a yummy Brit who’d give Darcy in his wet shirt a run for his money. Mix gently. Try not to drool.</description>

  <description>Life is full of compromises. That's what Avi Rosen tells himself. He's a yeshiva boy turned historian, working on his dissertation and stretching his meager stipend by moonlighting as a closeted politician's houseboy. Their relationship used to feel like a real affair. Lately it seems more like a job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It isn't until he meets someone decent that he realizes how corrupt his life has become. Pete is a tall blond farmer who charms Avi with his dazzling smile and his straightforward life. But even if he can believe this refreshingly honest man doesn't have his own political agenda, will Avi find the strength to emerge from the dark life he's chosen and find a future in the sun?</description>

  <description>Three days ago, Claire was a wife, a mother, and very much alive… then the music called for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire has one goal for the conference— to land a few whales so that her boss will give her a badly needed raise. She pitches and prays while courting the music industry elite until her plans are derailed by hotness-in-high-heels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bette is at the conference on a mission—to find a human with untapped talents that she can mold and control. Bette uses her cursed violin to lure Claire in with a haunting song, which unravels Claire’s life as her new talents emerge. To make matters worse, Claire is attracted to two unlikely people— Bette and her hunky associate, Gregor. Both can light Claire’s fire, but is either of them the only one? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for Claire, life isn’t all song lyrics and seduction. Tied to darkness by blood and power, Claire must harness her abilities if she has any hope of returning home to her daughter and regaining her former life… if that’s what she really wants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kill Me, the debut novel from author Alex Owens, is a quirky paranormal fantasy complete with music, magic, fangs and freaks. It is also the first in a planned series, with the second book due out by the Fall of 2012. Be forewarned, this is not your daughter’s paranormal.</description>

  <description>A horse stock manager on the rodeo tour, gruff cowboy Jed Hastings is in a bind. He needs a new assistant yesterday. Enter green-as-hell Booker West. Booker spent his childhood dreaming about being a part of the rodeo. He doesn’t have any experience working with horses, but Jed doesn’t have options, and gives the newbie a chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Innocent about the world and secretly gay, Booker works like the devil to hide his attraction to Jed. He doesn’t just want to be a wannabe-cowboy with a crush; he wants to learn from Jed. Booker craves Jed’s respect, friendship, and trust. For Jed, he knows an eager young colt like Booker should work his last nerve, yet he finds he has endless patience with the guy. He’s possessive about Booker too. And while bunking together does create intimacy, that doesn’t explain away straight Jed’s explicit sexual fantasies and growing desire for another man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a life altering event sends Jed and Booker reeling, a night of raw passion between the men finally explodes. But in the light of day, can Booker help Jed accept their love? Or will this unearthed attraction send Jed to a dark place from which he can’t recover?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In the dystopian future, two men discover attraction isn't just dangerous, it's deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Two generations ago, the world was annihilated by a series of catastrophic environmental events. The remaining survivors were driven closer and closer to big city centers-damaged but not destroyed-divvied into sixteen identical international territories ruled by the Company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oppressive to the core, the Company has one rule in order to recoup the world's devastated population: homosexuality and deviant sexual behaviors are hanging offenses. First time offenders are last-time offenders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the year 2070. Commander Caspar Cannon has a stellar military reputation-and a life-threatening secret. When a revolution rips through the territories, Cannon is ordered to escort Company Executive Nathaniel Rice to a secure location. Leaving the besieged city behind, their journey becomes a minefield of sabotage, betrayal, secrets . . . and intense desire for one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cannon's militant self-repression takes a direct hit, his suspicions warring with passion for a man who can never be his, not while the Company remains in power. True to his mission, he delivers Nathaniel to the safe bunker where a fate he never expected awaits him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Word count: 97,000.</description>

  <description>He wanted a boyfriend. What he got was a hero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fire and Rain, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an accident burns down Jesse’s apartment, he’s left broke and homeless, with a giant dog and a college schedule he can’t afford to maintain. And no family who’s willing to take him in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucky for him, a sexy fireman offers him a place to stay. The drawback? The fireman’s big Latino family lives next door, and they don’t know their son is gay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tomas’s parents made their way in America with hard work and by accepting help when it was offered, so he won’t let Jesse drop out of school just so he can afford a place to live. Besides, Jesse’s the perfect roommate—funny, sweet and breathtakingly cute. He climbs into Tomas’s bed and tugs at his heart. Until Jesse starts pushing for more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their passion enflames their bodies but threatens to crush Tomas’s family. Tomas is willing to fight for Jesse, but after losing everything, Jesse isn’t sure he can bear to risk his one remaining possession—his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains an angry older brother, judgmental best friends, a slobbering bull mastiff, and enough red-hot gay loving to make a porn star blush.</description>

  <description>Fool me three times… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dale Ramsey is looking forward to his twenty-year high school reunion except for one small problem. Adam O’Connor, his old friend—and old flame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twice before, Adam has disappeared from Dale’s life. Once after a graduation night fling, and again after a hot reunion years later. When Adam resurfaces this time, single and on the verge of retiring from the Navy, Dale wonders if he’ll want to mend fences…and maybe tear up some sheets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spark between them is alive and well, but Dale resists. After all, Adam only seems to come around when his life is in flux, and Dale is through being a placeholder until something better comes along. He wants his friend back, but not if he’ll be deserted a third time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inevitably, though, their attempts to rekindle their friendship wind up igniting something much hotter, and stirring up emotions too strong to ignore. Making Dale wonder if he should put his heart on the line…or if this time he should be the one to walk away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Let’s face it, Dale’s been sitting quietly (well, kind of) on the sidelines since The Distance Between Us, and he waited patiently through The Closer You Get. Dude is seriously ready for some scorching-hot action, so keep a fire extinguisher and some ice handy. These boys are gonna need it…</description>

While the scars on the outside have faded, the damage inside is much harder to conquer. Zeke resigns himself to a solitary existence, aside from his sister Enessa and, of course, his mama's occasional visits. Brendon Shanahan has a very meddling cousin, Gloria, who is best buds with Enessa Matthers. When the two women convince Brendon that he should hook-up with the reclusive Zeke, a plan is hatched that sets a series of events into motion - with potentially deadly consequences. Can Ezekiel conquer his fears and accept what Brendon is offering? Or will Brendon walk away, giving up on the love he has waited for? And will the visits from Zeke's mama - deceased for four years now - help the two men find their way to each other? Only time will tell, and that may be the one thing the lovers don't have, because someone is out to destroy everything Zeke and Brendon hold dear - and this time, the bad guy just might succeed.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Book One in the Uniformity series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kash never thought he’d find true love working at a maximum security prison, but that’s exactly what happens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Correctional Officer Daniel “Kash” Kashaveroff is single, gay and working at a maximum security prison in a small town in Nevada. Not the best job or town in which to meet men. He wants to fall in love again but isn’t actively looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he begins working with a new partner, Zane Davis, and his life is turned upside down. Kash is attracted to Zane but isn’t sure the sexy man plays for his team. When the gay or not mystery is solved, Zane and Kash begin a relationship that starts as friends-with-benefits but soon becomes a committed one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zane is bisexual and as much as he cares for Kash, he is still drawn to women. The attraction to the fairer sex creates problems in the relationship but Kash is committed to making it work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While dealing with his relationship issues, Kash also becomes friends with an inmate named Cody Ives. Becoming personally involved with an inmate is against the rules, but Kash believes in the young man’s innocence and insists on proving it.</description>

  <description>Calvin Hamilton reluctantly returns to his home town of Parrish Creek, Texas, to sell his parents' house. Finding the place in need of repair he hires John "Brock" Brockwell to renovate the house before putting it on the market. Brock bares a passing resemblance to Gary Cooper, especially as he often wears western clothing. Calvin has always had a weakness for cowboys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time has reversed the two men's fortunes. In high school Brock was the big man on campus, his popularity allowing him to hide his true nature. Calvin was a nerd, bullied by most of the jocks for being perceived as gay. Now Calvin is a successful New York advertising executive, and Brock is a divorced father with a teenage son who faces financial ruin, unable to pay his late father's hospital bills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Calvin put past bitterness behind him and help the cowboy with whom he is rapidly falling in love? Will the deeply closeted Brock be able to admit he has feelings for Calvin? Or will pride, fear, distance, and the past prevent them from building a future together?</description>

  <description>Wounded by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan and suffering post traumatic stress as a result, Andy Johnson is given a medical discharge from the British army. Shunning attention, Andy lives a quiet and lonely existence on his pig farm in Yorkshire. His peace is threatened when his friends take him to the city for his birthday. They buy him a kiss from Luke Wales, a twink porn star. &lt;br&gt; Overwhelmed and needing some air, Andy escapes outside. Luke finds him there. They talk and Andy begins to relax. It's cold and Andy gives Luke his combat jacket. However Roger, Luke's boyfriend appears and the momentary connection is lost. &lt;br&gt; Weeks later, recently separated from Roger, Luke is back in the north of England. He decides to pay Andy a visit, using the excuse of returning the man's jacket. A snow storm forces the two men to spend time together, and a tentative friendship begins. &lt;br&gt; Neither man is convinced they are worthy of the other. It takes time, plus the encouragement of friends and Andy's teenage nephew, Craig, to convince the reluctant couple that what exists on the surface only tells part of the story. Andy's scars and Luke's past employment shouldn't stand in the way of them exploring what each feels for the other.</description>

  <description>When Michael Knapp brings his lover Dan Biggs home to meet his parents, he doesn't expect things to go smoothly. His mother's been trying to marry him off for years, and sometimes he isn't even sure his father knows he exists. He has always felt like the shadow son, competing with his terminally stupid older brother and smart-mouthed little sister for his parents' attention. Coming out to them over dinner seemed like the perfect opportunity to finally get noticed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But an unexpected phone call interrupts his announcement -- Aunt Evie, the family matriarch, is dead. With Dan in tow, Michael follows his family to Sugar Creek, where he spent his summers growing up, to prepare for the funeral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amid an overabundance of memories and relatives, Michael's world begins to slip. His dysfunctional family, Evie's death, and an old friend's confession all threaten to smother him. Worse, in his grief and confusion he seems determined to inadvertently push everyone away, including his lover. Can he and Dan move beyond his family and his past to a new life together, before Michael's insecurities tear them apart?</description>

  <description>Hart Clan Hybrids, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who’s afraid of the big bad hybrid?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amber Paulson’s wolf has chosen a mate for her, but Amber is not amused with its pick. Jake Meyers might look amazing in a wet T-shirt and have the cheekbones and strong jaw that artists drool over. Too bad he is missing a pulse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake is a vampire, well, mostly. Then a tall, curvy redhead pops up on his radar and something awakens in him. Even though he tries to stay away, Amber gets under his skin, and his vampire/werewolf heritage starts to become more bark and less bite. For the first time, he feels the call of the moon, and he knows it’s all because of Amber Paulson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amber’s trying to stay away, and Jake’s trying to not turn furry. They both fail miserably—and with a lot of sweaty and enjoyable property destruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By giving in to her mating call, Amber finds out more than she ever wanted to know about herself, her family, and the rogue wolf who took so much from her so long ago. As her past comes back to bite her, she’ll have to decide what she’s willing to give up for her mate. Her home? Her pack? Her…heartbeat?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This book contains a snarky shifter heroine who could give Sookie a run for her money, a hot hunk of a vampire with a soft (and furry) side, and sex so sizzling that even an inter-species war can’t get in the way.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Katie McGarry captivated readers with her “riveting, emotional”* Young Adult debut, Pushing the Limits. In this gripping novella, she tells the story of Lila and Lincoln, who discover that sometimes it’s worth crossing the line for love…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lila McCormick, Echo's best friend from Pushing the Limits, first met Lincoln Turner when tragedy struck both their lives. But she never expected their surprise encounter would lead to two years of exchanging letters—or that she’d fall for the boy she’s only seen once. Their relationship is a secret, but Lila feels closer to Lincoln than anyone else. Until she finds out that he lied to her about the one thing she depended on him for the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hurting Lila is the last thing Lincoln wanted. For two years, her letters have been the only thing getting him through the day. Admitting his feelings would cross a line he’s never dared breach before. But Lincoln will do whatever it takes to fix his mistakes, earn Lila’s forgiveness—and finally win a chance to be with the girl he loves.</description>

  <description>Frank Mackenzie didn't foresee meeting his young prodigy of a professor during a police raid on a seedy bar. Doctor Col Courtland didn't expect his brightest new graduate student to be a blue-collar widower scarred by the Battle of the Bulge. Neither of them anticipated the complications of academic careers conducted beneath the unsympathetic gaze of the F.B.I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life in experimental physics may have grown much more exciting for everyone at Clarence Tenn Polytechnic since the Manhattan Project, but Frank and Courtland share illegal desires that make exciting lives dangerous. As the race for the H-Bomb begins and the Red Scare looms, the pair's intellectual triumphs and strengthening friendship are both threatened by the attraction growing between them. They will need to be brilliant in new ways if they expect to overcome the one threat that moves faster than the speed of light.</description>

  <description>Christmas, and the man of his fantasies is back in Chris's life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been far too long since Christian Matthews has seen Daniel Bailey. In fact the last time they met Chris was a senior in college and he was the TA tasked with helping Daniel who was a way too confident freshman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some years down the road, Chris is licking his wounds after being asked to leave the private school where he was teaching.

  <description>I’ve been unsure about many things in my life except for one thing, that I have always loved him. Every single minute of every single day that I have been on this earth, my heart has belonged to him. It has never been a question, never a doubt. The love had taken on many different forms over the years, but it had always been a constant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Everyone has their definition of love. There have been countless songs sung about it. A gazillion books, articles, and poems written about it. There are experts on love who will tell you how to get it, keep it, and get over it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  We’re led to believe love is complicated. It’s not the love that’s complicated. It’s all the crap that we attach to it and put in front of it that makes it difficult. If you’re smart, you’ll realize this before it’s too late and simplify.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      ____________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amanda Kelly spent her entire life trying to control every aspect of it, while striving for perfection. Her obsession with being perfect, along with her feelings of worthlessness, consumed her. The one thing she thought was perfect in her life was the bond she shared with her best friend, Noah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything was going according to her life plan until she woke up one day and realized she had fallen in love with him. The one thing she couldn’t control was the affect he had on her. Noah had the power to give her one hundred lifetimes of happiness, which also gave him the power to completely devastate her. He was the one thing in her life that was perfect, but she couldn't allow herself to have him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her life begins to unravel. Events take over and force her to let go of her dreams and desires. She needs to realize that a person cannot control the events in their life, only their reaction to them...but will it be too late for her to save her relationship with her best friend? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Present Perfect is a story of how past events have present consequences and how perfect your present could be if you stopped fighting and just allowed it to happen.</description>

  <description>Her car disabled during a tropical storm, Jessica Randall discovers the isolated house where she's sheltering is a private bondage club. At first shocked, she soon becomes aroused watching the interactions between the Doms and their subs. But she's a professional woman--an accountant--and surely isn't a submissive...is she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Z hasn't been so attracted to a woman in years. But the little sub who has wandered into his club intrigues him. She's intelligent. Reserved. Conservative. After he discovers her interest in BDSM, he can't resist tying her up and unleashing the passion she hides within.</description>

  <description>[P’TIT CADEAU (euphemism) – the “small gift” French hustlers ask for to let you know they expect to be paid]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben, an American art professor on a painting sabbatical in the south of France, rents a room in an isolated village to avoid the tourist crush. There he meets his landlady's brother, the sensitive and childlike loner Jean-Yves, whom the locals consider simple minded because he is "different". Ben makes him his principal model and undertakes to build his self-confidence and prepare him to fend for himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jean-Yves’ has never had a friend before. As they grow closer, Ben comes to realize the extent of the young man’s emotional needs, and his total dependence and unbridled devotion frighten him. Has he taken on more responsibility than he can handle? Should he allow himself to fall in love with Jean-Yves when he knows their relationship must end when his sabbatical is over?</description>

  <description>When the fearsome warlord Brasius chooses Kynon as his tribute, Kynon tells himself it’s the price of peace, and that he can endure anything. If his slavery will save his father’s kingdom, then he will be a slave and submit to every indignity the warlord and the senate of Segasa require of him. He can live with the shame; it’s the mind-blowing pleasure that frightens him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the warlord wants more than a tribute who will respond eagerly to whips and bondage. The warlord might just want the man underneath: the prince, the soldier and the tribute, if Kynon can figure out who that is. On an enforced journey of self-discovery, Kynon learns that being the warlord’s tribute isn’t just about submission. And, to be the tribute that Brasius wants him to be, Kynon will have to defy all the traditions of Segasa and risk the wrath of the senate that really holds his chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publisher's Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This book is primarily LGBT m/m but contains one or more scenes of m/f sexual interaction. It also contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: strong BDSM theme and elements, dubious consent, violence. Readers with a history of rape or sexual abuse may find elements of this story disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Marc Wynn has accompanied his beloved aunt to estate sales for years, but he's never found anything he couldn't live without-until he meets Sawyer Calhoun. Sawyer, in town to deal with his grandfather's estate, wastes no time in revealing his romantic interest in Marc, but their promising first evening ends badly with Sawyer as adamant about broadcasting his sexuality as Marc is about hiding his. But when Sawyer hires Marc to restore his grandfather's house, their intense attraction grows into an emotional connection neither can resist. During the renovations, family secrets and other surprises come to light, and Sawyer must face his past when a tragedy threatens Marc's livelihood. But not every obstacle is surmountable, and even with Sawyer by his side, Marc might lose everything.</description>

  <description>On a transatlantic cruise to New York, sculptor Rhys Matherton struggles to piece his life back together after losing his mother, inheriting a fortune, and finding out his father isn't his father after all. He spills a tray of drinks on a handsome stranger, then he finds himself up against a wall getting the best hand-job he’s ever had. And for the first time in his life, he feels whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rhys enjoys the company of Silas Quint, but for the eerie way no one pays attention to them even while they kiss in a crowded bar. Silas explains he's a forest fae able to glamor the room around them—and more importantly, that he's on the cruise to hunt vampires. Rhys thinks Silas is full of it, until he discovers vampires are real, and he’s part of their main course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silas Quint can’t be distracted by a human lover, even one as lovely as Rhys. Stuck in the middle of the ocean, he has barely enough of energy to hunt the vampires he’s been sent to destroy. Rhys is full of the one thing Silas needs needs most—the element of living plants. Only sucking energy from Rhys would make Silas as soulless as the creatures he hunts. How can he keep Rhys safe, without becoming like the very monsters he hunts?</description>

  <description>Drug dealers aren't always on the streets; sometimes they sit in offices and board rooms, selling merchandise in official looking bottles instead of little cellophane bags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When given a choice between eight more years in prison or using his "expertise" to assist the Southeastern Narcotics Bureau's Department of Diversion Prevention and Control, convicted drug trafficker Richmond "Lucky" Lucklighter takes the sentence with the illusion of freedom. Cynical and unwilling to admit he's begun to care about his job, he counts the days until his debt is paid. His sole obstacle to getting his life back is the rookie he's assigned to train before he leaves; a rookie who quotes pharmacy texts, hasn't paid his dues, and has the obnoxious tendency of seeing the good in everyone – including the target of their investigation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Marine Bo Schollenberger dreamed of becoming a pharmacist and watched the dream turn into a nightmare of PTSD-fueled prescription drug abuse. Battling his demons daily, he wakes up every morning, wondering, "Will this be the day I give in?" To keep his license, he must now put his skills to use for a diversion control task force, deal with a crude partner with too much attitude and no brain-to-mouth filter, and take down a drug lord who reminds him of his favorite cooking show hostess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bad guys don't stand a chance -- &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; Lucky and Bo don't strangle each other first...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This book contains material some may find objectionable, and is intended only for mature readers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2012 Rainbow Awards Honorable Mention</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Jace, an injured ex-soldier suffering from PTSD, saves Nathaniel, a nineteen-year-old street kid, from a beating. In doing so, he has no way of knowing that he will find his own salvation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace came home from the war scarred in more ways than one. The physical scars that he carries are nothing compared to the mental ones. Struggling with PTSD, he has closed himself off from the rest of the world. The last thing that he ever thought to do was fall in love... Nathaniel has lived on the streets since he was thirteen. When he wakes up in a strange apartment after being badly beaten, he has no idea how he got there. Little does he know that his rescuer, the large man with scars crisscrossing his face, could hold the key to healing the scars that they both have.</description>

  <description>Book One: How the Light Gets In&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was like the only splash of color in a black-and-white photograph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man was beautiful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At an exhibition opening in Sydney, jaded Hollywood heartthrob Jaxon Moncrieff lays eyes on publicity-shy artist Liam Lassiter for the first time and is immediately captivated. But he doesn’t get far into their first conversation before he realizes what he’s feeling is attraction, which brings him up short. Jaxon has always been a womanizer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his reservations, Jaxon makes a play for Liam, but Liam has his own issues. Unlucky in love and orphaned at sixteen, he is reluctant to open his heart to anyone, and dismisses Jaxon out of hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driven by a need he doesn’t understand, Jaxon organizes a return to Sydney to film his next project. If he can’t be with Liam, maybe they can be friends. Of course, that creates a whole new problem. Now Jaxon is falling in love for the first time. How can he move their relationship from friends to lovers without destroying the trust he’s worked so hard for?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;I think these two men have decided to spice up their love life a bit by trying something new. They are in a fancy hotel and have used whatever came to hand. Where did that lacy scarf come from?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two well-built, naked, dark-haired men are in a high-ceilinged room with a wooden floor and white-painted decorative moldings on the walls. The photo catches them in a kiss. The man against the wall is blindfolded with a long length of black lace, and he entwines his legs around the other as he is lifted off the floor, hands grasped firmly, and pressed to the wall in passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Waiting for Forever: Book I&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part One: The Throwaway Boy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the country’s religious and secular leaders battle over equality in the abstract, Brian McAllister and Jamie Mayfield live in the crossfire. In their little town of Crayford, Alabama, loving another boy is the worst kind of sin. Best friends since childhood, they explore their love and each other in Jamie’s backyard tree house as they hide from the world. They happily plan for the future together—until their lives are rocked when their secret is exposed and Jamie’s family intervenes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When hatred turns to violence in their sleepy little town, Brian tries to cope with the loss of his best friend, who is stolen in the night.

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verses of Vrelenden: Book One&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the suspicions Mother Dragon shared with Celestrian before her death, he may be the last surviving unicorn of Vrelenden—though most may simply think him some crazy person with a horn attached to his forehead. Nevertheless, Trian has nothing to hold on to but hope, and he’s about to hang that hope on an unlikely hero named Renwald Mallorian. Ren may have been born an accountant’s son, but he’s longed to be a professional hero for as long as he can remember, and he’s read every book on the subject he could get his hands on. When Trian arrives and hires him to find the last remaining unicorns, Ren jumps at the offer and their quest begins.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the evil Father Denkham is intent on obtaining the last unicorn and sets a deadly assassin on their trail. If that isn’t bad enough, they’ll face a Vampire, Dragon, bandits, and zombies. Their only hope now is for Ren to prove he’s the hero he always dreamed of becoming—but no book in the world could have prepared him for what’s in store.</description>

  <description>All Lucas Tripp wants is prosperity for the tenants of his family’s estate; good weather for the harvest; suitable matches for his sisters; a little money left over at the end of the month; and more quality time with his boyfriend, Alex Booker. That’s not so much to ask for, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong. When his sister’s new suitor suddenly disappears, Lucas is drawn into an adventure of a lifetime—kicking and screaming all the way. Magical beings who were allegedly banished hundreds of years ago are coming through portals that were supposed to be shut against them—and that’s only part of Lucas’s problem. The rest consists of missing princes, breaking and entering, suspicious magicians, well-meaning women who are far too interested in Lucas’s sex life… the list goes on. Lucas is decidedly Not Amused, but he’ll get over it someday. Probably. After all, there’s always Alex.</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Reese Johnson can finally leave her troublesome past behind. She enters college with her best friend, Gia, and spends her time doing what she loves—working as a self-defense instructor at a local gym. Then Luke Ryann enters the picture. He’s the tall, dark, and tattooed MMA fighter her boss hires to privately train her. One minute, he captivates her with his piercing brown eyes and boyish dimples. The next, he infuriates her with his relentless banter and cocky bad boy behavior. He’s the last thing she wants or needs, and she never expects to fall in love with him.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke’s jaded past has him keeping a safe distance. Despite what he feels, some things are better left alone. He has a dangerous secret—one that has the potential to risk their lives. As he fights the attraction between them, can he resist the growing tension and protect the woman he’ll never be able to have? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for mature audiences due to situations of abuse, violence, strong language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raising Ryann, the first book in the Bad Boy Reformed series, isn't just a story about first love.  It's filled with action, suspense, mystery, and a touch of humor.</description>

  <description>When Madison “Matty” Ward finds himself out of work and without a place to live, his cousin comes through with a job on the Gates cattle ranch. Despite not knowing anything about herding cattle or taking care of horses, Matty does his best to impress the older hunky foreman, Baxter Hollingsworth. Baxter is drawn to the new young hand, but he’s deeply closeted, and after an openly gay veterinarian shows he’s interested in Matty, Baxter’s repressed feelings lead to an explosive encounter. Baxter then withdraws—leaving Matty feeling angry and used—until an accident forces him to confront his fears.</description>

  <description>After two years, Matthew Langer is still getting over the death of a loved one. He's steered clear of serious relationships, but when he meets the irascible, dirty mouthed and tempestuous Shane Templar that decision has never been harder. Shane is sexy, warm and funny, and Matthew finds himself trying like hell not to care about him. Especially when Shane, with his quick wit and hacking skills, is quick to stand up for justice and avenge wrongs. Then Shane strikes at the wrong target, and Matthew realises just how far gone he already is. At the threat of losing for good yet another man who’s broken through his armour, Matthew finds his heart stripped bare. He must face the demons of his soul or a future without love.</description>

  <description>A battle is brewing in the conservative little town of Webster’s Glen. Gay activist Dylan Cussler stirs up the establishment when he moves in with his boyfriend and sues the state over its gay adoption ban. Sixteen-year-old Jericho Jiles and his best friend, Mac Travis, decide to do their bit to convince Dylan and his boyfriend to leave town. But when Dylan turns up before they can finish trashing his house, Jericho panics, leaving Dylan unconscious and wounded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drowning in guilt, Jericho returns to Dylan’s home to make amends. He is surprised when Dylan forgives him and opens his eyes to the world around him. Soon Jericho comes to a life-changing realization: he is attracted to boys as well as girls. That’s a problem, considering Jericho has a girlfriend and very strict, very religious parents. Accepting his sexuality means he must question not only his identity and his place in the world but his relationship with his girlfriend, his parents, and with God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so begins the battle for Jericho’s soul.</description>

  <description>A "quickie" is all Shawn Delaney wants when he meets Marc Wright at a XXX bookstore. Instead, he discovers instant, explosive chemistry with a man with whom he has nothing in common. The last thing he wants is a long-term relationship with anyone, much less an impulsive guy sporting chipped black nail polish. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a workaholic like Shawn, "love" is a four-letter word, until Marc strolls into his life and turns it upside down in the best way possible. And for the first time in his life, Shawn isn’t concentrating on work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the discovery of a simple yellow rubber ducky in Marc’s luggage sends Shawn on a downward spiral of confusion about his lover's history and fidelity, and eventually, it leads to heartbreak. Has their entire relationship been nothing more than the illusion of happiness, or could there be more to Marc’s betrayal than meets the eye?</description>

  <description>Cassidy Ryan and Brynn Michaels attend the same high school, but they live in different worlds. Cassidy’s a popular cheerleader, and Brynn’s the social leper. One is all sunshine and rainbows, while the other could’ve been carved from an Edgar Allan Poe book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both girls have their problems, though. Cassidy is coming into her birthright—a long line of ancient magic Cassidy isn’t ready to have. Brynn is coming into her sexuality—something that will definitely cause problems with her very conservative family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a teacher assigns Cassidy and Brynn to work together on a project, the girls find themselves in a heap of trouble, because what they feel for each other can’t be denied. If they have any hope of changing ignorant and frightened minds, they’ll have to listen to their own hearts first.</description>

  <description>Dustin gave up on being worthy of anyone's affections a long time ago, drowning his problems in substance abuse and meaningless encounters. He has learned it's better to avoid love altogether than risk the inevitable moment when it all comes crashing down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicolæ has neither eyesight nor excess, but he does have a wealth of family and intuition. He is nothing that Dustin would have anticipated in a potential lover, but the more Dustin discovers, the more he finds himself willing to accept the risk - even if his conscience and the people in his life keep warning him away.</description>

  <description>Love doesn’t come with a syllabus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelly Davidson has waited what seems like forever to graduate high school and get out of his small-minded, small town. But when he arrives at Hope University, he quickly realizes finding his Prince Charming isn’t so easy. Everyone here is already out. In fact, Kelly could be the only virgin on campus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worst of all, he’s landed the charming, handsome, gay campus Casanova as a roommate, whose bed might as well be equipped with a revolving door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Walter Lucas doesn’t believe in storybook love. Everyone is better off having as much fun as possible with as many people as possible…except his shy, sad little sack of a roommate is seriously screwing up his world view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Walter sets out to lure Kelly out of his shell, staying just friends is harder than he anticipated. He discovers love is a crash course in determination. To make the grade, he’ll have to finally show up for class…and overcome his own private fear that love was never meant to last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This story contains lingering glances, milder than usual sexual content for this author, and a steamy dance-floor kiss. Story has no dairy or egg content, but may contain almonds.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to legend, King Arthur is supposed to return when Britain needs him most. So why does a man claiming to be the once and future king suddenly appear in Los Angeles?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This charismatic young Arthur creates a new Camelot within the City of Angels to lead a crusade of unwanted kids against an adult society that discards and ignores them. Under his banner of equality, every needy child is welcome, regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, or gang affiliation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of his amazing First Knight, homeless fourteen-year-old Lance, Arthur transforms this ragtag band of rejected children and teens into a well-trained army—the Children of the Knight. Through his intervention, they win the hearts and minds of the populace at large, and gain a truer understanding of themselves and their worth to society. But seeking more rights for kids pits Arthur and the children squarely against the rich, the influential, and the self-satisfied politicians who want nothing more than to maintain the status quo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can right truly overcome might? Arthur’s hopeful young knights are about to find out, and the City of Angels will never be the same.</description>

  <description>Working for a California-based film production company, David McIntyre is the go-to man for matching the right location to the right project for the right price. On an extended trip to Hawaii, he hires Sutton’s Air Service to cart him all around to some of the most exotic locations in the South Pacific. During one of those trips, a freak tropical storm forces them to make a crash landing, leaving both men stranded without a radio and with very little in the way of food and water. Rick Sutton’s injuries make it imperative that they be rescued soon, and David finds himself calling on all his professional skills to keep both of them alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It takes a vivid dream about WW2 however, to make David realize that he has real feelings for Rick—more than just his natural concern that both of them get out of this mess alive. But putting his heart on the line might be the greatest risk David has ever taken—does he have the courage to make it before time runs out on both of them? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 74,949 (approximate)</description>

  <description>It's the worst feeling in the world, seeing him with someone else. There's nothing I wouldn't do, no limits I won't go to get him back. But he won't give me a chance. He won't so much as look at me because he thinks I don't belong to him anymore.&lt;br&gt;But that's the whole thing.&lt;br&gt;I don't belong anywhere. &lt;br&gt;Doesn't matter where I go or who I am with I am always alone. There is something wrong with me, there has to be because no one else seems quite as miserable at being without a master. &lt;br&gt;But don't we all owe our freedom to something? &lt;br&gt;People are slaves, aren't they? To their jobs, to their partners, to their children, even to their lifestyles? &lt;br&gt;We all have those little kinks that we don't tell anyone about, because we think we're going to be judged for them, and because we're slaves to society's rules. &lt;br&gt;In a world where slavery is the norm I'm a slave to my needs. &lt;br&gt;To him. &lt;br&gt;And I need to get him back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNINGS: HARDCORE BDSM, DUB-CON, NON-CON</description>

  <description>Raised in a remote farming community, Tom Fletcher knows little of his Shifter heritage and less about the dangerous lives that others of his kind lead in the city of Riverside. For Tom the big city is a daydream of opening nights and bright theater lights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Tom meets Cloud Coldmoon — infamous and handsome heir to a criminal syndicate — everything changes. Suddenly suspected of murder, Tom must flee to the only city where his kind are common.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with shapeshifters, con men, mobsters and ruled by the vengeful Coldmoon Family, Riverside is as perilous as it is alluring. Tom seeks refuge in the Turnskin Theatre, where his shape-changing skills can be put to good use on and off the stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here he has a chance to fulfill his dreams of stardom and romance, but only if he can stay one step ahead of police and criminals alike, otherwise the next shape he takes could be his last.</description>

  <description>Sinclair Jeffries thought she knew what she was getting into when her zany, gay friend, Jesse Eddington, talked her into portraying his girlfriend during his parent's anniversary party on Huntington Beach. That is, until she met Reed, Jesse's sexy as hell older brother, and ends up getting much more than what she'd bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reed Eddington assumed his future was settled until he met Sinclair, his brother's so-called "girlfriend", but the raw, sexual tension between them is hard to ignore. As he watches their ruse from the sidelines, he finds himself wanting to uncover more than just their amusing little facade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to sexual content and heavy subject matter, this book is recommended for ages 18+</description>

  <description>Art history professor Daniel Wollek is delighted to assist the Uffizi Gallery in Florence in cataloguing a cache of Renaissance artworks uncovered by an earthquake. But when a second earthquake pitches him headlong into the fifteenth century, Daniel finds himself more involved than he expected in rescuing precious artifacts from a fanatic's bonfires. Then he meets Leonardo di Vinci's assistant, Giacopo di Careggi, and finds in the beautiful young model a treasure even greater than art from the past. A story from the Dreamspinner Press 2012 Daily Dose package "Time Is Eternity."</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At St. Peter’s, an exclusive British boarding school for boys, a teacher’s word is law—and Anthony Parker is leading a rebellion. When he is found reading a book containing “questionable content,” he receives a reprimand from the headmaster. Parker responds by secretly lending questionable materials to other students, aided by his best friend and long-time crush, Rafe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The situation escalates when their draconic literature teacher discovers their subterfuge and compiles a banned books list. Parker and Rafe fall in with Peter Fritz, a broody outcast who’s turning the ban in his favor by buying and lending banned books to students—for a price. As the banned books library grows and hidden feelings threaten the boys’ burgeoning partnership, they discover that the challenges of growing up might outweigh the rewards of bucking the system.</description>

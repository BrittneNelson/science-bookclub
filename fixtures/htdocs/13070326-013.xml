  <description>Kiss by heated kiss in the City of Light and Love…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When event planner Chloe Turner wakes up penniless and without a passport in the Plaza Athénée Hotel in Paris, she only has a few fleeting memories of Claude, the suave French man who convinced her to have that extra glass of wine…before taking all of her possessions and slipping out the door. As the overly organized, go-to gal for her drama queen younger sisters, her anxiety-ridden father, and her needy clients, Chloe is normally prepared for every disaster that comes her way. But with her wedding to her straight-laced, lawyer fiancé back in DC only days away and a French con-man on the loose with her engagement ring, this is one catastrophe she never could have planned for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Chloe tries to figure out a way home, she runs into an even bigger problem: the police are after her due to suspicious activity now tied to her bank account. Chloe's only hope at retrieving her passport and clearing her name lies in the hands of Julien, a rugged, undercover agent who has secrets of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Chloe follows this mysterious, and—although she doesn't want to admit it—sexy French man on a wild chase through the sun-kissed countryside of France, she discovers a magical world she never knew existed. And she can’t help but wonder if the perfectly ordered life she’s built for herself back home really what she wants after all…</description>

  <description>Genre: LGBT, Contemporary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sexy, kilt-wearing astronomy professor Greg MacIntyre moves in next door, Blake Theriot knows he's in trouble. Blake is a research librarian, and he likes things orderly and controlled. But in his secret fantasies, he craves a big, powerful man like Greg to stir up his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every time Blake tries to talk to his erudite neighbor, his brain shuts down and his vocabulary is reduced to one-word utterances, but when Blake's niece challenges him to invite Greg to dinner, he does. A few shots of after-dinner whiskey loosen Blake's inhibitions, and the two men share a hot kiss and the promise of more. Can Blake relax enough to give himself a chance with Greg, or will his fear of letting go ruin his hopes for love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's note: This book is a revised, re-edited version of one previously released by another publisher under the same title.</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Evan Granger has no problems with being gay. Despite his mother’s objections, he wears nail polish and makeup to school and pursues his goal of becoming a professional drag queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TV drag star Taffy Sweet gives encouragement and Evan’s cousin Holly tries to protect him, but school bullies abuse him so badly because of his sexuality and the girly way he dresses that he ends up at the hospital emergency room. After that, even his new crush, a closeted football jock named Moe Garcia, is unhappy about Evan's choice to live his life openly gay. But even in girly clothes and nail polish, Evan is a force to be reckoned with, and he soon shows the bullies—and everyone else—that beating a drag queen up does not mean the queen is beaten down.</description>

  <description>In Viking Age Iceland, where boys are expected to grow into strong farmers and skilled warriors, there is little place for a sickly twelve-year-old boy like Kol until he catches the eye of a seið-woman—a sorceress—and becomes her apprentice. Kol travels to the sorceress’s home, where her grandson, Thorbrand, takes Kol under his wing. Before long Kol discovers something else about himself that is different—something else that sets him apart as unmanly: Kol has fallen in love with another boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the world is changing in ways that threaten those who practice the ancient arts. As Kol’s new life takes him across the Norse lands, he finds that a new religion is sweeping through them, and King Olaf Tryggvason is hunting down and executing sorcerers. When a decades-old feud forces Thorbrand to choose between Kol and his duty to his kinsman, Kol finds himself cast adrift with only the cryptic messages of an ancient goddess to guide him to his destiny—and possibly to his death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young Adult Age Range: 14 to 18 years old</description>

  <description>Life doesn't look like it's supposed to for Dani Ruiz, a hopeless romantic. After a painful and sudden break-up with Rick Marin, Dani hides away from reality, retreating to a world of fiction where she prefers book boyfriends over the hassles of a relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost two years later, Dani's friends are tired of watching her in a holding pattern, so they stage an intervention, forcing her back into the real world of dating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unexpectedly, Dani meets Liam Lucas, a down-to-earth firefighter. He might be the person to show her she's still worth something. Dani's hesitant to trust her heart with another man, but their instant and electric chemistry is something she can't deny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dani starts to believe that she's found her real-life book boyfriend, Rick decides that he'll go to any lengths to get her back. Seeing Rick as a changed man makes Dani question everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Dani trust her patched-up heart with Liam? &lt;br&gt;Or has Rick transformed into the man she's always wanted? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written from various points of views, The Do Over is a story of second chances and new beginnings.</description>

  <description>The prophecies were there but no one listened. Until now. They are the Lords of Deliverance and they have the power to ward off Doomsday . . . or let it ride. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jillian Cardiff came to this remote mountain town to forget the demon attack that almost killed her. Instead, she rescues - and falls for - a gorgeous stranger who has no memory of anything other than his name. Handsome, charming and protective, Reseph seems like the kind of man that Jillian can trust. But with hints of a troubling history of his own, he's also the kind of man that can be very dangerous . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reseph may not know his background, or why he mysteriously appeared in Jillian's life, but he knows he wants to stay. Yet when Jillian's neighbours are killed and demon hunters arrive on the scene, Reseph fears that he's putting Jillian in danger. And once it's revealed that Reseph is also Pestilence, the Horseman responsible for ravaging the world with death and destruction, he and Jillian must face the greatest challenge of all: can they forget the horrors of a chilling past to save the future they both desire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Includes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;- A preview of "Eternal Rider"&lt;br&gt;- &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13514070.Apocalypse__The_Lords_of_Deliverance_Compendium" title="Apocalypse: The Lords of Deliverance Compendium"&gt;Apocalypse: The Lords of Deliverance Compendium&lt;/a&gt; (with an exclusive short story "Eternal Damnation")&lt;br&gt;- Glossary</description>

  <description>You breathe in, you breathe out, and everything you know is gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara Walker knows firsthand what it feels like to have your reality ripped away, scrambled, and shoved back at you in an undone puzzle where pieces are missing and nothing fits. She's lost so much and is struggling to live and to find the strength to forgive herself for being human. With the help of Lincoln, her husband's brother, Sara realizes it's not about finding who she used to be, but about finding who she is now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You breathe in, you breathe out, and everything you know isn't gone, but reborn.</description>

  <description>Reader Beware: If you're not OK with having your guts ripped out and are not a bit of a masochist when it comes to reading, this may not be the book for you. If you're open-minded and willing to have a life-changing experience even if you have to go through the wringer emotionally, this is definitely the book for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you do when you realize you were foolish enough to throw away true, unconditional love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lorraina Dabney turns her back on her creativity and tumultuous upbringing to embark on a college career that will lead her to law school and to becoming what she values most in life—a controlled, powerful, respected woman. When she stumbles upon her childhood friend's artwork, she feels inspired to reconnect with him and her former self.  This onslaught of emotion will send Lorraina in a tale-spin to figure out exactly why she abandoned all that she was, all that she could've been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming from his own chaotic upbringing, Michael falls quickly and deeply in love with Lorraina at a tender age. Even her rejection can't stand in the way of his obsession. When she starts to date other boys, however, Michael finally relents, causing him to spiral further into a world filled with violence, drugs, alcohol, and women. Realizing this lifestyle will only lead to his further estrangement from Lorraina, Michael sets about to turn himself around before going to get his girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Bang will have Lorraina questioning everything.</description>

  <description>Former con artist Katherine "KC" Carmichael inherits the Honey House, a Bed and Breakfast located in the tiny town of Juniper Springs, AZ, a hot bed of the paranormal tourism industry. It doesn't take her long to discover that both the town and the House are keeping secrets. The town entices thrill-seekers with special photo-safaris at "The Way They Were" Ranch, to take advantage of the rumors that werewolves have been spotted in the area. KC realizes something doesn’t add up when the local sheriff throws her in jail for breaking the town’s full moon curfew. She soon discovers werewolves and witches are real, and she wonders what other fairy tales might be waiting to come to life. With multiple murders and men to distract her, KC needs to discover her own hidden magick in order to survive.</description>

  <description>I'm not your typical girl. I've been running away from the memories that haunt me for so long that depression has become my only comfort. I was content in the darkness...until Wes Michals offered to be my light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't know that time wasn't my ally -- that every second that ticked past was one step closer to the end of something that was beginning to mean the end of myself. He tried to warn me. He promised me all he was able to offer--each moment as it came--but it would never be enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes when you think it's the end, it's only the beginning. Wes thought he could save me, but in giving me everything, he ruined me. Because after one kiss, one touch, I couldn't--I wouldn't ever be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And from that moment on, his heartbeat became my own.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Take two stubborn cowboys, add in one determined little boy, and toss in a snowstorm for good measure. Who knew building a family could be so hard?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you ask Isaiah Preston, he’s pretty lucky. He’s happy in his job as a ranch manager, admires his boss, Grady, in more ways than one, and if he doesn’t have everything he wants, well, that’s life, isn’t it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter one little brother, and suddenly Isaiah's comfortable world is turned upside down. Everything becomes complicated and he's seeing people in ways he never has before—good and bad. Near-perfect isn't enough anymore. Isaiah wants it all—home, family and, most importantly, Grady, in both his life and bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To get what he wants, though, Isaiah is going to have to fight prejudice, misunderstanding, and even Grady himself.</description>

  <description>The old sugar maple features strongly in Stuart's life. He'd first met Harry here, while he was completing a college project. He'd been eighteen, Harry twenty-one. They'd started dating soon after. Harry had proposed under the maple—down on one knee, the whole nine yards. Under its branches, they'd decided to buy a house together, and here, many years later, Stuart had scattered Harry's ashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For six years Stuart has been alone. He feels he's had his chance at love, and doesn't expect to find anyone else. Then he meets Tom. But Tom is twenty years his junior, and Stuart can't take that in his stride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their age difference is irrelevant to Tom. He knows Stuart is it for him, the one man who can give him everything he didn't know he needed, and he can offer the same to Stuart. All he has to do is convince Stuart to give them a chance. Once again Old Man Maple is witness to life-changing decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NB - shorter version previously published in the anthology Silver Presents... Love Is Love</description>

  <description>When Senior Constable Daniel Hart stops bartender Phoenix Love from picking his pocket one evening, it’s an inauspicious beginning, but Daniel falls for the beautiful Phoenix anyway. Things become complicated when Detective Paul Somerset, who’s been on the trail of Australia’s notorious serial killer “The Crucifix Slayer”, sets his sights on Phoenix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Convinced that Phoenix Love is the killer, Detective Somerset pursues him single-mindedly. As evidence, and Phoenix’s behavior, point toward Somerset being right, Daniel must protect their fledgling love affair, his own heart and his lover while deciphering whether or not Phoenix actually is the killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Phoenix Love a victim or is his love affair with Daniel doomed to fall at the whims of a monster?</description>

  <description>Scot Victore is a multi-billionaire business man.  He is a distractingly good looking, intensely sexual, controlled and powerful human being.  He is the successor to his father, Gray Victore and the Victore Empire, the largest privately owned business in Europe.  Scot is ready to take over the world and there’s nothing to stand in his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no love in Scot Victore’s life and that's how he wants it to be.  The world is his for the taking, nothing is out of reach when you have his power and his money combined with his name, Victore.  Anything Scot wants he gets, that's the way his life has always been.  Whether it’s buying out a global company or taking someone to his bed everything comes easy to him.  So why is it the one thing he wants more than anything is out of his reach?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Burton is a mysteriously beautiful private young man who is out of his reach.  He's an enigma.  Scot has known Jamie all his life but he suddenly realises that he is a stranger to him.  Finding out who Jamie is becomes an obsession, one that will overtake his every thought and control his mind.  Jamie can't or won't give Scot what he needs, his heart.  Soon Scot is lost in his overwhelming need for him, his whole world is Jamie, but not having anything returned pushes them both to the edge of sanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their relationship is out of control, incredibly passionate.  The sex is dangerous and explosive but it doesn’t end in the bedroom.  Everything about Jamie and Scot is explosive.  Everything apart from Jamie's feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no end to what Scot will do for Jamie.  No end to how he loves him.  No end to what he will do to keep him.  But how far will he push the emotionally unstable love of his life?  Too much?</description>

Did the elder Hilliard die with Hicks Pasha’s army at El Obeid in 1883 or, as his mother fervently hopes, did he somehow escape the massacre there by the fanatic Mahdist Dervishes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His greatest support comes from the Ja’alin Zaki, the love of his young life, his friend, and soul-mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world that refuses to recognize the right of men to love men and in an era that looks down on the “inferior” natives, Gregory faces his most difficult battle for personal happiness. Success will bring him and Zaki fulfilment but also unravel a tragic and at the same time life-enhancing mystery with its roots in far away England… and in the solving of it, one which might yet rip the two lovers apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 145,000 word novel Gregory’s Story is the companion to A Life Apart. While Gregory’s Story stands alone as a novel, some of the characters from A Life Apart appear in this completely new story taking place ten years later.</description>

  <description>August Adahy Mendez would rather be buried in the world of his detective novels or a good film noir movie than in real life. He’s overweight, undermotivated, and stuck in a dead-end job. As a Chincha, he’s part of a long line of chinchilla shifters, but the greatest accomplishment in his life so far has been moving an hour away from his close-knit herd. That all changes when August’s grandfather leaves him enough cash to pursue his dream: becoming a detective himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Ewing is a bitter divorcé who enjoys watching football and being alone. It’s easier when his only interaction with people is when he collects rent from his office building tenants. Then August rents space from him to set up his new detective agency, and Sam is drawn to him despite his misgivings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam soon finds himself involved with one of August’s cases, and the men join forces to catch their criminal. The greater challenges they face, however, are how August makes Sam want to give love a second try and how Sam makes August believe that real life might be even better than fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Rock singer, Ash Ivers, and country music star, Jackson Abrams, have intense passion that brings them together, but will they be able to overcome all their differences when Jackson's career is threatened?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ash Ivers says and does what he wants, and with being the lead singer of the world famous rock band, From Ashes, he gets away with both. Three years ago, his mouth got the better of him, and he started a media feud with county music star, Jackson Abrams. When they’re both booked to play a charity concert, he sees his chance to finally confront Jackson in person. Though, he’s uncertain if his anger will hold against his attraction to the singing cowboy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson Abrams is the darling of country music. He’s polite, charming, handsome…and he has a secret that he fears could jeopardize his career. When it comes to the cocky rock star, Ash Ivers, he’s infuriated and intrigued by him. He wants their feuding to stop, but he also doesn't want to lose the attention it gives him from Ash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Ash and Jackson meet, the heat of anger turns to passion. But when Jackson’s world starts crumbling around him, will their differences make them stronger, or drive them apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Author's Note***&lt;br&gt;This is the expanded, full-length novel. The original novella, "A Little Bit Country", was approximately 28k. This book is approximately 60k. It takes the original novella, and where it ended, this one continues on to complete the story.</description>

  <description>A couture wedding dress designer to the rich and famous, Lexi LaCroix’s image means everything. But crossing paths with a sexier-than-sin, bad-boy biker makes Lexi realize how much living she’s sacrificed for her success and one touch is all it takes to threaten her carefully choreographed life. When that touch fills far more than just Lexi’s physical needs, she finds herself torn between the career she needs and the bad-boy she craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jax Chamberlin gave up the superficial life of acting for the thrill of running his own stunt company years ago. But a recent betrayal proves he’s still too close to the limelight to find a woman who doesn’t plan to use him as a stepping-stone to success. When the charming and mysterious Lexi offers him a totally anonymous hook-up during an out of town trip, Jax accepts. Only Lexi is more sextacular than charming, and Jax wants more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lexi’s got a major hang-up over his renegade lifestyle, and Jax isn’t willing to change his ways. Especially not when he discovers who she really is. Because if she finds out his connections could catapult her to the top of her career, he’s afraid the fantasy woman he’s falling for might just end up like all the other gold-diggers. And this time, it’s not just his bad-boy reputation at risk, but his heart, too.</description>

  <description>Neil Josten is the newest addition to the Palmetto State University Exy team. He's short, he's fast, he's got a ton of potential—and he's the runaway son of the murderous crime lord known as The Butcher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Signing a contract with the PSU Foxes is the last thing a guy like Neil should do. The team is high profile and he doesn't need sports crews broadcasting pictures of his face around the nation. His lies will hold up only so long under this kind of scrutiny and the truth will get him killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Neil's not the only one with secrets on the team. One of Neil's new teammates is a friend from his old life, and Neil can't walk away from him a second time. Neil has survived the last eight years by running. Maybe he's finally found someone and something worth fighting for.</description>

  <description>Jacob Cruz, aka “Mr. Matchmaker”, has an uncanny knack for knowing who would be perfect for whom, which led to his own successful matchmaking company, &lt;em&gt;His Perfect Match&lt;/em&gt;. His record is nearly flawless, but when it comes to his own love life he always seems to miss the mark.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brant Hudson, aka “Mr. Romance”, is a hopeless romantic with his own romance consulting business. He knows every move in the book to win a heart and build a lasting, loving relationship, heck, &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wrote the book. Even knowing what he knows, seeing his clients’ relationships bloom and grow, his own seems to miss the spark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparks fly the first time Jacob and Brant meet at a New Year’s Eve party, but bad timing and sitcom-worthy mishaps conspire against them at every turn, from demanding clients to current boyfriends, spilled drinks to broken bones, and a rogue ferret. How can the perfect couple ever hope to make it work when Old Lady Fate refuses to get out of their way?</description>

  <description>Toronto artist Gabriel Navarro splits his time between slinging ink and working on his master’s degree. He’s sure of his beliefs and his artistic integrity and naïve enough to think he’ll never compromise—until Iraq war veteran Jake MacLean shows up in his tattoo parlor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overcome with anger and survivor’s guilt, Jake is locked in a struggle to atone for sins he’s sure will never be forgiven. Desperate to get his life back on track and with nowhere else to go, he moves in with his sister in Toronto. He doesn't expect to fall for Gabe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Jake’s refusal to talk about what happened in Iraq frustrates Gabe, accepting Jake’s claims that he's “fine” is easier than dealing with the truth. But pretty soon it’s clear Jake can’t control his panic attacks, and his condition is worsening. If Gabe can’t help him face his demons, Jake is headed for a crash—and there’s every chance he’ll take Gabriel down with him.</description>

  <description>How can love between two men possibly be responsible for a horse’s death during the Kentucky Derby? Reporter Will Yeats wants to know the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen years ago, a love affair between a jockey and a horse trainer and a tragic accident on the racetrack scandalized the horseracing world. But Nic Pithiviers and Louis Meerow seem to have no desire to set the record straight: they refuse the interview and send attorney Francis LeBon to question Will’s motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Francis has a special place in his heart for Nic and Louis, who taught him to take pride in himself as a gay man, and he’ll stop at nothing to protect them from a gossipmongering reporter. However, Francis doesn’t expect the reporter’s honesty and genuine determination to exonerate two men falsely accused… or the growing attraction to Will he feels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While visiting with Nic and Louis at their horse training center in France, Will uncovers a web of intrigue, secrets, and old lies, and he unwittingly sets a series of perilous events into motion that not only threaten to destroy his budding relationship with Francis, but Nic and Louis’s decades-long commitment as well.</description>

  <description>A lord in danger. A magician in turmoil. A snowball in hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Charm of Magpies&lt;/em&gt;, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exiled to China for twenty years, Lucien Vaudrey never planned to return to England. But with the mysterious deaths of his father and brother, it seems the new Lord Crane has inherited an earldom. He’s also inherited his family’s enemies. He needs magical assistance, fast. He doesn’t expect it to turn up angry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magician Stephen Day has good reason to hate Crane’s family. Unfortunately, it’s his job to deal with supernatural threats. Besides, the earl is unlike any aristocrat he’s ever met, with the tattoos, the attitude…and the way Crane seems determined to get him into bed. That’s definitely unusual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Stephen is falling hard for the worst possible man, at the worst possible time. But Crane’s dangerous appeal isn’t the only thing rendering Stephen powerless. Evil pervades the house, a web of plots is closing round Crane, and if Stephen can’t find a way through it—they’re both going to die. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains hot m/m sex between a deeply inappropriate earl and a very confused magician, dark plots in a magical version of Victorian England, family values (not the good kind), and a lot of swearing.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Alex Verus is part of a world hidden in plain sight, running a magic shop in London. And while Alex's own powers aren't as showy as some mages, he does have the advantage of foreseeing the possible future--allowing him to pull off operations that have a million-to-one-chance of success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Alex is approached by multiple factions to crack open a relic from a long-ago mage war, he knows that whatever's inside must be beyond powerful. And thanks to his abilities, Alex can predict that by taking the job, his odds of survival are about to go from slim to none...</description>

  <description>Detective Roger Corso is open about his sexual orientation. He's less forthcoming about his leather lifestyle. He thinks he's doing a pretty good job of keeping it covert, but then something happen that changes his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone delivers an elegantly clothed corpse to his home. His couch to be precise. And that corpse is carrying a leather flogger. Roger's taking that personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additional distraction comes in the form of the victim's younger brother Sean. He's annoying. Knows something about the murder he's not telling. Wants something from Roger--and is everything Roger ever wanted. But before he can make Sean his, he's going to have to solve the mystery of the elegant corpse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, BDSM with significant D/s play, male/male sexual practices, spanking, strong violence.]</description>

  <description>Lucas doesn't want attachments.  He thinks life is much easier that way.  Watching the way his mom suffered when his father was dying taught him that. But deep down, Lucas likes the idea of someone taking care of him, of coming home to the same person every night. Yeah, what Lucas &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; wants is love....so why is he settling for random quick sex in seedy bathrooms??</description>

  <description>Lexis had everything, beauty, grace and a powerful coven, but through a feat of arrogance, he loses it all. Even his sight and his freedom are taken from him. Imprisoned and humiliated by humans, Lexis sinks into a depression so thick that not even a chance at freedom is welcomed. A headstrong werewolf, Bryce frees the broken vampire from his cell and back into life. Despite Lexis' resistance, Bryce shows the vampire that weakness only enhances strength and that to him, he has an unnatural worth. When a ghost from Lexis' past returns to threaten the union of vampire and wolf, it is up to Lexis to find it in himself to fight for himself and the man he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Dubious consent, male/male sexual practices, sex while in shifted form, strong violence.</description>

  <description>Everyone enjoys peace and tranquility, and Victor Bayne is no exception. He goes to great lengths to maintain a harmonious home with his partner, Jacob. Although the cannery is huge, it’s grown difficult to avoid the elephant in the room…the elephant with the letters FPMP scrawled on its hide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once Jacob surrendered his PsyCop badge, he infiltrated the Federal Psychic Monitoring Program. In his typical restrained fashion, he hasn’t been sharing much about what he actually does behind its vigilantly guarded doors. And true to form, Vic hasn’t asked. In fact, he would prefer not to think about the FPMP at all, since he’s owed Director Dreyfuss an exorcism since their private flight to PsyTrain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Vic has successfully avoided FPMP entanglement for several months, now his debt has finally come due.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;Please help this poor Laird. He’s a warrior and a leader, always alone. Now he’s fallen in love with the enemy and his clan won’t allow it. Please don’t make him time travel, but he can shift for sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A scruffy shirtless bald man in a red, green, and white kilt is standing with his feet apart looking up. He has tattoos on his upper right chest, and his arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.</description>

  <description>It wasn't the first time Heydn Case had to transfer to a new school, but Acton-Pierce Academy was the prep school of choice for people with a lot more money than he had. As always, the good-natured Texan was hoping to find a friend; his assigned roommate was hoping to be left alone and said so rather bluntly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heydn had never met anyone quite like Blue Barclay, the campus's resident eccentric loner, but the two young men soon find they have more in common than they might have imagined. Friendship quickly takes on a new dimension of physical intimacy accompanied by bewildering new feelings. However, Blue and Heydn are given little time to explore and understand what is growing between them before they're pulled apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heydn is chosen for the track team and befriended by a popular senior. Fearing, rightly, that their relationship would cost him the place he's won at Acton, Heydn turns his back on Blue. He feels he's made the right choice for his future, but when Blue finds a new friend, Heydn realizes he's made a terrible mistake. Is it too late for him to try to win Blue's heart again?</description>

  <description>Blaze Shinozuka has two goals: get a job as a guitarist and lose his virginity. At an audition for a famous pop star, he draws the attention of celebrity manager Jason Stockton—and their instant attraction sends his world careening off its axis just as he is thrust into the gritty world of rock 'n' roll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Straight-laced music manager Jason Stockton is always professional and never dips his pen in the company ink. But there is something about Blaze that leaves him wanting what he shouldn't. The guitarist’s exotic beauty and compelling innocence is a temptation Jason can’t resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After one lie in the national media pushes them apart, Blaze must decide whether he will trust Jason, a man he shouldn’t touch, let alone love. The cutthroat, jealous world of rock 'n' roll, has chewed up and spit out the toughest musicians, and Blaze vows he will be the last man standing, even after the music stops.</description>

  <description>“I subscribe to the notion that if you can laugh at the shittiest moments in your life,you can transcend them. And if other people can laugh at your awful shit as well, then I guess you can officially call yourself a comedian.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Boston, a college student fears leaving her own room—even to use the toilet. In Pennsylvania, a meek personal assistant finally confronts a perpetually enraged gay spiritual guru. In Texas, a rookie high school teacher deals with her male student’s unusually, er, hard personal problem. Sara Benincasa has been that terrified student, that embattled employee, that confused teacher—and so much more. Her hilarious memoir chronicles her attempts to forge a wonderfully weird adulthood in the midst of her lifelong struggle with agoraphobia, depression, and unruly hair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relatable, unpretentious, and unsentimental, &lt;em&gt;Agorafabulous!&lt;/em&gt; celebrates eccentricity, resilience, and the power of humor to light up even the darkest corners of our lives. (There are also some sexy parts, but they’re really awkward. Like really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; awkward.)</description>

  <description>The last thing Nathaniel, aka Deuce, expects to see when he gets home from work is his street jammed with fire engines and police cars. When he realizes that it’s his apartment building that’s on fire, Nathaniel can only think of one thing: his pregnant dog, trapped inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When firefighter Trey Donovan delivers Nathaniel’s unharmed dog to him, Nathaniel is exceedingly grateful. After all, it isn’t every day that he meets muscular, attractive rescue workers. Nathaniel manages to find out where Trey’s station is with the idea of saying thank you and offering him a puppy, but discovers that he and Trey have something else between them that needs exploring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trey, however, has responsibilities that could prove to make that exploration difficult. He has shift work to contend with. His seven year old daughter is a priority, plus he shares custody with his less than friendly ex-wife. Since Nathaniel is the new owner of one dog and six puppies, and doesn’t even have a place to live, he isn’t exactly in an ideal situation to explore a new relationship. Even if it is with a hot, handsome fireman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Trey and Nathaniel find some common ground amid the yapping of puppies and Trey’s complicated family life?</description>

  <description>Coleman Wilder is a half-breed werewolf. Some days the tension between his human side and his werewolf instincts threaten to tear him apart. But the challenge of running a horse farm as a gay man in a conservative Tennessee town keeps him focused until he meets horse shifter, Jonah Marks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah's family insists that shifting is sinful, but Jonah longs to let his stallion run free. Desperate to escape his family's judgment, he asks Cole, his secret crush, for a job. Cole turns him down, scared his desire for Jonah will make him lose control. When Jonah's brother threatens his life, Cole struggles to save him and give them both a second chance at the life they've always wanted.</description>

  <description>Sergei Stolkov is a faithful officer, though his deepest desires go against the Doctrine. A captain with the invading Coalition forces, he believes that self-sacrifice is the most heroic act and his own needs are only valid if they serve the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike, an operative planted within Cirokko's rebels, has been ordered to seduce Sergei and pry from him the Coalition's military secrets. His mission is a success, but as he captures Sergei's heart, Mike is tempted by his own charade and falls in love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the hostile natives of the planet Cirokko make their move, all seems lost. Can Mike and Sergei survive when the Coalition's internal affairs division takes an interest in what happened in the dusty mountains of Zasidka Pass...?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;96,000 words</description>

  <description>Born with a birth defect called Devil Syndrome, it is impossible for Josh Harper to hide the two small stumps of hornlike bone atop his head. If people also knew about his ability to create force fields with his mind, they’d lock him up for sure. Left to fend for himself on his eighteenth birthday, Josh tries to make it on the streets. When he’s attacked, he’s rescued by Sam Mitchell, who has an equally strange power—and a set of pure white wings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam ran away from home a year ago, and the new life he’s built for himself includes living in an abandoned house and looking after three younger kids, all with Devil Syndrome. Then along comes Josh. After a rough start their relationship grows and the two young men find a haven in each other’s arms. But when tragedy strikes their newfound family, Sam’s hatred of regular humans spirals out of control, and Josh will have to make Sam see sense before everything he’s worked so hard to build is destroyed.</description>

  <description>On Mariket, the strongest competitors win...by losing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Narone native and former heir of Class II shipbuilder Denbo-West Industries, Shane West surrendered his perilous birthright to compete in the Hunt and tried his luck with the lusty cats of Mariket. Shane’s mastery of survival craft in the untamed forest made him an early favorite among gamblers, fans, and arena officials. When he lured a cat into an arousing chase the first night, mating with Lore to become the season’s first victor seemed guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then news from Arena 4 slowed to a trickle. Rumors emerged about cats who’d gone feral as well as shocking breaches in security. Unconfirmed reports of assassins and rogue predators circulated before offworld communications screeched to a halt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this unprecedented glimpse inside the arena, Shane peels back the veil of secrecy. What does it take to tempt a sexy cat? How does being marked as prey by a feline lover feel? Experience the wanton pleasures of the heat with Shane and his mysterious mate—and discover which of last season’s scandalous rumors are true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run, pounce, fuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the Hunt.</description>

  <description>Robbie Cooper gets more than he bargains for when Shane Donald walks into his shop, photograph in hand, asking Robbie to tattoo the likeness on his skin. There’s something about the photograph and the way Shane talks about him that ignites a spark deep inside Robbie, and he longs to know more. But will he like what he hears, and will he be able to control his instant attraction to his client?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Infinite possibilities….&lt;br&gt;Infinite passion…..&lt;br&gt;Infinite danger….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His touch spirals through me, warm and sweet, wicked and hot. I shouldn’t trust him. I shouldn’t tell him my secrets. But how do I not when he is the reason I breathe? He is what I need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the young age of eighteen, tragedy and a dark secret force Lara to flee all she has known and loves to start a new life. Now years later, with a new identity as Amy, she’s finally dared to believe she is forgotten–even if she cannot forget. But just when she lets down her guard, the ghosts of her past are quick to punish her, forcing her back on the run.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a plane, struggling to face the devastation of losing everything again and starting over, Amy meets Liam Stone, a darkly entrancing recluse billionaire, who is also a brilliant, and famous, prodigy architect. A man who knows what he wants and goes after it. And what he wants is Amy. Refusing to take “no” as an answer, he sweeps her into a passionate affair, pushing her to her erotic limits. He wants to possess her. He makes her want to be possessed. Liam demands everything from her, accepting nothing less. But what if she is too devastated by tragedy to know when he wants more than she should give? And what if there is more to Liam than meets the eyes?</description>

  <description>Rudy is excited to be working for his old friend, the shy, bewildered, terminally handsome Wes, who's inherited a bunch of antiques and a mandate to turn a mansion overlooking the sea into a museum housing them. As an interior designer, Rudy is confident he can help. But he doesn't expect the trouble that comes from a possibly-cursed crown, a jealous Roman antiquities expert... or the possibility of falling in love.</description>

  <description>Will and John have a new life together, but unfortunately it seems as if their former lives are not completely behind them even now.  What was supposed to be a leisurely journey west turns into a fight for survival when they discover that an old enemy has taken over an innocent town, and that it’s going to need a hero to stop him – or perhaps even a whole group of heroes, willing to stand up and be counted.  It’s time for the real John Anderson, outlaw, to come out of retirement – but there’s still a price on his head, and now there’s a great deal more that he stands to lose…</description>

  <description>"The body you are wearing used to be mine." So begins the letter Myfanwy Thomas is holding when she awakes in a London park surrounded by bodies all wearing latex gloves. With no recollection of who she is, Myfanwy must follow the instructions her former self left behind to discover her identity and track down the agents who want to destroy her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She soon learns that she is a Rook, a high-ranking member of a secret organization called the Chequy that battles the many supernatural forces at work in Britain. She also discovers that she possesses a rare, potentially deadly supernatural ability of her own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her quest to uncover which member of the Chequy betrayed her and why, Myfanwy encounters a person with four bodies, an aristocratic woman who can enter her dreams, a secret training facility where children are transformed into deadly fighters, and a conspiracy more vast than she ever could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with characters both fascinating and fantastical, THE ROOK is a richly inventive, suspenseful, and often wry thriller that marks an ambitious debut from a promising young writer.</description>

  <description>**The Ghost and The Graveyard is a funny, exciting, and sexy read intended for adults. Due to sexual content, language, and violence this book is recommended for ages 18+** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grateful Knight isn't looking for love when she moves into a rent-free house on the edge of a graveyard. At twenty-two, all she wants is to recover financially so she can move back to the city where she belongs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But sparks fly when the gorgeous cemetery caretaker, Rick, introduces himself and mentions his suspicion that her new house might be haunted. Her attraction to him seems supernatural, and despite her resolve to not get involved, she literally can't keep her hands off him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When things in Grateful's house start moving on their own, another man enters her life, Logan, a sexy ghost with a dark secret. He says Rick isn't what he seems, and indulging her passion for him could cost her soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing's for sure, magical forces are at work in the tiny town of Red Grove, and they're converging on Grateful. Life will never be the same once she's forced to choose between the ghost and the graveyard.</description>

  <description>"Confronting the darkness of his past, he finds the light of his future. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years gadding about Europe, Everett Gerard can no longer avoid his responsibilities. Word has come that a child bearing the unmistakable Gerard stamp has shown up at the family estate-and he realizes it's time to face his demons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As his carriage nears the gates of home, he fights the urge to flee the memory of the horrible crime he witnessed as a child. Yet the Abbey delivers surprises and delights he never expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles Kenway was content with his quiet life as the Abbey's bailiff, until the wild child, clearly a bastard son of some Gerard, upends his peace with constant pranks and mischief. And when the master of the house arrives, an unsettling attraction heats Miles's blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they clash over the fate of the ancestral land, they battle a powerful desire to grapple in ways that could disrupt the delicate balance between master and servant. But when the boy's real sire appears, they must unite as only true fathers can to protect the boy whose mischievous charm has captured their hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Gothic murder, hot man loving, and emotional family drama</description>

  <description>Book one in the Thomas Elkin series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; Even the strongest of buildings start out as plans on paper, and every architect knows that sometimes plans need to change. Sometimes, these lessons are learned on the job. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A successful New York architect, Thomas Elkin almost has it all.  Coming out as gay and ending his marriage before his fortieth birthday, he needed to start living his life. Now, four years later, with his relationship with his son back on track, and after a few short-lived romances, this esteemed traditional draftsman thought he knew everything about architecture, about life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cooper Jones, twenty-two years old, is about to take the architect world by storm. Talented, professional, driven, and completely infuriating, Cooper is the definition of Generation Y.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting an internship working with Thomas, Cooper is about to knock Tom’s world off its axis. Tom can teach Cooper about the industry, but Cooper is about to teach Tom a few things about life.</description>

  <description>Trans-Global IT director Connor Witt is a rare and prized anomaly: the aggression centers in his brain have been suppressed rather than stimulated by the mutated crops that so recently took over the world’s food supply. Bewildered by his physical changes and terrified of a world growing more and more predatory, Connor risks harassment and worse until Trans-Global CEO David Martin collars Connor to protect him against men like security consultant Emmett Drake. Men who stalk Connor as sweet, sexy prey. Men to whom the newly submissive Connor feels irresistibly drawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But David can’t be Connor’s master; David’s straight. He promises to find a worthy man, though. One willing to court and appreciate Connor as more than just some rich man’s toy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the world adapts to the biological disaster and new laws strip away Connor’s rights, David’s resolve to protect his boy slowly grows into something more. But can his new desires keep pace with Emmett’s determination to claim Connor? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One man offers safety; the other is a safer bet. Problem is, Connor’s never sure which is which. The one thing he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; know? He wants them both.</description>

  <description>Brad “Frat Boy” Feller and Sebastian “Toppy” DeWitt have been together for nine months, and their relationship is as hot as ever. The only cloud Brad sees on their horizon is Sebastian’s stress over his thesis. And their uncertain future together after graduation. And how Sebastian sometimes takes Brad for granted. And Sebastian’s unwillingness to introduce Brad to his father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that, everything’s awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of Sebastian’s energy is currently devoted to his thesis, and getting into a top-notch PhD program. Fortunately, his boyfriend takes care of all the domestic stuff and Sebastian’s needs. Any minor strain between them will disappear and they’ll return to the status quo after Sebastian graduates. As long as nothing upsets their delicate balance in the meantime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a friend Brad once had a small fling with is forced to take refuge with them, and Frat Boy and Toppy’s delicate balance topples like an elephant on a waterski. Now Sebastian has to face some truths about how he’s been treating Brad, what he wants for their future, and what he has to do to get it.</description>

The day before he is to attend his girlfriend’s sister’s wedding, he makes an appearance at his BDSM club and runs into Kayla, a bubbly Little Girl who captures his undivided attention. Look but don’t touch, Nicholas tells himself. What he doesn’t know is that Kayla’s in town to go to her cousin’s wedding…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Word count: about 15 000</description>

  <description>Ian and Cal have known each other since they were kids. When Cal offers to let Ian move in with him, Ian doesn't even let the fact that Cal is gay factor in. It's supposed to be a joke when Ian brings home a fish bowl with no fish, but when Cal buys fish and comes into Ian's room to check on them, Ian starts seeing more of Cal than he'd counted on, and liking what he sees. There's really only one logical way for Ian to sort out his feelings for Cal. Buy more fish. Soon, he's a regular hobbyist with an excuse to get Cal in his bedroom several times a day. He has no idea what to do once they're there. Throw in Marcy- the adorable pet store geek who keeps him plied with bait- a bad chili dog, a game of strip Go Fish, and a raging case of food poisoning, and Ian's about to lose his gay virginity the way only he could... ass backward.</description>

  <description>Devlin Morgan and Gradyn Connell have one thing on their minds when they meet in a bar one Friday night in San Francisco. One good, hard fuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the hell he’s been through, Gradyn knows the young man sitting at the end of the bar--with his sweet nervousness and beautiful face--is just what he needs. And Gradyn has absolutely no problem getting up to say hello.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devlin knows inviting muscle-bound, tattooed Gradyn to his motel room is the riskiest thing he’s ever done, but there’s something in the man’s warm green eyes that tells Devlin everything will be all right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One explosive encounter in Devlin’s motel room is the plan. Only, it turns out one hot fuck isn’t enough for either man. Dinner afterward leads to another round in bed, and what follows is a weekend together that stirs more emotions than either Devlin or Gradyn ever expected to feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward five years. Devlin has never forgotten Gradyn but he has moved on with his life. That is, until he walks into his sister’s workplace and comes face to face with the man from his wild weekend in San Francisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except, this man is calling himself Garrick Langley. This man is a shell of the man Devlin remembers and hardly looks like the same person. And the biggest kick in Devlin’s gut? This Garrick Langley pretends he doesn’t know Devlin at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No. Fucking. Way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devlin doesn’t care what this man looks like or that he has a new name. Garrick Langley is Gradyn Connell, and they both know it. Devlin is a lot more secure in his own skin now, and he wants answers. This Garrick had better look out because Devlin won’t stop until he uncovers every one of Gradyn’s secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This title contains male/male acts of loving, including oral, anal and rimming. Also includes scene with mild bondage and spanking.</description>

  <description>When Laurie, son of a wealthy London baronet, takes a homeless young man off the bitter winter streets, he only means to shelter him. But Sasha is beautiful and passionate, and he knows what he wants. Soon the two are entangled in a wild and illicit romance. Sasha, an illegal alien, has dangerous connections and a violent underworld past that won’t let him go. Privileged Laurie has problems of his own -- a brutal father who holds the keys to Laurie’s golden cage and would rather kill him than accept his son and heir is gay, let alone in love with a street urchin. Laurie’s only hope is to run. In a Romani encampment with Sasha, he finds not only a safe haven but sexual fulfilment beyond his wildest dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their new happiness is fragile. Sasha’s secrets run too deep, and he vanishes, leaving Laurie desolate, as much an exile in his own city as Sasha has been. Now Laurie must grow up and find his own strength. Can he break free of his suffocating aristocratic world in time to save his lover and himself?</description>

  <description>Evan loves his work on International Space Colony 2, but he misses the colors of his life on Earth. Drawing the flowers he remembers from his mother's greenhouse provides a pale substitute for authentic living color, but it's the best he can find. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean spends his days lost in his software while listening to the same songs on the same radio stations day after day. He would give almost anything to hear the mistakes of a live performance, but a space colony is hardly an ideal place to find an amateur musician.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance meeting shows Evan a glimpse of real color and Sean a taste of real music, but neither expects to see the other again. Then Evan's greatest accomplishment fails, endangering the entire colony, and Sean becomes his last chance at fixing it.  </description>

  <description>Two men. One wants to kill the dragon. One wants to capture it. Both have secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    When men from the northern town of Brock come to Adencass, sharing tales of a dragon, Ian MacGree thinks it’s a ploy to get out of sending their share of support. His father, Chieftain Goth, sends Ian to discover the truth. Never does he think the stories of a dragon terrorizing the area would be true until he runs into Roark, who claims to be a dragon hunter. Ian’s attraction to Roark is almost instantaneous, but as the second son of the chieftain, romance has no place in his life, for his father plans to wed him to another to seal an alliance. But he’s not the only one with secrets. When he discovers Roark’s, will their secrets bring them together or drive them apart?</description>

  <description>Ten years ago, August's adolescent brother was brutally murdered, and dumped in Blood Pond. The one person he is sure can identify the killer is on the run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruce can't escape the horror of what he experienced the night his friend, Tommy, was slaughtered in front of his eyes. Although he survived, he is still on the run, running from shadows that he can't see. The last thing he wants is to come face to face with his greatest nightmare, face to face with the older brother of his dead boyhood crush.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The person chasing Bruce is a face he once admired in a photograph, a man desperately seeking closure to his brother's murder. August has given up everything to find Bruce because he is sure that Bruce is the key to helping him find what he seeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can Bruce help August find the killer, or will the answer be buried forever at the bottom of Blood Pond?</description>

  <description>Genre: BDSM, LGBT Historical&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Nathaniel Travers has been visiting Madame Delacroix's brothel for five years. On every visit, he requests the same man. Stunningly handsome and highly skilled, Jasper not only shares Nate's fondness for wickedly erotic games and black leather corsets, but he's become a friend. Someone he can talk to. Someone he can share a supper with. And Jasper's the only person who knows Nate secretly harbors a love for his old childhood friend, Peter Edmonton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jasper Reed has been working at the house for a decade. He's saved enough to retire, yet he remains at the decadent London brothel. Retiring would mean leaving Nate and the hope perhaps someday the rugged gentleman would stop pining for his best friend and realize he loves Jasper, just as Jasper loves him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes Edmonton's marriage for Jasper to see he's been just as blind as Nate. Stubbornly hoping for something that cannot be. Convinced a gentleman like Nate can never be more than his client, Jasper retires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in the country may be lonely, but with no one to please but himself, it's calm and peaceful...until Nate shows up on his doorstep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM theme and elements, male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>A story of love, a story of hope. How can you move forward when you're anchored to the past?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to tattooed bad boys, Chase Gartner was the real deal. Partying, engaging in meaningless sex, getting into fights---Chase indulged in it all during his late teen years, thus firmly solidifying his status as a heartbreakingly gorgeous but way-too-dangerous-to-trust guy in his hometown of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Then, following one fateful night of reckless decisions, Chase's actions finally caught up to him and landed him in prison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, four years have passed and Chase finds himself a free man. He returns to Harmony Creek, ready to pick up the pieces and start rebuilding his shattered life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things are off to a promising start when he meets Kay Stanton, a young woman with a tragic past of her own. Despite a powerful attraction, Chase and Kay are naturally hesitant to become involved. That's why friendship feels like the safest option. But when passions ignite and love blossoms, a relationship that is destined and meant to be can only be resisted for so long. When Chase and Kay finally succumb to their feelings they realize being together feels more right and true than anything they have ever experienced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their love is soon tested. Chase's wild past still haunts and tempts him, and Kay is keeping a secret that could tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I Stand Before You is a journey of hope and forgiveness, coming to terms with the past and moving forward. But mostly it's a story of two damaged people who take a chance, open their hearts, and find true love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult/Contemporary Romance genres. First in a series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;***warning: contains explicit sexual situations, drug use, some violence, and profanity***&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>He scared me. He thrilled me. And after one touch, all I could think about was getting more…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Makayla never thought she’d set foot in an underground mixed-martial arts club. But if anyone needs a medic on hand, it’s these guys. Trouble is, at her first sight of the club’s owner she’s the one feeling breathless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All sleek muscle and restrained power, the man they call Torment plays to win at any cost.

  <description>Ethan Conner and Jamie McHale have moved to Chicago so that Jamie can take over as King of the vampires of the city. But things are not going how they had planned. Ethan feels neglected as the new king is too busy trying to hold onto control of the city to spend enough time with his mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ethan is called home by his father to watch over his old kingdom in his parent’s absence, he is almost relieved to be leaving. The men try to work out a long distance relationship but the strain is just as hard on them as it had been before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile Jamie is fighting to assert his power over a group of vampires who remain loyal only to the former monarchy. He believes that his advisors are plotting behind his back and worries that he isn’t strong enough to hold things together on his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The men need each other more than ever, but without the bond that originally brought them together, their stubbornness and aggression feels too strong to overcome again. Both are left to wonder if they are ever going to make things work or if they have been fighting a losing battle from the very beginning.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Can Jamie and Ethan overcome their hatred for each other before the vampire marriage they are cursed into kills them both?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie McHale has always hated vampire prince Ethan Connor, and Ethan loathes him right back. One dark and stormy night the two men tangle in a violent altercation that leaves them somehow bound together in vampire marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It becomes very clear that the magic of the marriage bond will get what it wants for them, regardless of the men's feelings toward the situation. The curse wants them together, and as they spend time with each other they start to wonder if this really was a curse at all.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;  bestselling author David Levithan tells the based-on-true-events story of Harry and Craig, two 17-year-olds who are about to take part in a 32-hour marathon of kissing to set a new Guinness World Record—all of which is narrated by a Greek Chorus of the generation of gay men lost to AIDS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the two increasingly dehydrated and sleep-deprived boys are locking lips, they become a focal point in the lives of other teen boys dealing with languishing long-term relationships, coming out, navigating gender identity, and falling deeper into the digital rabbit hole of gay hookup sites—all while the kissing former couple tries to figure out their own feelings for each other.</description>

  <description>It's been several generations since a genetic experiment gone wrong caused the Reduction, decimating humanity and giving rise to a Luddite nobility who outlawed most technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elliot North has always known her place in this world. Four years ago Elliot refused to run away with her childhood sweetheart, the servant Kai, choosing duty to her family's estate over love. Since then the world has changed: a new class of Post-Reductionists is jumpstarting the wheel of progress, and Elliot's estate is foundering, forcing her to rent land to the mysterious Cloud Fleet, a group of shipbuilders that includes renowned explorer Captain Malakai Wentforth--an almost unrecognizable Kai. And while Elliot wonders if this could be their second chance, Kai seems determined to show Elliot exactly what she gave up when she let him go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Elliot soon discovers her old friend carries a secret--one that could change their society . . . or bring it to its knees. And again, she's faced with a choice: cling to what she's been raised to believe, or cast her lot with the only boy she's ever loved, even if she's lost him forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by Jane Austen's &lt;em&gt;Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;For Darkness Shows the Stars&lt;/em&gt; is a breathtaking romance about opening your mind to the future and your heart to the one person you know can break it.</description>

  <description>Can a mere mortal Viking tame the daughter of a goddess?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Scotland’s King Kenneth orders his death and kidnaps his sister, the Viking Brökk—the Malice Striker—plans his vengeance: he’ll steal the king’s bastard daughter from Sumbarten Abbey and use her to buy his sister freedom. But his schemes go awry when his liege lord commands him to wed Skatha—and when he finds five women instead of one at the Abbey, none will claim the King as father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Viking abducts Skatha and her women, she’s bewildered. Why did Brökk seize her? Why does he want her for his wife? She weds him willingly enough when he threatens to kill her companions, but she vows to control her own destiny and escape. For if the Viking discovers her secrets, the laws of his people will force him to cast her aside…or kill her. And even Skatha, daughter of a goddess, might not escape the Viking’s wrath…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;For an alpha male wolf shifter promised to a female whose goal is to one day be queen, coming out has never been more explosive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evin KinKaid, the only son of the KinKaid pack's alpha, has a secret. One that will tear his family apart. In one year, Evin is to succeed his father as alpha leader and continue the dominant bloodline of his family. There's only one problem: Evin is gay. When Evin is pushed into the bed of his intended female mate, he's forced to reveal the truth. And for an alpha male wolf shifter promised to a female whose goal is to one day be queen, coming out has never been more explosive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Mason Thorne II, heir to Thorne Global Inc., life is a lie. To sustain his father's love, Mason has agreed to stay in the family business and to one day assume his place as CEO. Instead of reaching for his heart's desire, he's settled for a life he never wanted. But an unexpected auto accident will send Evin and Mason into each other's arms and down a path toward a destiny neither man can escape: an eternity sealed in blood.</description>

  <description>Two young people are forced to make a stand in this thought-provoking look at racism and prejudice in an alternate society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sephy is a Cross -- a member of the dark-skinned ruling class. Callum is a Nought -- a “colourless” member of the underclass who were once slaves to the Crosses. The two have been friends since early childhood, but that’s as far as it can go. In their world, Noughts and Crosses simply don’t mix. Against a background of prejudice and distrust, intensely highlighted by violent terrorist activity, a romance builds between Sephy and Callum -- a romance that is to lead both of them into terrible danger. Can they possibly find a way to be together?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this gripping, stimulating and totally absorbing novel, black and white are right and wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This edition also includes 'An Eye for an Eye' which is a short novella written for 2003 World Book Day.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Teague’s in the game for redemption, and Jack’s in the game for Teague. Can they both get what they need at Green’s Hill?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack and Teague are human ‘hunters’, who have been recruited to work as liaisons between the preternatural world of Green’s Hill and the ignorant humans that surround it. Teague's in the game for redemption – and Jack’s in the game for Teague.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teague Sullivan is damaged and haunted – and about the loneliest man Jack has ever met. But Jack sees beyond his scars and his gruffness to kind and valiant man underneath. Unfortunately, Teague sees beneath Jack’s overtures to the naive, green idealist, and although Teague loves him, he makes it clear that a scarred old dog like himself will never be good enough for a sweet young pup like Jacky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the argument’s raging, Jack is injured in the line of duty and the two hunters are abruptly sucked into the paranormal world that they’ve been defending.  Teague is forced to reevaluate everything he’s believed about the two of them. He may be old and damaged, but that doesn’t mean he can let his Jacky go somewhere without him, does it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Be aware that future books in this series contain m/m/f menage.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Gordon Frost is a survivor. He survived a war that ravaged the nation, and he made it through the orphanages and crime-ridden slums that followed. With few prospects for the future, Gordon carved out a niche for himself in the expanding drug trade of Lexington, PA. It’s not pretty, but it's his, and it beats what he was doing before. But a classic case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time results in a brush with death, going by the name of Adam. Afterward, the life that seemed good enough before, isn't quite the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam Blake is an assassin on the brink of being terminated by the very organization that controls him. He completed his mission, but not without being seen. With his secrets in danger of being exposed by Gordon, Adam knows he should kill the smart-mouthed redhead, but finds himself intrigued by the troublesome civilian instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gordon’s knack for finding trouble combines with the dangerous consequences of Adam’s indecision, their worlds intertwine in an explosive way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;word count: 85,000&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

He walks and grooms dogs for a living, tries to keep up with the sprawling old house his grandparents left him, manages a boyfriend, and tries like heck to hide his crush on the town's fire chief. Pretty ordinary, right? But Endi's always hoped for better than "ordinary." One day, he meets a mysterious new friend and his canine clients start sprouting wings and spewing fire. Can the motley collection of pooches really be dragons?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally published in the Another Fine Mess Anthology.</description>

  <description>Garrett Kross is finally living his life long dream of opening a gym in his hometown of Tampa, Florida along with his high school friends, Mateo Carrasco, and Brandon Bliss. Between training clients and workouts, Garrett hopes to find time for some extracurricular activities of his own which hopefully include a hot shower with an even hotter guy.&lt;br&gt;He does just that with Kip Hayes, a blond hair, blue-eyed construction worker with broad shoulders, a tight, lean waist, and plenty of emotional baggage, namely his son, Noah. The last thing Garrett needs is taking on more responsibility. But why is he entertaining the idea of a relationship with a man that is flat broke, has a less than accommodating ex and a child under the age of three? And on top of everything else, his best friends and co-owners of PUMP are falling in love, threatening to make a mess of a very good thing.&lt;br&gt;When Garrett had dreamed of owning a gym, for some reason his dream was just a little bit different than the reality. But sometimes life’s happily ever after includes more than just your own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A PUMP [#1] Novella. The beginning to a very sexy series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book of Male/Male Erotic Romance is intended for mature audiences due to strong language and sexual content.</description>

  <description>Marcus is a 30-year-old successful architect. He wants someone to love and knows the right man will turn up when he least expects it. That moment arrives at his friend’s party. He sees Danny for only a moment, yet his interest is piqued. What could be more irresistible than a blue-eyed beauty who is completely untouched?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danny knows he doesn’t find women attractive, but how is he going to find out if he’s gay? His sister’s party answers his prayers and the most gorgeous guy he has ever seen asks him out. But can their love survive when Marcus wants more than a closeted partner and Danny wants nothing more than to hide forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://steamereads.com.au/product/hearts-truth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://steamereads.com.au/product/hea...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>I've been a vampire hunter all my life. Usually, the job's pretty straightforward: find a vamp and kill it, while staying alive in the process. But things have been getting weird lately. The vamps have started hunting in packs, which is almost unheard of. And they’re up to something at an old warehouse down by the Port of Long Beach. Then there’s the daywalking vamp that I came across. None of that should be happening, and I need answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I usually work alone. But with all the strange stuff that's been going on, I’ve begun teaming up with fellow hunter Lee Halstrom, a hot Texan that occasionally makes me forget what a bad idea it is to mix business and pleasure. And then there’s Bane. For years the mysterious vampire has been circling me, but never going in for the kill. All of a sudden, he’s putting himself right in the middle of my business. I need to find out what game he's playing…either that, or I could just end him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is the first novella in The Tinder Chronicles. In his hunting ground of Long Beach, California, Tinder crosses paths with Nikolai and Nathaniel, characters introduced in Alexa Land’s best-selling paranormal romance Feral (though this book is not a sequel). This m/m paranormal erotic novella is approximately 25K words in length, and is intended for adults only.***</description>

  <description>Martin Powers wanted an ironing board for Christmas. Instead, he got . . . Matthew Kieler, a non-returnable gift, but a gift that kept on giving. Chance encounters are sometimes the ones that most change our lives. He sold Matt a tie, but got more in the bargain - more than most people would want and more than anyone deserved. Although these lovers may not have had the pink American dream, they had it better than most, even as they faced a crisis that would change us all.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look Away Silence&lt;/em&gt; is a romance set in the time of AIDS, when ignorance could spell trouble and often did. It encompasses the author's experiences in volunteer community service and personal friendships during a tragic period in American history. The novel is dedicated to the Hyacinth AIDS Foundation, the NAMES Project and to the author's own fallen angels. "Mothers, do not shun your children, because you never know how long you have to revel in them."</description>

  <description>Jamie is an accountant who lives by a strict schedule. Every day is planned; the future is predictable. And that schedule includes one night a week when he allows himself to blow off steam at a gay dance club in the City. One Friday night he gets more than he bargained for when he meets Matt, an out of work stranger with long dark hair and rough hands. The attraction is undeniable but Matt does not fit Jamie’s idea of the perfect man to share his carefully ordered life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, Jamie longs for a date with his dream man: handsome, sophisticated Keith, a successful Vice President at his prestigious New York accounting firm, a man on his way up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But everything changes when Jamie discovers a suspicious error in one of his accounts. Suddenly, he finds himself on the run from both the mob and the FBI -- and the only man who can help him is the tall, dark-haired stranger he rejected. Because Matt is not who he seems -- and neither is Keith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words: 65,000&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>From the deep swamps of the Everglades to the glittering night clubs of South Beach, Miami-Dade police detective Scott Chandler is hot on the trail of the drug running cartel that killed some good officers in a firefight and left him with a steel rod in his leg. The last thing he expected to find was love in the form of a seemingly innocent wilderness guide--a guide who inexplicably knows more than he should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah Taylor lives for the wild backwoods, spending days camping alone and only returning to town on the weekends to lead kayak tours through the dark waterways of the Everglades. But when he finds the remains of a ritually sacrificed body hanging from the twisted limbs of a mangrove tree, his life's going to change in ways he can't possibly predict--or can he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Scott must untangle a web of deceit while struggling with his passion for Noah. Because loving him is easy. But trusting him could be deadly.</description>

  <description>Christmas vacation 1984 is far from festive at the house of eighteen year-old Alejo Sandoval. His parents teeter on the verge of divorce. His final semester of high school looms ahead. He has just found out that his trickster cousin Martin has vanished, leaving no traces behind. And he keeps a secret that could destroy his place within his religious Hispanic world—he and his best friend Bobby Gallegos are lovers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Independent and exasperating, Bobby is the love of his life. There is no one Alejo would rather have at his side when his mother and aunt send him on a road trip to unravel his cousin’s mysterious disappearance. But what starts as an excuse to get out of Albuquerque and enjoy a romantic road trip soon takes on serious overtones. Martin might have endangered his life by coming out as gay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their short fact-finding mission turns into a quest for Martin’s whereabouts through the secretive small towns of New Mexico. Stress and speculation have set Alejo’s eccentric relatives against each other, and Alejo and Bobby are about to walk into the crossfire in an adventure (at 90K words) set on a different timeline from the events in Fall Into the Sun.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Great Kitchen Flood begins one man's journey to find confidence and love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avery Storey has bought a house in a conscious effort to be more independent. Right before he moves in, the kitchen pipes malfunction. Lucky for him, one of his new neighbors is the same man Avery has begun to warm up to through his teller job. Gratefully, AJ comes to the rescue, because that's what neighbors do. A little romance blooms between the two men. Unfortunately, AJ blows his chance when he learns Avery is thirteen years his junior. Hurting for the sweet man across the street, he's forced to face what his life would be like without Avery at all, because being neighbors alone just would not be enough.</description>

  <description>Sometimes the only way for justice to prevail is to get a little Wicked...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who call him know the deal. He'll solve their problems, but he'll do it his way. That's the only way Wick Templeton plays the game. His years on the force and connections to all types of specialists put him in a league of his own. That's how he intends to keep it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An ex-boyfriend in need puts Wick on a path that crosses that of Ned Harris, a stranger who proves to be a worthy adversary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wick's simple agenda gets a little more complicated. Item one: Clear his ex's name. Item two: unmask the enigma that is Ned Harris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a good agenda. Too bad Wick can't seem to stick to it.</description>

  <description>WHEN introverted doctor Ben Hardy's high maintenance girlfriend wants to introduce a little more kink into their love life, he doesn't expect it to come in the form of the hunky EMT who just moved to Blackwood. Ben's not gay, but DAMN! He can definitely see why all the women turn to mush when the new guy's around. Baby blue eyes, flirtatious smile, body of an underwear model...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prospect of being naked in the same room with him is horrifying. So why the hell is Ben actually considering it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COREY Butler desperately needs to leave his shady past behind, and the microscopic town of Blackwood is just the place to do it. No drama, no danger, no sleeping under bridges... What he doesn't need is a huge crush on someone who's completely out of his league. When Dr. Hardy's gorgeous girlfriend propositions him for a threesome, he knows the smart thing would be to say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course it would. But then Corey's never been known for making smart decisions.</description>

  <description>Qhuinn, son of no one, is used to being on his own. Disavowed from his bloodline, shunned by the aristocracy, he has finally found an identity as one of the most brutal fighters in the war against the Lessening Society. But his life is not complete. Even as the prospect of having a family of his own seems to be within reach, he is empty on the inside, his heart given to another....  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blay, after years of unrequited love, has moved on from his feelings for Qhuinn. And it’s about time: The male has found his perfect match in a Chosen female, and they are going to have a young—just as Qhuinn has always wanted for himself. It’s hard to see the new couple together, but building your life around a pipe dream is just a heartbreak waiting to happen. As he’s learned firsthand.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fate seems to have taken these vampire soldiers in different directions... but as the battle over the race’s throne intensifies, and new players on the scene in Caldwell create mortal danger for the Brotherhood, Qhuinn finally learns the true definition of courage, and two hearts who are meant to be together... finally become one.</description>

  <description>William Lyon's past forced him to become someone he isn't. Conflicted and unable to maintain the charade, he separates from his wife and takes a job as caretaker at a former mental hospital. Jelley’s Valley State Insane Asylum was the largest mental hospital in California for well over a century, but it now stands empty. William thinks the decrepit institution is the perfect place to finish his dissertation and wait for his divorce to become final. In town, William meets Colby Anderson, who minds the local store and post office. Unlike William, Colby is cute, upbeat, and flamboyantly out. Although initially put off by Colby’s mannerisms, William comes to value their new friendship, and even accepts Colby's offer to ease him into the world of gay sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William’s self-image begins to change when he discovers a tin box, hidden in an asylum wall since the 1940s. It contains letters secretly written by Bill, a patient who was sent to the asylum for being homosexual. The letters hit close to home, and William comes to care about Bill and his fate. With Colby’s help, he hopes the words written seventy years ago will give him courage to be his true self.</description>

  <description>The snow hasn’t even attempted to thaw when Ian’s life is turned upside down. His only sister is murdered, leaving him as the sole family to his 14 year-old niece. As an uncle, he’d been there for them, but he is clueless when it comes to actually seeing to Terra’s wellbeing. Muddling through, they become closer, healing together through the trauma, and slowly begin to feel like family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ian has a deep secret though. Not even Terra’s mother knew, and when Caleb is the officer to deliver a freezing and terrified niece to his door, that secret is in jeopardy of being blown sky-high.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Survivor Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From her perch on a shelf above my bed, the doll accuses me with lifeless eyes of failing Juliette in the most heinous way imaginable, forcing me to crave the bite of his whip and the steel in his voice to drown out the ache in my chest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For his entire life, Benjamin Martin’s parents drilled into his head that he must watch out for his little sister, but one horrific night, he failed. Now, the bite of a whip, cuffs digging into his wrists, his arms and legs stretched beyond endurance, these things give him what he needs to forget his sister’s violent death, at least for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ben’s latest Dom casts him aside like a broken toy, he manipulates his best friend, Jude Archer, into picking up the pieces. Jude has been in love with Ben for years, but his fantasies about his friend never included whipping him. He doesn't understand why Ben needs BDSM and he worries about Ben’s addiction. Most of all, he fears losing his humanity because he’s already lost himself in Ben. When he’s forced to trade the marks upon his soul for the pain that ravages Ben, Jude learns the real definition of submission.</description>

  <description>When Aubrey returns home after many years away, he is welcomed back with the extravagant gift of a Pet he never wanted and secrets he never dreamed existed...    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many years ago, the race of creatures once known as 'vampires' agreed to surrender their freedom, rather than face eventual annihilation.  They exist now as Pets to the lords and ladies of high society, forced to serve forever the human whose blood they first drink.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detesting the practice, Aubrey has always avoided taking a Pet for himself. But upon his return home from school, he is gifted with a Pet by his father. His Pet, however, is like none he's ever known, and only the start of an old and complicated tangle of secrets.</description>

  <description>"As long as no one asks and they don't tell."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First class petty officer Eric Randall is less than thrilled about taking orders to Okinawa. Three long, lonely years on a crappy island that's thousands of miles from his daughter? Oh. Yeah. Sign him up. But as long as he's stuck here, he might as well make the best of it, so he discreetly checks out the local gay scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane nearly drops his drink when the gorgeous, cocky-looking guy strolls into Palace Habu. He buys him a drink, and before long, they're making out in a booth. Eric is a straight-to-the-point kind of guy and doesn't want to play games. Since Eric's idea of not playing games is getting the hell out of there and going back to one of their apartments, Shane is more than happy to go along with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as a scorching-hot one-night stand leaves both of them wanting more until Eric finds out Shane doesn't just outrank him, he's an officer. DADT may be repealed, but an officer getting involved with an enlisted man falls under conduct unbecoming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, they can't resist their mutual desire. There's no reason anyone has to find out. But secrets have a way of outing themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains two military boys who keep forgetting they're not supposed to be together. Probably because they never have their uniforms on for any length of time.</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aaron Downing is broken, barely clinging to the hope that one day, he will be normal again. His life remains a constant string of nightmares, flashbacks, and fear, but he perseveres and starts college, determined to move on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Aaron gets assigned to work with Spencer Thomas for his programming project. Aaron doesn’t want Spencer to think he’s a freak, but as he gets to know his new deaf friend, he figures out he doesn’t need to be “normal.” If he could just learn to control his fear, that could be enough to find his footing again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so Aaron thinks until his parents begin talking about institutionalizing him to give his brothers a more stable life. He searches desperately to find a way to cope or even to fake normalcy. But his new shrink’s instability makes conquering his demons that much more difficult, and his attraction to Spencer threatens to send Aaron spinning out of control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adapted as a YA edition of the novel Aaron by J.P. Barnaby. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;100% of the author's royalties are being donated to help homeless LGBT kids find safe shelter.</description>

  <description>From the author of the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life — and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>Leander Mayfield is the only surviving son of a poor farmer... or so he believes until the day he learns he is in fact the new Earl of Dearborn. Still recovering from a lingering illness, the sensitive young man travels to Great Britain to claim his estate and embarks upon a bewildering new life. Julien Sutcliffe, the Earl of Blackstone, is suffering from ennui. He's tired and bored with all the finery and wealth and wonders about him. Then he meets this refreshingly naive American Earl, newly arrived in England, and suddenly the world comes alive around him again. Irresistibly drawn to one another, Julien finds himself besotted, and Leander is equally smitten. But just when they think they may have finally found happiness together, Julien and Leander discover that something--or someone--is determined to separate them permanently.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Meeting the family shouldn’t be this complicated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the designated slacker of the family, Peter Stevens was accustomed to being eclipsed by his “perfect” older brother, Mark. But when Mark came out to their parents one Christmas vacation, it was his turn to be the black sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more surreal was Peter’s brief encounter with his brother’s boyfriend, Colin. The unmistakable sparks between them shook the foundations of his confirmed heterosexuality. Years later, when they meet again as graduate student and professor, that bone-deep attraction is still there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to the emotional scars Mark left behind, Colin has had his fill of Stevens men. Having Peter at his university shouldn’t be a problem though, as he knows the younger man is straight. But when Colin realizes the electricity sizzles both ways, he can’t resist indulging in a passionate affair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet some old flames stubbornly refuse to die. This time, Peter refuses to step aside—and when an emergency brings the family together again, Colin must decide if it’s worth the risk to trust another Stevens brother with his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This book contains an adorable professor who gets invited home for a very complicated holiday, a perfect relationship with “Mr. Right”, and a dangerous crush on “Mr. Wrong”.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It is the dawn of a new age... The Industrial Revolution has begun, factories are springing up across the country, and new technologies are transforming in the cities. But the old ways do not die easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I was not a bard or a djeli or an historian or a scribe and I was certainly not a sage, but that didn't mean I wasn't curious…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young Cat Barahal thinks she understands the world she lives in and her place in it, but in fact she is merely poised, unaware, on the brink of shattering events. Drawn into a labyrinth of politics involving blood, betrayal and old feuds, she will be forced to make an unexpected and perilous journey in order to discover the truth, not just about her own family but about an ancient secret lying at the heart of her world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cat and her cousin Bee are part of this revolution. Young women at college, learning of the science that will shape their future and ignorant of the magics that rule their families. But all of that will change when the Cold Mages come for Cat. New dangers lurk around every corner and hidden threats menace her every move. If blood can't be trusted, who can you trust?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From one of the genre's finest writers comes a bold new epic fantasy in which science and magic are locked in a deadly struggle.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; A short story, approx. 12.5K words. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heartbroken, Dean Cartwright leaves Sydney and heads home, to the coastal town of Newcastle.  In a bid to make new friends, he signs up for a local rugby league team where he meets a man known as Macca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dean and Macca are both front row forwards, meaning they’re the biggest guys on the team. Over six feet tall and over a hundred kilos each, they’re a force to be reckoned with on the field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Dean gets knocked out, Macca gets even by punching the other guy, and both Dean and Macca end up on the sideline.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dean soon realizes that being knocked unconscious is the best thing to ever happen to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; Story is set in Australia, and uses Australian English &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty-two-year-old barman Nathan is always the odd one out. It's tough to get a date when his love of loud music, tattoos, and zombie paraphernalia usually sends potential candidates running for the hills. Trying to find anyone who wants to spend time with him, let alone stay in and watch trashy horror movies, has always been a problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, on his day off, Nathan does a friend a favor by covering a shift at a pub, and in walks a handsome stranger who shares his love of horror. It could be a match made in B-movie heaven, and Nathan is determined to pursue this new acquaintance, but—zombies aside—has Nathan got the guts to go on a real date?</description>

  <description>A mistake made long ago…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pain buried so deep…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bailey Trent returns home to her small little Ozark mountain town after being away for nearly six years, she knows she’ll face the ghosts of her past. It does not mean she’s prepared to come face to face with the cruelest of those memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darren Cory’s life is a shell of what it once was, and when he’s forced to endure the cause of his agony, hatred abounds quickly. But hating Bailey destroys him too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Darren find a way to move past the pain and forgive the woman he once cared so much for before his anger consumes them both? Or will he drag them into the hell of an unforgiven past.</description>

  <description>Promises spin-off&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zach Mitchell is stuck in a rut. His college boyfriend left him ten years ago, but Zach still lives in the same apartment, drives the same car, and feeds his ex-boyfriend’s ungrateful cat. His Denver business, A to Z Video Rental, is struggling. He has annoying customers, eccentric neighbors, and an unfulfilling romance with his landlord, Tom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A combat boot-wearing punk with an attitude, Angelo Green was raised in foster homes and has been on his own since he was sixteen; he has never learned to trust or to love. He doesn’t do relationships, so when Angelo takes a job at A to Z Video, he decides Zach is strictly off-limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite their differences, Zach and Angelo quickly become friends, and when Zach’s break-up with Tom puts his business on the line, it’s Angelo who comes up with a solution. Together with Jared and Matt, their friends from Coda, Colorado, Zach and Angelo will find a way to save A to Z, but will they be able to save each other too?</description>

  <description>Caleb Jansen’s old life is in ruins after being possessed by the vampire spirit Gray. Now all Caleb wants is for Gray to be exorcised so he can adjust to living as a registered paranormal. Instead, District Chief Kaniyar of SPECTR offers him a new choice: be locked away for public safety, or come work for the very agency he’s spent years trying to avoid. The only good thing to come from Caleb’s possession is his relationship with federal exorcist John Starkweather, but even that seems doomed to end before it can really begin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John’s newest case is a nightmare: someone is summoning demons and forcing them to possess women and boys snatched from the streets of Charleston. If his team can’t find the summoner soon enough, the possessions will become permanent, transforming the victims into ghouls. To make matters worse, he barely prevents Gray from feeding on their only lead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can John shield his heart from Caleb, who only seems interested in a temporary hook-up? Can Caleb keep Gray under control while they hunt for the summoner? Or will the cost of solving the case be higher than any of them could have guessed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the master of ghouls has set his sights on a new target: Gray.</description>

  <description>It’s July 3, 1976, the beginning of America’s bicentennial weekend, and everyone seems to be celebrating their freedoms except eighteen-year-old runaway Michael Ryder. Fresh from rural Pennsylvania, Michael is doing whatever and whoever it takes to get to San Francisco, where he hopes to find a new life with the freedom to love without fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While hitchhiking, a mysterious, tattooed biker named Snake offers him a ride west—on the back of his customized Harley chopper. During their journey across Route 66, Snake introduces Michael to new and steamy pleasures, leaving Michael aching for more than just a physical relationship. But a violent encounter with a cruel biker gang and a harrowing secret from Snake’s military past might destroy their unlikely relationship long before they reach the end of the road.</description>

  <description>Given his line of work in the employ of a psychotic Brooklyn crime boss, Trent finds himself on the wrong end of too many bullets. Yet each time he’s killed, he wakes a few minutes later completely healed of his wounds but with no memory of his past identity. What’s worse, each time he cheats death someone else dies in his place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent to steal an antique box from some squatters in an abandoned warehouse near the West Side Highway, Trent soon finds himself stumbling into an age-old struggle between the forces of good and evil, revealing a secret world where dangerous magic turns people into inhuman monstrosities, where impossible creatures hide in plain sight, and where the line between the living and the dead is never quite clear. And when the mysterious box is opened, he discovers he has only twenty-four hours to save New York City from certain destruction.</description>

  <description>Andy Jessop wants a life without ghosts. He doesn’t want to see, hear, or talk to them. Ignoring them should be relatively simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Andy soon finds that Benji Richards, an eternally gorgeous ghost from the fifties, is not so easy to ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Halloween night is approaching and both Andy and Benji know what it could mean for them. From sunset to sunrise, it is the one night of the year when a mortal can feel the touch of a ghost.</description>

  <description>Luke Schumaker designs computer games, working from his home. Every day he walks his dog in the woods nearby, never suspecting that someone who is completely smitten is watching. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The watcher is Alex Shaw, and he too works from home, designing logic and crossword puzzles. Alex’s options are limited: he’s too shy to approach Luke and his wheelchair won’t let him follow into the woods. His solution? Secret messages for Luke in the crosswords he writes for the local paper. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Luke decodes them, romance begins, but then they face greater puzzles, like Alex’s interfering sister and what commitment to a man in a wheelchair really takes. And, most puzzling of all, how do you know if love is real?</description>

  <description>Up and coming football hero, Colton Michaels, makes a Hail Mary pass one night in the college locker room that results in the hottest, sexiest five days of his young life. However, interference after the play has him hiding his past and burying his future in the bottom of a bottle. While Colt seems to have it all, looks can be deceiving, especially when you’re trapped so far in a closet that you can’t see your way out. When ten years of living his expected fast-lane lifestyle lands him engaged to his manipulative Russian supermodel girlfriend, he decides it’s time to call a new play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Montgomery single-handily built the largest all-star cheerleading gym in the world, driven by a need to forget a life-altering encounter with a handsome quarterback a decade ago. His reputation as an excellent coach, hard-nosed business man, and savvy entrepreneur earned him respect in the sometimes catty world of competitive cheerleading. When Jace learns of his ex-lover’s plans to marry, his heart executes a barrel roll and his carefully-placed resolve tumbles down without a mat to absorb the shock. Can his island escape help him to finally let go of the past and move his life forward?</description>

  <description>Reylan is everything a Sydney vampire aspires to be: wealthy, handsome and independent, carefully feeding off companions plucked from the gay bars of Oxford Street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one of those companions is killed by Jorgas, a hot-headed young werewolf prowling his streets, Reylan reluctantly puts his cherished lifestyle of blood and boys on hold to help a mysterious alliance of supernatural beings track down the beast. It can’t be that hard... not when Jorgas keeps coming after him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there’s more to this werewolf than a body count and a bad attitude. As their relationship grows deeper and more twisted, Reylan tastes Jorgas’ blood, reawakening desires the vampire had thought long dead. And what evolves between them may be far more dangerous than some rival predator in the dark...</description>

  <description>Nate Tippie and Brandon Wilde are gay, single, and both hoping to meet that special man, even though fate has not yet delivered him to their doorstep. Nate's sister, Hannah, and her kooky best friend, Marilyn, are about to help fate with that task by creating a profile on the gay dating site, OpenHeartOpenMind. The two women are only exploring, but when they need a face and body for the persona they create, they use Nate as the model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Brandon comes across the false profile, he falls for the guy he sees online. Keeping up the charade, Hannah begins corresponding with him, posing as Nate. Real complications begin when Brandon wants to meet Nate, but Nate doesn’t even know he’s being used in the online dating ruse. Hannah and Marilyn concoct another story and send Nate out to let the guy down gently. But when Nate and Brandon meet, the two men feel an instant and powerful pull toward each other. Cupid seems to have shot his bow, but how do Nate and Brandon climb out from under a mountain of deceit without letting go of their chance at love?</description>

  <description>Let the games begin... Former Los Angeles Police officer Steve Miller has gone from walking a beat in the City of Angels to joining the rat race as an advertising executive. He knows how cut-throat the industry can be, so when his boss tells him that he's in direct competition with a newcomer from across the pond for a coveted account he's not surprised...then he meets Mark Richfield. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth and fashion-model good looks, Mark is used to getting what he wants. About to be married, Mark has just nailed the job of his dreams. If the determined Brit could just steal the firm's biggest account right out from under Steve Miller, his life would be perfect. When their boss sends them together to the New Mexican desert for a team-building retreat the tension between the two dynamic men escalates until in the heat of the moment their uncontrollable passion leads them to a sexual experience that neither can forget. Will Mark deny his feelings and follow through with marriage to a women he no longer wants, or will he realize in time that in the game of love, sometimes you have to let go and lose yourself in order to really win.</description>

  <description>It’s 1919, and Frank Huddleston has survived the battlefields of the Great War. A serious head injury has left him with amnesia so profound he must re-learn his name every morning from a note posted on the privy door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gerald “Jersey" Rohn, joined the Army because he wanted to feel like a man, but he returned from the trenches minus a leg and with no goal for his life. He’s plagued by the nightmare of his best friend’s death and has nervous fits, but refuses to associate those things with battle fatigue. He can't work his father's farm, so he takes a job supervising Frank, who is working his grandparents’ farm despite his head injury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Frank recovers enough to ask about his past, he discovers his grandparents know almost nothing about him, and they’re lying about what they do know. The men set out to discover Frank's past and get Jersey a prosthesis. They soon begin to care for each other, but they'll need to trust their hearts and put their pasts to rest if they are to turn attraction into a loving future.</description>

  <description>Deacon Miller never had it all—he never really believed he could. Growing up in a broken home with an alcoholic mother and a revolving door of truly pathetic father figures taught him to keep his expectations low. Now at twenty-seven, on the night before Christmas Eve, his life is turned upside down yet again; his boyfriend has dumped him, he just fled the holiday family reunion from hell, and now to top it all off, a blizzard has left him stranded in an airport hotel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Steele has spent the better part of his forty-four years living a lie, ignoring his attraction to other men in an attempt to fit into the mold of the man he thought he should be, instead of living life as the man he knew himself to be. Recently divorced after coming home from work one day and coming out to his wife, Steve has floundered over the past year, desperately attempting to wade through the guilt and find the courage to start again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s when a chance meeting in a hotel bar brings two lonely men together… and what should’ve been a one night stand turns into something much more than either one ever expected.</description>

  <description>Tanner Wallis is nearly at the end of his rope the night Mason Seidel finds him lying next to the mangled body of a cow on the back pastures of the Seidel family's Wyoming ranch. Recently out of the hospital after he and his boyfriend were brutally beaten, Tanner is jobless, homeless, and almost penniless. His desperate hope is that Mason will believe he’s innocent of the senseless crime and give him a place to heal, both physically and emotionally, until he can get on his feet again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Mason already has enough on his plate. He's only been back on the ranch a few months, ten years after his father kicked him out for being gay, and only because his sister begged him to come help after the man's disabling stroke. With all his responsibilities—running the struggling ranch and keeping his sister and father off his back—Mason can't really afford the distraction Tanner represents. But he can't just abandon the attractive young man either. There’s trouble in spades on the ranch, but if they face it together, Mason and Tanner might find a future with a little sunshine.</description>

  <description>Bryce is the adorable young thing that Dustin knows he shouldn’t want. He should be looking for a man his own age. Someone with a future. Someone with a real job. But no matter how hard he tries, no matter how much he knows that it just won’t work, he can’t resist those big blue eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dusty is an adult. So unlike any of the party crowd that Bryce hangs around. But after just a brief taste of Dusty’s so-called boring, normal life, Bryce is more surprised than anyone to find out that that’s the life he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No wonder they just Can’t Fight This Feeling.</description>

  <description>Grace Hamilton was the girl with a plan. She knew exactly where her life was going and prided herself on always achieving her goals. It was who she was, and how she lived her life. She never stepped outside the lines, and never considered what she might desire and whom she was actually trying so hard to please. Until him…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carson Stinger was a man who didn't play by any rules except his own. Working in the adult entertainment industry, he didn't care what others thought, and took each day as it came, no direction, no plan. He knew what women wanted from him and believed it was all he had to offer. Until her… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When circumstances forced them to spend several hours together, they walked away changed. But for two people who never should have meshed, overcoming the reality of their vastly different lives wasn't possible. At least not yet…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS IS A STAND-ALONE NOVEL. The first two books in the series need not be read to enjoy this book. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This novella is a companion novel to the Hopeless series, but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance encounter in the dark leads eighteen-year-old Daniel and the girl who stumbles across him to profess their love for each other. But this love comes with conditions: they agree it will only last one hour and it will only be make-believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their hour is up and the girl rushes off like Cinderella, Daniel tries to convince himself that what happened between them only seemed perfect because they were pretending it was perfect. Moments like that with girls like her don’t happen outside of fairytales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year and one bad relationship later, his disbelief in insta-love is stripped away the day he meets Six: a girl with a strange name and an even stranger personality. Daniel soon realizes the way he pretended to feel about Cinderella and the way he really feels about Six may not be so different after all. Especially when the two loves of his life end up being one in the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for Daniel, finding Cinderella doesn’t guarantee their happily ever after…it only further threatens it.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old twins, Andrew and Andrea Morris, have always been close. They share everything—from their friends to a room—and they both enjoy star positions on their high school’s soccer teams. All’s right with the twins...or is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When new student Ryder Coltrane moves from Texas to their small New York town, he spins Andrew’s world upside down. All of Andrew’s past relationship troubles begin to make sense and his true feelings start to click into place after Ryder comes out to him. His friendship with Ryder turns secretively romantic, but secrets, they soon find out, are hard to keep. Once rumors start to fly, so-called friends turn on them, and the boys’ relationship turns into a bomb about to explode. But Andrew never expected it would be his own twin, Andrea, holding a lighter to ignite it.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Rodney Mansfield is tiny, flamboyant and, oh yeah, a black belt in karate. He is also one of southern California’s greatest artists. Too bad the work of art he really wants is firefighter, Hunter Fallon. But the gorgeous “straight gay” guy could never want the Runtback of Notre Dame, so when Rodney’s handsome, surfer friend, Jerry, develops an unexpected passion for the beautiful firefighter, Rodney breaks his own heart by helping Jerry land his man. And then Rod makes it worse by embarrassing Hunter when he protects him from a firehouse bully. Hunter hates gay guys like Rodney – doesn’t he? Then why can’t he get the powerful pipsqueak’s face out of his mind… and cock out of his ass? And why does he risk his job and his life to rescue Rod from a burning building? Isn’t it time for him to admit he’s not an alpha male after all and that he is the property of the artist?</description>

  <description>Adam Bates is in trouble. He's virtually penniless, is being threatened by his landlord, and now he's late for work at his new job. Expecting to be chastened by his boss, Adam doesn't expect Cody to provide him with a protector instead. He definitely doesn't expect his minder to be a big, bad wolf with attitude.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Black has just arrived at Del Fantasma after his latest black ops mission. He's ready for some R and R, but Marcus won't refuse Cody when he asks him to help a little tabby cat. When Adam is threatened by his landlord in front of Marcus, his alpha wolf won't let him stand by and let it happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam is about to find strength in submission, and his own set of claws. Marcus is about to find the mate he's been searching for in a deceptively small tabby. Now, if only they can hold on long enough to survive.</description>

  <description>Inspired by actual events; Broken is a unapologetic step into the psyche of a serial killer. From the outside Randy was always one of the lucky ones. Smart, athletic, successful and handsome, the middle son of the town's most prominent family. But deep inside, the truth lay buried in torment shared with his little brother. Horrific abuses from the one person they trusted most to keep them safe have unleashed a sadistic predator of epic proportions. As he moves closer to the object of his rage the only person who can stop him is the one who shares his secret. A single moment drenched in blood will change history, one way or the other.</description>

  <description>Recluse Andrew Eccleston wants revenge on the man who destroyed his face twenty years ago, Winnie Wexford--a vindictive state senator not above a smear campaign against Andrew. Andrew's grateful for the help of his erstwhile brother-in-law, David, until the help turns up in the form of PR guru Levi Beaumont, Andrew's every fantasy come to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Levi is beautiful, smart, and righteous. When his mentor, David asks him to take on a difficult client for the PR firm, Levi agrees, in spite of a very real risk to his career working with non-profits to get them the attention they deserve. He knows facing off against a powerful politician could destroy his career, but he agrees out of loyalty to his mentor. Andrew and Levi are thrown into tense proximity as they work to protect Andrew and expose Wexford. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Andrew opens his tightly-guarded private life to Levi, hostility turns to respect, respect to passion, and the stakes go much deeper than career or reputation</description>

  <description>Academic librarian Jamie Brodie hasn't seen old boyfriend Dan Christensen in years. When Jamie reads Dan's obituary in the paper, he's surprised. When he receives a letter from Dan, written just before his death, Jamie is shocked. Dan's letter suggests that Dan was in danger, lists two article citations from medical journals, and asks Jamie to look into the citations. When Jamie requests the articles, strange things begin to happen. His computer is hacked, his tires are slashed, he thinks someone might be following him - and he uncovers two more deaths. The coroner's report says that Dan died of natural causes - but did he? Is there something suspicious about the articles, or was Dan just paranoid? The closer Jamie gets to answering those questions, the more it seems that someone is trying to stop him...</description>

  <description>All hell breaks loose when Dean Smith, Earl of Carwick, is tricked into being discovered in the company of Rob, a handsome male prostitute. Now Dean needs to repair his broken engagement to a wealthy heiress…and Rob is the only one who can identify the man who set him up, proving to Dean's fiancée that things weren't as they appeared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trip from Worcester to Bath turns into a journey of self-discovery, as Dean finds himself becoming increasingly attracted to Rob. His charming companion stirs feelings Dean has long kept repressed, but acting on them would make true the accusations that destroyed his engagement. Torn between duty and desire, Dean's destiny lies in the hands of a &lt;em&gt;Discreet Young Gentleman&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Life used to be pretty simple for Dr. Van Jacobs, until a dead guy rolled into his emergency room and didn't have the courtesy to stay dead. From there, things get a little out of control when Van finds himself being recruited by a government agency that's spent the last 100 years protecting something very important, and very strange under the water just off the coast of San Diego. They need Van's help, but as time goes on and -- runs out -- it becomes clear to Van that they wanted him for far more than his medical expertise. Between the spacetime breaks and the wingnut cult ... and Ben ... Van is barely hanging on. Not that he was hanging on much before, just kind of existing. But now, he's got a reason to exist - a purpose - just when it looks like all of existence might not be existing much longer.</description>

  <description>Thrown out on the street by his homophobic stepfather, Dylan struggles to get his life together. Years of being used and abused have left him tough and determined to make it on his own. When he sees a dog getting beaten, his protective instincts drive him to rescue her. But as the attackers turn on Dylan, out of the shadows comes a hero. One with mysterious eyes and a shy sensuality Dylan can’t resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cam Coburn can’t reveal his true identity to the man he rescues. Nor can he reveal that he’s a freak among freaks, a cockatrice shifter with an unwanted gift for seeking out conflict rather than treasure. Newly independent from his mentor, Cam sees in Dylan his first chance to test the limits of his human guise. Defying every rule, Cam succumbs to Dylan’s seduction for just one night. But Cam finds he can’t let his lover go, and Dylan breaks down every barrier. For he is the one human who can gaze in a cockatrice’s eyes without fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet even as their bond deepens, danger closes in on them from all sides, and Cam’s dark secrets may save them—or lead to their destruction.</description>

  <description>Old hatreds die hard. Old love dies harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Meli Galdes' home planet, the struggle for power is a bloody, full-contact sport--in business and on the battlefield. For years her lethal skills have been a valuable asset in advancing her family's interests. She's more than earned her right to retire, but her kinsmen have one last favor to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kill the man who ruined her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celino Carvanna's razor-sharp business acumen--and skills with a blade--won him the freedom to do as he pleases. There's only one thing he can't seem to control--his reaction to the mysterious woman who tantalizes his senses. Her eyes alone set his blood simmering, stirring ridiculous adolescent fantasies about breasts and honey. With a few words she dissects his soul. Who is she? And how does she slide so easily under his well-guarded skin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's almost too easy to draw Celino within the kill zone. Meli plans to revel in him. Drink him in. Wring every drop of pleasure out of every moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when she's sure he belongs to her, she will finally repay a decade's worth of pain--in a single, brutal dose of reality.</description>

  <description>In her first trial by fire, Cordelia Naismith captained a throwaway ship of the Betan Expeditionary Force on a mission to destroy an enemy armada. Discovering deception within deception, treachery within treachery, she was forced into a separate peace with her chief opponent, Lord Aral Vorkosigan - he who was called "The Butcher of Komarr" - and would consequently become an outcast on her own planet and the Lady Vorkosigan on his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sick of combat and betrayal, she was ready to settle down to a quiet life, interrupted only by the occasional ceremonial appearances required of the Lady Vorkosigan. But when the Emperor died, Aral became guardian of the infant heir to the imperial throne of Barrayar - and the target of high-tech assassins in a dynastic civil war that was reminscent of Earth's Middle Ages, but fought with up-to-the-minute biowar technology. Neither Aral nor Cordelia guessed the part that their cell-damaged unborn would play in Barrayari's bloody legacy.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author tempts success in this stunning debut novel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National bestselling author Eileen Wilks draws readers into a bold new world where the magical and mundane co-exist in an uneasy alliance—and a cop balanced on her own knife-edged struggle is their only hope against a cold-blooded killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily Yu is a San Diego police detective investigating a series of grisly murders that appear to be the work of a werewolf. To hunt down the killer, she must infiltrate the clans. Only one man can help her--a were named Rule Turner, a prince of the lupi, whose charismatic presence disturbs Lily. Rule has his own reasons for helping the investigation--reasons he doesn't want to share with Lily. Logic and honor demand she keep her distance, but the attraction between them is immediate and devastating-and beyond human reason. Now, in a race to fend off evil, Lily finds herself in uncharted territory, tested as never before, and at her back a man who she's not sure she can trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Willkommen in einer Welt, in der Magie Teil des täglichen Lebens ist. Eine Welt, in der es geschieht, dass Katzen Geheimnisse ausplaudern. Eine Welt, in der dunkle Mächte nach der Herrschaft greifen und ein außergewöhnliches Mädchen die einzige Rettung bedeutet ...&lt;br&gt;Nichts ist mehr, wie es war, als die fünfzehnjährige Wynter nach ihrer Lehrzeit im Norden nach Hause zurückkehrt. Ein dunkler Bann scheint über dem Königreich zu liegen: Alte Bekannte weichen Wynter aus, und auch die sonst so redseligen Katzen weigern sich, mit ihr zu sprechen. Vor allem aber ist einer ihrer besten Freunde spurlos verschwunden: Kronprinz Albernon. Was ist mit ihm geschehen? Warum hat König Jonathon eine Schreckensherrschaft errichtet? Und was hat es mit den Gerüchten um eine neue, furchterregende Waffe auf sich? Wynter sieht sich vor eine schicksalhafte Wahl gestellt: Soll sie sich dem Willen des Königs beugen oder sich von ihm und ihrer Familie lossagen und das Geheimnis lüften?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;By all accounts, Sirantha Jax should have burned out years ago…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the carrier of a rare gene, Jax has the ability to jump ships through grimspace—a talent which cuts into her life expectancy, but makes her a highly prized navigator for the Corp. But then the ship she’s navigating crash-lands, and she’s accused of killing everyone on board. It’s hard for Jax to defend herself: she has no memory of the crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now imprisoned and the subject of a ruthless interrogation, Jax is on the verge of madness. Then a mysterious man breaks into her cell, offering her freedom—for a price. March needs Jax to help his small band of rogue fighters break the Corp monopoly on interstellar travel—and establish a new breed of jumper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jax is only good at one thing—grimspace—and it will eventually kill her. So she may as well have some fun in the meantime…</description>

  <description>Ambrose Young was beautiful.  He was tall and muscular, with hair that touched his shoulders and eyes that burned right through you. The kind of beautiful that graced the covers of romance novels, and Fern Taylor would know.  She'd been reading them since she was thirteen.  But maybe because he was so beautiful he was never someone Fern thought she could have...until he wasn't beautiful anymore.&lt;br&gt;	Making Faces is the story of a small town where five young men go off to war, and only one comes back.  It is the story of loss.  Collective loss, individual loss, loss of beauty, loss of life, loss of identity.  It is the tale of one girl's love for a broken boy, and a wounded warrior's love for an unremarkable girl.  This is a story of friendship that overcomes heartache, heroism that defies the common definitions, and a modern tale of Beauty and the Beast, where we discover that there is a little beauty and a little beast in all of us.</description>

  <description>Former gladiator Saevius is certain fortune’s smiling on him when a Pompeiian politician buys him to be his bodyguard. But then his new master, Laurea Calvus, orders Saevius to discover the gladiator with whom his wife is having an affair. In order to do that, Saevius must return to the arena, training alongside the very men on whom he’s spying. Worse, he’s now under the command of Drusus, a notoriously cruel—and yet strangely intriguing—lanista.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Saevius’s ruse is the least of his worries. There’s more to the affair than a wife humiliating her prominent husband, and now Saevius is part of a dangerous game between dangerous men. He isn’t the only gladiator out to expose the Lady Verina’s transgressions, and her husband wants more than just the guilty man’s name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Saevius learns the truth about the affair, he’s left with no choice but to betray one of his masters: one he’s come to fear, one he’s come to respect, and both of whom could have him killed without repercussion. For the first time in his life, the most dangerous place for this gladiator isn’t the arena.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title is part of the Warriors of Rome collection.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Book One in the A Wizard's Touch series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes it takes a little magic to find true love…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaynell Marley’s father’s dying wish was to send his son to the Wizard Academy. It only took Jay a short time to realise he didn’t belong. His abilities, far more advanced than the other students, could only cause jealousy. Knowing how to speak gnome and summon a dragon put him beyond everyone’s skills but the teachers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Thomas Sparks—a member of the local wolf pack who isn’t impressed with Jay’s magic. He wants the man himself. One look into Jay’s eyes and Thomas knows he’s found his life mate. The only problem—convincing the powerful wizard that they were meant to be together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When outside forces threaten to tear them apart, it will take their combined skills to defeat the evil wizard trying to steal their future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book was previously released at another publisher. It has been revised and re-edited for release by Total-E-Bound.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It was her last chance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amber Bierce had nothing left except her sister and two tickets on Earth’s first colony-ship. She entered her Sleeper with a five-year contract and the promise of a better life, but awakened in wreckage on an unknown world. For the survivors, there is no rescue, no way home and no hope until they are found by Meoraq—a holy warrior more deadly than any hungering beast on this hostile new world…but whose eyes show a different sort of hunger when he looks at her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was his last year of freedom:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uyane Meoraq is a Sword of Sheul, God’s own instrument of judgment, victor of hundreds of trials, with a conqueror’s rights over all men. Or at least he was until his father’s death. Now, without divine intervention, he will be forced to assume stewardship over House Uyane and lose the life he has always known. At the legendary temple of Xi’Matezh, Meoraq hopes to find the deliverance he seeks, but the humans he encounters on his pilgrimage may prove too great a test even for him…especially the one called Amber, behind whose monstrous appearance burns a woman’s heart unlike any he has ever known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From R. Lee Smith, author of Heat and Cottonwood, comes an epic new story of desire, darkness and the dawn that comes after The Last Hour of Gann.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: This book contains graphic violence, strong sexual content and explicit language. It is intended for mature readers only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: 432,285&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>A decade in the future, humanity thrives in the absence of sickness and disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We owe our good health to a humble parasite - a genetically engineered tapeworm developed by the pioneering SymboGen Corporation. When implanted, the tapeworm protects us from illness, boosts our immune system - even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost every human being has a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives...and will do anything to get them.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Poe is about to learn death and time are fragile barriers—if he has the strength of will to let go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poe passes through a graffiti-laden alley, his chin tucked into his chest, a scarf wrapped tightly over his mouth to keep out the cold. He has nowhere to go since Isaac’s death, but something compels him out in the frigid Chicago winter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He steps out of the alley, off the curb, and…into sand. In summertime. Isaac told him it would happen but Poe doesn’t care how it’s possible, only that now he has a chance to make everything right</description>

  <description>Cash Fraser is planning revenge and to get it he needs the perfect woman. So he hires her. Abigail Butler has lost nearly everything in her life and she’s about to lose the home she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cash meets Abby, who is posing as a paid escort, and the minute he does he knows he’s willing to pay for more than Abby being his pretend girlfriend. A lot more. Abby needs the money or the last thing that links her to her dead family and husband will be gone. The deal is struck but both Cash and Abby get more than they bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cash realises very quickly that Abby isn’t what she seems and while he changes strategies, Abby discovers that Cash’s legacy, Penmort Castle, is like all the tales say – very, very haunted. Making matters worse, the ghost in residence wants her dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby’s found herself in the battle of her life so she enlists Mrs. Truman, her nosy neighbour; Jenny, her no-nonsense friend; Cassandra McNabb, white witch and clairvoyant with a penchant for wearing scarves (and lots of them); and Angus McPherson, dyed-in-the-wool Scot (which means he hunts ghosts in a kilt) to fight the vicious ghost who has vowed that she will rest at nothing to kill the true, abiding love of the master of Penmort.</description>

  <description>Alex’s life as a teenager in South Central L.A. is far from perfect, but it’s his life, and he knows how to live it. He knows what role to play and what things to keep to himself. He’s got it all under control, until one lousy pair of shoes kicks him out of his world and lands him in a foster care group home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surrounded by strangers and trapped in a life where he could never belong, Alex turns to the only person lower on the social ladder than he is: a “special” mute boy. In Sebastian, Alex finds a safe place to store his secrets—those that sent him to foster care, and the deeper one that sets him apart from the other teenagers he knows. But Sebastian has secrets of his own, and when tragedy rips the two boys apart, Alex will stop at nothing to find the answers—even if it means dragging them both through a past full of wounds best left buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It might just be worth it, for the slim chance at love.</description>

But when a brave beauty unwittingly breaks the enchantment, he is drawn into a strange new world…and an all-consuming desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sensible Morgan doesn’t believe in magic—until a mysterious being saves her from a fate worse than death, and life as she knows it changes forever. Now the man of her dreams has become flesh and blood, igniting a spark in Morgan’s soul which science cannot explain. But even a love that transcends time may not be strong enough to withstand the power of an ancient curse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the best-selling author of Changeling Moon, this stirring novel of passion and magic launches an addictive new series for fans of paranormal romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Fadeout&lt;/em&gt; is the first of Joseph Hansen's twelve classic mysteries featuring rugged Dave Brandstetter, an insurance investigator who is contentedly gay. When entertainer Fox Olson's car plunges off a bridge in a storm, a death claim is filed, but where is Olson's body? As Brandstetter questions family, fans, and detractors, he grows certain Olson is still alive and that Dave must find him before the would-be killer does. Suspenseful and wry, shrewd and deeply felt, Fadeout remains as fresh today as when it startled readers more than thirty years ago.</description>

  <description>After a near fatal car crash leaves him scarred both physically and emotionally, Matt Harmon finds the solitude of his huge, lonely house too much to bear. Hiring nurse James Hayden to look after him seems like the best idea for Matt, whose fierce independence has been compromised by his injuries. The two men clash from the start as James struggles to help Matt rebuild his shattered body and heal his crushed soul. The bond they form is forged in fire and ice, and the wounds they inflict on one another can only be erased by Matt's admission that he can't live without James's loving touch. Will Matt realize too late that James is the only one who can rescue him from himself?</description>

  <description>Being in the wrong place at the wrong time is not always a bad thing…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah Anderson is odd and he knows it. He has a strong obsessive compulsive disorder that keeps him organized but distances him from the world around him. He doesn't have any friends, family, or even a lover. He's never had a lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he finds himself in the wrong place at the right time, Noah discovers that the dangers posed by having sex for the first time pale in comparison to having sex with the assassin that comes to kill him, even if it means his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gage Tynan is a killer. It's what he's always been. And he excelled at his job until he jumped into the car of a passing motorist when his latest mission goes wrong. The man driving is so odd that Gage suspects he might have been sent to harm him. Gage has no idea that the little man that asks him to take his cat will change his life in ways he has no clue of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gage is dragged into a world of shifters and exiled kings, one where his strength will be called upon to keep Noah safe from the pride soldiers sent to keep him from taking the throne.</description>

  <description>What happens when you get everything you've worked for, only to discover it's not what you really want?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan O'Leary worked night and day to finish law school, join a top firm and make partner, all before the age of 35. He's found a man who swept him off his feet. And his best friend of twenty years has his back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one awful day it all comes crashing down around his ears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making a fresh start, Dan meets the people of Blue Ridge, Georgia, including Chief of Police Nick Oliver, and, perhaps, finds a new home. But danger from his old life follows him and puts not only his life, but that of his new friends, at risk.</description>

  <description>Jarvis Clark was stunned when he was verbally abused in the elevator at work and lewdly propositioned. Jarvis is young and handsome - the PA to the boss - a man with influence and power. His accoster might be butch and ruggedly good looking, but he is part of the rank and file - how dare he make such a move!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jarvis is left shocked, yet over the following weeks he continues to take the elevator late after work, knowing the man is likely to be there, and knowing the foul abuse he is going to receive. His life changes as questions are raised, put there in his mind by a verbal abuser - a nemesis come to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inevitably, the elevator takes this handsome young sophisticated man from the glamour of the top floor, all the way to the basement where the sex is rough and dirty – where he is used and abused by an uncouth lout he comes to crave. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why did he allow it? Only Mr. Clark can tell you that for sure. Perhaps the man saw in Jarvis something he didn't know was there himself, and having lit the fuse, he had to explode. Whatever - this is his story of how he was used and abused and knew the perverted joys of humiliation and debasement!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This book contains explicit gay m/m content and is suitable for readers 18 and above.</description>

  <description>Torn between two worlds.&lt;br&gt;Torn between two lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McKenzie Lewis’s ability to read the shadows has put her—and …those she loves—in harm’s way again and again. The violence must end, but will the cost of peace be more devastating than anyone ever imagined?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ten years of turmoil, the life McKenzie has always longed for may finally be within her grasp. No one is swinging a sword at her head or asking her to track the fae, and she finally has a regular—albeit boring—job. But when a ruthless enemy strikes against her friends, McKenzie abandons her attempt at normalcy and rushes back to the Realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the fae she loves and the fae she’s tied to pulling her in different directions, McKenzie must uncover the truth behind the war and accept the painful sacrifices that must be made to end it. Armed with dangerous secrets and with powerful allies at her side, her actions will either rip the Realm apart—or save it.</description>

  <description>She's an Agent of Death who really needs to get a life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an Agent of Death, Madeline Black is responsible for escorting the souls of the dearly departed to the afterlife. It's a 24/7 job with a lousy benefits package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maddy's position may come with magical powers and an impressive wingspan, but it doesn't pay the bills. And then there are her infuriating boss, tenant woes, and a cranky, popcorn-loving gargoyle to contend with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things start looking up, though, when tall, dark, and handsome Gabriel Angeloscuro agrees to rent the empty apartment in Maddy's building. It's probably just a coincidence that as soon as he moves in demons appear on the front lawn. But when an unholy monster is unleashed upon the streets of Chicago, Maddy discovers powers she never knew she possessed. Powers linked to a family legacy of tarnished halos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powers that place her directly between the light of Heaven and the fires of Hell..</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land. She finds starting new is not easy while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. She can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her--or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

  <description>Rase Illion is a middle-aged captain of industry, a restrained man with a spotless reputation just emerging from the shadow of his vicious, driven father. Since his father's death, Rase has been living like the old man was still alive, keeping up appearances with his trophy wife and appropriately luxurious house. Which is when Rase meets Gabriel. Gabriel loses his temper during his first meeting with Rase and lashes out, which unleashes Rase's carefully hidden submissive and masochistic tendencies. His encounter with Gabriel snaps Rase out of his sleepwalking life, and he sets about remaking his world in his own way. Rase isn't the only one shaken by their encounter, though. Can he convince Gabriel to give their relationship a chance?</description>

  <description>Detective Fynn Adder is embarking on the case that will change his life forever. The ghosts of murder victims are leaving him clues, his drinking problem is out of control, and no matter how nepotistic the Chicago Police Department might be, there are some forces his family’s reputation can’t save him from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a few years ago, Fynn’s longtime partner Robert was murdered and the case went unsolved. As he gets deeper into a new investigation, it becomes apparent that somehow the two cases are connected. To make matters worse, it’s clear to Fynn that forces beyond this world have come into play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forces like Internal Affairs agent Daniel Voight, who’s determined to make dirt stick to Fynn any which way he can. The only real bright points in Fynn’s day are when he’s with Jack, his unfortunately straight partner. Fynn is going to have to pull himself together--because if the dead don’t kill him, his family will.</description>

  <description>Meet Ethan...he's a self proclaimed slut hitchhiking across country from New York on his way to San Francisco. He stops in a small town in New Mexico and gets a job at a tavern called Honky Tonk without really wanting it. The owner of the tavern is a hulking man named Hunter Westmore and Ethan does everything he can to get the man's attention and once he does his dirtiest dreams come true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter is a cowboy and owns a ranch as well as the tavern. When he meets the city kid who came into the tavern he didn't know what hit him. He'd never felt the way Ethan made him feel and he tried to ignore the younger man but no one could ignore Ethan. Once he finally gives in they start a discovery of what makes them both tick, and what they both love is when Hunter takes a strong hand to Ethan and gives him his collar. Can their darkly seductive love last or will their kinks tear them apart?</description>

  <description>Teagan Wylltson’s best friend, Abby, dreams that horrifying creatures—goblins, shape-shifters, and beings of unearthly beauty but terrible cruelty—are hunting Teagan. Abby is always coming up with crazy stuff, though, so Teagan isn’t worried. Her life isn’t in danger. In fact, it’s perfect. She’s on track for a college scholarship. She has a great job. She’s focused on school, work, and her future. No boys, no heartaches, no problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Finn Mac Cumhaill arrives. Finn’s a bit on the unearthly beautiful side himself. He has a killer accent and a knee-weakening smile. And either he’s crazy or he’s been haunting Abby’s dreams, because he’s talking about goblins, too... and about being The Mac Cumhaill, born to fight all goblin-kind. Finn knows a thing or two about fighting. Which is a very good thing, because this time, Abby’s right. The goblins are coming.</description>

  <description>After barely surviving a shootout in New Orleans, Sidewinder medic Kelly Abbott has to suffer through a month of recovery before he can return home to Colorado. He’s not surprised when fellow Sidewinder Nick O’Flaherty stays with him in New Orleans. Nor is he surprised when Nick travels home with him to help him get back on his feet—after all, years on the same Marine Force Recon team bonded the men in ways that only bleeding for a brother can. He’s very surprised, though, when Nick humors his moment of curiosity and kisses him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick knows all of Kelly’s quirks and caprices, so the kiss was a low-risk move on his part . . . or so he thought. But what should’ve been a simple moment unleashes a flood of confusing emotions and urges that neither man is prepared to address.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Kelly and Nick must figure out what they mean to each other—friends and brothers in arms, or something even deeper?—before the past can come back to ruin their tenuous future.</description>

  <description>Punishing himself for a horrific past that is not his fault, bestselling author Alexander Montgomery seeks redemption and love—and perhaps he will find it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Famous author though he may be, Alexander Montgomery is not someone you take home to meet Mother. Seriously flawed, damaged by a horrific past, he’s trying hard to claw his way back to normality. But how can anyone respect what he truly is? His therapy involves regular sessions at Study in Scarlet, an exclusive S&amp;amp;M club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then comes Sage. Tall, with black hair and blue eyes, an up-and-coming actor with impossible charm and boy-next-door good looks, he’s the perfect choice to play the leading man in a TV adaptation of Alex’s last best-seller. Even more, he is a man you introduce to your family. Which Alex would do—if he weren’t taken by another man who offers the punishments Alex prays will wipe away the past and make him the person he wants to be. Yet, perhaps there is another path to redemption. If only the solution would reach out and touch him.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A romance series about four ex-soldiers who run a renegade operation against an organized crime ring out of the back of a tattoo shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tall, dark, and lethal...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble just walked into Nicholas Rixey's tattoo parlor. Becca Merritt is warm, sexy, wholesome — pure temptation to a very jaded Nick. He's left his military life behind to become co-owner of Hard Ink Tattoo, but Becca is his ex-commander's daughter. Loyalty won't let him turn her away. Lust has plenty to do with it too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her brother presumed kidnapped, Becca needs Nick. She just wasn't expecting to want him so much. As their investigation turns into all-out war with an organized crime ring, only Nick can protect her. And only Becca can heal the scars no one else sees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desire is the easy part. Love is as hard as it gets. Good thing Nick is always up for a challenge...</description>

  <description>Ever wondered what leads someone to hold another human captive? Why would they do it? What urges drive a person to take another as a possession? What is the motivation to enact one of the most heinous crimes imaginable? Who commits these crimes? Every so often we are presented with another shocking case, all by their very nature are incredibly complex. Without following these cases closely it is easy to get lost in the speculation, confused within the detail, or left wondering as loose ends are never tied off as the media moves onto the next story. Some cases are well known, like that of Elisabeth Fritzl, Jaycee Dugard, and Natascha Kampusch. Josef Fritzl held his daughter in a basement dungeon for 24 years, creating an incestuous family, living two lives. But, there are many other cases that almost evade the public eye. While Elisabeth's story is traumatic, she is far from alone. David Bisson spent his childhood locked in a cupboard, while his mother denied his existence. Under the ice covered grounds of Russia, a copycat kidnapper aimed to recreate another man's vision of an underground city of slaves. James Jamelske got away with holding five women captive over 15 years, before anyone would believe their stories. Captive Humans explores true crime cases of people held captive, examining the stories in a chronological order. These cases present the facts; you can draw your own conclusions. Come into the dark, hard places and explore the secretive world of Captive Humans. &lt;a href="http://www.captivehumans.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.captivehumans.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Riley Cooper is on the run. Misha Tokarev, the love of his life, turned out to be an assassin for the Russian mob, and when it comes to character flaws, Riley draws the line at premeditated murder. Alien armor system McClane is also on the run, for reasons that include accidentally crashing a space ship into Earth and evading U.S. military custody. A failed prototype, McClane was scheduled for destruction. Sabotaging the ship put an end to that, but McClane is dubbed a bone rider for good reason—he can’t live without a host body. That’s why he first stows away in Riley's truck and then in Riley himself. Their reluctant partnership soon evolves into something much more powerful—and personal—than either of them could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, they embark on a road trip from hell, made all the more exciting by the government troops and mob enforcers hot on their trail. Misha is determined to win Riley back and willing to do whatever it takes to keep him safe. When hitman and alien join forces, they discover their impressive combined potential for death and destruction. It will take everything Riley has to steer them through the mess they create.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Mermen of Ea: Book One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taren Laxley has never known anything but life as a slave. When a lusty pirate kidnaps him and holds him prisoner on his ship, Taren embraces the chance to realize his dream of a seagoing life. Not only does the pirate captain offer him freedom in exchange for three years of labor and sexual servitude, but the pleasures Taren finds when he joins the captain and first mate in bed far surpass his greatest fantasies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, during a storm, Taren dives overboard to save another sailor and is lost at sea. He’s rescued by Ian Dunaidh, the enigmatic and seemingly ageless captain of a rival ship, the Phantom, and Taren feels an overwhelming attraction to Ian that Ian appears to share. Soon Taren learns a secret that will change his life forever: Ian and his people are Ea, shape-shifting merfolk… and Taren is one of them too. Bound to each other by a fierce passion neither can explain or deny, Taren and Ian are soon embroiled in a war and forced to fight for a future—not only for themselves but for all their kind.</description>

  <description>Mark is a cynical, too pretty, slight man working as an elf for the Christmas season at a department store. He also hasn't been in a relationship since his manipulative and abusive ex left him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spence is a tall, handsome, strong man who works as a reindeer helping 'Santa' at the same department store. The two share a special chemistry, but it's hard for Mark to trust anyone, even this gentle man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They both have secrets that could -- perhaps should -- keep them apart. Gentle, caring Spence keeps getting past Mark's barriers...but will Mark be able to handle it when he finds out why Spence is really here?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains a Christmas theme, reindeer shifters, elves, abusive relationship aftermath, angst, and a happy ending.</description>

  <description>Nathaniel Reece is savvy and fierce and wouldn’t give boring-ass Greg Sanders the time of day, except Greg is the president of a fraternity Nathaniel wants to join. But once Nathaniel gets a taste of the ferocity under Greg’s cool exterior, he can’t stop himself from trying to lure the uptight frat brother out of his shell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The face of gay life on campus and a crusader heading off to law school, Greg doesn’t see any problem with seducing the flamboyant and exciting Nathaniel. But that’s before he finds out his fraternity brothers are refusing Nathaniel's pledge bid. Greg’s athletic and masculine and has never had to deal with the censure of his friends or the odd looks of strangers, but if he’s going to be what Nathaniel needs, he’ll have to be comfortable not just being out, but also standing out.</description>

  <description>Giles is an artist, a man who is intense and totally focused on his art. In fact, a lot of people including some of his own family, think he's a little bit crazy. Harrison meets the artist as Giles is running away from setting up a showing at a gallery, totally freaked out. Harrison is immediately intrigued. He doesn't think Giles is crazy, but he does believe that Giles needs someone like him, or more accurately, him, to help Giles focus on more than just his art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giles isn't exactly easy to convince that Harrison is the man to do the job, though. Oh, he likes Harrison well enough and the sex is wonderful, but this BDSM stuff Harrison talks about is just a game, right? And Giles is worried that all the time he's spending focussed on Harrison is damaging his art. After all, you have to suffer for your art, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Harrison convince him that Giles can have love, happiness and Harrison in his life as well as be a great artist or will Giles' worries about his artwork drive them apart for good?</description>

  <description>Marcus is getting ready for a leather convention and Jim is helping his Master take inventory. There's nothing better than the smell of leather and his Master nearby, and Jim is happy as a clam. Happy enough that even Marcus pushing can only bring joy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Markus and Jim first appear in the Hammer novel &lt;em&gt;Bent&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

Will Jim survive Marcus’ reaction?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: Originally published in the Pour Some Sugar On It anthology.</description>

  <description>Struggling to come to terms with his grief and guilt over his twin brother’s death, Ian feels he’s living in a world devoid of color. He once rode the highs of success and fame as a model, but he lost everything when his brother died suddenly. When his former agent invites him to Bora Bora, Ian accepts with the hope of finding color in his dark world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temaru owns a diving shop in Bora Bora. As he walks along the beach at sunset, he sees a beautiful man sitting in the white sand. Deeply attracted to Ian, he wants nothing more than to help him recover his confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lust, desire and emotions run high between them. Ian feels the man he used to be slowly returning, guided by Temaru’s gentle touch. But Temaru will have his hands full with Ian’s overwhelming grief.</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fact: When Zebulon Pike attempted to climb what is now known as Pikes Peak, he got stuck in waist-deep snow and had to turn back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the last thing Dusty Porter learns in his Colorado history class before appendicitis ruins his life. It isn't long before social services figures out that Dusty's parents are more myth than reality, and he and his siblings are shipped off to live in Vermont with an uncle and aunt they've never met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dusty's new life is a struggle. His brother and sister don't seem to need him anymore, and he can't stand his aunt and uncle. At school, one hockey player develops a personal vendetta against him, while Emmitt, another hockey player, is making it hard for Dusty to keep pretending he's straight. Problem is, he's pretty sure Emmitt’s not gay. Then, just when Dusty thinks things can't get any worse, his mother reappears, looking for a second chance to be a part of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow Zebulon Pike still got the mountain named after him, so Dusty's determined to persevere—but at what point in life do you keep climbing, and when do you give up and turn back?</description>

  <description>The Angel. That’s what the young hustlers call Noah Everett, the man who’ll help them get off the streets. Once a hustler himself, Noah doesn’t take his own good advice, which is, “Don’t let this ruin your life.” Haunted by the past and those he couldn’t save, Noah carefully keeps others at bay until his self-imposed loneliness is shattered by determined, ambitious, but homeless eighteen-year-old Jeremy Kincaid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A ruthless pimp has targeted Jeremy, but if Noah will fight to get anonymous young men out of the life, he’ll fight harder to keep Jeremy from getting in, even if it means a return to old stomping grounds to make a deal with the devil. To save Jeremy, Noah risks more than just his body. He risks his soul as well, because Willie Carnell, pimp, was once Billy Cordell, Noah’s lover.</description>

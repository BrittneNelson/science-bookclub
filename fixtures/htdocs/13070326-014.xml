  <description>Routine makes Eliot Taylor happy. He thinks. He goes to work, goes to school, and lives with his two best friends. Except lately, something’s missing. While he’s hungover from New Year’s Eve, Eliot’s friend Jen coerces him into a New Year’s resolution. They agree to try one new activity per month for an entire year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each new experience checked off his list, like singing karaoke and bungee jumping, destroys more of Eliot’s comfortable routine. He meets new people. He falls in love. And despite how much it scares him, he learns to love life a little out of order.</description>

  <description>1762, The Georgian Age of Sail: For his first command, John Cavendish is given a ship—the HMS &lt;em&gt;Meteor&lt;/em&gt;—and a crew, both in need of repair and discipline. He’s determined to make a success of their first mission, and hopes the well-liked lieutenant Alfred Donwell will stand by his side as he leads his new crew into battle: stopping the slave trade off the coast of Algiers.&lt;p&gt;Alfie knows their mission is futile, and that their superiors back in England will use the demise of this crew as impetus for war with the Ottoman Empire. But the darker secret he keeps is his growing attraction for his commanding officer—a secret punishable by death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of his former captain—and lover—on the scene of the disastrous mission, Alfie is torn between the security of his past and the uncertain promise of a future with the straight-laced John.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against a backdrop of war, intrigue, and personal betrayal, the high seas will carry these men through dangerous waters from England to Africa to the West Indies in search of a safe harbor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Zachary Fox can’t sleep. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His acting career is taking off. Public recognition is picking up. Now more than ever, he understands how key reputation is to his success. But his relationship with his co-star, Kris—arranged around publicity rather than genuine feelings—is suffocating him. She once understood his needs, but her demands are beginning to grate with every shrill order she gives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zach has a secret.&lt;/em&gt; The breakout star of a new medical series, he’s been hiding his orientation from co-stars, friends and family, the studio, and his fans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the recommendation of a friend, Zach seeks out Sky Kelly, a well-connected herbalist whose concoctions are natural magic, as is her stunning beauty. On the surface, she has it all: her own house, a thriving business, and good friends, but the things she had to do to get there are a time bomb ticking away, and when it goes off, she'll be teetering on the edge of a chasm that can put her right back where she started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky has secrets.&lt;/em&gt; Like, she’s got a Y chromosome and the original equipment to go with it. Like being a highly paid escort. Like, if Zach is seen with her in public, it could ruin his career. Like someone becoming so obsessed with Sky, that obsession threatens them both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secrets...&lt;/em&gt; everyone is hiding something, and instead of finding The One, it could be The End.</description>

  <description>Charlie is the quintessential bear. Big, muscular and hairy. But that isn’t the type of men he’s attracted to. He is drawn to men like Taylor—short, smooth, and sexy. Taylor is Charlie’s idea of the perfect twink. But there’s something about Taylor Charlie doesn’t know. Taylor is unsure about a lot of things, but when he sees Charlie, he instantly knows he wants him. The only issue standing in his way is how Taylor views his own masculinity. He’s afraid that Charlie will leave once he knows the secret Taylor wants to keep hidden. Can he be transparent with Charlie and allow him to look behind the image he's so carefully constructed?</description>

  <description>Albert Sterne, forensics expert with the FBI, is so obnoxious on the surface that no-one bothers digging deeper. When he's sent to Colorado to investigate what turns out to be the work of a serial killer he encounters Special Agent Fletcher Ash and they end up reluctantly joining forces to unravel the case. It's only a matter of duty, though; it can't be more, because Albert doesn't do friendship - and he certainly doesn't do love!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This edition of the novel incorporates the stories first published separately in the ebook &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/search/search?q=Albert%20J.%20Sterne:%20Future%20Bright,%20Past%20Imperfect" title="Albert J. Sterne: Future Bright, Past Imperfect"&gt;Albert J. Sterne: Future Bright, Past Imperfect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Levi Ramone entered the gay porn market for one reason, and one reason only–he needed the cash to pay his momma's spiraling gambling debts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven years later, he's a veteran with a reputation as one of Blue Boy Studio's most ruthless tops, and when his boss suggests it's time for a change, he finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Figuratively speaking, at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Sonny Valentine, a go-go dancer at Blue's sister club, Silver's. Levi has secretly admired Sonny from afar for years, but there's one problem–he can't stand Sonny and the feeling is entirely mutual. When Levi learns Sonny is to play the third part in a scene he considers his worst nightmare, he figures things can't get any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when preparations for the scene from hell collide with tragic events in his personal life, he finds his fast growing, red hot attraction to Sonny the one thing left between him and a bullet.</description>

  <description>Jenny Kramer knows she isn't normal. After all, not everybody can see the past lives of people around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she befriends Ben Daulton, resident new boy, the pair stumble on an old music box with instructions for “mesmerization” and discover they may have more in common than they thought. Like a past life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using the instructions in the music box, Ben and Jenny share a dream that transports them to Romanov Russia and leads them to believe they have been there together before. But they weren't alone. Nikolai, the mysterious young man Jenny has been seeing in her own dreams was there, too. When Nikolai appears next door, Jenny is forced to acknowledge that he has travelled through time and space to find her. Doing so means he has defied the laws of time, and the Order, an ominous organization tasked with keeping people in the correct time, is determined to send him back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Ben, Jenny and Nikolai race against the clock - and the Order - Jenny and Nikolai discover a link that joins them in life - and beyond death.</description>

  <description>Prodigy pianist Simon Duckworth has a dark past. After being violently raped when he was thirteen, he flees to London, ashamed and determined never to tell a soul. He gets a job at a Denmark Street music shop, but it stifles him. At the first opportunity, Simon answers an ad for a musician, an act that changes his life forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephen Abednego has seen the same ad. He arrives in London with little more than his ambitions and a sheaf of poems, but together, they’re enough to get him hired. Under their new manager’s watchful eye, Stephen falls for Simon—but Stephen deeply closeted, and Simon may be too emotionally scarred for a mature relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With their manager’s help, their music rises, dragging them into the hectic world of superstardom, but success doesn’t come without a price. Each step out of the ennui and coal smoke of 1960s industrial London must be paid for in regret. With social convention standing between them and the whole world watching, Stephen and Simon discover that finding each other is not as easy as it seems.</description>

  <description>Sequel to Dark Horse "It's hard enough with two people. Throwing a third into the mix is... I don't know, doesn't it seem like we're asking for trouble?" It hasn't been easy, but horse trainer Dan Wheeler is beginning to build a new life for himself, finding his place in California with his lovers Evan Kaminski and Jeff Stevens. When things are going well, it's spectacular: there's affection, humor, and passion. But things don't seem to go well all that often. Dan continues to struggle with the loss of his previous lover and sometimes doubts that he even deserves to be happy; Evan is jealous of every rival for Dan's attention-including Jeff; and Jeff worries that he's too old for the younger men and wonders if he should bow out completely. Despite his resolutions, Dan has grown attached to the other two men, but he's not sure that's enough. He knows that it hurts to be together-he needs to decide whether it would hurt even more to be apart.</description>

  <description>Simon has waited centuries for someone like Robert, but their first meeting is intended to be their last: Robert’s time on Earth is up, and it is Simon’s place to take him out of this world and into the next. Instead, Simon makes a split-second decision to save Robert’s life, though he is uncomfortably aware he has only postponed the inevitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert quickly falls for Simon, but when he notices the way Death seems to follow him around, his curiosity about Simon’s true nature turns to suspicion, all but erasing his memories of the man. Simon must fight to make him remember… and to stop Robert from making a grisly mistake.</description>

  <description>Before…Miles "Pudge" Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave "the Great Perhaps" even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads  off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After…Nothing is ever the same.</description>

  <description>A lad from the streets meets a lord of the manor...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Crimean war veteran Sir Alan Watleigh goes searching for sex, he never imagines the street rat he brings home for one last bit of pleasure in his darkest hour will be the man who hauls him back from the edge of the grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A night of meaningless sex turns into an offer of permanent employment. As Alan’s valet, Jem offers much more than polished boots and starched cravats. He makes Alan smile and warms his bed. Just as the men are adjusting to their new living arrangement, news about a former soldier under his command sends Sir Watleigh and Jem on the road to save a child in danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The journey brings them closer together as they travel from lust toward love. But is Alan's love strong enough to risk society discovering the truth about him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Male/male sexual practices.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It wasn't so very long ago that James Campbell and William Hunt were lovers. They met at the horse ranch where they both worked, training and transporting stallions and mares all across the state and sometimes farther. But then, James discovered his employer's secrets and the truth behind the job he loved so much. The knowledge was too much, and James had to do something about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, James Campbell is a wanted man. Every bounty hunter in the area is hot on his trail, eager to be the one who finally brings him in. William, though, is determined to get there first. But when he finally catches up to James, he's torn between finding revenge for James' betrayal and helping him escape. Because his feelings for James are as strong as ever, and because he's not convinced that James was entirely wrong...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Originally part of the &lt;/em&gt;Weight of a Gun&lt;em&gt; anthology.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>When a man loses his heart, he has no choice but to follow…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enlightenment, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lowborn David Lauriston lacks the family connections needed to rise in Edinburgh’s privileged legal world. Worse, his latest case—defending weavers accused of treason—has brought him under suspicion of harbouring radical sympathies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Troubled by his sexuality, tormented by memories of a man he once platonically loved, David lives a largely celibate life—until a rare sexual encounter with a compelling stranger turns his world on its head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cynical and worldly, Lord Murdo Balfour is more at home in hedonistic London than dingy, repressed Edinburgh. Unlike David, he intends to eventually marry while continuing to enjoy the company of men whenever he pleases. Yet sex with David is different. It’s personal, intimate, and instead of extinguishing his desire, it only leaves him hungry for more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As David’s search for the man who betrayed the weavers deepens, he begins to suspect that his mysterious lover has more sinister reasons for his presence in Edinburgh. The truth could leave his heart broken…and more necks stretching on the gallows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains mystery and danger set in 1822 Scotland, and a forbidden love between two men that will leave you on the edge of your seat—until the next book.</description>

  <description>The moment model and part-time actor Benjamin spots the sexually alluring Alan outside his local restaurant, he’s determined to get to know him better. So he takes a chance and pretends to be Timothy, the blind date Alan is waiting for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Alan asks him about submission, safe words and spanking, Benjamin knows the sensible thing to do would be to leave. Funny then how he finds himself eager to know more. Will it be a date to remember and, if Alan discovers his deceit, could he ever be persuaded to take a chance on Benjamin?</description>

  <description>Between the pissed off creatures that want demon-hunter Lily Marks dead and the fallen angel who just...wants her, Lily is about ready to trade in forever for a comfy job in a cubicle farm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that she and Julian are civil to one another is enough to have her thrown out of the Sanctuary, but she can't shake her not-so-angelic stalker or how he brings her dangerously close to ecstasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her forbidden relationship with Julian provides the perfect fuel for suspicion when a traitor is discovered to be working within the Sanctuary. Lily quickly finds herself hunted by well, everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her only hope is to discover the real traitor before she loses everything--and she'll need Julian's help. That is, if Julian is really there to help her...and not destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, being a Nephilim isn't everything it's cracked up to be.</description>

  <description>Jacob Freehan has no job, no man, and no motivation. In pain both from ending a long-term abusive relationship and a severe back injury, he escapes to the sunny seaside town of Puerto Morelos, Mexico for a little yoga, a little R&amp;amp;R, and possibly a place to quietly end his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pakal is a centuries-old immortal Mayan spirit guide who has been charged with getting Jacob on the path toward healing. Romantic involvement with a spirit charge is strictly forbidden, and it has never been a problem...until now. Pakal sees something special in Jacob, but failure to keep a rapidly growing attraction at bay could result in Jacob losing his life and Pakal being condemned to the Underworld forever...</description>

  <description>Don’t look back. Don’t you ever look back… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shy tattoo artist Ash has a troubled past. Years of neglect, drug abuse, and life on the streets have taken their toll, and sometimes it seems the deep, unspoken bond with his lover is the only balm for wounds he doesn’t quite understand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chicago paramedic Pete is warmth, love, and strength—things Ash never knew he could have, and never even knew he wanted until Pete showed him. But fate is a cruel, cruel mistress, and when nightmares collide with the present, their tentatively built world comes crashing down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traumatic events in Pete’s work life distance him from home, and he doesn’t realize until it’s too late that Ash has slipped away. Betrayal, secrets, and lies unfold, and when a devastating coincidence takes hold, Pete must fight with all he has to save the love of his life.</description>

  <description>Book One in the Gin &amp;amp; Jazz series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack and Nick seek fortune and adventure in the silent film era of Hollywood. But their newly-expressed love is threatened by the heady allure of fame, gin and easy money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweet and innocent nineteen year-old Jack has loved the older and more street wise Nick from almost the first time he met him. Nick has taken care of him ever since Jack arrived in New York after he was beaten and thrown out of the boy’s orphanage for messing around with one of the guys there. They share a passion for silent films and have dreams of heading west to make their fortunes building sets for the studios. If only Nick felt the same passion for Jack, and wasn’t already engaged to a gal back in Philly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick’s temper sometimes gets the best of him, but that’s only because he worries about Jack – Nick is all the poor kid has. But he’s also terrified about the way he’s been feeling towards Jack lately. They’re the kinds of feelings he should be having for his fiancé—Penelope—and never for a man. His only goal is to get them both to Hollywood, where he’s sure they’ll be rolling in the dough in no time, and where everything will all work out the way it should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hollywood isn’t exactly what they’d thought it would be. There are plenty of gin joints, jazz, money, parties and sex—but everything comes with a hefty price. Everyone they meet—from Trixie Fox, the ditzy up and coming starlet, to Bernie, the foreman who gets them their first studio job—seems to have a hidden agenda. Can the newfound love between Jack and Nick survive the tawdry mess that makes up the glitz and glamour of the celluloid kingdom, or will their own secrets tear them apart forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains mild BDSM elements, drug use, and sex-for-hire scenes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Advisory: Please note, this is the first book of a three book serial and is part of a continuing story line best read in sequence.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dreams can come true—but sometimes nightmares are very real, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Michael—Mikey—Fawkes bags himself a job as a handyman for a film production company and meets his favourite actor, gay porn star Colin Meighan, he believes his dream has come true. Colin indeed appears to be a dream turned to flesh. Handsome, young and as insatiable sexually as the roles he plays suggest, he makes his way into Mikey’s bed and introduces him to unknown carnal pleasures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A slick lover and sweet talker, Colin also finds a place in Mikey’s heart, but as Mikey lets his new lover lure him deeper and deeper into a world of decadent on- and off-screen sex, their indulgences begin to take their toll on Mikey. Curious to find out more about the strange and inexplicable effect Colin has on his sex partners, Mikey discovers that there is a terrible reason why one man alone can never be enough to satisfy Colin’s hunger and he realises that dreams can come true—but sometimes nightmares are very real, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader Advisory: This book is the first in a series with an ongoing story arc. It is set in the world of gay porn where the heroes enjoy a red-hot multi-man pile-up with secondary characters as well as some mild BDSM play.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Mikael Jarvela may only be a half shifter, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be alpha of the eastern Finland farm-turned-sanctuary his father founded. Six wolves, a red fox, a black jaguar, and a lynx all think of him as the head of the family. But Mikael doesn’t have anyone to call his own until he comes across an injured Siberian tiger in the woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment the animal recovers and Mikael and Maxim meet face to human face, the attraction between them is undeniable. They strike up a tentative relationship, but they’re both proud men, and their egos keep getting in the way. Just when it looks like their romance is doomed, an outside threat to the family—to Mikael—forces Maxim to choose between the life of solitude he knows and the love and companionship that could be his if he stays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Word Count: 32,214</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Luke Chesser is trying to forget his spectacular failure of a love life. He practices marching band moves for hours in the hot Texas sun, deals with his disapproving father, and slyly checks out the new band field tech, Curtis Cameron. Before long, Luke is falling harder than he knew he could. And this time, he intends to play it right.&lt;br&gt;Since testing positive for HIV, Curtis has careened between numbness and fear. Too ashamed to tell anyone, Curtis can't possibly act on his feelings. And Luke--impulsive, funny, and more tempting than he realizes--won't take a hint. Even when Curtis distances himself it backfires, leaving him with no idea how to protect Luke from the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confronting a sensitive topic with candor and aplomb, acclaimed author J. H. Trumble renders a modern love story as sweet, sharp, and messy as the real thing, where easy answers are elusive, and sometimes the only impossible thing is to walk away.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Finalist, 2013 Pacific Northwest Writers' Association Literary Contest, Mainstream Category ("Ezra")&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrian Stockwell and Ezra Cherevin both battle the fallout from their broken families. Yet each one’s strategy is as different as each one’s past. Adrian’s childhood was left void by apathy; Ezra’s upended by violence. The written word soon becomes their therapy, their escape. This shared passion for literature is the vehicle that brings them together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their journey is filled with personal and familial potholes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can these two young men carve out a life together by learning to navigate a sea of challenges? And can the people in their lives do the same?</description>

  <description>Abby Sellers knows what she wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enduring eighteen years in the shadow of her identical twin sister, Annika, she wants a fresh start. A chance to create her own life, separate from her conniving, deceptive twin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising both her family and friends, Abby ditches her plans for college and enrolls at a new school instead. There, she encounters West Montgomery, a sexy fellow student who immediately disarms her with his good looks and charm. West takes a liking to Abby and she suddenly finds herself walking a thin line, fabricating a fictional life created not by lies but by omission. She soon discovers West has secrets of his own, secrets that he's not altogether interested in sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out from under the shadow of her twin, Abby's life—and her relationship with West—blossoms. When Abby leaves town one weekend, something unthinkable happens and her relationship with West is shattered. Reeling from the discovery, Abby fears all of her plans have backfired and she's created a mess for both of them, a mess that no one can clean up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But West isn't willing to let her go that easily. When he forces her to confront secrets they've both been hiding, Abby must decide more than if she's willing to forgive and forget. She must also decide just what kind of life she wants...and who she wants to live it with.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twink's Bottom&lt;/strong&gt; - Just a typical English village...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tracy Richards has no idea what to expect when he takes the job of caretaker at the mysterious village of Twink's Bottom. The locals are happy to tell him about the part he will have to play in the annual &lt;strong&gt;erotic topiary&lt;/strong&gt; event, but when it comes to the reclusive lord living in the dilapidated manor house on the hill, they are far more reluctant to talk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Reeves lives an isolated life, only venturing from the grounds of Twink's Bottom Manor to walk his beloved dog, Reggie. But Lord Reeves has a vision—&lt;strong&gt;a beautiful, majestic topiary phallus&lt;/strong&gt; soaring towards the sky from the top of Twink's Bottom Hill. He believes its creation will lay old ghosts to rest, and bring him the peace that has alluded him for so many years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could Tracy be the man to bring Lord Reeves' phallus to life&lt;/strong&gt;, and by working together will they finally reclaim Rory's rightful place as The Lord of Twink's Bottom?</description>

  <description>When Aidan Sterling has been to hell and back doing his duty to his country, who will help him come to terms with what happened?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, inevitably, life hits a snag. What if love turns up at the same time? Aidan Sterling's life has hit one of those moments-the times when things might just change whether he wants it to or not. Outside of the inherent paranoia of his active career in covert ops, he's recovering from some serious physical and emotional trauma from a mission gone disastrously wrong. His bosses aren't sure if he's up to returning to active fieldwork---and neither is he. And Kris Jameson is the kind of guy who'll take the time to understand and care about Aiden. He's a regular guy with a large heart. Kris is a carpenter and a part-time bouncer, easy going and hardworking. But not all danger can be found overseas, and nice guys aren't always safe even here at home.</description>

  <description>Christmas is a time for giving - what do you do when no one gives a damn? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Zachary Weston Christmas means sleeping on a churchyard bench in the freezing snow with nothing better in his future. Thrown out of his home for being gay, he is left without money or, it seems, anywhere to go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until a stranger shows him that some people do give a lot more than a damn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Hamilton is a rookie cop in his small home town. He finds a young throwaway, fresh from the city, sleeping on a bench in the churchyard on a snowy Christmas Eve. Can he be the one to give Zachary his own Christmas miracle?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * * * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First published December 2010</description>

  <description>Avery has just met her hot upstairs neighbor. He's irresistible. Tattooed. And a virgin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nursing student Avery Michaels wants nothing to do with dating—she's perfectly happy single. Privy to too many of her mother's bad decisions and even worse taste in boyfriends, all Avery can handle is a string of uncomplicated hookups whenever the mood strikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she meets smoking hot tattoo artist Bennett, she wants him—for just one night. But he won't accept a no-strings-attached arrangement. He lives by a straight-laced code of values based on his own troubled upbringing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bennett sees something special in Avery and he wants more from her. Way more. As Avery wrestles with her emotions for Bennett, danger and tragedy force them to open up to each other. And Avery must face the terrifying realization that she wants more from him, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she needs to make a choice—let Bennett go or finally let him &lt;em&gt;in.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>New York City, May 2000. The Internet bubble has burst and Evan, a computer programmer, is fired with an email from his boss. The next day, his girlfriend dumps him, also via email. Afraid to check any more emails, Evan desperately seeks a rebound romance but the catastrophes that ensue go from bad to hilariously worse.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, Evan meets Sammy -- someone whose legendary disasters with females eclipse even his own. To reverse their fortunes, they recruit their friends -- Trevor, Yi, and Carlos -- to form a group of five guys who take on Manhattan in pursuit of dates, sex, and adventure.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Evan, a closet writer, falls desperately in love with a Hollywood starlet, he schemes to meet her by writing a novel that will sweep her off her feet. Sammy knows nothing about publishing but is confident of one thing: Evan's book should have the word "sex" in the title. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With musings about life, relationships, and human psychology, this quintessential New York story about the search for happiness follows five men on their comical paths to trouble, self-discovery, and love.</description>

  <description>Ennek, the son of the Chief, and Miner, a former slave, have escaped the totalitarian city-state of Praesidium and remain fugitives. Having defeated two mighty wizards, they begin to realize that complete freedom can be as dangerous as absolute power. In this final book in the trilogy that began with Stasis and continued with Flux, Ennek and Miner face battles, corruption, and further journeys through lands both new and familiar. As they grow more secure in their relationship with one other, they're also learning that the greatest challenges sometimes come from very close to the heart and that everything of value has a price. With the help of a few allies, they seek equipoise—a balance for themselves and for their world.</description>

  <description>Carlos O'Shea is stuck. He knocked up a girl in college after a night of too much drinking and then married her to be honorable. With little money, fewer options, and no degree, he winds up cleaning the floors in a small town gentlemen's club and thinking desperate thoughts about the handsome owner that'll lead to nothing but trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greg Moorehouse only invested in a nudie bar to help his best buddy out of a financial crisis. Now his drug-dealing ex-boyfriend, his reverend father, and a parade of surgically-enhanced DDs are driving him insane. But what's really stripped him of all good sense is his growing obsession with his married employee, Carlos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They circle each other in a push-pull of misunderstandings and growing attraction. Carlos needs to get his boss out of his head, and Greg can’t abide cheaters and married men. So what are a strip club owner and the guy who cleans going to do with their undeniable desires? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be advised: Contains explicit love-making between two hot-blooded men, angsty dark moments, and cupcake-baking exotic dancers.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Chance Irving is a young man with a gift for getting into trouble-not surprising, as trouble is all he's ever known. After losing everything he held dear one fateful night, he decides to leave New York and his past behind, and joins the French Foreign Legion. But even in Algiers, Chance can't seem to shake his old ways, and he ends up being transferred to a unit made up of misfits and rabble-rousers like him-a unit he finds just in time to be captured and thrown into a cell with his new commandant, Jacky Valentine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A highly respected commandant with a soft spot for hard luck cases, Jacky is the kind of guy who would go to war for you, and the three equally troubled youths from his unit he's more or less adopted feel the same way about him. Suddenly Chance starts to think that his life doesn't have to be as desolate and barren as the wastelands around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even after their escape, with the promise of a future with Jacky to buoy his spirits, or maybe because of it, Chance can't stop making mistakes. He disobeys orders, lashes out at the boys in Jacky's care, and blazes a trail of self-destruction across the desert-until someone makes him realize he's hurting more than just himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Timeless Dreams title: While reaction to same-sex relationships throughout time and across cultures has not always been positive, these stories celebrate M/M love in a manner that may address, minimize, or ignore historical stigma.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>"Fixing the home can heal the heart if you can find all the pieces. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police officer Samuel Briggs is getting to know the people on his new, third-shift beat, but he d prefer they not know too much about him or the painful past that drove him away from New Mexico to start fresh in small-town Stratton, PA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All he wants is peace, a manageable routine, and time to fix up his project home. There s no room in his broken heart for a new relationship. It s crowded with too many memories. But there s something about the Dixie s Cup short-order cook, who s flirty one minute, distracted the next, that piques Sam s interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part-time cook, part-time hardware salesman and full-time handyman Rey King lives to work but not because he loves it. Relationships? No time. Until one glance at Sam s haunted eyes sends a plumb line straight to his wary heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One afternoon of impulsive, no-strings sex begins to grow into a cautious friendship. But when Rey is seriously injured protecting a friend, the cracks in their already shaky foundation begin to show. Falling in love wasn t in either man s recovery plan and this time, the risk could be too great.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains one emotionally wrecked cop, one angsty short-order cook, a few too many secrets, some meddling small-town folk, and plenty of hot man-on-man action.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Serena Bell makes her Loveswept debut with the captivating story of a woman living on the edge—and the man who’s destined to love her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Ana Travares has been looking over her shoulder her whole life. Her U.S. visa expired when she was a young girl, and if her secret is discovered, she’ll be forced to return to the Dominican Republic. Ana allowed herself to get close to someone once before—and after he broke her heart, she swore never to make the same mistake again. But when a handsome doctor asks for her assistance, she fantasizes about breaking all her rules.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Even though pediatrician Ethan Hansen is a natural when it comes to little kids, as the single father of a teenage son he just can’t seem to get it right . . . except for the Spanish tutor he’s hired for his son, Theo. Ana has managed to crack Theo’s shell—and he isn’t the only one taken with her. The sexy tutor has fired up Ethan with a potent mix of lust and protectiveness. But as he starts to envision a future with Ana, Ethan is devastated to learn the truth about her citizenship. Somehow he’s got to find a way to help her—and hold on to the woman he’s falling hopelessly in love with.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: &lt;em&gt;Accidental Cowgirl, After the Kiss, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Blue Lines&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Lord Vellem is a man desperate for escape. His father hides from his problems in alcohol, his mother hides from her misery in drugs, and his brother fled to the relative safety of the royal palace. Vellem eventually found solace in the Royal Army Corp of Engineers, but still could not entirely escape. Then his brother provides him with an unexpected chance, and now Vellem's marriage to the young prince of a neighboring kingdom is only months away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The marriage promises not just a fresh start in a new land, but a challenge to his famed skills in building roads and bridges. But before he can settle into his new life, tragedy strikes, and Vellem isn't certain he's up to rebuilding the ruin left in its wake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: This story started as a LT3's Serial Fiction in February 2013; this Goodreads entry is for the published version&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Jeffrey Kuyper was a once-in-a-generation talent and I was his muse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeffrey's death shocked the art world and upended my life. His last portrait is an intimate reminder of our final weeks together. Now it's up for auction and I want it more than anything. When a cold-mannered man in a dark suit outbids me, I'll agree to anything to buy it from him--even a weekend in his bed.</description>

  <description>Corporal Jacqs Glebov is a simple soldier who wants a bunk, decent food and the company of other battle-hardened men and women who understand the realities of fighting. Instead he's stuck patrolling a remote corner of the border with cadets straight out of boot camp. They don't understand him, and he sure doesn't have an ounce of respect for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a field promotion, Earth sends Commander Zeke Waters to the Candiru for some practical experience in a leadership role. Instead, Zeke falls in lust with the adamantly heterosexual Jacqs. The way Jacqs fights and the way he sees the world draws Zeke closer, even if common sense tells him to walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if they can find a way to reconcile their sexual differences, they are both still soldiers. The war will eventually take them away from each other unless they can find a way to escape the rules that have defined their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Gin, and I kill people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; They call me the Spider. I'm the most feared assassin in the South — when I'm not busy at the Pork Pit cooking up the best barbecue in Ashland. As a Stone elemental, I can hear everything from the whispers of the gravel beneath my feet to the vibrations of the soaring Appalachian Mountains above me. My Ice magic also comes in handy for making the occasional knife. But I don't use my powers on the job unless I absolutely have to. Call it professional pride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that a ruthless Air elemental has double-crossed me and killed my handler, I'm out for revenge. And I'll exterminate anyone who gets in my way — good or bad. I may look hot, but I'm still one of the bad guys. Which is why I'm in trouble, since irresistibly rugged Detective Donovan Caine has agreed to help me. The last thing this coldhearted killer needs when I'm battling a magic more powerful than my own is a sexy distraction...especially when Donovan wants me dead just as much as the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Pro cyclist Luca Biondi lives for the race. For the star of Team Antano-Clark, victory lies within his grasp—if he can outdistance 200 other hopefuls, avoid suspicion from race officials, and keep his lieutenant more friend than foe. Luca also has secrets, and eyes for amateur cyclist and journalist Christopher Nye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christopher understands Luca’s need to keep their relationship under wraps, but chafes at hiding in the shadows of his lover’s career. He’s ready to cheer Luca’s victories, but he knows too well how triumph can turn to tears. While Christopher’s heart sees Luca the man, his inner journalist—and his editor—sees the cycling world’s biggest scoop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the jagged curves of the Colorado Rockies to the viciously steep Belgian hills, Luca can ride out any bumps—except rumors about his loyalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few words in the wrong ear could crash everything. With miles between them, hints of scandal, and Luca’s fierce need to guard his reputation, a journalist might have to let go of the biggest story of his career or risk forcing his lover to abandon the race. Christopher and Luca face a path more treacherous than any road to the summit in the Italian Alps.</description>

  <description>Perfect Parker Fadley isn’t so perfect anymore.  She’s quit the cheerleading squad, she’s dumped her perfect boyfriend, and she’s failing school.  Her parents are on a constant suicide watch and her counselors think she’s playing games…but what they don’t know, the real reason for this whole mess, isn’t something she can say out loud.  It isn’t even something she can say to herself.  A horrible thing has happened and it just might be her fault.  If she can just remove herself from everybody--be totally alone--then everything will be okay...The problem is, nobody will let her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Though mortals have been convinced that God cares about their souls, nothing could be further from the truth. He created the world as a gift for his lover, Satan. But when Satan left him, he decided to end what he saw as his most grotesque creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satan and his army of demons are man's only hope...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The demon Kinzer and his lover, Janka, have been sent by Satan to spy on The Raze, a gang of rogue demons who are working with God to bring about Armageddon. When someone exposes their true allegiances, The Raze clips Kinzer's wings and murders Janka. Kinzer manages to escape. He tracks down Satan's allies to warn them about a mole in their midst when he learns that they've located the Antichrist—a powerful weapon that could prevent the apocalypse. Now, he's on a mission to protect the Antichrist and avenge his lover’s death.</description>

  <description>On a transatlantic cruise to New York, sculptor Rhys Matherton struggles to piece his life back together after losing his mother, inheriting a fortune, and finding out his father isn't his father after all. He spills a tray of drinks on a handsome stranger, then he finds himself up against a wall getting the best hand-job he’s ever had. And for the first time in his life, he feels whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rhys enjoys the company of Silas Quint, but for the eerie way no one pays attention to them even while they kiss in a crowded bar. Silas explains he's a forest fae able to glamor the room around them—and more importantly, that he's on the cruise to hunt vampires. Rhys thinks Silas is full of it, until he discovers vampires are real, and he’s part of their main course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silas Quint can’t be distracted by a human lover, even one as lovely as Rhys. Stuck in the middle of the ocean, he has barely enough of energy to hunt the vampires he’s been sent to destroy. Rhys is full of the one thing Silas needs needs most—the element of living plants. Only sucking energy from Rhys would make Silas as soulless as the creatures he hunts. How can he keep Rhys safe, without becoming like the very monsters he hunts?</description>

  <description>Monty and Walter are an unlikely couple. They meet one freezing Idaho winter night when Monty, after several Miller chills and an ugly fight with his latest boytoy, plunges his van into the icy Snake River, just a few hundred yards from where Walter and his older sister Kendall are parked discussing the heartless and ugly attitude of their stepmother Helena. The siblings end up saving Monty's life, and from that moment, nothing is ever the same for Monty and Walter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They dive into a passionate secret relationship, and though they appear to be polar opposites in personality and lifestyle, they will discover that they have a lot more in common than they realize. Their love changes both of them as they navigate the rough and rocky terrain of sharing a home with Walter's judgmental stepmother. No matter what tries to tear them apart, they come to the painful conclusion, again and again, that they are soul mates.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A modern knight, a noble quest, and a magical sword. What could go wrong?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the City, where gods run nightclubs, goblins hire out as mercs, sorcerers work their magic, the Fae hold court over every neighborhood…and humanity is blissfully ignorant of it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For minor Fae noble Richard Stone, life is going well. He has a decent fiefdom (okay, it’s a slum), a budding acting career (okay, so it’s porn), and one of only five magical swords in the City. An arranged marriage is barely a blip on his worry meter—until his family blade loses its magic. The shame of it puts his noble standing in jeopardy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To regain his status, Richard needs help. Fortunately, his new bride is a sidhe knight and his servant Simaron has, er, his back. Together they embark on a quest to find the demon who slew his father, investigate a conspiracy that goes to the highest echelons of Fae nobility, and discover a secret family legacy that could ruin his House.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All while keeping up appearances to a society that demands perfection. And they say a noble’s life is easy…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: This book contains explicit gay sex, not-so-explicit gay sex, explicitly implied gay sex, routine breaking of the fourth wall, occasional bouts of Pearl Jam fanboy-ism, and plot. Side effects include confusion and headaches, and are best avoided by reading the pages therein in numerical order.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

He thinks a one night stand in the Caribbean might be the answer, but when he sees the young, thin and much smaller Travis, he thinks the agency sent the wrong man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can desire overcome misunderstanding when these two bear it all? Or will both men walk away from exactly what they need and desire?</description>

  <description>When Trent Copeland runs into Reed Acton at a Bangkok airport, he thinks the handsome American is too good to be true. Why would someone like Reed be interested in a quiet, introverted gay-romance writer? After all, even an obvious tourist like Trent can see that there is more to Reed’s constant unexplained appearances in his path than meets the eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reed Acton has one mission and one mission only—he needs to get the map that was accidentally slipped into Trent's bag and keep the mobsters who want the priceless artifact from taking deadly revenge. Trent Copeland is a delicious and damned near irresistible diversion, but Reed can’t afford distractions right now, especially if he wants to keep Trent safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Bangkok's seediest back alleys to the sacred north, the two men will fight to stay one step ahead of the bad guys and learn that the only treasure worth finding is... each other.</description>

  <description>When Daniel's invalid landlady asks for his help preventing a possible suicide from the clifftop near their home, he doesn't want to disappoint her. So he grits his teeth, picks up his camera, and goes out to play the Chinese tourist. He's done it before: befriended the lonely, lured them away from the danger zone, acted as a safety net. This time, the figure staring out to sea is way out of his league, his complete opposite, the sort of man Daniel's always admired from afar. Then the attractive Taylor turns the tables and lures Daniel out from behind the safety of his camera, and as Daniel finds himself fighting off an attraction he can't deny, he realizes he's in danger of being caught. Will the camera expose truths about himself that he wants to keep hidden?</description>

  <description>The Dark Kingdom is preparing itself for the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy--the arrival of a new Queen, a Witch who will wield more power than even the High Lord of Hell himself. But this new ruler is young, and very susceptible to influence and corruption; whoever controls her controls the Darkness. And now, three sworn enemies begin a ruthless game of politics and intrigue, magic and betrayal, and the destiny of an entire world is at stake.</description>

  <description>Shy, nervous Scott is a big book geek, and fellow student Mark is a bit controlling between the sheets. During one afternoon at the university library, they find they are the perfect match. Now they have to find out if they can keep on proving that some things are even more enjoyable than a good book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two begin exploring their most secret sexual fantasies, neither can imagine walking away. With only one semester left before they head off in different directions, they discover it’s impossible to avoid their growing feelings for each other. When a desperate bully tries to destroy Mark’s chance at the career he’s always wanted and tries to keep him away from Scott, the two lovers must come to terms with exactly what it means to be in love with someone—and how to be brave enough to go after what it is they truly want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This work contains graphic language and explicit sexual content between two men, including some light BDSM (spanking and bondage). Intended for adult audiences only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author's Note:&lt;br&gt;This is the expanded, full-length novel. The original, free short story is chapter one of this novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Paramedic Aaron Chase doesn't have anything against love, but he knows it means a lot of responsibility, like when he had to step in to raise his siblings. With the last one off to college, Aaron's anticipating enjoying life on his own terms. He certainly isn't expecting Joey Miller to accidentally drop into his life. Sexy, funny and annoyingly optimistic, Joey's tendency to get into trouble keeps sending him Aaron's way; Joey knows all about love. He's fallen in it ten times. All that experience has to count for something, right? With Aaron it's different. Joey's fallen for good.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Hard help can be good to find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romano and Albright, Book 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feisty New Yorker Caesar Romano has a knack for getting into a jam, and this week is no exception. When his pregnancy-hormone-buzzed business partner sweet talks him into working a solo gig for his famous ex, Caesar attracts the worst kind of attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s only the beginning. Hit on by a lusty German, stalked by the paparazzi, victim of an unexpected airbag attack—and desperate for some part-time help—Ce’s running out of time, staff and patience. But what’s really got him poised to run? A looming brunch with his sexy lover’s esteemed family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PI Dan Albright is a man of many gifts: investigation, security, sex talk and driving Caesar nuts in and out of the bedroom. Hired to protect an outrageous soap star from a deranged personal assistant, Dan’s got his hands full refereeing rival actors, locating one four-foot-eleven woman…and convincing Ce that he’s playing for keeps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey, nobody ever said taking a relationship to the next level was a waltz in the park.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;’Tis the season of goodwill to all men…even the one who dumped you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley MacDermott’s ambitions are simple. Managing the annual Bath Christmas Market—which involves long hours in the cold and a whole lot of hassle—will secure the promotion he needs to afford to move out of his noisy, top-floor flat. Where not even his balcony is safe from an aggressive herring gull.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last stallholder he expects to see is his ex. Riley never recovered from their break up, and five years on the old chemistry still sparkles. So does their habitual head butting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stan never wanted to leave the love of his life, but the pull of the woods was too strong—and Riley was firmly planted in the city. Reconnecting is painful, but Stan still jumps at the chance to stay with his old flame during the Market. And damn the consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the weeks pass, the two grow closer than ever. But despite scorching sex and cozy intimacy, they both know they face a cold and lonely future. Unless one of them can compromise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains sex in a shed, a seagull with a grudge, glamping, awful Secret Santa underwear, misuse of an Abba song, and as many wood-related puns as the author thought she could get away with.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A sophisticated, page-turning double love story spanning forty years-an unforgettable &lt;em&gt;Brief Encounter&lt;/em&gt; for our times. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is 1960. When Jennifer Stirling wakes up in the hospital, she can remember nothing-not the tragic car accident that put her there, not her husband, not even who she is. She feels like a stranger in her own life until she stumbles upon an impassioned letter, signed simply "B", asking her to leave her husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Years later, in 2003, a journalist named Ellie discovers the same enigmatic letter in a forgotten file in her newspaper's archives. She becomes obsessed by the story and hopeful that it can resurrect her faltering career. Perhaps if these lovers had a happy ending she will find one to her own complicated love life, too. Ellie's search will rewrite history and help her see the truth about her own modern romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A spellbinding, intoxicating love story with a knockout ending, &lt;em&gt;The Last Letter from Your Lover&lt;/em&gt; will appeal to the readers who have made &lt;em&gt;One Day&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Blush sensuality level: This is a sensual romance (may have explicit love scenes, but not erotic in frequency or type). Tired of having been constantly on the move, Drew is determined to make Cardiff his home. When he starts his new job as a teacher, he strikes up an immediate friendship with Nathan Morgan, a young history teacher. Nathan is instantly attracted to Drew but doesn't want to risk their fledgling friendship by declaring the extent of his desire. Completely oblivious to Nathan's quandary, Drew doesn't realize the true nature of his own feelings for Nathan until accusations from a student force both men's hands. Drew has spent his life running away. Running away from his mistakes, his desires and a secret-filled past. This time, he's forced to choose between running once more and a possible future with Nathan.</description>

  <description>After breaking up with his cheating boyfriend, Mark Smith keeps life simple: his nursing career and a place of his own, but no dating. He’s steering clear of romance and the heartbreak that goes with it. After losing both parents and having all his relationships fail, he figures happily ever after is a myth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dr. Trevor Hayes crosses Mark’s path at the hospital, he falls hard for Mark. The attraction is clearly mutual, and Trevor is determined to parlay that attraction into a relationship. Mark is just as determined to avoid exactly that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Trevor chips away at Mark’s resistance, and facing hardship and sorrow together brings them closer. Still, Mark can’t shake his belief that their romance is temporary—until he’s unexpectedly faced with the danger that he might lose Trevor for good. Mark must choose between guarding his heart and giving it completely, the risk he swore never to take again.</description>

  <description>Ahoy, me proud beauty, shiver me timbers! I ask ye to sail me jollyboat on the high seas, lubber, but will ye dare to accept? On offer be a pirate's life full of danger and risk, and not just to yer neck, but to yer very virgin heart! There's many a bodice to be ripped--or perhaps I should say many a codpiece to be snapped--and should ye be graced enough to cross bones with a corsair, don't be an addlepate! Heave ho, lad, handsomely, and show him how ye bury yer treasure!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pirates didn't only sail the high seas in historical times. Modern-day renegades and futuristic rebels are just as ripe for adventure and plunder. No matter the time, place, or circumstances, bad boys steal affection as often as they salvage treasure, and in these stories of romance, a rogue's black heart always conceals a center of gold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stories included:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Merric by Rebecca Cohen&lt;br&gt;Rough Trade by Cooper West&lt;br&gt;Touched by the West Wind by Ellen Holiday&lt;br&gt;The Winds of Change by Maggie Lee&lt;br&gt;My Hand in Yours by Emily Moreton&lt;br&gt;Ghost of Jupiter by Jana Denardo&lt;br&gt;The Golden Galleon by K.R.

  <description>Six years ago, Jeff Beachum comforted a frightened teenager outside an HIV treatment clinic, and Collin Waters has remembered his kindness ever since. Now, after six years of crushing on the kind, brown-eyed sweetheart of his dreams, Collin is feeling adult and together enough to make his move. Too bad fate, which has never been kind to Jeff, has something else in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff's life had fallen completely apart before that long-ago day, and it isn’t much better now. Jeff has toughened up, become self-reliant, been the funny guy his friends turn to, the one who gives advice and comfort when needed. But every phantom from Jeff’s past is about to come out to haunt him, and the family Jeff has staked his future on isn’t in such great shape either. Collin is more than a starry-eyed kid, and it’s a good thing, because Jeff’s going to need all the help he can get. No one knows better than Jeff that life can be too short to turn your back on honest love, and that living happily is the best promise of all.</description>

  <description>Nicola Marter was born with a gift. When she touches an object, she sometimes glimpses those who have owned it before. When a woman arrives with a small wooden carving at the gallery Nicola works at, she can see the object’s history and knows that it was named after the Firebird—the mythical creature from an old Russian fable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compelled to know more, Nicola follows a young girl named Anna into the past who leads her on a quest through the glittering backdrops of the Jacobites and Russian courts, unearthing a tale of love, courage, and redemption.</description>

  <description>In the year 2081 our planet survived global warming of an apocalyptic scale. When the dust settled and the water receded Dr. Anthony Smith, one of only a few hundred survivors of GWI, started society anew. Having come to the conclusion that injudicious breeding played a huge role in the destruction of Earth as we knew it in the twenty first century, he worked closely with other survivors to isolate the Dionysus gene. This gene has the ability to manipulate human DNA to ensure that all male children be born gay, and all female children be born lesbians. A new society is born. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the year 2300 Dr. Smith’s descendants are ushering in the twenty fourth century having maintained control of the government that still rules society. Twins Aiya and Aiyan are preparing to meet their matches and take control of House Gaeland, the current ruling House. But not everything is as it seems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love is Love.. it knows no gender and doesn’t conform to restrictions and boundaries. Aiyan has found his soul mate in Kaden, the prince of House Devi that he is matched with and eventually marries. But when the person Aiya falls in love with tests the boundaries put in place after GWI, all hell breaks loose. And in the midst of one secret unraveling, another will emerge. There is a growing anomaly that threatens to destroy over two hundred years of progression. This anomaly is known as Opposites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*WARNING* Opposites is a majorly M/M New Adult novel that contains explicit sexual content and relationships between gay, lesbian and straight couples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UK PURCHASE LINK: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Opposites-ebook/dp/B00D54PF6M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Opposites-ebo...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>A story of love, a story of hope. How can you move forward when you're anchored to the past?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to tattooed bad boys, Chase Gartner was the real deal. Partying, engaging in meaningless sex, getting into fights---Chase indulged in it all during his late teen years, thus firmly solidifying his status as a heartbreakingly gorgeous but way-too-dangerous-to-trust guy in his hometown of Harmony Creek, Ohio. Then, following one fateful night of reckless decisions, Chase's actions finally caught up to him and landed him in prison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, four years have passed and Chase finds himself a free man. He returns to Harmony Creek, ready to pick up the pieces and start rebuilding his shattered life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things are off to a promising start when he meets Kay Stanton, a young woman with a tragic past of her own. Despite a powerful attraction, Chase and Kay are naturally hesitant to become involved. That's why friendship feels like the safest option. But when passions ignite and love blossoms, a relationship that is destined and meant to be can only be resisted for so long. When Chase and Kay finally succumb to their feelings they realize being together feels more right and true than anything they have ever experienced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their love is soon tested. Chase's wild past still haunts and tempts him, and Kay is keeping a secret that could tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I Stand Before You is a journey of hope and forgiveness, coming to terms with the past and moving forward. But mostly it's a story of two damaged people who take a chance, open their hearts, and find true love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult/Contemporary Romance genres. First in a series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;***warning: contains explicit sexual situations, drug use, some violence, and profanity***&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A past that won’t let go…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After losing his job, Chase Sarim finds himself living in a shit hole apartment. His new neighbor calls himself Seven, wears aluminum hats and carries around a ceramic rooster.  He also seems to know what Chase is going to do or say before it happens, and talks about people named, Nine, Three, and Four.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase knows better than to get involved with someone like that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But some men are just to hot to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A future of fear…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven has been running for his life ever since he escaped Sub-Floor. In order to elude those hunting him he can never have a home, never have friends…and love? It’s nothing but a weakness that can be used against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hiding had become a way of life. Until Chase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greed, power, and corruption…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. David Stone knows Seven has a secret. Why else would his colleague, Dr. Radcliff, help Seven escape Sub-Floor?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t the loss of a defective precog that bothered Stone, it was the fact Radcliff was willing to die to keep Stone from knowing why he did it.  Or better yet, how.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two men, one love, brought together by a series of impossible circumstances and destined by fate for an entangled future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But maybe &lt;em&gt;fate&lt;/em&gt; has nothing to do with it.</description>

  <description>Twenty year old Emma hasn’t left the house since she was attacked as a child. Now, with the impending release of her attacker from prison, Emma knows it’s more important than ever for her to regain control of her life. From her unrelenting nightmares, to her strained relationships, to her crippling agoraphobia, Emma feels as though her life is spiraling out of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her professor, Simon Anderson enters her life, Emma must deal with feelings she has never experienced before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though both she and Simon know their relationship is bordering on inappropriate, neither of them are able to ignore the intense chemistry that is quickly developing between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What was supposed to keep her mind off the attack has left her more confused than ever. When there are so many reasons why you shouldn’t be together, is simply being in love really enough?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is book one in a two book series.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When Sam Raintree goes to work for Bay City Paranormal Investigations, he expects his quiet life to change--he doesn't expect to put his life and sanity on the line, or to fall for a man he can never have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book One in the Bay City Paranormal Investigation series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Raintree has never been normal. All his life, he's experienced things he can't explain. Things that have colored his view of the world and of himself. So taking a job as a paranormal investigator seems like a perfect fit. His new co-workers, he figures, don't have to know he's gay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sam arrives at Oleander House, the site of his first assignment with Bay City Paranormal Investigations, nothing is what he expected. The repetitive yet exciting work, the unusual and violent history of the house, the intensely erotic and terrifying dreams which plague his sleep. But the most unexpected thing is Dr. Bo Broussard, the group's leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment they meet, Sam is strongly attracted to his intelligent, alluring boss. It doesn't take Sam long to figure out that although Bo has led a heterosexual life, he is very much in the closet, and wants Sam as badly as Sam wants him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the investigation of Oleander House progresses and paranormal events in the house escalate, Sam and Bo circle warily around their mutual attraction, until a single night of bloodshed and revelation changes their lives forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this title contains explicit male/male sex, intense violence, and graphic language.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[So I got about 10% into the book when I decided that this will have to be a DNF for me. The blurb sounded so interesting that I was motivated to try this one, but the style isn't clicking with me.

  <description>A Men of Myth Story &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brett Wright and Finn de Morisco come from vastly different worlds. Disowned by his family for being gay, Brett builds both a life on his own terms and walls around his heart. But nothing can prepare him for the evil that stalks him in the night or from discovering the dark secrets of his heritage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The youngest of a doting family, Finn lives a sheltered life that allows him to trust easily and makes him quick to jump to the rescue. While using his knowledge of the supernatural world to help Brett uncover the truth of his ancestry, Finn learns neither his magical life nor falling in love is as simple and risk-free as he believed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New knowledge comes with a price—one that may prove too high for them to pay.</description>

  <description>Attraction for Adam was not a handsome face, a striking smile, or beautiful eyes, but a scent that would drive him to distraction or a voice that could make his heart beat faster. When the combination of the two walked into his life in Luke, Adam couldn’t help but want him. But how was he supposed to know if Luke felt the same attraction? He had no prior experience, no past encounters, nothing to help him. Not even his sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One look at Adam and Luke wanted him. Sensual, gorgeous, kind, with a strength that Luke was drawn to, Adam was everything Luke desired. Being in Adam’s arms, showing him the pleasure of a man’s body, being touched, held, and desired in return, had Luke wanting more, had him wanting what he knew he couldn’t have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It didn’t matter to him that Adam was blind, but Adam deserved more than someone like him. Luke was a man with a broken past and falling in love with Adam was a foolish thing to do, especially because Adam would never love him back if he found out what Luke was hiding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's Note: &lt;em&gt;This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices, voyeurism.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>After a student’s accusation of sexual assault destroyed his reputation, Noah Birchwood left the teaching career he loved. The school system that should have protected him and an ex-lover who should have known better shattered his confidence, and it took Noah six years and another university degree to finally get his life back on track.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He loves his new job as a computer programmer and keeps busy on weekends performing at a drag club with his best friend, Aiden. It’s there that he meets shy, chivalrous Oscar, the owner of the club and, just maybe, the love of Noah’s life. But everything turns upside down when a specter from his former life moves in next door. Noah will have to face his fears and discover the truth about his ordeal if he wants to move past it once and for all and face the future with Oscar at his side.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Night of Cake &amp;amp; Puppets&lt;/em&gt;, Taylor brings to life a night only hinted at in the &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone &lt;/em&gt;trilogy—the magical first date of fan-favorites Zuzana and Mik. Told in alternating perspectives, it’s the perfect love story for fans of the series and new readers alike. Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her “rabid fairy,” her “voodoo eyes” are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or “Violin Boy,” her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to meet him, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. It’s a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winter’s night before finally leading him to the treasure: herself! Violin Boy’s not going to know what hit him.</description>

  <description>Friends since childhood, Anais Darnby and Lindsay Markham have long harbored a secret passion for one another. When they finally confess their love, their future together seems assured, sealed with their searing embrace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a debauched Lindsay is seduced by a scheming socialite, a devastated Anais seeks refuge in another man's bed while Lindsay retreats to the exotic East. There, he is seduced again—this time by the alluring red smoke and sinister beauty of opium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back home, Lindsay's addiction is fed by the vogue for all things Oriental—especially its sensual pleasures—in fashionable London society. In his lucid moments, Lindsay still lusts after Anais, who can neither allow him near nor forget his smoldering touch. Tortured by two obsessions—opium and Anais—Lindsay must ultimately decide which is the one he truly cannot live without.</description>

  <description>What happens when two broken men collide?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And one of them disappears?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Prater has already lost one man to senseless violence. He won't lose another. Calling in all his resources, former blue knights on the Atlanta Police Department, and his own experience as a Vice cop, Marcus desperately searches for the new man in his life, college student and rent boy Ben Danvers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can love survive in the wake of Marcus's worst nightmare?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning. This is the second in a three book series. It is filled with angst, gruff men, and just maybe some hot man-on-man action. Be aware, there IS a third story coming, so don't piss and moan if there is a cliff hanger in your future. You HAVE been warned...</description>

  <description>What happens when two broken men collide?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Prater has spent the last two years of his life existing, ignoring his friends and family because remembering hurts too much. Benjamin Danvers, running from ghosts of his own, has separated himself emotionally from the world. Neither man needs anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When these two men collide again, one life hangs in the balance. Will it break them, or provide more healing than either man thought possible? Friends come together, brotherhood is confirmed, but will it be enough?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caution: Yeah, this is the third in the three story cycle so no more nasty cliffhangers. Hot men may have sex, old friends may bond again, and a few tears may be shed. I promise, it was worth the wait. Oh, and look for Marcus and Benjamin again in August.</description>

  <description>Marcus Prater has his life in order. He's got the man he loves, Benjamin Danvers, living and working with him. He's healed from the bullet that almost stopped his heart. And he's got his best friends back in his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What more could he ask for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Marcus is asked to investigate the disappearance of a young man close to Benjamin, that prompts him to begin the search for his brother too. What he finds changes everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Marcus and Benjamin are back, and hotter for each other than ever before. There's sex, laughs and a few tears. But not necessarily answers. And no cliffhanger. Really. I promise...</description>

  <description>My name is Darwin De Groi, and I’m in love with Peter Forbes. But Pete has this dream of becoming a metaphysical scientist and that means all his time—his attention—is taken up by college and studying. So in order to deal with the pain of watching Peter and never having him I spend most of my time in the Gray Zone, the no-man’s-land between the city of Atlanta and the Dens. There I’m free to drown myself; with drugs, with booze…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the inhuman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lesser-Breds. Kin hybrids. The offspring of Humans and Dragons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then an act of revenge led to a stupid college prank, which put Peter right into my arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A better man would make the right decision and tell Pete no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am so not that man.</description>

  <description>Genre: LGBT Romantic Suspense&lt;br&gt;Length: Novella&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been years since Jonah Levinson has seen his parents. But now he is going to spend Hanukkah with them in order to finally tell them the truth: not only is he gay, but he is a successful author of gay novels and not the struggling (and straight) writer they imagine him to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The holiday starts poorly. A record blizzard delays his flight. The snowstorm locks him and his loud, argumentative relatives in the house. The power fails. And, worst of all, Jonah has to share his room with his childhood rival, the perfect Jewish son, the one he spent his entire life unfavorably compared to: Dr. Ethan Rosenberg, son of his mother's mahjong partner, and apparently God's gift to the Chosen People.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this isn't bad enough, Jonah has to interpret Ethan's strange new fascination with him. Is Ethan flirting? Or is this just another trick to break Jonah's heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a valuable family heirloom is stolen during the festivities and suspicion falls on Jonah, Ethan agrees to help prove Jonah's innocence. They have eight days to do it. But will they solve the crime before the cooking oil -- and everyone's civility -- runs out?</description>

  <description>Terra has never known anything but life aboard the &lt;em&gt;Asherah&lt;/em&gt;, a city-within-a-spaceship that left Earth five hundred years ago in search of refuge. At sixteen, working a job that doesn't interest her, and living with a grieving father who only notices her when he's yelling, Terra is sure that there has to be more to life than what she's got.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she inadvertently witnesses the captain's guard murdering an innocent man, Terra is suddenly thrust into the dark world beneath her ship's idyllic surface. As she's drawn into a secret rebellion determined to restore power to the people, Terra discovers that her choices may determine life or death for the people she cares most about. With mere months to go before landing on the long-promised planet, Terra has to make the decision of a lifetime--one that will determine the fate of her people.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Even a vampire has to face her inner demons…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kat Redding is the very thing she hunts: a vampire, thirsting for blood, capable of killing any creature unlucky enough to get in her path. The difference is, Kat kills her own kind in order to protect human Purebloods. She’s good at what she does. Good enough to earn the nickname Lady Death—and the enmity of every bloodthirsty being around. But now a vampire Count is intent on merging his House with a werewolf cult to create a force of terrifying power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kat can’t allow that to happen. Even if it means taking on a den of weres and a vampire more ruthless than any she’s encountered before. She has the weapons, the skill, and a few allies. But that may not be enough to eliminate the Count before her own dark nature rises to the surface—and costs her whatever is left of her humanity…</description>

  <description>Miles Piekus thought he and Itai would make a great team, despite the infidelities haunting their past. After all, Itai is smoking hot, they’re both driven entrepreneurs, and they love each other. What else did a person need?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, a lot more, apparently, because not only are they no longer passionate, they don’t even share the same passions. Like people, affections change, and Miles wonders if a relationship this broken is truly worth repairing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Itai’s business launch with his ex-boyfriend isn’t helping. And Miles himself has a new business to grow over a busy few weeks where Thanksgiving and Hanukkah collide to form either the best holiday season ever, or a kosher caterer’s worst nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But help comes in the unexpected, ruggedly handsome form of Detective Dominic Delbene, a pickle aficionado with his own ghosts, who stakes out the deli to capture a dangerous drug dealer. As Hanukkah’s eight days come to an end, Miles discovers that Nic is not only good with pickling; he’s good at &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A search for missing children throws a misanthropic human GPS and an obnoxious human torch together in a struggle to survive dangerous conpiracies and each other.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien just wants to be left alone. Too bad his variant talent as a locator makes him the go-to contractor for the government's missing person cases. He can refuse, but it's not so easy when the missing are variant kids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaze Emerson is a sparker. People fear him as much for his ability to call fire as his obnoxious, violent temperament. He's good at what he does, though, and he's intrigued by the quiet man who can find people with his brain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conspiracies, treachery, and wild rumors are only the start. First Damien and Blaze have to survive each other.</description>

  <description>I love two men. I screw two men. I am in a relationship with them both, and they are both aware there is another. That is all they need to know, that is all I let them know. They don’t need to know a name; they don’t need to know anything but that they are not alone in my heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have accepted the situation. Stewart, because his life is too busy for the sort of obligations that are required in a relationship. Paul, because he loves me too much to tell me no. And because my sexual appetite is such that one man has trouble keeping up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we exist, two parallel relationships, each running their own course, with no need for intersection or conflict. It works for us, for them, and for me. I don’t expect it to be a long-term situation. I know there is an expiration date on the easy perfection of our lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should have paid more attention, should have looked around and noticed the woman who watched it all. She sat in the background and waited, tried to figure me out. Saw my two relationships, the love between us, and the moment that it all fell apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She hates me. &lt;br&gt;I don’t even know she exists. &lt;br&gt;She loves them. I love them. &lt;br&gt;And they love me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EVERYTHING else hangs in the balance.</description>

  <description>It begins with a 3:00 a.m. telephone call. On one end is Terry Bachelder, a closeted teacher. On the other, the suicidal teenage son of the local preacher. When Terry fails to prevent disaster, grief rips the small town of Crystal Falls apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the epicenter of the tragedy, seventeen-year-old Jonah Riverside tries to make sense of it all. Finding Daniel’s body leaves him struggling to balance his sexual identity with his faith, while his church, led by the Reverend Isaac Thompson, mounts a crusade to destroy Terry, whom Isaac believes corrupted his son and caused the boy to take his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having quietly crushed on his teacher for years, Jonah is determined to clear Terry’s name. That quest leads him to Eric Jacobs, Daniel’s true secret lover, and to get involved in Eric’s plan to shake up their small-minded town. Meanwhile, Rev. Thompson struggles to make peace between his religious convictions and the revelation of his son's homosexuality. If he can’t, he leaves the door open for the devil—and for a second tragedy to follow.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Scarlet Letter meets Minority Report in bestselling author Sophie Jordan's chilling new novel about a teenage girl who is ostracized when her genetic test proves she's destined to become a murderer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Davy Hamilton's tests come back positive for Homicidal Tendency Syndrome (HTS)-aka the kill gene-she loses everything. Her boyfriend ditches her, her parents are scared of her, and she can forget about her bright future at Juilliard. Davy doesn't feel any different, but genes don't lie. One day she will kill someone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Sean, a fellow HTS carrier, can relate to her new life. Davy wants to trust him; maybe he's not as dangerous as he seems. Or maybe Davy is just as deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first in a two-book series, Uninvited tackles intriguing questions about free will, identity, and human nature. Steeped in New York Times bestselling author Sophie Jordan's trademark mix of gripping action and breathless romance, this suspenseful tale is perfect for fans of James Patterson, Michelle Hodkin, and Lisa McMann.</description>

  <description>New from #1 New York Times bestselling author Meg Cabot, a dark, fantastical story about this world . . . and the underworld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though she tries returning to the life she knew before the accident, Pierce can't help but feel at once a part of this world, and apart from it. Yet she's never alone . . . because someone is always watching her. Escape from the realm of the dead is impossible when someone there wants you back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now she's moved to a new town. Maybe at her new school, she can start fresh. Maybe she can stop feeling so afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only she can't. Because even here, he finds her. That's how desperately he wants her back. She knows he's no guardian angel, and his dark world isn't exactly heaven, yet she can't stay away . . . especially since he always appears when she least expects it, but exactly when she needs him most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if she lets herself fall any further, she may just find herself back in the one place she most fears: the Underworld.</description>

  <description>WARNING! This story contains lots and lots of Gay Sex. If Gay Sex is too much for you, DO NOT read. Otherwise, enjoy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the love between a free man and a slave survive the cruelties of their world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Synd Island is an extraordinary, seemingly idyllic place. Resources are bountiful, and a number of people can be seen wearing nothing but a piece of cloth on, or even stark naked everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Guy Tenant accepts his appointment as Admin Manager and gets shipped to the island's office branch, he makes the grave mistake of setting out to explore the island...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;... where he finds out the hard way why so many people are walking around scantily clad or naked. He is tricked into being a slave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the midst of his great suffering, he finds his little piece of paradise in Javier, a deputy in the company Guy is still working for, now as a slave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love is the only consolation for Guy's unfair trial, but will it save him from the brutality of his situation? And can it even survive their opposing status?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story is also known as "No Choice"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sample:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raul, his new master, delivered twenty incredibly hard strokes of the cane, starting at the shoulders and finishing behind the knees. When released he fell to the floor, sobbing as hard as he had ever done in his life. The pain was horrendous and his pleas for mercy had achieved nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If you ever misbehave again, I will substitute a whip and I will have my overseer apply it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At that comment a big man walked in, clad in just small shorts and a T shirt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Samson, take this miserable creature away, he'll sleep in a cage tonight, but feed him first, and then hose him down."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life, as Guy knew it, had changed forever...</description>

  <description>Turner Michaels is an idealistic junior enlisted communicator that wants nothing more than to successfully execute his duties. After being transferred to a light armored reconnaissance unit in the middle of the Mojave Desert, the young U.S. Marine starts to feel a bit overwhelmed and out of place from his usual role of support - that is until he is reunited with his old friend Jace Sozio. Reconnecting with one another is simple, but neither of them could have imagined the intense yet awkward attraction that would grow between them. Though admitting these feelings to one another poses a dilemma for the men, as neither wants it to threaten their close friendship. Taking things to a whole new level raises a number of other questions as well. First and foremost, would their peers accept them, or would they have to forever hide their relationship? And admitting their true feelings for one another is easier said than done. Their harsh supervisor is demanding and makes life miserable for the pair, and they also have a number of very good (though sometimes annoying) friends that make them question if they even need enemies. But with the help of their family and inspiring leaders the two will discover that loyalty and support are stronger than bigotry and misperception. Proving that the Corps indeed is a sacred brotherhood where men can trust one another with their very lives.</description>

  <description>On the outside, Dina Demille is the epitome of normal. She runs a quaint Victorian Bed and Breakfast in a small Texas town, owns a Shih Tzu named Beast, and is a perfect neighbor, whose biggest problem should be what to serve her guests for breakfast. But Dina is...different: Her broom is a deadly weapon; her Inn is magic and thinks for itself. Meant to be a lodging for otherworldly visitors, the only permanent guest is a retired Galactic aristocrat who can’t leave the grounds because she’s responsible for the deaths of millions and someone might shoot her on sight. Under the circumstances, "normal" is a bit of a stretch for Dina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, something with wicked claws and deepwater teeth has begun to hunt at night....Feeling responsible for her neighbors, Dina decides to get involved. Before long, she has to juggle dealing with the annoyingly attractive, ex-military, new neighbor, Sean Evans—an alpha-strain werewolf—and the equally arresting cosmic vampire soldier, Arland, while trying to keep her inn and its guests safe. But the enemy she’s facing is unlike anything she’s ever encountered before. It’s smart, vicious, and lethal, and putting herself between this creature and her neighbors might just cost her everything.</description>

  <description>Special Agent John Flynn is everything Jerry Parker is not: dangerously handsome, coolly charismatic, and respected by his peers. Special Agent Parker is dedicated and meticulous, but his abrasive personality has given him a reputation for being difficult. When new information on a cold case appears, Parker is assigned to work with Flynn, and the sparks fly as their investigative styles clash. Contact with a strange artifact changes everything when it bestows unusual and unpredictable powers on Flynn... and the two men must learn to trust each other before a killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>Lushly written with rich and vivid characters, SANTA OLIVIA is Jacqueline Carey's take on comic book superheroes and the classic werewolf myth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Loup Garron was born and raised in Santa Olivia, an isolated, disenfranchised town next to a US military base inside a DMZ buffer zone between Texas and Mexico. A fugitive "Wolf-Man" who had a love affair with a local woman, Loup's father was one of a group of men genetically-manipulated and used by the US government as a weapon. The "Wolf-Men" were engineered to have superhuman strength, speed, sensory capability, stamina, and a total lack of fear, and Loup, named for and sharing her father's wolf-like qualities, is marked as an outsider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After her mother dies, Loup goes to live among the misfit orphans at the parish church, where they seethe from the injustices visited upon the locals by the soldiers. Eventually, the orphans find an outlet for their frustrations: They form a vigilante group to support Loup Garron who, costumed as their patron saint, Santa Olivia, uses her special abilities to avenge the town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aware that she could lose her freedom, and possibly her life, Loup is determined to fight to redress the wrongs her community has suffered. And like the reincarnation of their patron saint, she will bring hope to all of Santa Olivia.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;No safe word can protect the heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Infamous erotica author and accomplished dominatrix Nora Sutherlin is doing something utterly out of character: hiding. While her longtime lover, Søren—whose fetishes, if exposed, would be his ruin—is under scrutiny pending a major promotion, Nora's lying low and away from temptation in the lap of luxury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her host, the wealthy and uninhibited Griffin Fiske, is thrilled to have Nora stay at his country estate, especially once he meets her traveling companion. Young, inexperienced and angelically beautiful, Michael has become Nora's protégé, and this summer with Griffin is going to be his training, where the hazing never ends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while her flesh is willing, Nora's mind is wandering. To thoughts of Søren, her master, under investigation by a journalist with an ax to grind. And to another man from Nora's past, whose hold on her is less bruising, but whose secrets are no less painful. It's a summer that will prove the old adage: love hurts.</description>

  <description>Are you straight? Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt;? What would you do if you were down-and-out and desperate? What would you do—how far would you go—for FAME? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out just how far, and just how low, Johnny Gellis is willing to go in SUICIDE RIDE: THE PLATINUM MAN. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hitch your lift with this man &lt;br&gt;You'll have your blood on your hand …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AN OLDER MAN WITH NO FUTURE, AND NOTHING TO LIVE FOR … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman Dimond is the Silver Man, an over-the-hill LA-based rock 'n roll record producer who has seen better days. A set-for-life bisexual with a hard spot for younger men, he squanders his nights hustling cash-strapped gay-for-pay desperadoes who swagger into his den on the Sunset Strip, looking for one-off love in all the right places. Lonely and at loose ends, he longs for a worthy dance partner, but despairs of finding him … Until one night, when he least expects it, in waltzes … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A YOUNGER MAN WITH A PAST, AND A DEATH WISH … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnny Gellis is the Platinum Man, a beautiful straight wreck who needs fixing—and who wants exactly what Norman Dimond has to give: a platform, a stage. But does he want it badly enough? Desperate to outrun his demons, he's driving himself crazy, and is heading straight for the edge. Can Norman save him, before it's too late? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TWO LIVES ABOUT TO COLLIDE IN A SUICIDE RIDE … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Norman meets Johnny, their heavy-metal fenders bend, sending the male-on-male sparks flying. Johnny's number-one-with-a-bullet hit "Suicide Ride" blows Norman's mind, while his number-99-with-an-anchor tattoo pricks up more than just his ears. And though this hell-bent, cliff-hanging headbanger is the man-boy of his dreams, keeping him on course turns out to be a waking nightmare. Can Norman do it? Can he put him on top while stopping him from breaking down and destroying them both? The deeper Dimond digs, the darker it gets; and as the secrets and suspense multiply, so, too, do the lies. Johnny is hiding something, that much Norman is sure of; and what's worse, he begins to feel the tug of even darker and ever more violent undertows—sinister, malevolent drags that Gellis himself cannot spin-rinse away.</description>

  <description>A vacation fling. No complications. No connections. And no regrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trauma surgeon Jae Sun Kim has just lost the job he wanted more than anything else in his life. Looking for a way to hit the reset button, he takes a scuba vacation. He didn't plan on seasickness, or a dive master who is sex-on-the-beach personified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane McCormack's tendency to drift away from complicated situations has landed him a job as a dive master in Belize, which isn't as glamorous as it sounds. But with the big three-oh looming, asking his parents to bail him out again isn't an option. The job isn't without its perks, though, and as soon as he figures a way to keep that hot but arrogant ass of a doctor from tossing his cookies over the side of the boat, he plans to flirt the control freak out of his brittle shell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The close quarters on the ship generate more heat than either expects, but a vacation fling is all that's in the plans. An unexpected adventure leaves them changed in ways that make it impossible to go back to their old lives. The risks they'll both have to take could leave them with nothing but more scars, or the best souvenir of all.</description>

  <description>For Damien, passion brings ecstasy, betrayal and danger that almost cost him his life. At the lowest point in his life, he discovers that true passion and loyalty have been staring him in the face all along. There is one problem he must surmount first, Dax is straight and carries a lot of baggage. What neither of them realize is that sometimes passion can also bring healing. That is if one is brave enough to take the first step. In a perfect passion, one must be willing to take the risk.</description>

  <description>Jesse Calhoun met Devin Palmer five years ago, in front of a Christmas tree at a friend's party. It was Jesse's first holiday alone, away from home. Devin didn't have much of a home to go back to. They found a way to make the season brighter, together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four years ago, Jesse brought Devin to his parents' house and came out to them. It wasn't all roses, but his family came around, and Devin has spent each holiday with the Calhouns since then. Jesse really loves sharing Christmas with his family, and sharing his family with Devin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So he isn't prepared to hear his mom say, “I don't want Devin to come to the house for Christmas Eve this year.” Suddenly it's not smooth sailing, keeping peace with the family he was born with.</description>

  <description>When Shanti attempts to ski an icy black diamond trail beyond his ability, he suffers a major wipe out, shooting off into the woods and injuring himself. But when a stranger who's been watching him scrambles off the trail to help, he meets Mick Paulson, native Vermonter and the most gorgeous man Shanti has ever seen. Smitten with the alluring stranger, Shanti asks him for date, but quickly learns his brawny rescuer isn't exactly the dating type. But then Mick offers him a compromise. He's willing to give a full scale, romantic dinner a try, if Shanti agrees to venture into Mick's world for a night – a place where lust runs high and inhibitions run low. Through this bargain, they both learn where their edges lie, and what happens when they step beyond them.</description>

  <description>The ghost of Christmas Past... If Charles prefers leather to tinsel, that's okay. Nicky is still sure he can teach his master to love Christmas with the aid of a perfect gift. Just because Charles doesn't see any point in making a fuss about Christmas, that doesn't mean he can't tolerate Nicky's passion for tinsel and holly. He's never forbidden his pet from enjoying any of his Christmas traditions and he thinks that's enough. Nicky has one ambition to give his master a perfect Christmas. He's willing to do anything to make that happen even if it means taking risks and asking his master for special privileges - even if it means inviting a third man into their bed. The Spirit of Christmas Past isn't used to visiting Christmases that involve quite so much nudity, passion or kinky sex. Leading a dominant man like Charles through the Christmases isn't easy and keeping his eyes off the frequently naked Nicky is impossible. Still, all the spirit can do is enjoy the show because his job is to bring lovers together and fade away inconspicuously. That's the plan. However, if someone suddenly wants to thank him, who is he to say no? This story has a hot male gay menage scene and some BDSM play.</description>

  <description>Twenty-one-year-old Lane Moredock finally has a normal life. Six months after he was wrongly made a suspect in his parents' ponzi scheme, he's settled down with his older boyfriend, Derek, and is working and attending school. But his happiness is threatened when his mother launches a Christmastime PR campaign to help appeal her prison sentence, and asks introverted Lane to be part of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derek Fields has his hands full taking Santa photos, bird-sitting his sister's foul-mouthed macaw, and helping Lane prepare for a television interview neither of them wants him to do. As he eases Lane through his anxiety, he worries that Lane sees him as a caretaker rather than a boyfriend, and that their age difference really does matter. He and Lane compensate for the stress in their lives by taking their D/s relationship to new levels--a relationship that Lane's mother insists he should be ashamed of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Christmas draws nearer, the pressure builds. Pushy elves. Snarky subs. A bad fight. A parrot in peril. How the hell is Derek going to give Lane a perfect Christmas when the Moredock legacy threatens to pull them apart before the new year?</description>

  <description>Lane Daniels loves his job, working as a foreman on the south Texas ranch gives him the type of satisfaction he’s always craved, but the owner of Crazy Hills ranch, Gresh Hamilton Miller the third, has woven his way under Lane’s skin, leaving Lane crazy for the man’s touch. But doing the boss is out of the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gresh wants more from Lane than his ability to handle livestock, he wants it all. Lane won’t give him the time of day so he forces the issue, setting up a date that Lane believes to be a business meeting. Alone together, Lane and Gresh ignite in a flash of passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when it feels like there could be something more between Lane and Gresh, the new doctor in town, Riley, sets his sights on Lane. Riley chases hard after him, insinuating himself in Lane’s life, highlighting Gresh’s faults. But Gresh won’t give up without a fight. Will Lane and Gresh be able to survive the intrusion, or will Riley be the one walking away with Lane's heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Texas Rough is the first book in Sara York’s Texas series. Texas Hard and Texas Twist are next in line. Get ready to get your cowboy on and go for a rough ride.</description>

  <description>Logan Marshall moves to New York to be a social worker where he feels he's needed most. Logan's always had it good. His Daddy is a preacher, sure, but he preaches a laid back, tolerant congregation who accepted Logan's sexuality gracefully.  He's from a ranch in nowhere, Texas, which makes him a hot ticket in the clubs with his tight, work strengthened body and his cute accent. He's out of his element in New York, not looking for Mr. Right Now but Mr. Right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gianni Rodriguez grew up in Brooklyn. Nothing could be further from the way he was raised than innocent, good hearted Logan was. Gianni is fascinated that people like Logan even exist. And parents that not only are God-fearing, but also accepting?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As second in command of Los Cuervos, his brother's not-so-merry band of drug runners and pimps, Gianni's life would be in serious jeopardy if anyone ever knew the truth. That's why his growing attachment for Logan is a bad thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Logan's work collides violently with Gianni's life, Gianni has to decide if the man is worth risking everything, even his family-- the man that may not even want him once he realizes what a monster the man he's been sleeping with really is. Could Logan be Gianni's reason to go straight? Or will they both go straight to an unmarked grave?</description>

  <description>Brin and his Dom, Ferg, have enjoyed a fun, sexy domestic discipline relationship for years. Brin knows his role—flamboyant, fabulous brat—and Ferg knows it's his job to play the big bad Dom, giving Brin the punishment he desperately craves. When Brin is tasked with dressing his new friend Lane Moredock for a date with Brin's ex, Derek, he's excited—fashion is what he knows best, and Lane is going to look stunning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what should be a fun afternoon takes a serious turn when Brin sees that Lane has been injured, and Lane's reluctance to tell Brin the truth about it makes Brin start to question who he is, why things didn't work with Derek, and what people really think of him. Is he just a flittery, glittery fashion fairy? Or does he mean something more to the people he loves? And can he find a way to bring these doubts up with Ferg—or is Ferg going to have to Top his way to the bottom of this?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;McKenzie Lewis has a gift. It allows her access to a world few have seen, and even fewer can comprehend. It’s her secret. And it exists in the shadows… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McKenzie was a normal college student, save for one little twist: she’s a shadow reader, someone who can both see the fae and track their movements between our world and the Realm. It’s a gift for which she has been called insane, one for which she has risked family and friends—and one that has now plunged her into a brutal civil war between the fae.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the reign of the king and his vicious general at an end, McKenzie hoped to live a more normal life while exploring her new relationship with Aren, the rebel fae who has captured her heart. But when her best friend, Paige, disappears McKenzie knows her wish is, for now, just a dream. McKenzie is the only one who can rescue her friend, but if she’s not careful, her decisions could cost the lives of everyone she’s tried so hard to save.&lt;br&gt;</description>

She’s got a kid of her own, and a job as a firefighter that could end her life without a moment’s notice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are people who have had enough of Michael’s defiance, his family’s “bad luck.” Before he knows it, Michael’s enemies have turned into the Merricks’ enemies, and they’re armed for war. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re not interested in surrender. But Michael isn’t the white flag type anyway. There will be blood on the ground tonight…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; **NEW ADULT** &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're looking for a heartwarming story about a girl who falls deeply in love with a troubled boy who changes her life--a sob story with pretty metaphors and a million ways that'll tell you how "broken" she is, STOP. Don't read another word of this.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; I'm not that type of girl. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Emerald Anderson and I'm not going to bullshit you: I flunked out of college after my sophomore year, I've been fired from every job I've ever taken, and I've never had a fully functioning relationship in my life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wish I could say that I had a cheerleader in my corner, someone who says, "No, Emerald--You're great and you are good at something!" but I don't. My grandparents are completely oblivious to my life, and my mother's dying words to me were "You're going to end up just like me one day. A beautiful nothing."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; She was right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I decide to start my life over and take two jobs that will forever change me--one from the inside, and one from the outside, I keep my mother's words close to my heart so I can keep the sexy and mysterious Carter Black away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's the first man who's ever pursued me, the first man who seems bent on finding out why I am the way I am, but he's wasting his time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm not broken. I don't need to be fixed. I'm perfectly fine being a beautiful failure...</description>

  <description>Out-and-regretting-it comprehensive attendee Jayden Phillips turns his cast-iron plans for life upside-down by falling in love with private-school violinist Darren Peace, a sardonic boy with the craziest hair Jayden's ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all is not what it seems, and Jayden's bullying problem becomes meaningless when he is confronted with what the music does to Darren. How do you stop a dangerous depression rooted in the same thing that makes someone what they are? Dark moods, blank apathy, and the undertow of self-loathing all simmer beneath Darren's dry and beautiful veneer, and Jayden feels powerless to stop them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a mugging gone wrong takes the music forcibly away, and Jayden is finally given the chance to change Darren's life -- and, quite literally, his mind.</description>

  <description>City planner Remy McIntosh is looking forward to spending the holidays with his lover, architect Lane Anders. For the past six months, he’s been planning the perfect getaway -- two weeks in a forest cabin at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remy also has a special gift he can't wait to give Lane on Christmas Day: a wedding ring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Remy's ex-wife changes her Christmas plans at the last minute, and asks him to take care of their eight-year-old son, Braeden. Remy loves spending time with his son, but balks at the idea of taking a child along on vacation. The main problem is that Braden has never met Lane, and doesn't know his father is gay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lane is ready to take his relationship with Remy to the next level, and has a secret Christmas gift of his own. Having a young boy along will put a crimp in their plans, to be sure, but Lane wants to be a part of every aspect of Remy's life, and that includes Braden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How will Braden deal with meeting the "other man" in his father's life? What happens when Remy’s romantic holiday for two must also include his son?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There’s always one more grave to dig.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lately, life has been unnaturally calm for vampires Cat Crawfield and her husband Bones.  They should have known better than to relax their guard, because a shocking revelation sends them back into action to stop an all-out war…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A rogue CIA agent is involved in horrifying secret activities that threaten to raise tensions between humans and the undead to dangerous heights.  Now Cat and Bones are in a race against time to save their friends from a fate worse than death…because the more secrets they unravel, the deadlier the consequences.  And if they fail, their lives—and those of everyone they hold dear— will be hovering on the edge of the grave.</description>

  <description>The Mordred Saga: Book One &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mordred Pendragon, the Bastard Prince, has done a Bad Thing—again. Exiled to Canada for seven years, he has to find a job to pay his bills. For reasons he refuses to reveal, Mordred decides “Software Engineer” has a nice ring to it. And though experience with “killing the Once and Future King, my father” and “that time in feudal Japan” makes for a poor résumé, he is hired by a small tech startup in Toronto. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the midst of dealing with a crippling caffeine addiction and learning C++, Mordred thinks he has finally found someone to anchor him to the world of the living: Alan, the company’s offsite lead developer. Except that Alan might not be a "living" entity at all—he may, in fact, be the world's first strong AI. Or a demon that mistook a Windows install for the highway to Hell. Or, just maybe, the ghost of Alan Turing, currently inhabiting a laptop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mordred's attempts to figure out his love life are hampered by constant interference from the Inquisitors of the Securitates Arcanarum, corporate espionage, real espionage, a sysadmin bent on enslaving the world, and Marketing's demands that Mordred ship software to the Russian Federation. Then Alan gets himself kidnapped. To save him, Mordred must ally himself with the company’s CEO, who will stop at nothing to rescue her lead developer so he can get back to work. But the Prince doesn’t just want to rescue Alan, he wants a Happily Ever After—and he will travel beyond Death itself to get one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad Alan is perfectly happy as a computer.</description>

  <description>Chris Fletcher and Ian McCallum started out as a hook-up: no names, no strings, no future. But fate seemed determined to throw them together and each time was better than the last. Ian couldn't help starting to think about forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris knew he shouldn't take the chance. His life was a web of lies, from providing his Navy fiancee Jenny with a beard to the details of his fictional childhood. Ian would hate being deceived and a crash was inevitable. But Chris had never felt so deeply about a man before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the lies came out, Ian did walk away. But fate wasn't done with them. Because Chris's life was in danger, and only Ian was close enough to help. Now Ian had to decide where the deeper truths lay, and whether what he felt for Chris was still strong enough to risk his safety and his heart.</description>

  <description>Deviana Morris isn't your average mercenary. She has plans. Big ones. And a ton of ambition. One of those is going to get her killed one day - but not just yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not when she just got a job on a tiny trade ship with a nasty reputation for surprises. The Glorious Fool isn't misnamed: it likes to get into trouble. And with a reputation for bad luck that makes one year as security detail on this ship equal to five years everywhere else - Devi knows she's found the perfect way to get the jump on the next part of her Plan. But the Fool doesn't give up its secrets without a fight, and one year might be more than even Devi can handle.</description>

  <description>Two promising college athletes meet, each needing something only the other can give him…  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Roger and Brian lock eyes on the first day of school, a friendship is born.  Both men are hungry for connection – Brian needs the acceptance, encouragement and support he never had growing up, and when he finds out his new best friend is gay, it brings his own identity into question.  Roger needs a big brother, a best friend, but that will never be enough, especially not when he’s this close to big, strong, handsome Brian.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And both men want something more – careers as professional athletes.  For Roger, the demands of the closet, the need to reject the love of a man to fulfill his love of the game, will be a crushing burden.  For Brian, his downfall will be the substances he uses to get an edge over the competition, and to suppress his gnawing self-doubt and guilt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One set of desires will bring them together, the other will force them apart…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just give me another minute, Brian appealed.  But his feet didn’t listen, kept propelling him forward, his hand went to the door handle.  I’m not ready.&lt;br&gt;It didn’t matter, he knew.  He was here, the die was cast, as Caesar had said.  He opened the door and walked in.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at them, he told himself.  Brainiacs.  What are you doing here?  It was Cal State Berkeley, man.  Not Party Hearty State College, where maybe he should have gone.  Not Lessing College, where he’d at least been able to keep his scholastic head above water.  He had a year of sitting out ahead of him, a year in academia alone for the first time in his life.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was nobody with a hand on his shoulder, nobody to whisper, “You belong here.”  And when he’d made the change and it was too late to unchange it, his blood went ice cold and he thought, What have I done?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone in the classroom was in their own little world, not even looking up at the new guy.  Nobody looks at anybody, he thought, anywhere ever.  Trying to make eye contact with people on campus was like a contact sport where the goal was to avoid contact.  Almost nobody wanted to look at you, nod, smile, say “Hey,” just be…civilized.  Like you were going to ask them for spare change, or beg them to join your cult.  It was the first time in his life he’d been somewhere he didn’t know anyone.  And it sucked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one guy in the classroom looked at him right away.  A fellow jock, no doubt – another guy always watching the patterns, the movements, making sure no detail of the action escaped his attention.  Instinct or ingrained, at this point in their lives it didn’t matter, it was habit, permanent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The guy nodded, Brian nodded back.  The desk on his left was empty, and Brian took it.  Something tense unknotted inside him, his first friendly moment of the day, of his new life, something he’d needed like a glass of water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hey, I’m Roger,” Roger said, offering his hand.  The guy looked familiar to Brian, his dark hair and big blue eyes, with the ultra-white sclera of a clean-living man, the pale skin of someone who either spent this last summer indoors or had sensitive skin.  He looked to be just short of Brian’s own height of six foot four, but not as beefy as Brian.  A firm grip, a big hand, a really big hand.  Meaty and work-toughened, like his own.  Football, Brian thought.  Was he a wide receiver?  I feel like I should know who he is…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I’m Brian.”  Roger looked at Brian, at his serious handsome face, tanned from a summer outdoors, took in his dark hair and dark eyes, felt his grip match Roger’s own.  Put it back, he told himself.  But “it” was out, he was young and horny and this guy was…hot.  He’s a big bastard, 240 at least.  All muscle, heroic shoulders and chest.  Rolling on top of you, wrestling with you, pinning you down, one of the one percent of guys in the world who are bigger than you, who can do that, win that fight, the fight you’d put up to make him prove his worth, all the while wanting to lose, refusing to lose, thrilled to lose…</description>

  <description>Vampire bachelor Samson can't get it up anymore. Not even his shrink can help him. That changes when the lovely mortal auditor Delilah tumbles into his arms after a seemingly random attack. Suddenly there's nothing wrong with his hydraulics - that is, as long as Delilah is the woman in his arms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His scruples about taking Delilah to bed vanish when his shrink suggests it's the only way to cure his problem. Thinking all he needs is one night with her, Samson indulges in a night of pleasure and passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, another attack on Delilah and a dead body later, and Samson has his hands full: not only with trying to hide the fact he's a vampire, but also with finding out what secrets Delilah harbors for somebody to want her harm.</description>

  <description>Laying hands upon the injured and dying, Avry of Kazan assumes their wounds and diseases into herself. But rather than being honoured for her skills, she is hunted. Healers like Avry are accused of spreading the plague that has decimated the Territories, leaving the survivors in a state of chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stressed and tired from hiding, Avry is abducted by a band of rogues who, shockingly, value her gift above the golden bounty offered for her capture. Their leader an enigmatic captor-protector with powers of his own is unequivocal in his demands: Avry must heal a plague-stricken prince, the leader of a campaign against her people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they traverse the daunting Nine Mountains, beset by mercenaries and magical dangers, Avry must decide who is worth healing and what is worth dying for.</description>

  <description>Ewan is one of Boston’s leading genealogy experts. When a would-be bridegroom comes looking for confirmation that there are no skeletons in his ancestral closet, Ewan considers turning the job down. Trey is a jerk of the highest order and yet Ewan experiences an infuriating attraction that’s easy to justify. Trey’s exactly his type—a carbon copy of the man Ewan’s been looking for his entire life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harder to explain is the sense of recognition that leaves Ewan speechless the moment Trey steps into his office. Or the stomach-churning sensation at the thought of casting the job aside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trey gets more appealing by the day, leaving Ewan struggling with forbidden desire for his client. Desire not helped by strange voyeuristic dreams that have started to haunt his sleep. Dreams that appear to be an echo of the past…</description>

  <description>Prince of the Night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He came to her in the night, a predator -- strength and power chiseled his features. The seduction was deep and elemental; he affected her soul. His need. His darkness. His terrible haunting loneliness. Her senses aroused, she craved the dangerous force of his body. Burned for him. And he had only touched her with his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady of the Light&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She came to him at dawn, his bleakest hour. As the beast raged inside him, threatening to consume him, he vented his centuries-old despair in an anguished cry that filled the waning night. And she answered, a ray of light, piercing his darkness. A beautiful angel. Her compassion, courage, and innocence awakened in him an exquisite longing and tenderness. He knew he must possess her, for only she could tame his savage side and lift the dark shadow from his soul. Apart they were desolate, bereft. Intertwined physically and spiritually, they could heal one another and experience an eternity of nights filled with love.</description>

  <description>The classified experiment is the brainchild of renowned scientist Peter Whitney and his brilliant daughter, Lily. Created to enhance the psychic abilities of an elite squadron, it can transform their natural mental powers into a unique military weapon. But something goes wrong. In the isolated underground labs, the men have been dying-victims of bizarre accidents. Captain Ryland Miller knows he is next. When Dr. Whitney himself is murdered, Ryland has only one person left to trust: the beautiful Lily. Possessed of an uncanny sixth sense herself, Lily shares Ryland's every new fear, every betrayal, every growing suspicion, and every passionate beat of the heart. Together, they will be drawn deeper into the labyrinth of her father's past and closer to a secret that someone would kill to keep hidden.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; He’s exquisitely hot. Exquisitely tousled. Exquisitely screwed in the head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cammibelle Hicks just wants to survive her first year of college. Desperate to forget her troubled past, she throws herself into her degree and book review blog. So what if her life is one long tumblr page of grumpy cat GIFs? She doesn’t need to get out more, and she definitely doesn’t need a man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter von Styles approaches life like he’s spoiling for a fight: with a tempting scowl. A cage-fighting, ex-rocker billionaire, it’s unclear why Hunter’s at college. Frankly, it makes no sense. Then Cammie falls into him—literally—at a party, and he’s obsessed. He needs her more than a moist towelette at a barbecue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Cammie’s friends warn her against Hunter, she can’t resist his charms; especially not when he buys her shoes. And GoodReads. And a unicorn. But when her handsome best friend, medieval reenactor Archer Riddick, makes a play for her heart—and challenges Hunter to a jousting match—it turns out that Hunter has demons of his own. Demons that aren’t real ones, but metaphorical ones—which are MUCH WORSE, when you think about it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Hunter and Cammie on an emotionally exhausting journey into love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And co-dependence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And probably therapy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;FBI agent and psychic, Brianna Reece, descends from an ancient and powerful bloodline of witches, only she doesn’t know it. But now that legacy has come back to bite her—literally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the shadows of night in Denver Colorado, a serial killer is hunting women, and FBI agent Brianna Reece is hunting the killer. Unlike any case she’s worked before, Brianna can’t ignore the prickling at the back of her neck when she glimpses the resemblance she shares with the victims. The investigation begins to touch even closer to home when it is revealed that all of the victims were also psychic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicating matters further, Brianna is captivated by the FBI’s prime suspect Nathan Donovan. Though she senses he is hiding something from her, the attraction she feels for him is compelling, and unlike anything she’s ever experienced. Through a chance twist of fate, Nathan learns of Brianna’s ancestry and is forced to divulge secrets to Brianna that will change her life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she learns that the killer is an evil vampire, and he’s now set his sights on her, Nathan alone holds the key to awakening her dormant powers. Now he must race to teach her how to control her emergent gifts before she becomes the next victim.</description>

  <description>Paul Hannon moved to Tucker Springs for his girlfriend, but she's left him with a house he can't afford and a pantry full of useless gadgets. All Paul wants is to get back to normal, even if he's not sure what that is anymore. When he wanders into Tucker Pawn for a gift to win her back, he meets El Rozal, pawn shop owner and all-around cynic. El Rozal doesn't do relationships, especially not with clueless straight boys still pining for their ex. El may make his living dealing in castoffs, but that doesn't apply to men. Still, when Paul starts clearing out his old life, pawning kitchen equipment he never wanted in the first place, El is drawn to Paul in spite of himself. Paul and El have nothing in common except a past full of disappointments. There's no reason to believe the two of them could fit, but in El's line of work, one man's junk is another man's treasure. When it comes to love, El and Paul may learn that secondhand doesn't mean second best. This title is part of the Tucker Springs universe.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Under the rule of science, there are no witch burnings allowed, no water trials or public lynchings. In return, the average law-abiding, solid citizen has little to worry about from the things that go bump in the night. Sometimes I wish I was an average citizen...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mechanic Mercy Thompson has friends in low places-and in dark ones. And now she owes one of them a favor. Since she can shapeshift at will, she agrees to act as some extra muscle when her vampire friend Stefan goes to deliver a message to another of his kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this new vampire is hardly ordinary-and neither is the demon inside of him.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I could smell her fear, and it satisfied something deep inside me that had been writhing under her cool, superior gaze. I curled my upper lip so she could get a good look at my sharp teeth. I might only weigh thirty or so pounds in my coyote shape, but I was a predator...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mechanic Mercy Thompson can shift her shape - but not her loyalty. When her former boss and mentor is arrested for murder and left to rot behind bars by his own kind, it's up to Mercy to clear his name, whether he wants her to or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mercy's loyalty is under pressure from other directions, too. Werewolves are not known for their patience, and if Mercy can't decide between the two she cares for, Sam and Adam may make the choice for her...</description>

  <description>By day, Mercy is a car mechanic in the sprawling Tri-Cities of Eastern Washington. By night, she explores her preternatural side. As a shapeshifter with some unique talents, Mercy has often found herself having to maintain a tenuous harmony between the human and the not so human. This time she may get more than she bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marsilia, the local Vampire Queen, has learned that Mercy crossed her by slaying a member of her clan—and she's out for blood. But since Mercy is protected from direct reprisal by the werewolf pack (and her close relationship with its sexy Alpha), it won't be Mercy's blood Marsilia is after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It'll be her friends'.</description>

  <description>Charles is a professor, an expatriate Brit, and a man with a past. He's put that aside, living the peaceful life he thinks he needs. He figures he's happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until he meets Gray Collins, that is. He's a student, and even though Gray waits until after his class with Charles ends to make his move, Charles decides he's not about to get involved. Gray is stubborn, persisting until Charles can't resist, which is when Charles' past comes to light. Will Gray be able to accept all that he learns, and convince Charles to let him get as close as he wants to?</description>

  <description>Two cops walk into a bar. Mason, the bartender, waits for the punch line, because no way in hell are these ridiculously hot men real cops. They’re straight out of a cop-fetish fantasy. But he quickly learns that Jack and Gray are the real deal, and they want him in the worst way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as a night of hot, three-way sex becomes a lot more. The two cops fulfill Mason’s submissive fantasies, but they also meet a more basic need, comfort. They want to take care of Mason, to offer him unconditional friendship, but their concern for him unnerves Mason more than even the kinkiest sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find happiness with his new partners, Mason must change his belief that love is as much a fantasy as a pair of gorgeous, handcuff-wielding cops landing in his bed.</description>

  <description>All it took to destroy Andy Nocera's seemingly perfect life was an anonymous tryst at an Interstate rest area. Sentenced to probation and thrown out by his wife, he spends his week as a traveling salesman, and his weekends at his mother's house where no questions are asked--and no explanations are offered.  &lt;p&gt;To clear his record, the State of North Carolina requires Andy to complete one year of therapy without another arrest. He attends his sessions reluctantly at first, struggling to comprehend why he would risk everything. Answers don't come easily, especially in the face of his mother's sudden illness and his repeated failure to live as an openly gay man. But as Andy searches his past, he gets an opportunity to rescue another lost soul--and a chance at a future that is different in every way from the one he had envisioned.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With profound honesty, sharp wit, and genuine heart, this debut novel portrays one man's search--for love and passion, acceptance and redemption--and for the courage to really live.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're looking for a smart, engaging, witty, sad and unusual book about the complicated nature of family and love, try Tom Mendicino's &lt;em&gt;Probation&lt;/em&gt;.  You'll be glad you did."  --Bart Yates &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Probation&lt;/em&gt; is the rare novel that dares to take the reader on a journey through the dark night of the soul. An unflinching look at the dark side of self-discovery, it is ultimately a story of transformation and the worlds of possibilities hidden within each of us." --Michael Thomas Ford&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-If David Sedaris were cast as Willy Loman, it might sound something like &lt;em&gt;Probation&lt;/em&gt;.  Andy, a sharp-tongued travelling salesman, gives us the life events that led to his being taken away in handcuffs, and the hilarious and agonizing self-inquiry that follows.  Snarky, yet profound, it is a bold examination of the destructive effects of a life spent in the closet, reported with a Carolina twang.-   --Vestal McIntyre &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Bravery is being the only one who knows you're afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Navy SEAL training pushed Lieutenant Josh Walker to his limit, Chief David Flint’s stern heart-to-heart—more like boot-to-ass—helped Josh realize his potential. When the holidays found them alone together and sharing a mutual attraction, they couldn’t help breaking a few regulations. And nearly breaking some furniture in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years after their short-lived fling, Senior Chief Flint returns to SEAL duty and finds himself under the command of the man he’s never been able to forget: Lieutenant Commander Walker. And Josh hasn’t forgotten David, either. Rules be damned, they can’t keep their hands off each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite their discretion, another SEAL catches on and threatens to expose their relationship, forcing Josh to bend to a blackmailer’s demands to avoid strife within the team just before a dangerous mission. David is the last man he can confide in…and the first to pick up on Josh’s tightly screwed-down stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a life-or-death decision calls Josh’s leadership into question, coming clean could cost him what he values most. His coveted trident…and the man he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: Contains a pair of Navy SEALs who don’t like playing by the rules, scorching-hot sex between two Alphas who like to be in charge, cursing as only Navy men can curse, lots of camouflage and badassery in the wilds of North Korea, and enough emotion to sink a battleship.</description>

  <description>An international sensation, this hilarious, feel-good novel is narrated by an oddly charming and socially challenged genetics professor on an unusual quest: to find out if he is capable of true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don Tillman, professor of genetics, has never been on a second date. He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance. So when an acquaintance informs him that he would make a “wonderful” husband, his first reaction is shock. Yet he must concede to the statistical probability that there is someone for everyone, and he embarks upon The Wife Project. In the orderly, evidence-based manner with which he approaches all things, Don sets out to find the perfect partner. She will be punctual and logical—most definitely not a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also beguiling, fiery, intelligent—and on a quest of her own. She is looking for her biological father, a search that a certain DNA expert might be able to help her with. Don's Wife Project takes a back burner to the Father Project and an unlikely relationship blooms, forcing the scientifically minded geneticist to confront the spontaneous whirlwind that is Rosie—and the realization that love is not always what looks good on paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rosie Project&lt;/em&gt; is a moving and hilarious novel for anyone who has ever tenaciously gone after life or love in the face of overwhelming challenges.</description>

  <description>Adam's an undercover vice cop dealing with a dark past. He's no stranger to bad nights; in fact, he's lived a lot of them. But he won't survive this one. First, a drug deal he's working goes south. Then his partner and sometimes sex partner Peter has to watch him bleed to death. But the kicker: he's not sure what's worse. Watching Peter cry over him or waking up undead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter's a good cop in love with a bad man. Or a bad vampire, now. Watching Adam die was the worst thing he could imagine. Until he woke up. Now their relationship's in crisis. Adam's in the middle of a vampire enclave at the center of Los Angeles motorcycle clubs and Peter just can't hack it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam thinks he's fine with that. He's a commitment-phobe. But he's about to discover, immortality is seriously the suck.</description>

  <description>Some memories are better off lost in the mist…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight months ago, British academic Paul Ansell lost his lover—and all the memories of their time together—in an accident at Iceland’s Gullfoss Falls. Returning to the misty island country to resume his study of the bloodthirsty Viking Egil Skallagrimsson is tough as he struggles to pull his life back together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, there’s his colleague, Mags, who treats him like glass, and summer student Alex, who peppers him with discomforting questions. Then there’s Icelandic jet-boat driver Viggo, a tattooed, modern-day Viking who won’t say much about how they know each other. Leaving Paul to wonder if their volcanic attraction is fuelled by a desire to make a fresh start, or desperation to forget the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As more fragments of his lost memories fall into place, Paul is unsure if he can trust himself, much less anyone around him. And he begins to suspect his accident was nothing of the kind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains a modern-day Viking whose boat has V8 engines for oars, and a harsh land of hot springs and hotter passions that won’t forgive any false steps.</description>

  <description>A lyrical and romantic story of true love and dark curses, &lt;em&gt;Light of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is an enchanting read for fans of Laini Taylor's &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/em&gt; and Kami Garcia's and Margaret Stohl's &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Creatures&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night long ago, a constellation disappeared and fell from the sky in the form of a boy...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secrets are being kept in the sleepy town of Lakewood Hollow, Colorado. Life unfolds in shades of red for Calum, until a mysterious girl named Kate Black enrolls at his school and everything changes. Suddenly a dangerous world of demons, enchanters, and witches unfurls before Calum. He learns that the stars have forever held his destiny, and that the constellations above are much more than what they seem. But life is not so easy for Calum, and he can feel his &lt;em&gt;heart beat faster&lt;/em&gt; whenever Kate is close. Worse, Kate's blood holds a dark secret even more dangerous than the war between the demons and enchanters. Soon the two find that there are worse things than loving someone you shouldn't. For Calum and Kate, even love and the fiery power of stars may not be enough to break a curse as dark as the blood that binds their destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes being brave just means falling in love.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>"So this is what Stiles does. He lies in Scott’s bed and waits for Melissa to say she’s found someone to get it out of him, to cure him of the wrongness and the bad, and he dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God, he dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He dreams of fire and swollen bellies and that scene in Alien, of giving birth to jackals through his urethra, the whole horrific nine yards. His head is a terrible place to be, he can’t imagine his stomach is much better, why anyone would want to put a thing inside of it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words: 77138&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A thrill of excitement always went through paramedic James Willson whenever he transported a patient to St. Michael’s hospital, but it had nothing to do with the rush of the job. It was one of the emergency department doctors that set his heart racing—the very sexy, very aloof Calvin Dane.</description>

  <description>Here kitty, kitty has never sounded so fine. As the two males run for their lives, they find that not only are they having to battle their enemy, but they are also fighting a growing attraction to each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacyn had always considered himself a pretty normal guy. Little did he know that he couldn't be more wrong. Attacked by a group of gunmen, he suddenly finds himself shot at, kidnapped and chained to a wall. Not exactly the kind of day a normal guy has. All he knows is that all of it is somehow connected to his birth family. Rescued by a tall dangerous looking stranger who claims to have been sent by his long-lost family, Jacyn doesn't know whether to run with him or away from him. Especially when the stranger claims to be able to shift into a jaguar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Logan wants is to be rounding up some stray jaguar shifter, but he has never refused an order. Even as he tells himself the mission will be a snap, he finds himself having to launch a one-cat rescue party when Jacyn gets himself captured by their enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two males run for their lives, they find that not only are they having to battle their enemy, but they are also fighting a growing attraction to each other. Passion is the last thing they should be thinking about, however. Because if they don't keep their attention focused on the enemy, they could very well pay the ultimate price.</description>

  <description>At one time Devon Canton and his two brothers were the talk of the NHL. Set to become the next superstars of the sport, they had lucrative contracts and numerous endorsements within their reach. Then the bottom fell out of their world and everything changed. Now struggling to make ends meet, they have been reduced to playing in the minor leagues. To make matters worse, they all end up playing for the same dead-end team, the Battle Creek Hawks. Not only hasn’t that team won a game in three years, but their arena is falling down around them and is in danger of being condemned. Then Devon and his brothers hit a new low when they get thrown out of their first game for getting into a brawl…with each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Battle Creek Times sports reporter Saul Davis knows the instant he see the three brothers beating the snot out of each other that he has a story. It only takes a little digging to find out how far the once promising hockey players have fallen. Intrigued, Saul tries to pin down Devon for an interview, only to be rudely rebuked. Unfortunately for Devon, that only makes Saul more determined to get to the bottom of the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Saul uncovers something about the brooding hockey player that could not only destroy the man’s reputation, but also ruin any chance of him every playing on the professional level again. Saul knows he should go ahead and run the story, but as he finds himself growing closer to Devon, he realizes that his feelings for the other man are too strong to ignore. When a rival reporter also discovers Devon’s secret, Saul recognizes that he may have to make the most painful decision of all – his own journalism career or Devon.</description>

  <description>How long did it take you to find your place in the world? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Ethan Walker, going through the motions of life, keeping his distance and never getting attached has become the mantra he lives by. Success is measured by how many hours he can work and how little attention he can draw. That was until he landed on Beau Bennett’s radar. Until Beau, Ethan had never met a man who could get him to question his own logic and even consider taking a different path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beau Bennett knows exactly who he is - now. It might’ve taken him some time to figure it out, but now that he has his bearings, Beau has set his sights on the mysteriously sexy Ethan Walker. Pursuing someone has never been his style, but something is telling him to keep at it because the end result is going to be worth it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they’ve found one another, how long will it take Ethan and Beau to accept that their place in the world is... Together? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethan is part of the Alluring Indulgence series (#4), however, this book was written to be read as a stand alone book as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This book contains sexual encounters and graphic language that some readers may find objectionable, including, but not limited to: m/m encounters, anal sex. Contains graphic material that is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>North Star: Book One&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their small-town high school, Hugo and Kevin became closeted lovers who kept their secret even from parents. Hugo didn’t want to disappoint his terminally ill father, and Kevin’s controlling father would never tolerate a bisexual son. When college took them in different directions, they promised to reunite, but that didn’t happen for seventeen years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time they meet again, Hugo has become an out-and-proud actor and director who occasionally performs in drag—a secret that has cost him in past relationships. Kevin, still closeted, has followed his father’s path and now, in the shadow of divorce, is striving to be a better father to his own children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Hugo and Kevin meet by chance at a party, the spark of attraction reignites, as does their genuine friendship. Rekindling a romance may mean Hugo must compromise the openness he values, but Kevin will need a patient partner as he adapts to living outside the closet. With such different lifestyles, the odds seem stacked against them, and Hugo fears that if his secret comes to light, it may drive Kevin away completely.</description>

  <description>Cheating death is easy—the hard part is knowing when not to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment an anonymous rescuer pulled him back from the brink of death, Dane Harper has vowed to live every second of his life to the fullest. Nothing would please him more than to share those stolen moments with the man who, literally, held his life in his hands. First, though, he has to find him. Then convince him it’s safe to come out of his self-imposed shadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if it means playing dirty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Court has no regrets about manipulating that one second of fate to save Dane’s life, but having this accursed power to cheat death isn’t the only thing darkening his lonely existence. The last thing he needs is an eternal optimist shining a cheery light on the dark, tortured corners of his past. Except now that Dane has found him, there’s no shaking him...and the longer Court basks in Dane’s relentless warmth, the more he begins to believe that maybe, just maybe, happiness can at last be his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distracted by the devilish sparkle in Dane’s eyes, Court begins to forget that there are those who would kill to control his stunning power. And that Dane is the perfect bait…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Beware—features a man with absolutely no scruples about resorting to seduction and cheap tricks to get what he wants. Plus a skittish, supernaturally gifted paramedic who’s about to discover that it’s okay to go along for the ride.</description>

  <description>Dillard Brown has a mother who's determined he's straight, a writing career that’s going nowhere, and at thirty, he’s never been in love in his life. But thanks to a ten-pound ball of fluff and energy named Chester, one of Dill's circumstances is about to change. Maybe even all three. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who would've thought one little stray dog could change Dill's world—and not by accident either. The damn dog has it planned. If not for Chester wandering into Dill's life and into his heart, Dill would never have met Hector Peña—and tumbled headlong into love at last! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for all Chester's efforts, happiness for Dill and Hector is still not assured. Hector's evil ex, Valdemaro, is dead set on holding on—even if it means kidnapping Hector to keep him from Dill forever! Now Dill has to pull an army together to rescue Hector, and just where the hell is he supposed to find an army? Gads, if only Dill could write books this interesting!</description>

  <description>When a Fantasy Muse falls in love with a human, things can get sticky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the surface, Ren Crystal appears to be a regular computer repair shop owner—but he isn’t. Ren is a Fantasy Muse, born to covertly pleasure the men who desire him. Although Ren immensely enjoys his purpose in life, he doesn’t feel a personal connection to his “callers” until handsome college professor Will Spencer brings his PC in for repairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Will unwittingly reveals his secrets to Ren in fantasy, Ren finds himself falling in love. Because Ren is young, he doesn’t realize how hard it will be to date a human like Will, and problems quickly arise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Ren is uninhibited by nature, Will struggles with his desires. His outward conservative persona conflicts with his inner life. Will could never admit to his attraction to Ren—or the wicked things he imagines doing with him—but Ren knows. Both men have secrets that could keep them apart. Together they must bear the weight of their mutual deception.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The first in an all-new urban fantasy series by &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Jaye Wells.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing patrol cop Kate Prospero expected to find on her nightly rounds was a werewolf covered in the blood of his latest victim. But then, she also didn't expect that shooting him would land her in the crosshairs of a Magic Enforcement Agency task force, who wants to know why she killed their lead snitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more Prospero learns about the dangerous new potion the MEA is investigating, the more she's convinced that earning a spot on their task force is the career break she's been wanting. But getting the assignment proves much easier than solving the case. Especially once the investigation reveals their lead suspect is the man she walked away from ten years earlier—on the same day she swore she'd never use dirty magic again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate Prospero's about to learn the hard way that crossing a wizard will always get you burned, and that when it comes to magic, you should be never say never.</description>

  <description>** "If you enjoy Emily Giffin or Jennifer Weiner, then add Em Barrett to your list!" ~The Indie Bookshelf **&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;** 2013 Beach Book Festival Honorable Mention **&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than simply a modern love story, Leaving Green Island is a poignant yet lighthearted tale of friendship, family and the search for a place to belong in the complex world of today's twenty-something women. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a new job at a prestigious Chicago law firm and an engagement ring on her finger, everything seems to be falling into place for Brecken Pereira these days. However, all this perfection quickly unravels when Reed Whalen, Brecken’s first love, unexpectedly resurfaces. The complicated history of the enigmatic Reed unfolds as the two summers that Brecken spent as a teenager on posh, exclusive Green Island in northern Michigan are interspersed with her relatable and humorous modern day trials and tribulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Reed's reappearance, Brecken is torn between her longing for the past and the life she has carefully built for herself since Reed vanished years before.  Her true-to-life and complex relationships with her two best friends provide the backbone that supports Brecken, both as the life she knows quickly dissolves around her and as she struggles to pick up the pieces.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unputdownable novel is certain to pull on the heartstrings of anyone who ever had a first love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;{As a heads up, this book contains underage drinking and a bit of explicit language and sexual content.}</description>

  <description>Being a police detective is hard. Add the complication of being a werewolf subject to human prejudice, and you might say Ray Branigan has his work cut out for him. He’s hot on the trail of a killer when he realizes he needs help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Cal Parker, the beautiful half-fairy Ray’s secretly been in love with for years—secretly, because while werewolves mate for life, fairies...don’t. Ray needs Cal’s expertise, but it isn’t easy to concentrate with his mate walking around half-naked trying to publicly seduce him. By the time Ray identifies the killer—and sorts out a few prejudices of his own—it may be too late for Cal.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two boys bond, sharing geeky things and fast food. And falling in love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Luke's parents take in a foster kid named Randall, Luke is immediately taken with him, although he doesn't want to admit to himself why. He wasn't planning to be gay. He wasn't planning to fall in love with another boy. But then he met Ran....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember when I first met Ran. He was absolutely unprepossessing, all skinny white boy wearing his insecurities on his sleeves, which were tattered and faded on a too-big flannel shirt. He wore jeans that didn't quite fit him, cheap tennis shoes that had once been white, and glasses that made his eyes look too big in his scrawny, pale face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he was holding a trash bag and standing in the middle of my bedroom looking miserable...</description>

  <description>An Isla Sagrario Story&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 1700s on the island of Sagrario, men who love other men find safe haven. For Francis Holland, an escaped indentured servant, Sagrario offers nothing but loneliness. His life begins to change when he finds Wick, a merman, washed ashore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Wick awakens under Francis’s care, Francis returns him to the sea at his request. Soon after, they begin to meet in secret, and gradually, Francis blossoms under this new companionship. However, a merman is a difficult creature to entrust one’s heart to. With one trapped on land and the other at sea, the differences in their species threaten to keep them apart forever. It may not be long before Wick is gone, taking Francis’s reason to smile with him.</description>

  <description>Mark O’Brien is finally being honest with himself. His relationship with Rachel is over and he’s moving out of the home they've shared for six years. They get along, but he can’t fix a relationship when the person he's with is the wrong gender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Robertson, one of the removal men, is huge and ridiculously gorgeous, and Mark is smitten at first sight. When a cardboard box splits, revealing items of a personal nature that Mark never wanted anybody to see, he's mortified. But it sparks the start of a beautiful friendship with benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jamie initiates Mark into the joys of gay sex, the two men get increasingly close and “nothing serious” turns into something rather important to both of them. But communication isn’t their strong point. Will either man ever find the courage to be honest about his feelings?</description>

  <description>A New Adult Dark Contemporary Romance, not suitable for people sensitive to grief, slavery, and nonconsensual sex. A story about finding love in the strangest of places, a will of iron that grows from necessity, and forgiveness that may not be enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My life was complete. Happy, content, everything neat and perfect.&lt;br&gt;Then it all changed.&lt;br&gt;I was sold.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tess Snow has everything she ever wanted: one more semester before a career in property development, a loving boyfriend, and a future dazzling bright with possibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For their two year anniversary, Brax surprises Tess with a romantic trip to Mexico. Sandy beaches, delicious cocktails, and soul-connecting sex set the mood for a wonderful holiday. With a full heart, and looking forward to a passion filled week, Tess is on top of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But lusty paradise is shattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidnapped. Drugged. Stolen. Tess is forced into a world full of darkness and terror. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captive and alone with no savior, no lover, no faith, no future, Tess evolves from terrified girl to fierce fighter. But no matter her strength, it can’t save her from the horror of being sold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Brax find Tess before she’s broken and ruined, or will Tess’s new owner change her life forever?</description>

Suited for ages 18 and up*</description>

  <description>"The most dangerous refuge could be his lover's arms. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has at least one deep-seated fear. For Tyler, it's being in debt. He's so desperate to get out and stay out of it, he'll do almost anything-including selling his body at Saturday night sex parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he refuses to open his mind to anyone, especially the men paying to use him however they want. The only time he's truly happy is during the week at college, when he can escape into his music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moment Haris sees Tyler playing piano at a concert, he falls hard, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make the guy his. Even if it means-for the first time in his life-opening his wallet as wide and desperate as his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20,000 to live with a good-looking guy for four months? How can Tyler resist the chance to ditch the sex party scene for good? But neither man realizes how much they're risking. And when outside forces close in, ready to destroy them, the trickiest part about the next four months could be just surviving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains a "for hire" bad boy with a filthy mouth, an awkward guy with a penchant for BDSM, a hypochondriac butler who won't shut up, a dog called Alcide, and a lot of hot and dirty M/M sex.</description>

  <description>After an explosive locker room confrontation with his Russian rival ends in the most surprising and intense sex of his life, American pairs skater Dev Avira needs to refocus. He’s worked for years to win Olympic gold, and he can’t let himself—or his partner—down. Distraction in the form of steely and smoldering Mikhail Reznikov is the last thing he needs as he prepares for the biggest competition of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with the Games only days away, they can’t keep their hands off each other. Dev soon learns that beneath Mikhail’s arrogant and aloof exterior is Misha, a passionate man who warms Dev’s heart and scorches his bed. They're both determined to win, but for Misha his freedom could be on the line. Can Dev put his deepening feelings on ice as he goes for gold?</description>

  <description>Duty, honor, propriety…all fall in the face of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Hugh Fanshawe returned from the Peninsular War with a leg that no longer works properly, thanks to a French musket ball. Now his fight against Napoleon is reduced to quiet, lonely days compiling paperwork at Horse Guards headquarters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His evenings are spent dutifully escorting his mother and sister to stifling social engagements, where his lameness renders him an object of pity and distaste. But his orderly, restricted life is thrown into sudden disarray with the arrival of Colonel Theo Lindsay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theo is everything Hugh is not—a man of physical perfection and easy yet distinguished address. Surprisingly to Hugh, Theo appears to be interested in making his acquaintance. Lindsay turns out to be a most convivial companion, and Hugh finds great pleasure in his company. Their friendship deepens when they become lovers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of himself, Hugh falls desperately in love. But when a French spy is suspected at Horse Guards, Hugh discovers nothing is as it seems…and the paper he shuffles from day to day could be the instrument of his lover’s death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br&gt;Contains gallant English officers in love, dastardly French spies, skintight pantaloons (sometimes on the floor) and gleaming tasseled Hessians.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Better Than Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jay Reynolds has a crush on his project leader at work, but an office romance with Peter Morgan isn't likely to happen since Peter is straight. Worse, Jay soon fears Peter is homophobic, and his initial infatuation turns to loathing. But one fateful night, Jay is forced to acknowledge things aren't quite as they seem with Peter. Suddenly, his crush is back and unbelievably, Peter is interested too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They begin a friends with benefits arrangement, which becomes difficult for Jay when he starts falling for his sexy boss. Peter’s past issues keep him from committing, and Jay has to decide if he can be satisfied with friendship if Peter isn’t ready to take a chance on anything more.</description>

For the past twenty-two years Dan's lived his own version of happily-ever-after, with Travis by his side. Then tragedy strikes and life as they know it ceases to exist. Will they be strong enough to find their way back from a life interrupted?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Travis fights for his life, Dan can' t help but relive all those little moments that made up their life.

  <description>Joclyn Despain has been marred by a brand on her skin. She doesn't know why the mark appeared on her neck, but she doesn't want anyone to see it, including her best friend Ryland, who knows everything else about her. The scar is the reason she hides herself behind baggy clothes, and won't let the idea of kissing Ryland enter her mind, no matter how much she wants to.&lt;br&gt;The scar is the reason she is being hunted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only she knew that she was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only she had known that the cursed stone her estranged father sent for her 16th birthday would trigger a change in her. Now, she is being stalked by a tall blonde man, and is miraculously throwing her high school bully ten feet in the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joclyn attempts to find some answers and the courage to follow her heart. When Ryland finds her scar; only he knows what it means, and who will kill her because of it.</description>

  <description>Book one in an epic fantasy of intrigue and empire, for fans of George R. R. Martin and Douglas Hulick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The circle is closing. The stakes are high. And old truths will live again . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Emperor has been murdered, leaving the Annurian Empire in turmoil. Now his progeny must bury their grief and prepare to unmask a conspiracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His son Valyn, training for the empire’s deadliest fighting force, hears the news an ocean away. He expected a challenge, but after several ‘accidents’ and a dying soldier’s warning, he realizes his life is also in danger. Yet before Valyn can take action, he must survive the mercenaries’ brutal final initiation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the Emperor’s daughter, Minister Adare, hunts her father’s murderer in the capital itself. Court politics can be fatal, but she needs justice. And Kaden, heir to an empire, studies in a remote monastery. Here, the Blank God’s disciples teach their harsh ways – which Kaden must master to unlock their ancient powers. When an imperial delegation arrives, he’s learnt enough to perceive evil intent. But will this keep him alive, as long-hidden powers make their move?</description>

  <description>Drop into the world of rule-breaking, gravity-defying girls who shred riding freestyle BMX.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shredded by Karen Avivi is more than a teen girls’ sports book or a BMX biking book; it’s a motivating push-your-limits story for anyone who refuses to overlooked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josie Peters thinks she’ll do anything to qualify for the Ultimate BMX freestyle event the summer before her senior year so she and her friends take off on a summer road trip to hit the qualifying events in the Midwest. Late-night parties, an intimidating mega ramp, and the lure of sponsorships spark friction between the girls. When Josie’s best chance for success depends on her relationship with flashy rider R.T. Torres, she has to decide what she’s trying to win and how much she’ll sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shredded is a fast-paced, fun read that tackles feminism, friendship, sexism, and sibling rivalry. Even readers unfamiliar with BMX or extreme sports will be caught up in the adrenaline rush of Josie’s tricks, wipeouts, and wins. Hints of romance provide extra conflict without overtaking the main story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ideal for fans of realistic young adult fiction, Shredded features a strong female lead character who goes after what she wants by taking action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience the rivalries, rejections, and triumphs of Josie and her friends as they take off on a summer road trip adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Authentic, fun, emotional, and just plain gorgeous writing."&lt;br&gt;- Roxanne St. Claire, New York Times bestselling author</description>

Badly scarred from emotional wounds that have never healed, he doesn’t expect to find true love or happiness. He remains isolated in a prison of his own making, determined to not let anyone close enough to hurt him again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But his willpower is shaken to the core when Sarah Browning enters his world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The girl next door…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Jane Browning is three years into her college degree when a call from home changes everything. Back at the family homestead in the heart of Appalachia, she’s forced to reevaluate her hopes and dreams for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distraction from her heartache comes in the form of her parents’ neighbor. Whispers about “odd Owen Campbell” abound in their small community, and Sarah’s curiosity is aroused. When she breaks the rules and trespasses onto his land, what she finds is beyond her wildest imaginings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sarah struggles to overcome tragedy and loss, her burgeoning relationship with Owen is sorely tested. Will love conquer all, or will the secrets from Owen’s past tear them apart forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefly Hollow is the first in a new Romance series by T. L. Haddix, author of the Shadows/Leroy Collection, a series of standalone Romantic Suspense novels.

It’s love at first sight, and Brad even loses his virginity to the man of his dreams. But when he wakes up the next morning unable to remember anything—even what the man looked like—his best friend, Leslie, is convinced he imagined the whole thing. Brad knows he didn’t make up the best night of his life, but he has no idea of the danger he’s putting himself in as he struggles to recall the details of his perfect man. His search may lead him to parts of New York City he never dreamed existed and a war being waged in the shadows.</description>

  <description>Denton is a necromancer and his boyfriend Bran is a witch. It's not as exciting as it sounds. They don't even get to dress the part, unless it's New Year's Eve and they've been invited to a costume party. Denton is happy to let his hair down, but coaxing the reclusive Bran out of his shell is hard enough without a demonic spirit crashing the party.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Convincing the spirit to return whence it came from will call on Denton's special skills, but not in necromancy.</description>

  <description>At fifteen, Justin is already a cynic. He’s experienced too many betrayals, too many disappointments. He doesn’t want to be involved in anything. He doesn’t want to be popular. He doesn’t even want friends anymore, since they only ever let you down. He just wants to get through high school and the best way he can come up with to accomplish that goal is to simply be invisible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His self-imposed exile from high school life is threatened when Liam, the scary stoner, reaches out to him. What starts out as a strange and unsettling encounter with the unnerving,  pot-smoking teenager evolves into the sort of friendship that changes the course of a person’s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Liam drags the reluctant Justin out of his shell, Liam’s own secret is revealed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fearless is the story of the myriad shades of love, how to find one’s courage and the transformative power of friendship.</description>

  <description>For twenty years, Owen Fortescue, a down-to-earth farmer in upstate New York, has had an on-again, off-again relationship with volatile New York City artist Kerry Ruehling. Now that same-sex marriage is recognized in New York, Owen wants to tie the knot. But Kerry responds to the proposal with instant, angry withdrawal. Owen resolves to prove to Kerry that, regardless of the way his family of origin has treated him, family ties don’t necessarily tie a man down. With help from his grown daughter, Laura, who loves them both, Owen hopes to convince Kerry that his marriage proposal isn’t a trap, but a chance at real love.</description>

  <description>Gil Donaldson returned to his hometown of Boulder, Colorado, after a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis cut short his teaching career and his love life on the East Coast. Waking one morning to find that his vision has gone blurry, which makes driving himself to the hospital out of the question, Gil solicits the help of his slightly-reclusive neighbor, Warren Masters, to take him to the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two men become friends over the course of Gil’s recovery from his latest relapse, and while Gil recognizes he’s attracted to the other man, he refuses to act on it. Gil doesn’t like relying on anyone else to ensure his emotional or physical health, and he’s grown used to being alone, or at least that’s what he tells himself. Warren is a man of few words, but he’s there whenever Gil needs him, and he has only one request for them to be together.</description>

  <description>Baker Luke Henderson loves his job, and owning a bakery at Coogee Beach makes it even better. When he opens the shop before dawn, he hears the waves. When he walks along the beach after sunrise, he admires the surfers—one in particular: Cameron Brown. A chef and café owner, Cameron secretly watches Luke right back. When Luke proposes a business deal, Cameron seizes the chance to get close. But Cameron’s ideal man is physically perfect, and Luke’s awkward limp could be the flaw that fractures their romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the Under the Southern Cross anthology.</description>

  <description>From a "fresh and imaginative" ("The Romance Studio") voice in erotic romance come the tales of two women, each daring to challenge the boundaries of the toughest of men...But in these edgy, heated encounters, the greatest thing each woman will risk is her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Over the Edge," - after a tragic incident during Ty Hendricks' last tour of duty, he cut off all connection with anyone he cares about--until a night with Lauren Kincaid draws him reluctantly back into the world. Lauren sees a wounded man in danger of losing everything to his inner demons, but the sensual, no-holds-barred fight for Ty's soul could cost Lauren her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"All on the Line," - Abby Simmons fell hard for Lieutenant Sean Winthrop, but he sacrificed their relationship when he deployed to Afghanistan. Now he's home, full of regrets and intent on winning back the woman he never forgot. Abby gives Sean her body but holds her heart aloof, until one night of pleasure forces her to choose either her U.S. Marine...or life without him, forever.</description>

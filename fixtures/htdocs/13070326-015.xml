  <description>It’s a thin line between right and wrong. It’s an even thinner one between wrong and dead…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terrible has always been on the wrong side of the law, living up to the only name anyone ever gave him. As the chief enforcer for Downside’s most powerful criminal, it’s his job to collect debts and protection money by any means necessary. And he’s very good at his job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But part of that job is also to keep Bump’s various employees safe. So when a street dealer is found dead and a prostitute is brutally attacked, Terrible immediately starts using his fists to hunt down the ones responsible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s determined to find and destroy them. They’re determined to use his desire for the woman he secretly loves to break him.</description>

  <description>Megan promises listeners to her new radio call-in show that she'll "slay their personal demons," and they believe her. So do the personal demons... although she doesn't know it, Megan is the only human without a demon on her shoulder! Megan and her allies - a demon lover who both protects and seduces her with devilish intensity, a witch with poor social skills, and three cockney guard demons - have to deal not only with the personal demons, but a soul-sucker, ghosts of Megan's past, and a reporter who threatens to destroy Megan's career!</description>

  <description>For the past couple years Laurel’s been coasting, hiding in the backseat while her life drifts off course. Then one summer afternoon a tall, built bruiser named Flynn strides in and steers her straight into an infatuation she never saw coming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flynn introduces Laurel to things she’s never imagined—to the violent but exciting realm of the underground boxing circuit, to rough sex and even rougher role-playing, and to an attraction she craves even as it intimidates her. As Flynn invites her deeper into his world and his life, Laurel has to make a choice—let fear keep her holed up where it’s safe, or take a chance and fight for the man who makes her feel more alive than she’d dreamed possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: Although all sex acts are 100-percent consensual, Willing Victim contains role-playing scenarios that may upset some readers who are sensitive about rape, even in a simulated capacity.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Graceling meets Beauty and the Beast in this sweeping fantasy about one girl's journey to fulfill her destiny and the monster who gets in her way-by stealing her heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the classic fairy tale Beauty and the Beast, Cruel Beauty is a dazzling love story about our deepest desires and their power to change our destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since birth, Nyx has been betrothed to the evil ruler of her kingdom-all because of a foolish bargain struck by her father. And since birth, she has been in training to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no choice but to fulfill her duty, Nyx resents her family for never trying to save her and hates herself for wanting to escape her fate. Still, on her seventeenth birthday, Nyx abandons everything she's ever known to marry the all-powerful, immortal Ignifex. Her plan? Seduce him, destroy his enchanted castle, and break the nine-hundred-year-old curse he put on her people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Ignifex is not at all what Nyx expected. The strangely charming lord beguiles her, and his castle-a shifting maze of magical rooms-enthralls her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Nyx searches for a way to free her homeland by uncovering Ignifex's secrets, she finds herself unwillingly drawn to him. Even if she could bring herself to love her sworn enemy, how can she refuse her duty to kill him? With time running out, Nyx must decide what is more important: the future of her kingdom, or the man she was never supposed to love.</description>

  <description>Marshall's Park is a monthly series in 10 parts. Join Finn and Aiden as they meet and fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being Marshall's Park's resident mascot, Monty the Meerkat, wasn't exactly what Finn Thomas envisioned when he arrived in LA seeking fame and fortune. Although he did get to walk the red carpet every once in a while... when there was a parade. Finn loved his job but to say he wasn't used to being accused of kidnapping, wrestled to the ground by a maniacal father and locked in a cell with a hairy biker, would be an understatement. But that’s exactly where he finds himself when he meets a little girl with a grazed knee who's looking for her daddy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aiden Reid came from money and privilege. He'd expected his parents’ reaction to the news that he was going to be a father. Although being thrown out on the street with a check in his back pocket when he refused to sign the adoption papers, shocked even him. In Santa Monica he moves in with his eccentric aunt and life is good. Good that is, until Aiden loses sight of Kayley at the local zoo, Marshall's Park. When he spots her being led away by a man mountain, one word flashes before his eyes... kidnap! Of course, the freak says he works at the park, but Aiden calls the cops and has the lying bastard arrested. The following day, he learns that the lying bastard was telling the truth and has grounds to have him arrested for assault. How the hell is Aiden going to convince Monty the Meerkat not to press charges?</description>

  <description>Secrets. Their weight can be crushing, but their release can change everything—and not necessarily for the better. Ian is no stranger to secrets. Being a gay teen in a backwater southern town, Ian must keep his orientation under wraps, especially since he spends a lot of time with his hands all over members of the same sex, pinning their sweaty, hard bodies to the wrestling mat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he’s trying not to stare at teammates in the locker room, he’s busy hiding another secret—that he starves himself so he doesn’t get bumped to the next weight class. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Julian Yang, an Adonis with mesmerizing looks and punk rocker style. Befriending the flirtatious artist not only raises suspicion among his classmates, but leaves Ian terrified he’ll give in to the desires he’s fought to ignore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As secrets come to light, Ian’s world crumbles. Disowned, de-friended, and deserted by nearly everyone, Ian’s one-way ticket out of town is revoked, leaving him trapped in a world he hates—and one that hates him back.</description>

  <description>Shelby Bainbridge, former championship winning quarterback and son of an Alabama Senator with presidential aspirations, lost everything one Thursday night fifty-two weeks ago. Lost, alone, battered, and broken Shelby finds comfort in the local bar called Deacon’s Place. Week after week, he finds himself drawn to Deacon’s for the beer, for the atmosphere, for the solace and for Deacon himself.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deacon can no longer deny the desire he feels for the man he calls Thursday. When Deacon wants something Deacon is a hard man to resist. The problem is, Deacon never planned to lose his heart. Especially to a man who could be destroyed by an unexpected night of forbidden passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazon buy link &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/51st-Thursday-Mercy-Celeste-ebook/dp/B00722Z5K4/ref=la_B004WHS8PQ_1_7?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1388692271&amp;amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/51st-Thursday-M...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>This is book one in the Beer and Clay series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes unpredictable is exactly what’s needed, but can Corner Pub owner Damon convince shy Thursday night regular Toby of that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damon loves his life—his bar, his employees and his beer. He especially loves Thursdays. That's when the mysterious little red-head dances into his bar, drinks two honey wheat brews, and flits right back out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toby's comfortable. He has a good job, great friends, and he gets paid to do what he loves—sculpt. His life is great, if a little predictable. And if he secretly wears a plug to Corner Pub every Thursday, well...that's nobody's business but his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Toby meets Damon, his predictable little life flies right out the window. Damon shows him the big, wide world of the Dom/sub lifestyle, plugs and piercings, and teaches him that maybe, unpredictable is exactly what Toby needed all along.</description>

  <description>The midforties are that time in a gay man’s life when his major paradigm shifts from sexy to sensible. But when Barry Grooms's partner of twenty years is killed on Barry's forty-fifth birthday, his world doesn’t so much evolve as it does explode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After navigating through the surreal conveyor belt of friends and family, he can't eat another casserole or swallow much more advice, and so, still numb, he escapes to Key West, then New York. He embraces a new mantra: Why the hell not? He becomes so spontaneous he's ready to combust. First, he gets a thankless new job working for a crazy lady in a poncho, then has too many drinks with a narcissistic Broadway actor. Next, it's a nude exercise class that redefines flop sweat, and from there he’s on to a relationship with a man twenty years his junior, so youthfully oblivious he thinks Karen Carpenter is a lesbian woodworker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet no matter how great the retreat from the man he used to be, life's gravity spins Barry back to the town where he grew up for one more ironic twist that teaches him how to say good-bye with grace.</description>

  <description>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a dead-end town of 12,000 people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heather never thought she would compete in Panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher. She’d never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodge has never been afraid of Panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game, he’s sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he’s not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them—and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.</description>

  <description>An all-new novel from the author of After Hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She set out to find herself, and discovered the darker side of desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merry’s lost a lot recently—first her mother, then close to a hundred pounds. Feeling adrift, she strikes out in search of perspective. A three-week hike through the Scottish Highlands was supposed to challenge her new body and refocus her priorities, but when disaster strikes, she’s forced to seek refuge in the remote home of a brooding, handsome stranger…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob exiled himself to the Highlands years ago, desperate to escape his own self-destruction. Haunted by regrets, he avoids human contact at all costs…but when Merry turns up injured, he can’t very well run her off. And as he nurses her back to health, Rob can’t resist his guest’s sweet demeanor—or her flirtatious advances. The igniting passion between them rouses a secret appetite Rob has long struggled to keep hidden. But Merry craves nothing more than to help Rob surrender to his desires, and the journey draws the lovers into an entirely different kind of wilderness.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Fight for your dreams. Fight for your life. Fight for love.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nerdy girl Autumn Blakewood is the prime example of a goody two-shoes. She studies every night, is never late for class, and always follows the rules. She has never felt the need to step out of her comfort zone. That is, until she meets Hunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter Bane is a cocky, confident bad-boy, who's nothing but trouble. He’s a dangerous distraction to everyone around him. Sexy and strong, Hunter enjoys the swooning effect he has on women. Especially those who aren't used to attention, like Autumn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Autumn finds it hard not to give into Hunter’s advances, even though it all seems like a game to him. Trying to understand him is impossible, because he shrouds himself in mystery. &lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that Hunter has more baggage than anyone should have to carry. When she discovers he's in an illegal frat club to save the one person that matters to him, Autumn realizes this could mean the end of her undeniable connection to him. Even their lives are at risk.&lt;br&gt;But it's too late to turn back now ...</description>

  <description>Mattie Ross, a 14-year-old girl from Dardanelle, Arkansas, sets out to avenge her Daddy who was shot to death by a no-good outlaw. Mattie convinces one-eyed "Rooster" Cogburn, the meanest U.S. marshal in the land, to ride along with her. In True Grit, we have a true American classic, as young Mattie, as vital as she is innocent, outdickers and outmaneuvers the hard-bitten men of the trail in a legend that will last through the ages.</description>

  <description>To most people, the realm of magic is the stuff of nursery rhymes and dusty libraries. But for Capt. Gabriel Huntley, it’s become quite real and quite dangerous… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IN HOT PURSUIT…&lt;br&gt;The vicious attack Capt. Gabriel Huntley witnesses in a dark alley sparks a chain of events that will take him to the ends of the Earth and beyond—where what is real and what is imagined become terribly confused. And frankly, Huntley couldn’t be more pleased. Intrigue, danger, and a beautiful woman in distress—just what he needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IN HOTTER WATER…&lt;br&gt;Raised thousands of miles from England, Thalia Burgess is no typical Victorian lady. A good thing, because a proper lady would have no hope of recovering the priceless magical artifact Thalia is after. Huntley’s assistance might come in handy, though she has to keep him in the dark. But this distractingly handsome soldier isn’t easy to deceive… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Zoe weaves a delightful spell…cleverly blending history and magic in new, delightful ways…”&lt;br&gt;—Elizabeth Vaughan USA Today bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“An innovative and exciting romantic adventure with just the right touch of the paranormal…”&lt;br&gt;—Jennifer Ashley, USA Today bestselling author</description>

  <description>Julie Valentine’s soul searching turned out to be a bad case of the author blues. Having just broken up with her boyfriend, she goes to a casino in the hopes of relaxing and getting her mind straight, while rekindling her passion for books, but not even a nice glass of wine seems to work. Writing steamy romances requires more than just leisure time.&lt;br&gt;When she meets the billionaire Dominic Fury, a handsome blue-eyed kind ladies’ man, his charms win her over. Maybe spending a night with him will give her plenty of inspiration. It turns out Dominic has a seductive request for her, one she cannot refuse.</description>

  <description>When nurse Tish Everett forced open the pesky but lovely locket she found at an estate sale, she had no idea she was answering the call of Criminy Stain, from the far off land of Sang. He’d cast a spell for her, but when she’s transported right to him, she’s not so sure she’s ready to be under the spell of another man. (It didn’t go so well last time with controlling, abusive, domineering Jeff.) If only Criminy wasn’t so deliciously rakish….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the inhabitants of Sang are Pinkies—human—and the other half are Bludmen, who in Tish’s world would be called vampires. But they don’t mess with any of the bat/coffin/no sunlight nonsense. They’re rather like you and me, just more fabulous, long living, and mostly indestructible. (They're also very good kissers.) But when the evil Mayor of Manchester (formerly Bludchester) redoubles his efforts to rid Sang of the Bludmen once and for all, stealing Tish’s locket in hopes of traveling back to her world himself for reinforcements, Criminy and Tish must battle ghosts, sea monsters, wayward submarines, a secret cabal, and thundering Bludmares to get the locket back and allow Tish to return home…but has she found love with Criminy? Could she stay in Sang forever?</description>

  <description>For a thousand years, since their defeat of the Shadow at Eyr, the dragons have slept under the mountains. Now their king, Tarnamell, has woken. Driven mad by loneliness, he hurls himself south until he finds and tries to claim the Alagard Desert. Unfortunately, the desert already has a guardian spirit, and he doesn't want to share. Amused by the cocky little desert spirit, Tarn retreats, planning to return in human form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his caravan enters the desert, however, Alagard is missing. Rumors fly of a dark power, and soon Tarn’s caravan encounters the living dead and an amnesiac mage called Gard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to take refuge in the Court of the Shells, a legendary fortress in the heart of the desert, Tarn, Gard, and their allies decide to seek out the Shadow before it destroys the desert. But to confront the Shadow, Tarn needs to gather his strength. A dragon's power depends on the love and loyalty of his human hoard, but Tarn's original hoard has been dead for centuries. Before he can face his most ancient enemy, he must win the trust of new followers and the heart of a cynical desert spirit.</description>

  <description>Mark Cooper is angry, homesick, and about to take his stepdad’s dubious advice and rush Prescott College’s biggest party fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi. Greek life is as foreign to Aussie transplant Mark as Pennsylvania’s snowstorms and bear sightings. So, when the fraternity extends Mark a bid, Mark vows to get himself kicked out by the end of pledge period. But then he’s drawn into Alpha Delt’s feud with a neighboring fraternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studious Deacon Holt is disappointed to learn Mark’s pledging Alpha Delt, his fraternity Phi Sigma Kappa’s sworn enemy. Mark is too beautiful for Deacon to pass up an invitation for sex, but beyond sex, Deacon’s not sure. He wants a relationship, but a difficult family situation prevents him from pursuing anything beyond his studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark and Deacon’s affair heats up as the war between their fraternities escalates. They explore kinks they didn’t know they had while keeping their liaison a secret from their brothers. But what Romeo and Juliet didn’t teach these star-crossed lovers is how to move beyond sex and into a place where they share more than a bed. That’s something they’ll have to figure out on their own—if the friction between their houses, and between Mark and America, doesn’t tear them apart.</description>

  <description>After being dumped by his longtime girlfriend, twenty-eight-year-old Justin Halpern found himself living at home with his seventy-three-year-old dad. Sam Halpern, who is "like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair," has never minced words, and when Justin moved back home, he began to record all the ridiculous things his dad said to him:&lt;blockquote&gt;"That woman was sexy. . . . Out of your league? Son, let women figure out why they won't screw you. Don't do it for them."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Do people your age know how to comb their hair? It looks like two squirrels crawled on their heads and started fucking."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The worst thing you can be is a liar. . . . Okay, fine, yes, the worst thing you can be is a Nazi, but then number two is liar. Nazi one, liar two."&lt;/blockquote&gt;More than a million people now follow Mr. Halpern's philosophical musings on Twitter, and in this book, his son weaves a brilliantly funny, touching coming-of-age memoir around the best of his quotes. An all-American story that unfolds on the Little League field, in Denny's, during excruciating family road trips, and, most frequently, in the Halperns' kitchen over bowls of Grape-Nuts, &lt;em&gt;Sh*t My Dad Says&lt;/em&gt; is a chaotic, hilarious, true portrait of a father-son relationship from a major new comic voice.</description>

  <description>Introverted young reporter Garrett Kowalski is unprepared for the reality of his weekend assignment at the Folsom Street Fair, where he's assigned to interview porn stars, including Justin. Garrett has no choice but to come out of his shell when Justin and his co-worker tease him up onto the stage for a live demonstration. That might have been that, just a one-off job but Garrett takes advantage of follow-up fact checking for his article to get to know Justin better... and it leads to an unexpected friendship and flirtation that just might grow into something more.</description>

  <description>"This is Beautiful Music for Ugly Children, on community radio 90.3, KZUK. I'm Gabe. Welcome to my show."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My birth name is Elizabeth, but I'm a guy. Gabe. My parents think I've gone crazy and the rest of the world is happy to agree with them, but I know I'm right. I've been a boy my whole life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you think about it, I'm like a record. Elizabeth is my A side, the song everybody knows, and Gabe is my B side--not heard as often, but just as good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's time to let my B side play.</description>

  <description>Within her walls are stories. Love. Laughter. Tears. Lives lived to the fullest, and sometimes cut short before they really get started. She’s seen it all, from homelessness to super-stardom, boys dressed as girls, girls dressed as lamps, and boy, does she have secrets she could tell. Her one truth is that everyone who darkens her doors is accepted with open arms and a song.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Her name is &lt;em&gt;Queers&lt;/em&gt;, and for one of L.A.’s few dueling piano bars, she has a lot of heart. On her stage, the beautiful voice of Duff McKinley rings so true he captures the shattered heart of his boss, Brad Mosely, who checked out of life three years ago. But even lifelong dreams have untold consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Duff came to L.A. to chase his musical aspirations, but his best friend Garrett Slater accompanied him to chase a wish of his own: finding The One, his white knight. He believes Landon Kennedy fits the bill. Suave, handsome, and powerful in the music industry, Landon can show Garrett a life he's only seen in movies. But even as Landon helps Duff realize his dreams, he brings Garrett into a nightmare he may never leave, one from which Garrett's roommate, Jackson Moriarty, is determined to rescue him. If Garrett repays Jackson by seeing his own charms, so much the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Yes, within her walls, &lt;em&gt;Queers&lt;/em&gt; has long history. Unrequited love, sinister intentions, fame, fortune, and a group of friends and lovers who would do anything for each other no matter the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLvIPltJCiQ" rel="nofollow"&gt;QUEERS BOOK TRAILER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product warning: this book contains vivid descriptions of domestic violence and may not be suitable for everyone.

  <description>"An imprisoned heart finds escape in forbidden love. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No pride. No privacy. No hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Academic John Gilliam thought being caught embracing another man was the worst that could happen. Until he agrees to "treatment" at an asylum, where a vicious attack leaves him shaken and afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But having all means of writing or reading taken from him... "That" is a serious threat to his sanity. Then a moment of kindness from an asylum attendant begins to restore his dignity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Tully feels sorry for the patient everyone calls "the professor," but with a back injury that cost him his job on the docks-and without the education that would have bettered his position-he tries to keep his head down, and a tight lid on his attraction to men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As John prays for freedom, he grows closer to the gentle, innately intelligent Tully. In spite of themselves, forbidden attraction leads to touches, kisses, and more. But there's something other than curative treatments going on at the asylum. When John and Tully uncover a heinous conspiracy, their very lives are in danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains heinous crimes and frightening treatments-oh, and some sweet and loving sexy times between two healthy, not-crazy men.</description>

  <description>After inheriting a Georgian house in London, Zack Daniels, millionaire art dealer, becomes obsessed with a portrait of the home’s former owner, Lord Alexander Swift. One evening, Zack decides to explore the old house and on entering, the once bricked up cellar finds himself hurled back in time to 1775 and comes face to face with the sweet man of his dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attraction is immediate, and they fall quickly into a whirlwind of erotic delights. Nothing runs smoothly for the tall, muscular, tanned American. Out of place in Alexander’s delicate, refined world, he needs to find his way back to the future – and convince Alexander to go with him. Mistaken for a debtor, beaten, and kidnapped, he must escape and return to Alexander before time runs out.</description>

Whilst Dr Archer battles his inner demons, his superiors begin to suspect that the doctor's interest in his patient may be a little more than merely professional.

  <description>Zach is eighteen. He is bright and articulate. He's also an alcoholic and in rehab instead of high school, but he doesn't remember how he got there. He's not sure he wants to remember. Something bad must have happened. Something really, really bad. Remembering sucks and being alive - well, what's up with that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have it in my head that when we're born, God writes things down on our hearts. See, on some people's hearts he writes Happy and on some people's hearts he writes Sad and on some people's hearts he writes Crazy on some people's hearts he writes Genius and on some people's hearts he writes Angry and on some people's hearts he writes Winner and on some people's hearts he writes Loser. It's all like a game to him. Him.God. And it's all pretty much random. He takes out his pen and starts writing on our blank hearts. When it came to my turn, he wrote Sad. I don't like God very much. Apparently he doesn't like me very much either.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Every relationship leaves something behind. Dumped by his sugar daddy, part-time model Scott Mackenzie somehow ends up owning an abandoned church in rural Ontario. He dreams of using it for gay weddings, even if he’ll never have one of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Sutton is trying to keep his family together after his parents’ deaths. Between the family ranch, his brother’s construction company, and commitments around town, he doesn’t have time for a relationship. But Mackenzie is hard to ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As both men fight their growing attraction, challenges to Mackenzie’s business threaten their relationship. If he can’t make it work, he’ll have to crawl back to the city in defeat. But the only solution involves risking the ranch Joe loves, and each man has to decide how much he’ll sacrifice for the other.</description>

  <description>Follow the lives of two immortals, Dorian Thorne and Mathias Sorensen, from their early years, to the apocalypse and beyond. These two men first cross paths in Victorian London, an encounter which does not leave them on friendly terms. They are fated to meet again though, in the present, the year 2095. From the Embers is not only a story of civilization trying to rebuild after the end of the world, but also one of two men trying to rebuild their wounded and shattered souls out of the ashes of their pasts. It is a voyage of self discovery that takes three hundred years and along the way they find that their lives may not have been by chance. There is a plan behind their immortality and it may be one of sinister design. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mathias Sorensen was born in 1776, near Copenhagen, Denmark. The son of a fisherman, he’d always dreamed of being a painter, but that dream was not meant to be. Instead, his life spirals downhill when, at age nineteen, he meets a man named Gunnar Pederson. Gunnar takes him in, but his cruel appetites destroy Mathias’ life. He eventually flees, but a broken shell of the man he was, whose only recourse is to rebuild himself in the image of his tormentor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorian Thorne was born, thirty-six years later, in the East End of London, England. Caught up in the cholera outbreak of 1832, he learns of his immortality early in life, but at an awful price. Cursed to walk the earth for over a century, unable to remember his early years, he eventually learns that he suppressed these memories because they were too painful. Shunned and forced from the only person he cared about, the experience would scar his ability to let anyone get close to him for the rest of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two men meet, for the first time, in London in 1862, but part three years later after a volatile and unhealthy relationship. It will be over two hundred years before they see each other again, both having found love and loss, been involved in some shady and less than legal situations, witnessed the end of the world, and tried and failed to gain peace and understanding of themselves. In the end, they begin to realize that their lives are somehow, inexplicably, entwined and they find the keys that may just lead to the ultimate explanation of who they are and how they can begin to heal.</description>

  <description>Skin to skin contact is illegal. Sex? A felony. Insulated suits and gloves keep people from even the most platonic touches. Citizens line up in droves at simhouses for their rationed, prescribed orgasms in virtual reality machines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keith Borden has worked in a simhouse for years, and he's never been tempted to break the strict no-contact laws… until Aiden Maxwell comes along. The attractive and dangerously flirtatious patient invites him into the seedy underground where people engage in real, wireless sex. Though Keith stands to lose his career and his freedom, he's curious and Aiden is irresistible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment he sets foot in the wireless lounge, Keith is in a world of flesh and fantasy. He's hooked. On the sex, on the atmosphere, and most of all, on Aiden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years of keeping everyone in his world at arm's length have left Keith craving a human touch, and Aiden offers all the contact--scorching sex, gentle affection, and everything in between--Keith can handle. That is, until an unexpected act of betrayal throws Keith's world into chaos, and he finds himself more alone than he ever imagined possible…</description>

  <description>Twenty years ago, the powerful mage Atrix Wolfe unleashed an uncontrollable force that killed his beloved king. Now, the Queen of the Wood has offered him one last chance for redemption. She asks him to find her daughter, who vanished into the human world during the massacre he caused. No one has seen the princess-but deep in the kitchens of the Castle of Pelucir, there is a scullery maid who appeared out of nowhere one night long ago. She cannot speak and her eyes are full of sadness. But there are those who call her beautiful.</description>

  <description>Presenter Advocate Harte Walford wants to do the right thing and bring a cruel attacker to justice. His father opposes any involvement with the case because the victim may be a pretty boy—a male prostitute who can't possibly pay for Harte's legal assistance. The situation deteriorates when Harte discovers that the perpetrator has powerful connections on the town council. When another boy, Peli, is threatened because he witnessed the crime, Harte must find a way to spirit him out of harms way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smack in the middle of the delicate operation, a new obstacle appears in the form of canny judge veritor, Stilian Cast. Judges Veritor can tell when you're lying. Judge Cast doesn't know why Harte and his band of watchmen have kidnapped Peli, but he's positive Peli was betrayed. When things appear as if they can't get any worse, Harte finds himself thinking the craggy judge is really handsome. Is it getting hot in here? Why are my breeches so tight? Yes, that kind of handsome.</description>

  <description>When bullies chase Jonah Winfield to the front step of Avakian Music, owner Davoud Avakian intervenes and offers Jonah sanctuary among the lush chords of the Music Box’s Steinway Grand. Jonah’s sexuality isn’t a problem for Avakian, but it’s an issue the kids at school won’t allow Jonah to forget—whether he’s ready to deal with it or not. When the bullying escalates to violence, Jonah's favorite music teacher, Mr. Gaston, wants to take the bullies to the principal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking up for his favorite student may bring Paul Gaston’s own sexuality up for debate, and with budget cuts looming, he’s already on shaky ground. Forcing Jonah to do anything will only make matters worse. Getting Jonah’s cooperation requires earning his trust and helping to preserve the sanctuary of the Music Box. But the generations old music store handed down to Davoud is on the verge of bankruptcy. If Paul and Davoud can’t figure out how to turn the business around, everyone will feel the loss.</description>

  <description>For Jace Bennett and Elias James monsters are no myth. In their world, no one sweet talks vampires or cuddles werewolves. The night is dark and the unnatural creatures lurking in it dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holding back the shadow, hunters protect an oblivious population. Once filled with ideals, Jace now hunts to avenge his family. Elias, true to his incubus nature, kills to live. When fate brings the natural born enemies together, they form an unlikely alliance to save a town from blood thirsty ghosts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparks fly and attraction flares, but when Jace learns Elias isn’t human, prejudice threatens their fragile bond. A threat from a common enemy forces them back together and Elias’ unexpectedly humane actions cast Jace’s black and white convictions into shadow. Shaken and facing an impossible choice, can Jace learn to redefine monster in time to save them?</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Gage Harris is not a part of twenty-five year old Trent Foster’s plans. He likes Gage but the intense attraction between them makes remaining just friends unlikely, and the young farmer with two small children is a complication Trent doesn’t need. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite all the reasons to stay away, Trent is pulled into the small family. Gage’s boys are delightful and the young man’s honesty and genuine affection impossible to resist.  Trent is intrigued by a life so different from everything he’s known. As he struggles to reconcile his plans with his feelings Trent begins to suspect that his random offer of a ride in the rain might lead straight to his last first kiss.</description>

  <description>Braden Mikelson is one step away from getting benched. Even though he started on the basketball team with high hopes, his recent performance may put his position at risk. But focusing during the game is hard when he can’t get the team captain out of his mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Team captain, Connor Matthews, is the golden child of the entire school. Top grades, girls swooning at every glance, and the athletic skills to boot. What people don’t know is that Connor has a secret deep in the closet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, at the end of practice when Braden and Connor are alone, Braden’s lustful thoughts become difficult to conceal. Will Connor see through Braden’s desires or can Braden keep up his charade? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mature content: Readers ages 18+</description>

  <description>Can three broken pieces make a whole?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josiah Evans is the orphan who lost both his parents. He’s sweet, shy, and all heart. He wants nothing more than to be loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mateo Sanchez is the son of a gang leader. He’s seen it all, and never hesitates to do what needs to be done, no matter what it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tristan Croft is the wealthy attorney who clawed his way up from the bottom to rule his own world. He’ll never depend on anyone but himself again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three men who couldn’t be more different…and yet, as their lives intersect they find an uncommon balance that calms the storms inside each of them, and ignites fires hotter than they ever thought imaginable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told uniquely in three parts and spanning over ten years, BROKEN PIECES is a journey of healing for three fragmented souls, finding love in the unlikeliest of places—with each other.</description>

  <description>There's no point beating around the bush. I like it rough. Hard enough to bring tears to my eyes and long enough I forget everything but how good it feels. Tonight I'm ready for a new playmate. When my eyes met his across the bar, I knew I was in for the ride of my life.</description>

  <description>A Delectable Novel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;World-class chef Joshua Golden is homesick for Paris before he even arrives in New York, but he’ll endure it—his parents need him to help run the family restaurant while his mother recovers from surgery. Running a place so far beneath his talents is bad enough, but bad turns to worse when Josh discovers his former best friend and lover, Micah Solomon, is living at his parents’ house with his ten-year-old son, Ethan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For ten years, Josh has done his best to forget how Micah shattered his heart into tiny pieces. Now Micah’s back, fresh out of prison, and helping out at the restaurant. Micah may not be the kind of sous chef Josh is used to, but he is more helpful and supportive than any of the other employees. But Josh finds it hard to keep his distance when, time after time, Micah proves himself a better man than Josh thought. Reluctantly, Josh realizes there is more to Micah than his lousy life choices… but that doesn’t mean Josh is ready to forgive him.</description>

  <description>Every Christmas, child chorister Jonah Lennox used to meet Callum Noakes at Aylminster cathedral when Callum's mother came to sell roasted chestnuts at the market. After years of friendship, an argument separates them, apparently forever. Putting away the memories of his lost friend, Jonah left the cathedral and moved on with his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jonah returns to the cathedral after ten years away, the market in the cathedral brings back memories—and Callum, who has made a life for himself as a woodturner. Upon meeting again, attraction pulls them together, and the holiday may inspire their old friendship to mature into new romance.</description>

  <description>Rose Hathaway's life will never be the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recent attack on St. Vladimir's Academy devastated the entire Moroi world. Many are dead. And, for the few victims carried off by Strigoi, their fates are even worse. A rare tattoo now adorns Rose's neck, a mark that says she's killed far too many Strigoi to count. But only one victim matters ... Dimitri Belikov. Rose must now choose one of two very different paths: honoring her life's vow to protect Lissa—her best friend and the last surviving Dragomir princess—or, dropping out of the Academy to strike out on her own and hunt down the man she loves. She'll have to go to the ends of the earth to find Dimitri and keep the promise he begged her to make. But the question is, when the time comes, will he want to be saved? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, with everything at stake—and worlds away from St. Vladimir's and her unguarded, vulnerable, and newly rebellious best friend—can Rose find the strength to destroy Dimitri? Or, will she sacrifice herself for a chance at eternal love?</description>

  <description>THEIR SOULS, REAWAKENED.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When 13-year-old Lilix Morgan is found alive and floating on a bed of ice at sea, everyone counts it a miracle. Kidnapped nearly four weeks earlier, she remembers nothing of her mysterious abduction. When she tries to remember what happened, she hears only a melody – a faint and delicate set of notes, strung together in a tune she doesn’t understand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THEIR POWER, UNMATCHED.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later and desperate to put the lingering nightmares of her past behind her, Lilix crosses the country to enroll at Baelmorte Academy, aiming to become the violinist she once dreamt of. Things seem to be finally going well, and Lilix settles into a routine of sheet music and inspiration among new friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the dreams start. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The melody and night terrors she thought she’d left behind return with a vengeance, threatening to ruin her fragile version of normalcy. Then an unlikely ally tells her that she isn’t alone. That there are others just like her, fighting to hide their own shocking truths from coming to light. That they know who she is, and what she’s been through. Now, accompanied by four other girls, Lilix discovers her nightmares are larger than a single trauma; they’re a window to a hidden part of her soul, a place of immense power with a destiny that cannot be ignored. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THEIR BATTLE, IS ONLY BEGINNING.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this knowledge comes a new and frightening reality. For Lilix has been reawakened to stop an age-old enemy, one thought to have been destroyed centuries ago. Trapped by her destiny, Lilix is torn between what feels right and what she remembers. Her memories tell her of a star-crossed love waiting to be reunited, of friendships and trust broken in the past. But can she save that love when reality brings her an enemy, and an evil that will be the undoing of them all if they don’t destroy it?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Garden Spells&lt;/em&gt; comes a novel about heartbroken people finding hope at a magical place in Georgia called Lost Lake.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suley, Georgia, is home to Lost Lake Cottages and not much else.  Which is why it's the perfect place for newly-widowed Kate and her eccentric eight-year-old daughter Devin to heal.  Kate spent one memorable childhood summer at Lost Lake, had her first almost-kiss at Lost Lake, and met a boy named Wes at Lost Lake.  It was a place for dreaming.  But Kate doesn't believe in dreams anymore, and her Aunt Eby, Lost Lake's owner, wants to sell the place and move on.  Lost Lake's magic is gone.  As Kate discovers that time has a way of standing still at Lost Lake can she bring the cottages—and her heart—back to life?  Because sometimes the things you love have a funny way of turning up again.  And sometimes you never even know they were lost . . . until they are found.</description>

  <description>32 year old Sebastian Vanwell, was a very successful yacht broker, who always loved the design and architecture of a luxurious boat. His only addiction was being on the water. He loved it, he thrived on it, and he needed it in his life. After a very stable, loving child hood with only a few bumps, Sebastian married the love of his life. The one person that he knew would always be there. Julia was his rock, and he loved her more than life itself. Sebastian kept his addiction to the water under control, wanting to keep his time with his wife and son his number one obsession, that was until he saw her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new addiction haunted him, the one compulsion that he couldn't control no matter how hard he tried. Ysabelle Telle hit him hard, knocking the wind from his lungs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming from worlds apart, beautiful, dark complexion Ysabelle Telle didn't have the rich, protected background that Sebastian Vanwell had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ysabelle lived a life of hell, in poverty, growing up with a drug addict mother that never cared, and horrific living conditions. Ysabelle lived for one person and one person only; herself. She was pure perfection, her beauty along with a flawless body had men lined up, driveling over her insuring her success as a VIP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are too many words that describe the effects when two diverse worlds like theirs collide. They both have too much to lose to get caught in the forceful pull, which could destroy them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning sex/drugs/language. Mature readers only.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this fun, scorching-hot eBook original romance by Ruthie Knox, a cross-country bike adventure takes a detour into unexplored passion. As readers will discover, &lt;em&gt;Ride with Me&lt;/em&gt; is not about the bike!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; When Lexie Marshall places an ad for a cycling companion, she hopes to find someone friendly and fun to cross the TransAmerica Trail with. Instead, she gets Tom Geiger—a lean, sexy loner whose bad attitude threatens to spoil the adventure she’s spent years planning.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Roped into the cycling equivalent of a blind date by his sister, Tom doesn’t want to ride with a chatty, go-by-the-map kind of woman, and he certainly doesn’t want to want her. Too bad the sight of Lexie with a bike between her thighs really turns his crank.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Even Tom’s stubborn determination to keep Lexie at a distance can’t stop a kiss from leading to endless nights of hotter-than-hot sex. But when the wild ride ends, where will they go next?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: &lt;em&gt;In the Arms of the Law, Ivy Secrets, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Because of You&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winning what you want may cost you everything you love&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a general’s daughter in a vast empire that revels in war and enslaves those it conquers, seventeen-year-old Kestrel has two choices: she can join the military or get married. But Kestrel has other intentions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, she is startled to find a kindred spirit in a young slave up for auction. Arin’s eyes seem to defy everything and everyone. Following her instinct, Kestrel buys him—with unexpected consequences. It’s not long before she has to hide her growing love for Arin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he, too, has a secret, and Kestrel quickly learns that the price she paid for a fellow human is much higher than she ever could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a richly imagined new world, &lt;em&gt;The Winner’s Curse&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Rutkoski is a story of deadly games where everything is at stake, and the gamble is whether you will keep your head or lose your heart.</description>

  <description>In the week since Lela returned to Rhode Island as Captain of the Guard with Malachi as her second in command, local news has been dominated by chilling sightings of human-like creatures running on all fours. Lela knows there’s only one explanation: the Mazikin have arrived in the land of the living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needing to maintain the appearance of a normal life for her foster mother, her probation officer, and her classmates, Lela returns to Warwick High along with Malachi. At night they secretly hunt for the Mazikin nest. To assist, two new Guards from very different parts of the Shadowlands are assigned to Lela’s unit, including the bad boy Jim, who repeatedly challenges Lela's authority. Lela struggles to keep all her Guards on the right side of the law, but their mistakes come at a terrible cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one painful revelation follows another and the Mazikin start targeting those closest to her, Lela finds herself more vulnerable than she’s ever been, wanting a future more than she ever has. With an enemy determined to separate soul from body, one question remains: how much is she willing to sacrifice to protect those she loves?</description>

  <description>Luka Krachec immigrates to the United States to find his cousin dead and his cousin’s wife hospitalized after a terrible accident. He meets Peter Montgomery at the funeral. The American seems nice and captures Luka’s attention when he offers to help him with his English. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter has spent most of his life believing he shot his father at age six, and his family uses his regret and overwhelming guilt to keep him under their proverbial thumbs. Peter does his best to make up for what he did by helping others, and agreeing to help Luka with his English yields something amazing when they hit it off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Peter opens up to Luka about what happened when he was a child, Luka senses some holes in the story and suspects Peter needs some help, so he approaches the head of the psychology department at the college where he works. Neither expects to open a long-barricaded door to secrets, denial, and family manipulation.</description>

  <description>A perfect life. A perfect home. A perfect husband. Gone in an instant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ian’s world turned upside down the day Travis walked out without so much as a word, or even a backward glance, leaving a lonely Ian to wonder why. Their son implores him, “Please go see Dad.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years of hurt leaves Ian ready to confront the man who’d broken his heart, but what if everything he’d believed about their failed romance turned out to be wrong? What if the biggest problem in Ian’s marriage was…Ian?</description>

  <description>The forest is full of secrets, and no one understands that better than Cade. Foraging, hunting, surviving— that’s all he knows. Alone for years, Cade believes he’s the sole survivor. At least, until he catches a glimpse of a beautiful stranger…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dara expected to find natural wonders when she set off for a spring break camping trip. Instead, she discovers a primitive boy— he’s stealthy and handsome and he might be following her. Intrigued, Dara seeks him out and sets a catastrophe in motion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrust back into society, Cade struggles with the realization that the life he knew was a lie. But he’s not the only one. Trying to explain life in a normal town leaves Dara questioning it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the media swarm and the police close in, Dara and Cade risk everything to get closer. But will the truth about Cade’s past tear them apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A YA Tarzan retelling.</description>

  <description>I'm not crazy. I don't see what the big deal is about what happened. But apparently someone does think it's a big deal because here I am. I bet it was my mother. She always overreacts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Jeff wakes up on New Year's Day to find himself in the hospital. Make that the psychiatric ward. With the nutjobs. Clearly, this is all a huge mistake. Forget about the bandages on his wrists and the notes on his chart. Forget about his problems with his best friend, Allie, and her boyfriend, Burke. Jeff's perfectly fine, perfectly normal, not like the other kids in the hospital with him. Now they've got problems. But a funny thing happens as his forty-five-day sentence drags on—the crazies start to seem less crazy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compelling, witty, and refreshingly real, &lt;em&gt;Suicide Notes&lt;/em&gt; is a darkly humorous novel from award-winning author Michael Thomas Ford that examines that fuzzy line between "normal" and the rest of us.</description>

  <description>Under the bubbling hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone National Park is a supervolcano. Most people don't know it's there. The caldera is so large that it can only be seen from a plane or satellite. It just could be overdue for an eruption, which would change the landscape and climate of our planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Alex, being left alone for the weekend means having the freedom to play computer games and hang out with his friends without hassle from his mother. Then the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, plunging his hometown into a nightmare of darkness, ash, and violence. Alex begins a harrowing trek to seach for his family and finds help in Darla, a travel partner he meets along the way. Together they must find the strength and skills to survive and outlast an epic disaster.</description>

  <description>In the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person’s consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or “sleeve”) making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex-U.N. envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Dispatched one hundred eighty light-years from home, re-sleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco, now with a rusted, dilapidated Golden Gate Bridge), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats “existence” as something that can be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Siddran is probably the most unloved kid in school. He lives in a trailer. His father is a drunkard and his mother is a whore and they both don't care about him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake, on the other hand, is the school jock who bullies almost everyone in school, except Siddran. Nobody sits beside him in school because he looks trashy and he's a bully. But Siddran has been nice to him ever since they first started going to school together and doesn't mind sitting beside him. This eventually led them to become close friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day however Jake invites Siddran for a dinner in his house. Sidd is surprised to see a big beautiful house. Nobody ever suspected Jake of living in a nice place because he wears trashy second-hand clothes and drives an old beat up junker. But here it is, Jake's mini mansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the initial shock Sidd is welcomed by Jake's parents. Dinner is superb and Sidd gives his compliments. Jake's parents are happy to know that Jake has a friend and that this one friend is well-mannered. Sidd begins to visit more and more often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake begins a personal journey and transformation thereafter. He starts to dress and act like a decent human being and Sidd gets a makeover too, as gratitude for bringing about Jake's big change. Until one night, Jake asks Sidd to move in...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Sidd take it? If he does, will Jake still be the same? Or will he turn into someone Sidd never thought he would be...</description>

  <description>“It’s not fair. I should be able to love you without fear of being found out…” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will and John meet while serving in the Royal Navy. They are both good at their jobs and have promising careers, but life isn’t a bed of roses for two gay, infatuated Navy men - being together couldn’t just end their careers, it was also illegal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With John still shy of 21, the legal age for homosexual acts, they have to be very careful not to get caught. Still, no one can stop them from being together. Will buys a house off-base and they go away on weekends to spend whatever time they could together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a love so strong can’t be kept secret for very long… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their relationship is discovered, Will and John have to be stronger than ever. After all, two gorgeous men in love have to deal with a law that is against them, a society that judges them, and, in some instances, other gay men who want to challenge their monogamy and bed them! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*A Gay Romance for mature audiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAMPLE 1: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The showers and tooth cleaning were completed almost at the speed of light. Will had put a tube of KY Gel by the bed, just in case, but he would be quite happy if they never got beyond frottage, or hand jobs. This wasn’t a one night wonder; he was contemplating a long term relationship here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They did start out almost glued together down the whole length of their bodies as they tried to devour each other’s mouths. Will had the added delight of being able to run his hand down the length of John’s body, caressing the perfect little behind, feeling the contours where it fell away into the crack that divided the two cheeks. He ran a finger down the crack and touched the rosebud. No hair, and it felt incredible. He could feel the puckering around the entry to Paradise, and John gasped. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I love you Will, I think I have for a long time.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SAMPLE 2: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will did, and nearly wet himself when Shareef told him to hold them wider and to bring the knees down further. The view then was amazing and had Will gasping. Shareef’s huge cock slowly sliding in and out of Ahmed‘s cute arse was so erotic Will could feel the precum soaking his shorts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John could see the look on Wills’ face and dropped onto his knees to see the wet patch. He took pity on his lover, walked round behind Will, sat on the cockpit seat, and undid Will’s shorts. He dropped them and started playing with a cock as hard as he could ever remember. He whispered to Will. “Quite a turn on, Lover?” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will was loving it and replied, breathlessly, “Are you kidding? I have never seen anything as erotic as this in my life.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John was very wicked then. He slipped off his own shorts, grabbed the lube that was convenient on the adjacent cockpit seat and after using it, gently slid into Will. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You wicked man. But please don’t stop.”</description>

  <description>For eight years, Liam has been trapped underground in The Colony—a sanctuary so determined to stay hidden it forbids anyone from leaving once they've entered. His only hope of returning home rests on his best friend Riley who, on the eve of their escape, slipped into a coma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite staggering debt, vengeful mutants and bounty hunters, Liam continues a seemingly never-ending quest for a cure to end Riley's unnatural five-year sleep. Every night, Liam stares at the listless man who not only holds his escape, but his heart. The suffering can end, however; Liam must only forsake all hope of ever returning home again, abandon Riley to his fate, and wholeheartedly serve as a soldier for The Colony—the very people he's trying to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Live the life within his reach, or continue chasing the one just beyond his grasp? He need only submit.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This title is part of the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9745914.2010_Advent_Calendar__Naughty_or_Nice" title="2010 Advent Calendar: Naughty or Nice"&gt;2010 Advent Calendar: Naughty or Nice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a perfect moment of cold November sunshine, pudgy accountant Kit Allen realizes Jesse, his new office assistant, is everything he's ever dreamed about in a man. Feeling supremely unworthy and desperate to get a life—even an imaginary one—Kit embarks on a self-improvement campaign featuring DVD fitness guru, Danny Fit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, Jesse has begun a subtle campaign of his own, one designed to bring Kit out of his DVD dream world and into Jesse's arms. Jesse isn't perfect—he's no Danny Fit—but he hopes that the kind, funny man who has been looking at him so soulfully since his first day at work has what it takes to be everything Jesse has always wanted.</description>

  <description>Eight thousand candidates sign up for the Suicide Game. Only one can win. Their destination: the Night Stadium, a place of makeup and music, fear and adrenaline, blood and romance, celebration and death.&lt;br&gt;Each candidate has his or her own reason for entering the Game. The Council runs the Game. The outcome of the Game is left to fate...in the laps of the gods. The candidates will jump to their deaths in order to win everything, before capacity crowds in the Stadium. The public follows every jump, live on TV and on their mobile screens, choosing their favorite candidates and betting on their lives. &lt;br&gt;The Game’s community also includes geeks, mafia, makeup artists, master chefs, models, musicians, ordinary workers, spies, terrorists, and many others. SG - Suicide Game is the story of the candidates’ journey. It boldly imagines a place where death and denial are interwoven with hope, choices and the innate desire for happiness. Impressive in the totality of its vision, it is an exploration of the best and worst things in our lives, nightmares and especially, our dreams</description>

  <description>Beth Brown doesn’t believe in premonitions until she dreams a sexy stranger is gunned down during the brutal hijacking of a commercial airliner. When events in her dream start coming true, she heads to the flight’s departure gate. To her shock, she recognizes the man she’d watched die the night before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lieutenant Commander Zane Winters comes from a bloodline of elite warriors with psychic abilities. When Zane and two of his platoon buddies arrive at Sea-Tac Airport, he has a vision of his teammates’ corpses. Then she arrives—a leggy blonde who sets off a different kind of alarm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Beth teams up with Zane, they discover the hijacking is the first step in a secret cartel’s deadly global agenda and that key personnel within the FBI are compromised. To survive the forces mobilizing against them, Beth will need to open herself to a psychic connection with the sexy SEAL who claims to be her soul mate.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When Mr. Wrong measures up just right!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;College tart Felix McAvoy is used to causing a stir with his conceptual art pranks, but for his final show he's planning something even more outrageous. In a last ditch attempt to seduce his jaded tutor, Felix plans to wear the canvas in a subversive display. However, if he's going to do this right he'll need a tailor-made canvas suit. Fortunately, he knows just the tailor to turn to for the favour—and Felix isn't shy about offering favours of a very different kind in return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First year fashion student Andrew Wheeler knows Felix by reputation only—and plans to keep things that way. Andrew's determined to save himself for the man of his dreams, and Felix couldn't be more different from his ideal Mr. Right.  There's only one use Andrew will contemplate for Felix's body: a model for his end of year project. Trouble is, it's going to involve a lot of close contact with a nearly naked Felix, and Andrew's never had temptation quite so close at hand...</description>

One faces eternal bliss while the other is headed straight to hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien has a lot going for him. A recent college graduate, he’s landed the perfect job and has already purchased his first home. What he doesn’t have is someone to share his success with. When his best childhood friend Christian pays him a visit, Damien discovers Christian is headed into the ministry. He’s going to be a missionary to Brazil.

Christian fears that Damien’s hedonistic homosexual lifestyle can lead his friend to one tragic destination: hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two go out for breakfast together and engage in a heated debate. Still upset, Damien pulls out in front of a semi-truck and both of them are hurled into eternity. What happens next? Only the devil knows…</description>

  <description>My name’s Cameron. And I’m a male escort. I’m the best, and most expensive, at what I do. I have one rule—never let anyone in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In five years of hooking I’ve never picked up the wrong guy. But when I met Toronto ad man Trevor Barclay in a Manhattan bar, his soft green eyes and shy smile drew me right in. When I discovered the error I had made, I should have written it off as a mistake and moved on. But memories of the steamy encounter we shared in his hotel room continued to haunt me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I never should have agreed to see him again, but from that very first night he worked his way under my skin and into my heart. I can’t stop thinking about him. But how can I tell him the first man he’s been with in sixteen years sells himself for a living?</description>

  <description>Growing up in foster care has left Kerry Grey with little self-esteem or hope for his future. A college dropout, Kerry scrapes by on a part-time job at a garden nursery. His friendship with his boss and working with the plants are the only high points in Kerry’s life. He’s been dating the man who bullied him at school, but when his boyfriend abandons him at a party, Kerry wanders down the beach to drown his sorrows in a bottle of scotch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malcolm Holmes and Charlie Stone have been together for fifteen years. Despite Charlie's willingness to accept Malcolm's unspoken domination in bed,something is missing from their relationship. Early one morning, they rescue a passed out Kerry from being washed away by the tide and Charlie immediately senses a kindred spirit in the lost younger man. When Kerry’s roommate kicks him out, Malcolm and Charlie invite him into their home. As Charlie and Kerry bond over Charlie’s garden, Malcolm sees Kerry may be just who they have been looking for to complete their lives. All they have to do is show Kerry, and each other, that Kerry's submissive tendencies will fit their dynamic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But someone is sabotaging Kerry at every turn. As he struggles to discover the culprit, he fears for the safety of his new friends. If Malcolm and Charlie cannot help, their lifelong search for their perfect third may not end with the happily ever after they imagined.</description>

  <description>Can an Alpha wolf convince his straight mate to give love a chance, before  an unexpected enemy tries to rob them of all they hold dear…even their own lives?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli Steele is a wolf without a pack. An invitation from his best friend, brings him to Grand Rapids, and a meeting with the local Alpha changes Eli’s life in ways he ever expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kellan Reeves, Alpha of the Grand Rapids Pack, had lost hope of ever finding his mate until Eli came to him, looking for a pack. Realising Eli is his mate, he feels things couldn’t be more perfect…discounting the angry pack Eli left behind. There’s also the insignificant fact that Eli’s not gay. It’s nothing an Alpha wolf can’t handle.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Eli struggles to understand his feelings for Kellan, an unexpected call for help has everyone on edge. As enemies move in and a horrifying plot is revealed, Kellan and Eli fight back, not only for themselves, but for the fate of all shifters.</description>

  <description>When architect Brian Townsend meets a man dressed as Zorro at a Halloween party it seems like a chance hookup, but Brian is attracted and it takes more effort then he originally thought just to find out the man’s name. NYPD homicide detective Tristan Blake, comes from old money, which he loathes and an idealistic streak burns within him to do a job that serves a purpose. A previous lover scorned him as a time when he was most vulnerable, after the death of friend, and Tristan is slow to trust what appears to a developing relationship between him and Brian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beer tasting, a broken window, a fall down a flight of stairs, a grenade and a violent attack on Brian, what do these all have in common? Each one brings Tristan an inch closer to trusting Brian with his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously published as &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/47509-inches-of-trust"&gt;separate short stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>World renowned chef, Prescott Vaughan was at the height of his career. Right before he's to leave for Paris to work alongside his idol, a horrific car accident leaves him completely blind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His female fiancé leaves him in a state of desperation and depression.  He pines for love, companionship, and so happens to find it in the form of his very sexy neighbor.  Sexy male neighbor, Dr. Rickson 'Ric' Edwards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prescott's not gay - at least he never considered himself gay - until Ric saves him from a date, gone terribly wrong. The two neighbors hit it off quickly and waste no time exploring and learning each other.  Things are great until Ric begins to have his doubts about meeting Prescott's many wants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ric insist he and Prescott take a breather, Pres finds himself lonely and miserable again. Enter, male escort and aspiring chef, Blair McKenzie to fill the void. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, Ric works on his issues that prohibit him from displaying the love he knows he has for Prescott. When Ric is finally ready and returns to claim Prescott he's not sure that Pres can let go of the sexy, southern, hotness that is Blair McKenzie. After Ric has his own personal encounter with the sinfully sexy man, he can't help but become entranced and crave more as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pres soon realizes that there's no need to choose between his two men, because when all three of them finally come together - grab a cold drink - because the heat is going to go all the way up! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;​This is not your typical gay ménage romance. Everyone is not happy, skipping along, and loving life. These men are at each other’s throats. They live completely separate lives; fuss, cuss, and fight until they all realize exactly what the problem is...too damn much sexual tension.​</description>

He keeps his two lives scrupulously separate, not wanting his clients to have any idea what he gets up to. Afraid it might ruin him, Dal keeps the wild child firmly in the closet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Dillon, a distant business associate, sees Dal at a club one night, things take a dangerous, and exciting turn. Dillon invites him to what he thinks is a business meeting, but it turns into a weekend of debauchery that sets off a torrid affair. Meeting whenever they can, high-powered Dillon and ambitious Dal explore all of the ways they can love each other, living just enough on the edge to get a thrill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And maybe get caught.

Dillon isn't quite ready to let him go, though, and sets out to get Dal back. Can Dillon convince Dal that some secrets are worth letting out of the bag?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean Michael creates an exciting world where business meets pleasure and all of the games have high stakes in this steamy novel. Wrap it up and take it home!</description>

  <description>On his way home one day Dean comes across an advertisement that offers what any college kid like himself needs the most: money. Despite offering hardly any information beyond the reward for participating, Dean couldn't pass up the opportunity for some easy cash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After going through the application process Dean is the lucky one chosen but it turns out that making the promised money requires far more than just showing up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He soon learns that Dopple research is not the harmless laboratory it seems like. They have the capability to manufacture clones built specifically for sex. And they're looking for volunteers to try out their new process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pumped full of a powerful aphrodisiac (and other drugs) he meets his clone who is eager to serve every one of his desires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To earn the money he has to make a decision: does he indulge in his desire for another man he's kept hidden for years or does he walk away? There's nothing wrong about experimenting with your clone, right?</description>

  <description>Zeus was two months old and the sole survivor on a science vessel in deep space found by the Mar’Sani. The blind infant was swept up by the grieving Empress Ashari and adopted by Emperor Valdor Vondorian as their fourth child. Zeus grew up in a loving home but his frailty as the only human among his strong reptilian brothers caused his parents to seek the help of the Chtichlians, the expert arachnid geneticists, to fix their son’s sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zeus discovers that having his sight is harder than being blind and he learns to not trust his eyes. His family believes he is the reincarnation of their lost child Canry, but there are those Mar’Sani nobles who only see him as the orphaned human, and not worth of the Emperor’s family name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dargon Kal-Turak is a Dar Massaga, he and his symbiote, Alpha; command a ship of manned by members of some of the most dangerous races. After narrowly escaping a trap, Dargon and his crew dock at the spaceport for repairs. It isn’t long before the Psonics have their location. Dargon snatches the Master Mechanic and limps out of port not realizing he has bought more trouble…and maybe the answer to salvaging the Valespian Pact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content Warning: M/M/M-Alien.  Yes, this means that there is hot alien smexin'.</description>

  <description>Tristan Janick is a Lycan descendant of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, an average Warrior of Anat. He's one of the lucky ones who've found his Twin Flame, the one person who's supposed to love him no matter what. Betrayed, broken, and dying he breaks the sacred bond and leaves his life behind. His best friend, Ushna, vows to guard and protect him, keeping him alive, always so close but never touching. Waking up from his half-life after a hunt gone badly, Tristan realizes that he's in love with Ushna, and sets out to seduce his best friend. Overnight, life changes for the two men. Ancient secrets and lies are revealed, setting off a chain of events that test not only Tristan and Ushna's love, but challenge their ability to stay alive when creatures of myth awaken, and absent gods walk the earth once again.</description>

  <description>Christo's life fell apart when his partner of eight years walked out on him. There wasn't even a reason for it: sometimes love just fades, as quickly and mysteriously as it appears in the first place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Damien. Damien's the guy with a different man on his arm for every event, he's smooth and arrogant and always impeccably turned out. Christo hates him. But God, he's gorgeous. Damien could be exactly what Christo needs to get him over John.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's only going to be a fling. Nothing serious, nothing that will affect their working relationship or the rest of their lives. So why are they fighting through the night rather than letting go and walking away? Why does Damien's secretive nature bug Christo so much? And why does he even care that the other man might not be as tough as he pretends to be?</description>

  <description>Devastated after losing his partner of fifteen years to cancer, Dr. Bradford Mitchell tries to escape the emptiness and loss by leaving his life in Seattle behind. Traveling to the Alaskan mountains where he and Jeff often vacationed, Brad reconnects with Mac Cleary, the ruggedly handsome and very straight floatplane pilot who had flown them to Hyline Lake many times in the past. Brad and Mac form an unlikely friendship and buy an old log cabin together, and as he and Mac begin to bring the old cabin back to life, Mac watches Brad come back to life as well, stirring emotions in him he’s never felt for a man before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fear, confusion, and a near tragedy threaten to force the two men apart, they’ll face some tough questions. Can Brad let go of Jeff and the guilt he feels about beginning to care for another man? And can Mac deal with his fears of being gay and accept the fact that he is in love with Brad? It will be a struggle for both men to keep their heads and hearts intact while exploring what life has to offer.</description>

  <description>In this breathtaking debut that reads like Gossip Girl crossed with Twin Peaks, a Queen Bee at a blue-blooded New England prep school stumbles into a murder mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne Dowling practically runs her exclusive academy on New York’s Upper East Side—that is, until she accidentally burns part of it down and gets sent to a prestigious boarding school outside of Boston.  Determined to make it back to New York, Anne could care less about making friends at the preppy Wheatley School. That is, until her roommate Isabella’s body is found in the woods behind the school.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When everyone else is oddly silent, Anne becomes determined to uncover the truth no matter how many rules she has to break to do it.  With the help of Isabella’s twin brother Anthony, and a cute classmate named Brent, Anne discovers that Isabella wasn’t quite the innocent nerdy girl she pretended to be. But someone will do anything to stop Anne’s snooping in this fast-paced, unputdownable read—even if it means framing her for Isabella’s murder.</description>

  <description>As part of the investigation into the murder of a young woman, Seattle P.I. Tony DeMarco poses as a patient of Dr. Jack Halloran, the therapist who treated the victim at a Seattle sex clinic. This isn’t the first time Tony has gone undercover, but it’s the first time he’s wanted to go &lt;em&gt;under cover&lt;/em&gt; with one of his suspects. He can’t help it—Jack Halloran is just the kind of steely-eyed hero Tony goes for. But he’ll have to prove Halloran’s innocence and keep the doctor from finding out about his ruse before he can play Romeo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Halloran has his own issues, including a damaged right arm sustained in the line of duty as a combat surgeon in Iraq and the PTSD that followed. He’s confused to find himself attracted to a new patient, the big, funny Italian with the puppy-dog eyes, and Tony’s humor slips right past Jack’s defenses, making him feel things he thought long buried. But can the doctor and the P.I. find a path to romance despite the secrets between them?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I am red now. It was her first thought of the day, every day, surfacing after a few seconds of fogged, blessed ignorance and sweeping through her like a wave, breaking in her breast with a soundless roar. Hard on its heels came the second wave, crashing into the wreckage left by the first: he is gone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hannah Payne’s life has been devoted to church and family. But after she’s convicted of murder, she awakens to a nightmarish new life. She finds herself lying on a table in a bare room, covered only by a paper gown, with cameras broadcasting her every move to millions at home, for whom observing new Chromes—criminals whose skin color has been genetically altered to match the class of their crime—is a sinister form of entertainment. Hannah is a Red for the crime of murder. The victim, says the State of Texas, was her unborn child, and Hannah is determined to protect the identity of the father, a public figure with whom she shared a fierce and forbidden love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful reimagining of &lt;em&gt;The Scarlet Letter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;When She Woke&lt;/em&gt; is a timely fable about a stigmatized woman struggling to navigate an America of the not-too-distant future, where the line between church and state has been eradicated, and convicted felons are no longer imprisoned but chromed and released back into the population to survive as best they can. In seeking a path to safety in an alien and hostile world, Hannah unknowingly embarks on a journey of self-discovery that forces her to question the values she once held true and the righteousness of a country that politicizes faith and love.</description>

  <description>Cale is a serving-boy at a high-class brothel in the city of Havisham. He isn't one of the courtesans, largely because he's too clumsy to manage seducing anyone, but he does his best as a servant, keeping the wine-glasses filled and the guests happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes when the warlord Darren Kaine visits the establishment. Darren is the new ruler of Havisham and is a brusque, commanding man. Fresh from a war that's lasted over six months, Darren is in no mood for frippery, and chooses Cale to accompany him for the night, rather than any of the courtesans on display.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, Darren so prefers Cale's straightforwardness and simplicity that he decides to make Cale his concubine, and to have Cale visit him at the palace, every night. Stunned by this new turn of events, Cale is further confused by his body's reactions to Darren. Darren is darkly handsome, sexually demanding and absolutely committed to giving his partner pleasure - a fact that has Cale looking forward to his time with Darren, perhaps more than he ought to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darren, too, is in danger of forgetting that Cale is just a tool he uses to slake his lust. For a new ruler, every action comes with a price. Will this one be too steep to pay?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;When a devilish lord and a bluestocking set off on the road to ruin...time is not on their side.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minerva Highwood, one of Spindle Cove's confirmed spinsters, needs to be in Scotland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Sandhurst, Lord Payne, a rake of the first order, needs to be...anywhere but Spindle Cove.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These unlikely partners have one week to&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;•  fake an elopement&lt;br&gt;•  convince family and friends they're in "love"&lt;br&gt;•  outrun armed robbers&lt;br&gt;•  survive their worst nightmares&lt;br&gt;•  travel four hundred miles without killing each other&lt;/blockquote&gt;All while sharing a very small carriage by day and an even smaller bed by night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they don't have time for is their growing attraction. Much less wild passion. And heaven forbid they spend precious hours baring their hearts and souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly one week seems like exactly enough time to find a world of trouble. And maybe...just maybe...love.</description>

  <description>When Trey and Liam meet in boarding school, they couldn’t be more different. Liam is a classical violinist with a scholarship, and Trey is a punk rocker with famous parents. Despite their conflicting backgrounds, they hit it off and bond over their love of music. But after spending every waking hour together, Liam is devastated when Trey leaves school without an explanation. Worse yet, Trey capitalizes on a song they wrote together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven years later, they bump into each other at a charity benefit in New York. Old sparks fly, but Liam hasn’t quite recovered from the pain Trey caused. Liam doesn’t know if any explanation Trey can offer will be enough, or if he can find it in his heart to forgive the only man he’s ever really loved.</description>

  <description>Sky piracy is a bit out of Darian Frey’s league. Fate has not been kind to the captain of the airship Ketty Jay—or his motley crew. They are all running from something. Crake is a daemonist in hiding, traveling with an armored golem and burdened by guilt. Jez is the new navigator, desperate to keep her secret from the rest of the crew. Malvery is a disgraced doctor, drinking himself to death. So when an opportunity arises to steal a chest of gems from a vulnerable airship, Frey can’t pass it up. It’s an easy take—and the payoff will finally make him a rich man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the attack goes horribly wrong, Frey suddenly finds himself the most wanted man in Vardia, trailed by bounty hunters, the elite Century Knights, and the dread queen of the skies, Trinica Dracken. Frey realizes that they’ve been set up to take a fall but doesn’t know the endgame. And the ultimate answer for captain and crew may lie in the legendary hidden pirate town of Retribution Falls. That’s if they can get there without getting blown out of the sky.</description>

  <description>A Texas Piney Woods Story &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rural East Texas, 1931. Preacher’s son Emory Joe Logan and a fiddler from Shreveport, Glory Lands, meet and form a tender bond. When they are caught and arrested for homosexual acts by Sheriff Elihu Bishop, the lawman’s sanctimonious bigotry threatens to rip the young men from their families. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emory Joe’s father, Pastor Charles Logan, is brought to his knees in terror, confusion, and anger. He still regrets not standing up against Bishop when the lawman murdered a youth in cold blood nine years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there’s no longer a choice for the preacher to stand up to the lawman. Cold-blooded justice, bigotry-disguised-as-religion, and hatred take on a whole new meaning when they’re standing on his doorstep, ready to take the son he loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Why is Lady Sophia looking for a lover? &lt;br&gt;And could she seduce the most marriageable man in London?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Sophia Sydney would do anything to ensnare the unattainable Sir Ross Cannon. Her goal: to ruin his reputation and cause a scandal that would be the talk of all London. So she insinuates herself into his life by gaining his trust and living in his house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every morning, her lush presence tempts him beyond all reason . . . the way she bends over the table to serve him the meals she has prepared . . . the way her hands oh, so gently—yet sensuously—brush against him. Every night, she promises with her eyes—and her body—that the hours before dawn could be spent in unbridled passion instead of restless sleep—if only he'd let her share his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows he is falling more in love with her each day. But she never counted on falling in love with &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. And she never dreamed he might very respectably ask for her hand in marriage.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Alt Cover for ISBN 0380802309&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grant Morgan is one of London's most eligible and unattainable bachelors. He's also a powerful member of the Bow Street Runners, and when he's called to the waterfront late one night to investigate a drowning victim, Grant is stunned to recognize the face of Vivien Rose Duvall, a well-known woman of the night. He's even more startled when he realizes that she's alive. With no one to care for her, Grant carries Vivien to his home and revives her, only to learn that she is suffering from amnesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivien hesitantly accepts her handsome rescuer's claim that she is his mistress, despite her misgivings about her true identity. Nevertheless, she can't deny the marks on her throat that prove her near-drowning in the Thames was not an accident, and now she must trust the man who claims her as his paramour, for her life is in danger. As Grant searches for Vivien's attacker, the two find themselves falling in love, all the while struggling to stay one step ahead of the evil forces that will stop at nothing to see Vivien dead.</description>

  <description>Graham Douglas doesn’t do romantic relationships, but he was knocked for a loop when he met Emma Pierce on the set of his last film. As they grew closer, he did everything in his power to keep from falling for a girl being pursued by superstar Reid Alexander. Now home in New York, his life is once again under control, until Emma appears and shows him how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; over her he is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma Pierce is forsaking an up-and-coming Hollywood career to embark on a life she’s only dreamed of—the life of a regular girl. After spending months burying her feelings for the two night-and-day guys who vied for her heart while filming her last movie, a twist of fate puts her in a coffee shop in the middle of Manhattan with the one she still misses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke Cameron was a fresh-faced Texas girl when she arrived in LA. Now she’s a beach sitcom star turned conceited heiress on the big screen. Having just survived three months on location with her ex—Hollywood’s reigning golden boy—she’s older and wiser and has set her sights on her close friend Graham. The only thing standing in her way is the girl he can’t forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reid Alexander can sum up his life in one word: &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Between film projects, there’s little going on outside of interviews, photo shoots, and the premiere of the film he finished last fall. The next-to-last thing he expects is to get a second chance with Emma, the girl who rejected him. The last thing he expects is for his still-bitter-ex to be the one to offer it to him on a platter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Mature Young Adult / New Adult)</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Welcome to Sutton Station: One of the world’s largest working farms in the middle of Australia – where if the animals and heat don’t kill you first, your heart just might. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie Sutton runs Sutton Station the only way he knows how; the way his father did before him. Determined to keep his head down and his heart in check, Charlie swears the red dirt that surrounds him – isolates him – runs through his veins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American agronomy student Travis Craig arrives at Sutton Station to see how farmers make a living from one of the harshest environments on earth. But it’s not the barren, brutal and totally beautiful landscapes that capture him so completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the man with the red dirt heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Please note: This book is set in Australia, using Australian English and lingo. &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Zayn has special powers she cannot control—powers that others fear and covet. Powers that cause the Templar Knights to burn Zayn’s mother at the stake for witchcraft. When a mysterious stranger tempts Zayn to become the first female member of the heretical Assassins, the chance to seek her revenge lures her in. She trains to harness her supernatural strength and agility, and then enters the King of Jerusalem's court in disguise with the assignment to assassinate Guy de Molay, her mother’s condemner. But once there, she discovers Earic Goodwin, the childhood friend who still holds her heart, among the knights—and his ocean-blue eyes don’t miss a thing. Will vengeance be worth the life of the one love she has left?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>What if all the legends you’ve learned were wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brutally attacked by one god and unfairly cursed by another she faithfully served, Medusa has spent the last two thousand years living out her punishment on an enchanted isle in the Aegean Sea. A far cry from the monster legends depict, she’s spent her time educating herself, gardening, and desperately trying to frighten away adventure seekers who occasionally end up, much to her dismay, as statues when they manage to catch her off guard.  As time marches on without her, Medusa wishes for nothing more than to be given a second chance at a life stolen away at far too young an age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then comes a day when Hermes, one of the few friends she still has and the only deity she trusts, petitions the rest of the gods and goddesses to reverse the curse. Thus begins a journey toward healing and redemption, of reclaiming a life after tragedy, and of just how powerful friendship and love can be—because sometimes, you have to sink in the deep end of the sea before you can rise back up again.</description>

  <description>Every day, Daniel Schroeder breaks his father’s heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While forgetting your problems won’t solve them, it does seem like it would make life a heck of a lot easier. Daniel thought so once. Now he knows better. He and Big Dan have always been close, which makes it all the more difficult to break the daily news: the last five years were nothing like his father remembers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re both professionals in the memory field—they even run their own memory palace. So shouldn’t they be able to figure out a way to overwrite the persistent false memory that’s wreaking havoc on both of their lives? Daniel thought he was holding it together, but the situation seems to be sliding out of control. Now even his own equipment has turned against him, reminding him he hasn’t had a date in ages by taunting him with flashes of an elusive man in black that only he can see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it some quirk of the circuitry, or is Daniel headed down the same path to fantasy-land as his old man?</description>

  <description>An unlikely savior emerges to prevent the advent of mass destruction and genocide descending on the world…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Los Angeles, 2040. &lt;/strong&gt;When the terrorist known as Medusa threatens to kill millions with a stolen nuclear bomb, Nick Jameson makes a fateful decision. He reveals himself on global television as a Daywalker - a vampire with a soul. To save Los Angeles, Nick exposes not only his own gifts but three separate cultures based on millennia-old magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three metahuman races exist in careful balance, working to maintain a fragile peace. Nick and his fellow Daywalkers successfully master their natural bloodlust. The Sentinels, armed with both magic and steel, repress their warlike instincts. And even some Nightwalkers, normally their natural enemies, have deserted the Court of Shadows to join the triple alliance. Nick Jameson is deeply involved with two such Nightwalkers - handsome Lorcan and powerful Rory. Both men love Nick. But neither can protect the new Ambassador to Humanity from the events he has set in motion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;By the Sword&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeremy Harkness was lured into Medusa's service under false pretenses. A loner with no one and nothing to cling to, he was willing to die for his cause. But the night Medusa tried to obliterate Los Angeles, Jeremy met Nick Jameson, triggering the onset of his own psychic gifts. For Jeremy is the third race of metahuman, a Sentinel, born to kill the Nightwalkers with no quarter asked or offered. And neither Medusa nor the Court of Shadows will settle for peace when they can make war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Betrayal and treachery lurk around every corner on the road to coexistence, and at every turn, Nick must question who to trust among his metahuman allies, friends, and lovers—before their civilization is plunged into the depths of darkness and bloodshed. With millennia-old magic, emerging romance, and ever-shifting allegiances, this inventive series unveils a scintillating, homoerotic world of Nightwalkers, Daywalkers, Sentinels, and Humans, who battle for world dominance in the not-too-distant future.</description>

  <description>A Harmony Ink Press Young Adult Title &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam Jameson has always felt like an outsider in his own home, where his parents’ constant efforts to instill religious fervor have instead filled him with fear. Most of the time, he just wants to stay out of everybody’s way. But when Adam is forced to volunteer at a homeless shelter his senior year in high school, everything changes. He’s introduced to people who care about more than religion and, as a result, he starts to come out of his shell. For the first time in his life, Adam finds people who he wants to be around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mickey Stafford lives on the streets, a teen kicked out by his parents for being gay. He comes to the shelter for food and medical care, and after they literally run into each other, the two boys strike up a friendship. As Mickey introduces his new friend to the world he lives in, Adam starts to question everything: his parents, their religion, even his own beliefs. Once Mickey kisses him, Adam starts soul-searching and finds his heart, which is full of love for Mickey. But these two young men will have their love put to the test as they face a future of uncertainty and fear.</description>

  <description>Simon Roberts’ plan for his senior year is simple -- help his high school hockey team win the state championship and earn a college scholarship so he can get away from his dysfunctional family, especially his belligerent father and obnoxious older brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Central High Falcons open their season with an away game, Simon is forced to deal with the problem he’s struggled with for months -- his crush on teammate Alex Miller. After the game that night, Alex makes an unexpected announcement -- he’s gay, and in love with Simon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon’s elated but scared to openly acknowledge that he’s gay, especially with so much at stake in their senior year. Now that they’re out to each other they have to decide what to do next. Should they date? Should they keep things between them secret? What about the team? Can Simon and Alex hide that they’re more than friends from the guys they spend so much time with?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a simple kiss is witnessed and their secret is out. The team fractures, and Simon’s family explodes as news about the gay hockey players quickly spreads. The guys must figure out how to move forward with everyone watching. Being the center of attention was in no way part of Simon’s plan for the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Simon juggle school, commitments to the team, his new relationship, and an unexpected tragedy all before the end of the hockey season?</description>

  <description>Book one in the Smuggler's Cove Series. Wounded in Iraq, Dean Hudson is forced to give up his dream of a career in the Marine Corps. Nearly recovered from the physical wounds that left him scarred, he resigns himself to a life alone, and begins to deal with the emotional and mental scars the war left behind while he tries to rebuild a life. Having kept his homosexuality a secret for so long, he doesn't expect to find love or acceptance in the arms of a knight. On the weekends, successful brewery co-owner, Dom Ethan Moreland dons armour and a sword and fights other knights. The adrenaline rush and stress relief provided by the atmosphere of the renaissance faire also serve as a constant reminder of the love he still hasn't found and can't remember having. When Dean meets Ethan dressed as a knight, he never dreams that he will find happiness and love on his knees while submitting to Ethan. Reader Advisory: This book contains scenes of M/M intimacy and BDSM.</description>

  <description>Michael's hating life since his lover Alex dumped him on what should have been a very important night for them. Even his best friend Jim is having trouble bringing Michael out of his slump. Until Jim does, with a temporary solution to Michael's loneliness that's as unexpected as it is welcome, at first. The last thing Jim expects when he tries to cheer Michael up is to fall in love with the guy. They're just comforting each other; being very friends with benefits, right? So why is Jim so damned hurt when Mike takes off without as much as a goodbye? What is it about Michael that has Jim feeling lost without him? And is there any chance that Mike feels it too, or will Jim forever think of Michael as the one that got away?</description>

Born human and forced to go evil, he has turned his back on the demonic ways. Despite demons trying to lure him back, he wants to make up for what he’s done and find love. But who will believe in him? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cupid Inc will do its best to find him a match! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fallen angel who adores the finer things in the human world is also looking for a Valentine’s date. Lonal longed for romance and human sexuality so much that he fell to earth to experience love. He just can’t find it. Sex and lust are easy to enjoy, but he wants a soul mate. It’s a good thing Lonal has a few tricks up his wings!</description>

  <description>Kris Hamilton escaped the rat race in LA to live his dream of owning an art studio and making snow globes in a Christmas-themed town in northern Minnesota. But life in a tiny town isn't as peaceful as advertised, and being treated like an outsider is making Kris’s Tourette's flare up. When he inadvertently offends Tyr Tollefson—a beautiful blond giant of a man—Kris is ready to chuck it all. But he strikes up an unlikely friendship with Tyr's cousin Bun, who shows them the magic of Christmas and gives them both a lesson in love and acceptance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story from the Dreamspinner Press 2013 Advent Calendar package "Heartwarming".</description>

  <description>Brian Townsend was having one hell of a week. Rejected by his parents, kicked out of his pack and now his car breaks down on his way south. What else could go wrong? He soon finds out when the police rock up, and the sexy cop turns out to be his mate. What he didn’t expect was his mate to walk away from him, without so much as a backward glance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Holland was having one hell of a week. Breaking up with his girlfriend, and then copping an earful from his mother about settling down and having kids. All he wanted was to go home and relax. Little did he know one last call-out on his way home would change his life for ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Marcus come to terms with the fact his mate is a man or will he risk losing Brian forever. However, not everyone in the pack is entirely happy with this mating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: UM has been re-edited, and expanded by over 17 K.</description>

  <description>Kagen was resigned to being alone..and lonely. Until the day he met a man he couldn't get out of his mind. A man so out of his league, he was crazy to even think about it. But what if? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kagen knew he was no catch, per se. Short, thin and always considered nothing but a twink, he just knew no man would be interested in him for anything more than a good time...one time. Most people were shocked to know he was a certified auto mechanic with his own shop, not some flaming gay stripper...anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a gorgeous man with a broken car entered his shop. A broken Jaguar, no less. Tall, dark and handsome Croy was Kagen's every dream come true. But could he ever get the reserved man interested? Especially, since he was straight and had a bombshell female blond on his arm. And Kagen had emotional baggage…too much emotional baggage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Croy struggled with his sexuality…until a gorgeous dark haired man captured his attention…and his heart. And, suddenly, Croy was willing to give up all that he has and is to possess that man…and make his dreams come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content warning: This book contains M/M, adult language and content that may be offense.</description>

  <description>Econ student Hansen Marks has been hot for Sam MacLeod since they first bonded over their secret superpowers--literally hot, since Hansen can produce fire from thin air. But soccer star Sam was always covered in girls, so Hansen kept his attraction in the closet and convinced himself that "best friends" was better than nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sam's electrical powers freak out in public, Hansen has a sinking feeling they've been spotted by unfriendly eyes. While dealing with the fallout, Sam's emotional dependency on Hansen forces their mutual attraction to the surface. Even after they give in, Hansen is afraid to admit he's in love. Sam doesn't really like guys, he's just feeling vulnerable...right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as their nights are heating up, it becomes clear Sam's electrical explosion was seen, and now someone has it in for both of them. They'll have to save each other, both from the haters and from their own fears, if they want to maintain equilibrium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: male/male sexual practices.</description>

  <description>After a bad breakup, Adam Kavanaugh returns to his sleepy old river town to find himself. His family hasn't changed, but he has some work to do readjusting to small town life, so much that he wonders if he's made a mistake by coming home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But from the moment Leith Marshall pops out of the Ohio River and smiles at him, there's no turning back. Between Leith's swimmer body, sweet laugh, and gentle soul, Adam is head over heels. Leith lets Adam into his little world bit by bit, from his mother's abandoned aquarium shop to his elderly father's fairy tale delusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which might not be so delusional after all. Leith does have a certain affinity for water. It seems almost to listen to him. The current never pulls him downriver, the tub doesn't splash, and the pool hardly moves around him even at an all out sprint. He can't spend a night away from his river, and then there's the way he sings. Adam has to admit, he'd steer his ship straight into the rocks for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So maybe Leith inherited a few things from his mysterious mother. It doesn't mean he'll disappear like she did. That's absurd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the River is the "water" in the Elementals project.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;This boy likes to wear sexy women’s underwear but it was his secret. He got caught out in a car accident by very manly, sexy, dominant rescuers. How did he get from there to “Property of xxx and xxx” tattooed on his ass after that fateful day?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photo Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;A young man is standing against a mirror. He is only wearing a pair of pink panties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event.

  <description>Eight years ago, Jake Anders was a college kid from the wrong side of the tracks. Then Trace Michelson recruited him into The Trust, a CIA-backed agency whose "executives" eliminate rogue biotechnology operations. Trace was everything Jake ever wanted in a man: powerful, brilliant, and gorgeous. But Jake never admitted his attraction to his mentor, and Trace always kept Jake at arm's length. Now Trace is dead and Jake is one of The Trust's best operatives, highly skilled and loyal to the organization. But the secret agent has his own secret: six years ago, before he was assassinated, Trace designed a Sim chip containing his memories and experiences-and now that chip is part of Jake. It's just data, designed to augment Jake's knowledge, but when Sim becomes reality, Jake wonders if Trace is still alive or if Jake really is going crazy like everyone claims. He doesn't know if he can trust himself, let alone anyone else. To learn the truth about Trace and the chip, Jake embarks on a dangerous mission-except he's not the only one looking for the information. Some of the answers are locked in his head, and unless he finds the key, he'll be killed for the technology that's become a part of him. Now, more than ever, Jake wishes Trace were here to guide him. Too bad he's dead... right?</description>

  <description>Brett Taylor has been doing just fine living in his little world of grief and pain for the past three years—thank you very much. Losing someone special is life changing, and Brett doesn't understand why everyone and their damn dog thinks they can get all up in his business about moving on. He's accepted his job going from musician to rancher without relying on anyone else's opinion, and he doesn't need some city kid coming into his life to break the habits he's been practicing—grief, isolation, and a whole lot of Jack Daniels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JT Campbell was on a quest to escape his old life, and to figure out who he is and where he belonged as he moved from one meaningless job to the next. He wasn't looking to save anyone, let alone a secretive, hotter-than-hell rancher who wore his heart on his sleeve. He likes working for Brett, but it's been made perfectly clear that any relationship other than professional will never see the light of day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when JT's lust turns to love, and he gives in to his desire to find out what makes Brett tick, will his patience and support result in Brett lowering the walls he's built-up enough so JT can unbreak his heart?</description>

  <description>Cole Harker, son of an alpha werewolf, is bigger and more powerful than most wolves, tongue-tied in groups, and gay. For twenty-four years, he’s lived to please his family and pack—even letting them promise him in marriage to female werewolf Analiese to secure a pack alliance and help save them from a powerful gangster who wants their land. Then Cole meets Analiese’s half-brother, panther shifter Paris Marketo, and for the first time, Cole wants something for himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Analiese runs off to marry a human, Cole finally has a chance with Paris, but the solitary cat rejects him, the pack, and everything it represents. Then Cole discovers the gangster wants Paris too and won’t rest until he has him. What started as a land dispute turns into World War Wolf! But the bigger fight is the battle between cats and dogs.</description>

  <description>Martin Harrison keeps himself to himself and his flat as neat as a new pin. His friends want him to loosen up and enjoy more of a social life, but in Martin's mind, that's tantamount to opening the floodgates to emotional chaos. However, he agrees to join the flat-sitting scheme in his building. He'll look after another tenant's flat in exchange for a similar watch over his, when he's traveling with his work as an antiques dealer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A floor away in the same building, Russ McNeely is happy with his life as a freelance cook and a self-confessed domestic slob. His best friend Don persuades him to join the flat-sitting scheme, both to be neighborly and to help keep his flat in order, as Russ also travels with his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a while, the very dissimilar men never actually meet. Martin is horrified at the mess at Russ' flat, while Russ finds Martin's minimalist style creepy. But in a spirit of generosity, each of them starts to help the other out by rearranging things in their own inimitable way. Gradually, the changes extend beyond interior decoration and into the habits of the men themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the day a hiccup in the schedule brings them face to face at last.</description>

  <description>Mitchell Collins is the king of denial. Five years after the death of his lover, Steve, he finds himself in a gay bar, wondering why he's even there. He has a rule he won't break: Don't take anyone home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sammi's trying to survive on the streets of Houston. It's not easy for someone with no money, no identity, and no friends. When Mitch meets Sammi, all thoughts of "safe" go flying out the window. He takes him home for the best sex of his life, not knowing that Sammi's a sex slave on the run from a man who'll do anything to get him back.</description>

  <description>A malicious deception... An ancient curse... A timeless love...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian Macon is a worn-out homicide detective whose job and life hold no meaning until he meets a gorgeous German man who turns his world upside down. Alrick Ritter has a poet's soul, a master cellist's skill, and a sniper's deadly accuracy, and though constrained by sinister forces to be a killer-for-hire, Alrick wants nothing more than to be with Brian. Helpless to resist the call of their hearts, Brian and Alrick begin a cautious affair, keeping secret the reality that places them on opposite sides of the law. But an ancient danger threatens to destroy their love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three thousand years ago in the burning sands of ancient Egypt, Prince Rahotep and his devoted slave, Tiye, were robbed of their lives, betrayed by a powerful woman’s mad hatred and the cruel humor of an evil god. Now, destiny has reunited the lovers, joining them in an unquenchable passion even as a twist of fate casts them as potential enemies. Will Brian and Alrick be able to overcome the centuries-old curse to secure the love that should have always been theirs?</description>

  <description>Months after waking from a car accident that took everything David held dear, he's trying to settle into a new life at CRU. There's only one problem. Well, three, his roommates: Bobby, Chris and Austin. They want to experience life now that they're out from under their parents' watchful eyes, and for David to partake in the fun with them. David feels he's experienced enough life already and just wants to be left alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby sees how David watches him, Chris and Austin. He's convinced their hard-ass roommate just needs a little nudge and David would open up. When Bobby comes back to the dorm unannounced, looking for an English paper for class, Bobby finds out why David's been holding them at arms length and becomes determined to help his roommate  rejoin the world of the here and now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem is: David has more secrets he doesn't want anyone to know about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: There are references to rape, and some graphic violence, in the story.</description>

  <description>An eye for an eye...&lt;p&gt;Ian McCandless is a hospice nurse, training to become a shaman. When his mentor orders him to make peace with his estranged family, Ian reluctantly agrees, anticipating just another conflict-filled visit. On their way from the airport Ian's older brother Will interrupts a convenience store robbery and is shot, dying in Ian's arms and calling to him for vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian uses his shamanic abilities to track down the killer, but his quest soon turns into a hunt for revenge---forbidden to any shaman. Ian's pursuit jeopardizes his relationship with the spirit world, endangers the lives of those he loves and threatens to banish him from the only path that gives his life meaning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the wake of the disease, his species faces extinction. The possibly mythical pre-plague migrants hold the only key to survival for his entire race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living in deep cover onboard a space frigate full of slave-running pirates would be difficult enough with reliable intel and some hope of back-up...even if he weren't slowly losing his ability to separate truth from fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lewell'yn finds himself in hot water, being deliberately fed false information, light-years from reliable help and saddled with the added complications caused by a fiercely passionate healer and a sweet, innocently sexy chef.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the fate of his world resting squarely on his shoulders, Lewell'yn must discover a way through an ever shifting maze of deception. The bombs are in place. The detonators are set. The chrono is ticking. Caught between two men desperate to escape the clutches pirates and an insidious, hidden enemy, can Lewell'yn find a path to become Tian's hero?</description>

With Seth’s support, can he work through his fears to finally find the true love he deserves, or will someone finally land the crushing blow he won’t survive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*M/M Contemporary Romance w/ (lite) BDSM elements*</description>

  <description>Hunter Krause knows better than anyone that running a ranch is hard work. Wranglers are hard to find, and even with Hunter’s foreman and entire extended family on hand, the busy ranch is constantly short-handed. So when horses go missing, Hunter’s brother-in-law hires a man Hunter would never have considered: Grant Jarreau, a man Hunter can't forgive for leaving Hunter’s best friend Gable after an incapacitating accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grant quickly fits in, befriending Hunter’s sister and making himself invaluable. Despite Hunter’s misgivings, he can’t quite control his body’s reactions to Grant, and he isn’t sure what to do about it. Then Grant saves Hunter’s young nephew from drowning and one thankful kiss opens doors Hunter never knew existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Hunter and Grant tentatively move toward a relationship, the family’s in an uproar, the ranch is struggling, they can’t figure out what happened to the horses, and to top it all off, Grant is hiding something. Can Hunter learn to trust Grant, or will the turmoil already tearing up his family claim another victim?</description>

  <description>Flynn Tomlinson has drifted for several years, working odd jobs when he needs the money and moving on when he doesn’t. He’s content with his freestyle life, not tied down, not responsible for anyone but himself. Then he comes across a Help Wanted ad in a post office in Idaho and meets Gable Sutton. Gable can’t pay Flynn until he sells his horses, but a serious accident has left him unable to work his ranch alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with horses beats stacking shelves at the supermarket, and so Flynn agrees to Gable’s terms. What Flynn doesn’t bargain for is being captivated by this gentle, lonely man who captures his heart and moves Flynn to take on an incredible burden: saving Gable’s ranch.</description>

  <description>After filing charges that put his abusive ex-Dom behind bars, Jesse Turbul relocates halfway across the country, hoping to escape his past—but, of course, it's never that easy. When Jesse meets third-year law student Aadon at the library where he works, their mutual attraction is instant and obvious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the sparks, they just can't seem to make it work. Aadon is mired in guilt over his inability to help his older brother, damaged by events far too similar to Jesse’s past. Jesse is stuck in his own desperate wish to forget the painful shadow that continues to threaten him and any hope of a happy future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way to move forward is for Jesse to acknowledge he’s broken and for Aadon to accept he can’t make him better.</description>

  <description>When he was sixteen years old, Rich Miller saved a young man from drowning at his local pool. Little did he know that years later, as a senior in college and Olympic diving hopeful, Rich would meet up once again with Johnny Milloway, now a big football player – and when Rich says big, he really means ‘bear’.  The shy jock remembers his savior, and the two men become friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnny isn’t put off by the fact that Rich is gay. In fact, the more time he spends with Rich, the more curious he becomes. Johnny wants to know all kinds of things – what it’s like to kiss a guy, for instance.  Only it doesn’t stop there…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rich finds it difficult to believe that this relationship can go anywhere. Johnny is straight, and Rich isn’t prepared to deal with the heartache he knows will come his way in the future. He has enough on his plate as it is – the Worlds are just around the corner, his father would rather watch a football game than spend time watching his son dive….  What he doesn’t count on is Johnny, who can be very determined. And having Johnny in his life proves to be a catalyst for some pretty earth-shattering changes.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five years ago Mark Nelson was ready to take on the world; just as soon as his lover-turned-business-partner returned from summer vacation. Instead, Mark received an invitation to his lover's wedding and his dreams came to an abrupt end. Could the unexpected invitation to the couple's twenty-fifth wedding anniversary give Mark the motivation he needs to start living again, or propel him into greater despair?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chancellor Marshall has finally worked up to courage to 'come out' to his parents, but he probably shouldn't have chosen the week of their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary to do it. Could the comfort he finds in the arms of a sexy stranger provide shelter from the fall-out, or will he heap even more troubles onto his life?</description>

  <description>After a tortured childhood and years of soul-searching, Brooke Morrison has finally settled into a comfortable life. While his sexuality prohibits him from practicing his degree in youth ministry in a church setting, he’s found a fulfilling job as a youth counselor at a residential treatment facility in Colorado. He falls in love, marries the man of his dreams, and makes peace with God. He’s happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then his buried past drags him back to the Ozarks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The life Brooke has worked so hard to build is crumbling in his hands in the face of painful memories and past abuse, and his confidence is withering. In El Dorado Springs, where his nightmares come to life, Brooke desperately seeks closure life doesn’t offer. Brooke must find value in himself, in his marriage, and in the world around him—and create the hope and perseverance to keep his past from swallowing him whole.</description>

  <description>The inspiration for the CBS TV show &lt;em&gt;Intelligence&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;a thrilling adventure that's &amp;amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; meets Wolverine and &lt;em&gt;Cool Hand Luke&lt;/em&gt;&amp;amp;#8221; (F. Paul Wilson, creator of Repairman Jack).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The judge told Carl that one day he&amp;amp;#8217;d have to decide exactly what kind of person he would become. But on Phoenix Island, the choice will be made for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A champion boxer with a sharp hook and a short temper, sixteen-year-old Carl Freeman has been shuffled from foster home to foster home. He can&amp;amp;#8217;t seem to stay out of trouble&amp;amp;#8212;using his fists to defend weaker classmates from bullies. His latest incident sends his opponent to the emergency room, and now the court is sending Carl to the worst place on earth: &lt;em&gt;Phoenix Island&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Classified as a &amp;amp;#8220;terminal facility,&amp;amp;#8221; it&amp;amp;#8217;s the end of the line for delinquents who have no home, no family, and no future. Located somewhere far off the coast of the United States&amp;amp;#8212;and immune to its laws&amp;amp;#8212;the island is a grueling Spartan-style boot camp run by sadistic drill sergeants who show no mercy to their young, orphan trainees. Sentenced to stay until his eighteenth birthday, Carl plans to play by the rules, so he makes friends with his wisecracking bunkmate, Ross, and a mysterious gray-eyed girl named Octavia. But he makes enemies, too, and after a few rough scrapes, he earns himself the nickname &amp;amp;#8220;Hollywood&amp;amp;#8221; as well as a string of punishments, including a brutal night in the &amp;amp;#8220;sweatbox.&amp;amp;#8221; But that&amp;amp;#8217;s nothing compared to what awaits him in the &amp;amp;#8220;Chop Shop&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;amp;#8212;a secret government lab where Carl is given something he never dreamed of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new life...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new body. A new brain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gifts from the fatherly Old Man, who wants to transform Carl into something he&amp;amp;#8217;s not sure he wants to become. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this is no ordinary government project. Phoenix Island is ground zero for the future of combat intelligence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And for Carl, it&amp;amp;#8217;s just the beginning....</description>

  <description>Every high school has it's social elite; the football players and cheerleaders ... you know, the popular crowd. At Butler High, Jack Barely was as close to the top as they came. Captain of the swim team, great hair, and abs that most would die for. However, that was all before the Leeches attacked, taking away everything: his popularity, his house, his grandmother, and even his best friend, Caleo, whom he secretly loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, living in a destroyed world, popularity means nothing as Jack struggles just to keep him and his twin sister, Jillian, alive. With attacks happening more frequently, Jack starts to wonder why they are even bothering to try and hold onto the past when it just reminds him of all they have lost. Just when he has given up hope, Jack hears a rumor that Caleo is still alive and sets out on a mission to find him. But will Jack make it to finally tell Caleo how he really feels?</description>

  <description>Ryan doesn’t mean to sleep with his best friend’s hot dad. It just happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan is eighteen, inexperienced and in lust with Javier, his friend’s divorced father. Javier is dangerously charismatic, confident and overwhelmingly sexual, and when Ryan hints at his desires, Javier takes every opportunity to fulfill them. However, what begins as a torrid affair soon becomes something more than what either of them had anticipated, and the forbidden nature of their feelings threatens to rip their families apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Ryan slowly discovering more about Javier’s dark past and Javier trying desperately to overcome it, their bond has the potential to become something truly transforming. But can they keep their relationship a secret, or will their story be forced to end before it even begins?</description>

  <description>It’s Rodeo Roundup time in Houston. Undefeated bull riding champion, Matt Stevens, runs into longtime nemesis, Lance Loskey. Matt is intense, his focus and drive sustain him, but seeing Lance with his carefree attitude rages a plethora of feelings to the surface. This mellow cowboy is in position for more than just the championship after a freak accident paves Lance's way. This is an opportunity for bull riding opponents to embrace their destiny. Will they succumb to fate, or will stubborn pride end the 8 second ride in tragedy?</description>

  <description>The much anticipated sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284565-winter-wolf"&gt;Winter Wolf&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After almost a decade of self imposed solitude, Axton has a boyfriend. Leander might be a thousand miles away, but that still counts, right? Sure, maybe they haven't actually talked about their relationship status yet, and Axton might be a gay werewolf and Leander might be a human, but Ax is pretty sure things are going well.        Leander wants Axton to come visit him,  but who's going to take care of his forest while he's gone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Los Angeles is a big change for a reclusive werewolf, but he's in love and happy, with a new family--pack?--to look after. But when Axton's carefully buried past starts to catch up with him, it's only a matter of time before someone pays the price for his freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book especially for fans of: shapeshifters, gay romance, action romance, lawyer romance, adventure romance, and gay for you.</description>

  <description>When his closest friend falls on hard times, Gerard is willing to do anything to help him. Taking in his friend’s younger brother, Alexander, proves to be no hardship at all, as Gerard has admired him from afar for years. He’s only been waiting for Alexander to grow up…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexander has fantasized about Gerard ever since the day he turned sixteen. He accidentally witnessed a sexual encounter between Gerard and another man. He’d never hoped to encounter someone else like himself—a man who desired other men—and now he’s very excited about the chance to confess his needs to someone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mutual attraction is obvious once they’re alone, but will these two men only find the pleasures of the flesh? Or will they discover that more than lust has brought them together?</description>

  <description>Rhys had a place of honor with the Prince Regent—even sharing his bed at night—but everything changed when his master gave him away to pay a debt. Now Rhys belongs to a man named Stryker, who immediately makes his intention of claiming Rhys, body and soul, very clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stryker has waited years to find the perfect beta, and he knows from the first touch that Rhys is the one for him. Rhys responds right away, and Stryker simply can’t get enough of him. Stryker works to get Rhys to admit that he wants Stryker as much as Stryker is growing to need him, but Rhys’s stubbornness isn’t the only conflict they’re destined to face…</description>

  <description>Gerald is in love with his best friend Paul, and he’s finally realized that he has to tell him. As much as rejection would hurt, he can’t go on pretending he doesn’t have these feelings. He plans a camping trip so he can tell Paul how he feels away from the pressures of society and their other friends. He believes that Paul could one day feel the same way about him, but Paul has to give Gerald a chance first. When the friends stumble across two other male campers having sex, it’s obvious Paul is aroused. Gerald acts in that moment, and his decision changes their relationship forever.</description>

  <description>When Killian’s band gets its big break, he can’t contain his excitement. He assumes everyone is going to be thrilled, including the drummer, his boyfriend Malcolm. Killian can’t wait to get out of their small town so they won’t have to hide their relationship anymore. But Malcolm is skeptical and feels college is a safer bet than touring with the band, and he wants Killian to stick to their original plan and go to school with him. So they part ways, both feeling hurt and abandoned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, Killian is in another band, and they need a drummer. Their manager convinces one of his college professors to play with them on their upcoming tour, and to Killian’s surprise, Malcolm is back in his life again. Their reunion hits a few bumps at first, but soon they’re working through their issues one at a time. This progress is interrupted when an obsessed lover from Killian’s past reemerges. He wants to keep Killian from being with Malcolm—the lost love he’d heard so much about—and he’ll do anything necessary to make Killian his again…</description>

  <description>Living with Humans is never easy. They don’t do scent exchange, they don’t lick palms, and they have this thing called “personal space”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the first and only Kin Agent for the Center of Folk and Kin Relations, Haley Night’s job is to help keep the public safe by helping keep the peace. But after an interview with serial man-eater Niles Fury goes terribly wrong, Haley finds herself face-to-face with a plot to destroy her species-genocide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help from her best friend and partner Farley, she sets off on a race against time to stop a madman’s plot to destroy Kin. It’s a journey that will put to the test everything she thought she knew: Kin have no God, survive at all costs, and love is only a Human emotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to Atlanta, Georgia… City of Dragons...</description>

  <description>Since they began getting each other into and out of trouble at age six, Mike Zimmer and Alex Jackson have been best friends. Now 20-year-old college roommates, they have distinctly different outlooks and personalities, but the friendship remains rock solid. That is, until Alex notices behavior changes in Mike – restlessness, eating pounds of food without gaining weight, and a sex drive bordering on insane, even for Mike, the campus stud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a spring break camping trip takes a bizarre and violent turn, Alex realizes his lifelong friend is a Lesser-Bred – a human carrying genes of the Kin…the dragons that inhabit the world in human-shaped bodies right alongside humans. And Mike is starting to Shift, taking on Kin behavior, instincts, and bloodlust. Alex finds himself torn between loyalty and self-preservation, and Mike is torn between dreading life and fearing death. Mike’s metamorphosis puts them on separate paths, but leaves them connected in ways they can’t fully understand.</description>

He runs into a friend from the past. Quanah Parker Running Bear is a difficult man full of inappropriate longings, with much to teach a young poet about life and the lust for warm toes.</description>

  <description>A collection of previously unpublished vignettes and longer works which introduce new characters and stories to Demont's ever-growing cast and setting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Drive-Through", a late-night run for barbecue takes an unexpected turn, while "The Line of the Hunt" tells the tale of a were-cheetah struggling to maintain a normal life despite his bestial nature, and how a chance encounter with another of his kind threatens to bring his house of cards tumbling down. "Happy Birthday" returns the reader to the romantic leads of "The Vampire Fred" for a brief but important night in Fred's life. The collection finishes with the novella "Let the River Run", the story of an incubus accused of murder who recounts his story and origins in an attempt to prove his innocence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This work contains scenes of explicit erotic content.</description>

  <description>Kadin Mahoney is ten years older than his lifelong partner, Gregory. But when Gregory is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and winds up in a nursing home, Kadin decides to move there with him in spite of the fact that Gregory doesn’t even know him. His three children aren’t happy about this and his friends think he’s crazy. But Gregory is the love of Kadin’s life, and he’s not going to let him slip away without a struggle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So he conceives a plan to help him remember their passionate, sexy past. With the help of a notebook computer and a personal blog, he begins telling him the story of two good looking young men who fell in love with each other during the l950s in Savannah. One is a recent college graduate, and the other is a thirty year old lawyer and divorced father of three. They meet by accident at the movies the day Kadin’s divorce is finalized, and wind up spending a full summer together engaged in every act of true love that is humanly possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it all comes to an abrupt halt in mid-August, when Gregory’s family begins to suspect his forbidden feelings for Kadin. They drag him back to Atlanta early, where he enlists in the army to get even. Five years later, Kadin has moved on with his life and Gregory is engaged to be married. But Gregory sees Kadin on TV, and he goes back to Savannah one more time before the wedding. He only wants to find out what happened to Kadin, but the moment he arrives his clothes come off and their lives are never the same again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a hot, sexy story with a happy ending. It’s about true love between two strong, passionate men that survives all the odds society and family have placed upon them. They do it with restrained dignity in public, but in private they share unbelievable, sizzling sex that leaves them both satisfied for the rest of their lives.</description>

  <description>Scott is in a lot of trouble. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His vet is holding his frozen dog to ransom, and if he can’t come up with £500 quickly, he’s lost him forever. His job at Chapterhouse Insurance is on shaky ground, and Scott needs a promotion if he’s going to outlive his failing department. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only, everyone who gets promoted at Chapterhouse seems to get married first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against the advice of his friends, Scott decides he needs a wife to secure a promotion, and the money to finally get his dog back. But, being a fish obsessed semi-recluse, he quickly realises that he’s not going to find a woman the old fashioned way. Turning to the internet, Scott eventually finds a Russian woman looking to move to the UK. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Maliki turns up at the airport, half Scott’s age, and definitely male, Scott begins to realise just how much trouble he’s in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living in close quarters with another man brings Scott to confront the spectre of his childhood, his absentee parents and the horrors of St. Savio's boarding school for boys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Goodwin is currently studying for her MA in Creative Writing at Bath Spa University, and lives alone with a pot plant named Sidney. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Young Noah hadn't any idea how quickly his world could turn upside down.  One minute, he was living, happy and secure, with a doting father and grandmother to look after him.  The next, his father is dead, his grandmother is confined to her sickbed, and the only other family he has left is his new stepmother and her two children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken far from his home, worked hard and hidden away from the world, Noah hasn't much to look forward to, growing up.  Until one day, Matthew, a handsome neighbor, comes riding up to him like a knight on his charger.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's love at first sight, at least as far as Noah is concerned.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now all Noah has to do is make his Prince Charming aware he exists, triumph over his evil stepmother, and claim the love he so richly deserves.  He may not have a fairy godmother helping him, but magic can come in many forms.  The only question is--will it be enough to give Noah his happily ever after?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A college campus sex romp&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Brennan is studying English literature but majoring in seduction. Blessed with good looks, charm, and confidence, Jamie lives for the chase. He has a well-earned reputation as a seducer of straight guys, but he’s also happy to help fellow gay students out of the closet when they are ready. Jamie sees nothing wrong with having a healthy sex life, even if his amorous pursuits frequently land him in sticky situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alas, not everyone approves of Jamie’s adventures. Roger Hunt, the hunky grad student, who dresses more like a lumberjack than the talented artist he is, gives Jamie hostile looks whenever their paths cross. Jamie tries to ignore Roger, but they can't seem to stop running into each other. Every time they meet the air crackles with tension, and Jamie begins to wonder if it’s fate or design pushing them together.</description>

  <description>When you fall in love, it can't all just be hanging loose... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After graduating from art school Nate left the Midwest for sunny Southern California, not quite sure what he hoped to find. It was almost certainly not falling in love with another man. His whole world and assumptions about himself begin to slowly turn upside down on one hot summer day. Seeking respite from the heat and his loneliness at Venice Beach he has a chance encounter with a handsome blond surfer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jez is friendly, easygoing, and just a little bit mysterious. Openly gay, Jez offers Nate a place to stay, and the two men become fast friends. Nate makes new friends, adjusts to his new life, but his unbidden attraction to Jez keeps growing. In their moments of closeness Nate realizes that he wants Jez more than just a friend, but it might be too late. To make Jez his, Nate has to face not only his own fears and insecurities, but his mysterious mate has secrets of his own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Al fresco man-love, a scene-stealing old coot, and a relentless California sun.</description>

  <description>Ennek, the son of the Chief, and Miner, a former slave, have escaped the totalitarian city-state of Praesidium and remain fugitives. Having defeated two mighty wizards, they begin to realize that complete freedom can be as dangerous as absolute power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this final book in the trilogy that began with Stasis and continued with Flux, Ennek and Miner face battles, corruption, and further journeys through lands both new and familiar. As they grow more secure in their relationship with one other, they're also learning that the greatest challenges sometimes come from very close to the heart and that everything of value has a price. With the help of a few allies, they seek equipoise—a balance for themselves and for their world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;** Re-edited, longer New Edition 2014 **&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lured by rumors of a momentous invention, Agent Julian Blake steps into the New York Gate and emerges outside London.&lt;br&gt;It is the same year, 1885, but an earth parallel to his. The two timelines are almost identical, but the slight variation is enough to threaten his mission as it includes an attitude toward same-sex attraction that is less than accepting.&lt;br&gt;He never expected that difference to pose a problem. Julian has an important mission to complete--a mission with far-reaching consequences not only across the alternate earths, but into their pasts. For the momentous invention is a working time machine.&lt;br&gt;And the inventor's assistant is a beautiful, auburn-haired young man named Daniel who causes Julian to disregard the Department rules he has lived by for so long.&lt;br&gt;But there are others interested in the professor's new invention, and when tragedy strikes, the professor's assistant might just be the only person left with the knowledge to recreate the device.&lt;br&gt;Now Daniel is a target, and Julian is in a race to protect him and retrieve the knowledge of the time machine from those who would misuse it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Gay Romance Steampunk adventure. Explicit male/male sexual practices.</description>

  <description>Spring of 1860: The Pony Express at Williams Station abducts and abuses two small Indian girls. The chiefs of the girls' respective tribes unite in search of revenge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gives Grain, coy and enigmatic, professes shamanic prowess. Middle Road Maker, reserved and stern, struggles to understand his warrior mother's legacy. From wildly different cultures, these antipodal men have nothing in common--except their inability to keep the other at arm's length. From strangers to allies to lovers, their actions are what trigger the metamorphosis of America's landscape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the true story of the Pony Express War. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;253,781 words</description>

  <description>Kerry Thompson is not supposed to exist. Kerry Thompson was aborted nineteen years ago--and survived. Nineteen years later, Kerry contends with a myriad of health conditions and a heart full of hatred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stint in the hospital sees Kerry cross paths with Sahara, a quirky little girl living in the pediatric ward, and her day nurse, Daniel, whose heart is as big as his earring collection. Challenged by their offers of friendship, Kerry starts to reevaluate his outlook on life--his self-image--and just how well he understands his mother.</description>

  <description>He didn’t know what he needed until he found it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disillusioned Dom Ronan Porter has hung up his whips and chains. Longing for someone who needs submission as much as he craves control, Ronan realizes he’s become just another way for self-loathing gay men to get off. Done with the lifestyle, he buries himself in work. But when a blond, blue-eyed innocent requests his services, he can’t resist the challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Repressed Mormon Noah Cameron has always known he was different. When he discovers the leather-clad world of BDSM, he’s intrigued, and desperate to submit. Noah seeks out a Dom to show him the literal and figurative ropes. But dark, sexy Ronan exceeds Noah’s wildest fantasies. He sees right through Noah’s fears and dares him to surrender completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Falling in love is easy. But staying there takes work. When a savage attack lands him in the ICU, Noah is caught between his deeply religious family and his devoted Dom. With so much pushing them apart, it will take more than courage to stand together. It will demand everything they have.</description>

  <description>Genre: Science Fiction, LGBT&lt;br&gt;16,000 words&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Star City, best known for its brothels and casinos, is one of the few planets in the quadrant that outlaws slavery—for everyone, that is, except the galaxy bullies, the Borathians.  Telepaths and recent conquerors of a backwards planet named Earth, the Borathians are simply too powerful to refuse.  A special treaty allows them to bring their pleasure slaves or “bonds” onto the planet, and if one escapes, they have five days to recover him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Beron, private locator, may have been born on a Maradi space cruiser, but Star City is his home now and he’d say he despises slavery as much as any native. Unfortunately, a run of bad luck at the casino tables leaves him flat broke and scavenging expired military rations out of a neighboring dumpster.  Next thing he knows, the Borathians are offering him a fortune to track down one of their escaped bonds, a beautiful Earth boy named Liam.  What's a hungry locator to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Adult readers only: Erotic M/M Content, BDSM elements, Dubious Consent.  This story contains a morally, financially, and sartorially challenged alien PI, some gorgeous if foul-mouthed earth boys, and explicit descriptions of sexual, ahem, congress between the same. If you disapprove of bad words, ugly Aloha shirts, or sexual relations with alien species please do not read this book.</description>

  <description>Kathleen Turner has goals. She moved to Indianapolis to start seeing to them, but things aren't going quite as well as she'd hoped. She's a runner for a high-powered law firm in town, not the most prestigious of positions, but it and her part-time bartender gig at least pays the bills. And one of the senior partners is a dreamboat in that obscenely rich, disturbingly good looking, slightly snobbish sort of way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before she did a mortifying face plant in his lap during a meeting, she was quite happy ogling him from afar. After that...well...she was more about the avoiding. Mature, no. More likely to assure she keeps her job, yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's made some friends in the few months she's been in Indy. One of those friends is her neighbor Sheila, though Kathleen can't say she's completely comfortable with Sheila's job choice as a high-dollar escort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the middle of the night when Kathleen hears fighting coming from Sheila's apartment. As disturbing as that is, it's the ominous sound of silence afterwards that keeps Kathleen from falling back to sleep. Slipping from bed with the intention of making sure everything is okay, Kathleen knocks on friend's door, only to find Sheila murdered, her naked body sprawled on sheets stained crimson with her blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shock and horror are followed by gritty determination when it becomes clear that Sheila's death isn't random and it isn't the result of a jealous boyfriend. It's the opening gambit in a web of murder, deceit, conspiracy, and fraud that stretches to the law firm for which Kathleen works. Maybe to the very office that Blane Kirk commands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Kathleen Turner, law office runner, can trust no one if she wants to survive.</description>

  <description>Scarlett Bernard knows about personal space: step within ten feet of her, and any supernatural spells or demonic forces are instantly defused—vampires and werewolves become human again, and witches can’t get out so much as a “hocus pocus.” This special skill makes her a null and very valuable to Los Angeles’s three most powerful magical communities, who utilize her ability to scrub crime scenes clean of all traces of the paranormal to keep humanity, and the LAPD, in the dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one night Scarlett’s late arrival to a grisly murder scene reveals her agenda and ends with LAPD’s Jesse Cruz tracking her down to strike a deal: he’ll keep quiet about the undead underworld if she helps solve the case. Their pact doesn’t sit well with Dash, the city’s chief bloodsucker, who fears his whole vampire empire is at stake. And when clues start to point to Scarlett, it’ll take more than her unique powers to catch the real killer and clear her name.</description>

  <description>A stunning memoir about a childhood spent growing up in a family of extreme hoarders and hiding squalor behind the veneer of a perfect family. Kim Miller is an immaculately put-together woman with a great career, a loving boyfriend, and a beautifully tidy apartment in Brooklyn. You would never guess that she spent her childhood hiding behind the closed doors of her family’s idyllic Long Island house, navigating between teetering stacks of aging newspaper, broken computers, and boxes upon boxes of unused junk festering in every room—the product of her father’s painful and unending struggle with hoarding. In this coming-of-age story, Kim brings to life her experience of growing up in a rat-infested home, concealing her father’s shameful secret from friends for years, and of the emotional burden that ultimately led to an attempt to take her own life. And in beautiful prose, Miller sheds light on her complicated yet loving relationship with her parents that has thrived in spite of the odds. &lt;em&gt; Coming Clean&lt;/em&gt; is a story about recognizing where we come from and the relationships that define us—and about finding peace in the homes we make for ourselves.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;“My name is Rylee and I am a Tracker.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;When children go missing, and the Humans have no leads, I’m the one they call. I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m on the FBI’s wanted list. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a werewolf for a pet, a Witch of a best friend, and have no need for anyone else in my life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a salvage starts to spin out of control, help comes from a most unexpected direction. One that is dangerously dark, brooding, and doesn’t know a thing about the supernatural. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One whose kisses set me on fire.</description>

  <description>“In its purest form love is self-sacrificing, eternal, selfless, enduring, truthful, forgiving and indulgent. It also feels an awful lot like a kick to the stomach when you try to fight it!” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Everleigh Carsen wanted to do was complete her final semester at Hensley University and begin the life she carefully planned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a wave of violent crime seizes campus, Everleigh is persuaded to attend a school sponsored self-defense seminar by her best friend, where she meets volunteer instructor, Hunter Charles. After Everleigh’s biting sarcasm induces Hunter to eject her from class, a tempestuous  relationship is born. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everleigh is determined to forget the striking man, but fate—that fickle shrew—continuously intervenes. Unable to escape him, she declares Hunter an enemy combatant.  The only complication…Hunter is resolutely pursuing vindication…by any means necessary. Verbal warfare ensues, and despite Everleigh’s ingenious efforts, in Hunter, she has finally found her equal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only For You is a compelling tale of friendship, desire, and redemption—brimming with intelligent characters, witty dialogue, unexpected twists, profound sorrow, unfettered hope, and love’s unassailable perseverance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• This story is appropriate for readers 18+&lt;br&gt;• Only For You is the first book in the For You series by Genna Rulon.  Each book in the series can be read as a stand alone novel.</description>

  <description>Kidnapping the brother of a mob boss was madness. If only it had stayed that simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had all gone wrong. Sent as a mercenary to kidnap Kirith Martinelli from his tropical island home, Landon finds himself on the wrong end of a job gone bad. But there's more to Kirith than meets the eye - he's the brother of feared mob boss Enzo Martinelli, and he's taken Landon as his captive. Kirith makes Landon an offer he can't refuse: stay with him for three months - until he tires of Landon's body - and then Landon may go free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Landon, fearing his own criminal family more than the man before him, quickly agrees. Three months will buy him enough time for his brothers to lose his scent, and then freedom will be his. But that freedom has a steeper price than Landon bargained for as he's drawn into the secrets of Kirith's past. He can't ignore the sadness and loss behind his captor's beautiful eyes, and Landon finds himself wondering if three months will be enough - for either of them...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meet Arcadia Bell: bartender, renegade magician, fugitive from the law. . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being the spawn of two infamous occultists (and alleged murderers) isn’t easy, but freewheeling magician Arcadia “Cady” Bell knows how to make the best of a crummy situation. After hiding out for seven years, she’s carved an incognito niche for herself slinging drinks at the demon-friendly Tambuku Tiki Lounge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she receives an ultimatum when unexpected surveillance footage of her notorious parents surfaces: either prove their innocence or surrender herself. Unfortunately, the only witness to the crimes was an elusive Æthyric demon, and Cady has no idea how to find it. She teams up with Lon Butler, an enigmatic demonologist with a special talent for sexual spells and an arcane library of priceless stolen grimoires. Their research soon escalates into a storm of conflict involving missing police evidence, the decadent Hellfire Club, a ruthless bounty hunter, and a powerful occult society that operates way outside the law. If Cady can’t clear her family name soon, she’ll be forced to sacrifice her own life . . . and no amount of running will save her this time.</description>

  <description>Reya Sinclair is a Redeemer of Souls. Her mission is to give Earth’s most depraved sinners a shot at redemption just before they are slated to die. Her own redemption is on the line as she fulfills her duties, leaving a trail of dead bodies in her wake. It’s all going perfectly well until one detective takes notice, possibly bringing her salvation to a halt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thane Driscoll is a good cop who’s seen too many bad guys get away, including the man who murdered his father. He exacts his own style of justice, even if it costs him his humanity. A string of mysterious deaths leads him to a woman who’s not quite human and might hold the key to finding his father’s killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When death and shadows descend, New York City becomes a battleground for the forces of light and dark. As the body count rises and sparks fly between them, Reya and Thane race to uncover a terrible truth. Can one man hell-bent on revenge and one woman determined to save her eternal soul be enough to keep the planet from spiraling into darkness?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A world in peril. A bond deeper than love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Psychologist Elizabeth Cole prepared for the worst when she accepted a job on a newly discovered world - a world where every colonist is tethered to an alien who manifests in the form of a dead loved one. But she never expected she'd struggle with the requirement to shun these “ghosts.” She never expected to be so attracted to the charming Irishman assigned as her supervisor. And she certainly never expected to discover she died in a transport crash en route to the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reincarnated as a ghost, Elizabeth is symbiotically linked to her supervisor, Murphy - creator of the Ghost Protocol, which forbids him to acknowledge or interact with her. Confused and alone - oppressed by her ghost status and tormented by forbidden love - Elizabeth works to unlock the secrets of her own existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her quest for answers lands her in a tug-of-war between powerful interests, and she soon finds herself a pawn in the struggle for control of the planet…a struggle that could separate her forever from the man she loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Manhood is about more than who’s on top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wulfstan, a noble and fearsome Saxon warrior, has spent most of his life hiding the fact that he would love to be cherished by someone stronger than himself. Not some slight, beautiful nobody of a harper who pushes him up against a wall and kisses him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the aftermath, Wulfstan isn’t sure what he regrets most—that he only punched the churl in the face, or that he really wanted to give in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leofgar is determined to prove he’s as much of a man as any Saxon. But now he’s got a bigger problem than a bloody nose. The lord who’s given him shelter from the killing cold is eyeing him like a wolf eyes a wounded hare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Wulfstan accidentally kills a friend who is about to blurt his secret, he flees in panic and meets Leofgar, who is on the run from his lord’s lust. Together, pursued by a mother’s curse, they battle guilt, outlaws, and the powers of the underworld, armed only with music…and love that must overcome murderous shame to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains accurate depictions of Vikings, Dark Ages magic, kickass musicians, trope subversions and men who don’t know their place.</description>

  <description>Despite the loving support of his family, Lorcan James wants to try life on his own, so at twenty-one, he finds himself walking half way across the country in search of adventure. What he finds is desperation, desperation that leads him straight to the Whispering Pines Ranch and right into the path of its strong, arrogant, gorgeous owner, who awakens something in Lorcan he didn’t even know, existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn Taylor is up to his neck in grief and frustration dealing with a neighboring rancher who wants nothing more than to see him go belly-up. He doesn’t need more complications, but from the moment he lays eyes on Lorcan, his world turns upside down. Despite finding in Quinn what his heart craves, Lorcan refuses to be Quinn’s dirty little secret—and Quinn isn’t the only one vying for Lorcan’s attention. Ranch hand Jess will happily declare his love for Lorcan to the world, something Quinn won’t offer—something Lorcan needs above all else.</description>

  <description>New sci-fi romance from the RITA Award nominated author of GHOST PLANET!&lt;br&gt;                                                              * * * &lt;br&gt;Our world is no longer our own. We engineered a race of superior fighters -- the Manti, mutant humans with insect-like abilities. Twenty-five years ago they all but destroyed us. In Sanctuary, some of us survive. Eking out our existence. Clinging to the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of us intend to do more than survive.&lt;br&gt;                                                             * * *&lt;br&gt;Asha and Pax -- strangers and enemies -- find themselves stranded together on the border of the last human city, neither with a memory of how they got there.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Asha is an archivist working to preserve humanity’s most valuable resource -- information -- viewed as the only means of resurrecting their society.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Pax is Manti, his Scarab ship a menacing presence in the skies over Sanctuary, keeping the last dregs of humanity in check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither of them is really what they seem, and what humanity believes about the Manti is a lie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With their hearts and fates on a collision course, they must unlock each other's secrets and forge a bond of trust before a rekindled conflict pushes their two races into repeating the mistakes of the past.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>It happens at the start of every November: the Scorpio Races. Riders attempt to keep hold of their water horses long enough to make it to the finish line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some riders live.&lt;br&gt;Others die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At age nineteen, Sean Kendrick is the returning champion. He is a young man of few words, and if he has any fears, he keeps them buried deep, where no one else can see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puck Connolly is different. She never meant to ride in the Scorpio Races. But fate hasn't given her much of a chance. So she enters the competition — the first girl ever to do so. She is in no way prepared for what is going to happen.</description>

  <description>Daniel Whitlock is terrified of going to sleep. And rightly so: he sleepwalks, with no awareness or memory of his actions. Including burning down Kenny Cooper’s house—with Kenny inside it—after Kenny brutally beat him for being gay. Back in the tiny town of Logan after serving his prison sentence, Daniel isolates himself in a cabin in the woods and chains himself to his bed at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like the rest of Logan, local cop Joe Belman doesn’t believe Daniel’s absurd defense. But when Bel saves Daniel from a retaliatory fire, he discovers that Daniel might not be what everyone thinks: killer, liar, tweaker, freak. Bel agrees to control Daniel at night—for the sake of the other townsfolk. Daniel’s fascinating, but Bel’s not going there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet as he’s drawn further into Daniel’s dark world, Bel finds that he likes being in charge. And submitting to Bel gives Daniel the only peace he’s ever known. But Daniel’s demons won’t leave him alone, and he’ll need Bel’s help to slay them once and for all—assuming Bel is willing to risk everything to stand by him.</description>

  <description>**Optioned for movie rights by multiple-award winning producer Chase Chenowith of Back Fence Productions.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every three years, Amber Hopkins explodes. Okay, not a blown-to-smithereens explosion, but whatever it is always hurts like hell and leaves her life a shambles. She’s already worked her way through five foster placements, and she’s doing whatever she can to avoid getting blasted into a sixth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As her eighteenth birthday approaches and she feels the strange and powerful energy building, disaster looms. When the inevitable explosion occurs, her life gets its biggest shakeup yet. She’ll not only learn how her fellow foster and best friend, Gabriel, really feels about her, but she’ll discover that she isn’t really without family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To top it all off, she’ll finally find out why she’s having the power surges: she isn’t entirely human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amber must Become, transitioning to another plane of existence and risking the loss of the most important relationship she’s ever had. Her choice will impact the future of an entire race of beings, and will pit her against an enemy that will prey upon her doubt to try and take her very life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kind of makes the explosions now seem like a cakewalk.</description>

  <description>[Siren Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Cowboy Romance, M/M, HEA]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Macon Sumner loves two things in the world. One is taboo, his best friend Wade Sutherland. His second love is the rodeo, where their problems begin. When a nosy reporter clicks a picture at the rodeo, capturing Wade and Macon kissing, life is never the same and neither are their relationships with their family and peers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As outcasts in their small, narrow-minded town, Wade and Macon feel the effects daily. Wade becomes secretive with their relationship, foolishly believing that hiding is the answer. What he doesn’t realize is how much harm he is inflicting on Macon by doing so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sneaking away for intimate moments with Wade are as hurtful as the glares Macon receives from people who are supposed to be neighbors, friends. Even roping buddies have stopped inviting them to functions. He can’t stand how he feels or how Wade is treating him. When he receives a call from Zander Wesley, he sees a new life and opportunity for him and Wade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This book is written in one point of view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This book was previously available as a free read on Goodreads under the title Rough in the Saddle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Siren Erotic Romance</description>

  <description>The Light in Your Eyes: Book One &lt;br&gt;A Spy vs Spook Novel &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Theo Bascopolis longs for the man of his dreams. But his dreams are dashed when his conservative Greek father discovers Theo is gay and throws him out. Hopeless, he falls in with Fast Franky, a pimp who seduces Theo with the nickname “Sweetcheeks,” but abuses him and wants Theo to hustle. A bloody fight with Franky forces Sweetcheeks to run. Winding up in Washington, DC, he meets a group of rent boys who take care of each other. While he may not have the man of his dreams, Theo finally has a home and family of his own making. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the boys take in mysterious tenant Mark Vincent, he seems a solid protector, until one of Sweetcheeks’s boys suffers a savage beating in his name. Vincent visits the boy in the hospital and introduces his equally enigmatic trainee, William Matheson. The instant attraction blindsides Sweetcheeks. In spite of knowing love isn’t for rent boys, Sweetcheeks hopes Matheson sees beyond the body he’s offered to so many. But Matheson has secrets of his own, and both will have to tear down their walls to find enduring love.</description>

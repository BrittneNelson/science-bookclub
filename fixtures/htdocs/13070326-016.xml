  <description>The village of Stamford, the quintessential chocolate box English scene, seemed an impossible dream for foster kid Toby Prentiss. Now he’s found a home among the haystacks and village fairs as the general manager for the Duck and Drake Hotel. With the fears and demons from his youth hidden away in this bucolic oasis, he’s very protective of who he lets in. Until he stumbles across shirtless carpenter Rain Engel building the hotel’s new custom-designed bar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working in the countryside, Rain prepared to face his biggest fear: sheep. He didn’t expect to deal with his second biggest fear: commitment. Toby’s controlled, tough guy façade coupled with his “find happiness where you can” optimism calls to Rain like nothing before. While Rain may be an exhibitionist, his romantic history forces him to hold his emotions close. As their relationship develops, secrets from their pasts drive a wedge between them: the ex-boyfriend who tore apart Rain’s trust and Toby's history with the law. But can the secrets hiding among the quirky villagers bring them together? With missing sheep, pole dancing at the winter festival, and a crippling drought, everyone is waiting for Rain.</description>

  <description>This free ebook is a collection of stories about men falling love, struggling with their own or other’s views of their orientation, and having some damn interesting adventures. It is a product of the Goodreads M/M Romance Group Scavenger Hunt challenge and features original stories from some excellent authors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Scavenger Hunt challenge is an event where readers find books that fit a criterion (like having a green cover or a title starting with “D”) and then find specific items within the pages of these books to add up to as many points as possible (for example, “twin bed” = +2 points). This challenge was a helluva lotta, fun and so we thought we share by creating the ultimate 2013 Goodreads Scavenger Hunt book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book was lovingly put together as a baby gift for Katie, our tireless leader, who recently had her first baby and is probably just now realizing what “busy mom” really means. Congratulations Katie!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’ve listed the items you need to find in the front of the book. Happy Hunting (Under Covers).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher’s Note: This book is intended for adult audiences. It contains sexually explicit scenes between two or more men, violence, and language which may be considered offensive by some readers.</description>

  <description>Have you ever heard of the old Celtic legends of the Fae - beautiful, magical, and deadly creatures that have a love of messing with humans just for kicks and giggles?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to my world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What started out as a strange assignment, lead to one of the most gruesome murder mysteries of our times. My friends and I are set and determined to find out who is killing off Fae and Witches alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Couple of problems in the way – I hate the Fae and the Prince of the Dark Fae is bound and determined that I work for him. He’s a rude, overbearing egotistical ass with a compulsive need to possess, dominate and control me. Oh – did I mention that he is absolutely sex-on-a-stick gorgeous and he makes me feel things that I never ever wanted to feel for a Fae...every time he touches me or looks at me with those dangerous golden eyes he seems to pull me further in under his spell, despite my better judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friends and I can’t trust anyone and nothing is as it seems on the surface – not even me.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What happens when a sex addict falls for a virgin?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Warning**&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;This book is intended for a mature reading audience and contains adult language and themes. Contains a stubborn alpha male with addiction issues and loads of sexual tension between two damaged characters. Read at your own risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knox Bauer's life has unraveled to the point of no return. Fighting to fill the emptiness inside himself, he seeks solace in unfamiliar beds with unfamiliar women. As guardian to his three younger brothers, he can't seem to do a thing right. But this can't go on...they look up to him in every way and all he’s done lately is prove how messed up he really is. Needing a change, he attends a local Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting, where he finds himself tempted by the alluring instructor, McKenna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-one year old McKenna is trying to make amends. After losing her parents in a horrific accident, she knows if she can just be good enough, maybe she can forgive herself for what happened. With her newly acquired degree in counseling, she begins leading a sex addicts group where she meets the troubled Knox and her life takes on complications she never bargained for. She doesn't have time for a bad boy who only wants to take her to bed, even if her body disagrees. The fixer in her wants to help, but trusting Knox's true motivations might take more courage than she has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I Break is book 1 in a new series by New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling author Kendall Ryan. When I Surrender, book 2, will be available April 7, 2014. Please note this is not a standalone, as the story continues in book 2.</description>

  <description>*WARNING FROM THE AUTHOR:&lt;br&gt;By Degrees is an ensemble serial with continuing story lines. Six Degrees of Separation is the second installment, and it must be read after Six Degrees of Lust. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the sequel to Six Degrees of Lust, F.B.I. team leader Samuel Shaughnessy and bar manager Machlan O’Bannon are exploring a new phase in their non-relationship. The intention is to take it slowly but power plays are still their favorite activity, and it isn’t long before lines begin blurring. After ending their friends with benefits agreement no rules are left in place to guide them, and soon enough the only thing that’s clear is that neither man is fighting hard enough to reestablish the boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their particular situations haven’t improved in the three months since their first encounter. Sam is still focused on his immediate family issues, and everything indicates Mac will have to go to war with his own family before he can reclaim his freedom. The last thing they need is additional complications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the opening of a night club brings Mac to New York City and a break in the Leviticus investigation leads Sam to Houston, they discover how closely their worlds have been connected from the very beginning. Hiding from the life-altering collision is not an option. Will they take the easier road and go their separate ways, or will they come to terms with their past and take a chance on each other?</description>

  <description>From the moment they meet, their connection is perfect in every way but one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s New Year’s Eve, 2007, and Justine James is fronting her dead-end band for a less-than-adoring crowd. But there’s one person there who sees what she could be—one person who changes everything for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dillon Pierce clawed his way up from the LA streets with no one to count on but his best friend, Ash. Their years of struggle finally pay off when their band, Outlaw Rovers, gets signed and their single takes off. With Ash as the magnetic lead singer and Dillon as the band’s musical soul, they’re destined for greatness, provided Dillon can keep Ash from self-destructing first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dillon might not be fronting Outlaw Rovers, but he’s always been the only one Justine sees. She’s followed his career from afar and when he shows up at her crummy New Year’s Eve gig, nothing will stop her from meeting him. They forge an intense connection, rapidly moving from friends to musical soul mates. Justine wants much more, but she’s not willing to climb over groupies and industry bottom-feeders to make it happen. Dillon becomes a fixture in her life, but she has to figure out how to keep him out of her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outlaw Rovers begins to implode as Justine’s star is on the rise. The years that follow bring equal parts fame and ruin. For Justine, a new love supplants her old heartbreak, and Dillon has to reboot his life after losing nearly everything that matters. Despite the odds, Dillon and Justine remain devoted friends and musical collaborators. After all the missed chances, wrong turns and painful detours, can they finally find the happiness together that seemed destined from the start?</description>

  <description>Harold Halpert is the pastor of Hope Christian Fellowship, a church and school that he helped build from the ground up. He is also a strong opponent of gay rights. Drake Halpert is a teenager who feels trapped in this community of people blindly following his father. He is also gay and deeply hurt by his father's outspoken beliefs. But Pastor Halpert isn't aware of his son's sexuality, and Drake has no idea that his father's ideas aren't shared by everyone. How can these two know so little about each other? And what would happen if father and son were to change places - literally?</description>

  <description>For Jack Lewis love comes from unexpected places…so does tragedy. When David arrived on Vancouver Island, he was just another tourist looking to charter a boat. A few hours on the water together proves he is more than that. As a world traveler, David is a man of mystery who has been everywhere and seen everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attraction draws them together but an attempt at a meaningless fling fails one touch at a time when Jack feels more than he thought he would. The love affair sparks fear in David and jealousy in Emerson, the man who frequents Jack’s bed in a relationship that is all sex and no soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At odds with the men in his life Jack tries to talk David into staying and Emerson into going. The attempt sends things spinning out of control and he struggles with the consequences that could leave him empty handed.</description>

  <description>This is a large print edition. The entire story is reprinted in this version at 16 point font for easy reading. &lt;br&gt; Ryan Talonovich is the star of his college hockey team ... until an accident during practice leaves him confined to a wheelchair. The doctors say he'll walk again but a new season is already underway and he's been replaced on the team, which leaves him feeling alone and betrayed. What's the use of fighting to get back on the ice now? &lt;br&gt; Then he meets Dante Espinosa, a short track skater on the city's speed skating club. Though he has to work overtime to afford his sport, Dante is hell on ice, and dreams of making the cut on the U.S. Olympic Speedskating Team. &lt;br&gt; Their love of the ice brings them together, but too many obstacles stand in their way: Ryan's struggle with therapy. The memory of Dante's first boyfriend. Lack of funding to the event, Dante's harassing boss, a skating friend in love with him, and Wil Dietrich, who will do anything to win.</description>

  <description>When your lover becomes a stranger, trust is the weakest link of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bartender Tony Gemetti has it all: a rich, hot boyfriend, a McMansion in the burbs and unlimited sex in an expectation-free zone. He thought that was all he ever wanted out of any relationship until Jack begins making excuses for frequent disappearances. Realizing he has more than his libido and enough drawers for his T-shirt collection riding on this relationship, Tony figures it s time to find out what s going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Noble has spent his life hiding his real self behind a carefully created image. With Tony, he finally knows real freedom, real happiness. Now a past of buried secrets and lies is closing in, and no matter how hard he tries to stop it, the truth is tearing through. Once Tony learns what kind of man Jack really is, he won t stay. Jack s sure of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly the past shows up in a completely unexpected way, testing the boundaries of their old, coasting-along-on-fun relationship. Tony indeed finds that Jack isn t the man he went looking for, but it s too late. There s too much at stake to just walk away. First, though, he has to make sure there are no lies left for Jack to hide behind.Warning: Readers should be free of any heart condition that may be affected by a hero with an overactive imagination, painful back stories, and hot sex in a variety of athletic positions. Neither the author nor the publisher is responsible for any sudden or frequent urges to have children with Tony Gemetti.</description>

  <description>Crick has been home from Iraq for five years, Jeff and Collin are finally married, and Shane and Mikhail are quietly making lives better for the dispossessed teenagers who come their way. Everything is right in Deacon's world, but nothing ever stays the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Deacon's best friends, Jon and Amy, answer the call of an opportunity in Washington, DC, Deacon figures that’s life. You love people, and they leave you, and you survive. Even Benny, Crick’s little sister, is close to grown and ready to start her own future. But Benny loves Deacon, and she owes him—she may move beyond The Pulpit and Levee Oaks one day, but not without leaving something of herself behind. And so she offers Deacon and Crick an amazing gift… and a terrifying decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benny’s offer forces Deacon and Crick to dredge up every past mistake and offer of redemption. And not just the two of them—everybody is forced to examine the chances they've been given and the promises they've made. In a real family, a child is a promise, and to the men and women of Promise Rock, keeping that promise will change their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Outrunning a winter storm in the north, Captain Faran of the King’s Guard, his men, and a young mage named Meric find shelter at the ancestral home of the Daenes, Bitterwood Manor. Faran and his troops have been searching for six weeks for both a powerful unknown mage, and for a mysterious, lion-like beast that reportedly haunts the uncharted northern woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faran finds the first clue in their quest: the Daene family heraldry—a gold cat on a red field. Meric finds something much more interesting—the son of the house, Eissa. For his part, Faran is fascinated by the powerful figure of Joss, a widower who manages Bitterwood and its environs with a strong, steady hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together they will need to brave the oldest, darkest part of the Bitterwood in the coldest, deepest snows of winter, to find the legendary gold cat and the prophesied mage, for time is running out—for Meric, and for the kingdom.</description>

  <description>High-powered stock trader. Simple handyman. Can they find common ground?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Spencer is a player with a reputation for using and discarding lovers as easily as he earns big money on Wall Street. Handsome, sexy and openly gay, he’s used to having whatever—and whoever—he wants at the snap of his fingers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what he wants now is his new handyman, Jack Crawford. But Jack is skittish. One lingering touch, one stolen kiss could send the older man into full retreat. Where Will might have quickly moved on to a more ready-and-willing partner, he unexpectedly finds himself wanting to go slow. With just a little coaxing, he’s sure he can show Jack how good it could be between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack, a recent widower, never thought of himself as gay. Frightened years ago by an erotic encounter with his best friend, he focused firmly on his marriage. Now that his bed is empty, however, those deep sexual longings are rising dangerously close to the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their connection is deep, instant, and one that Jack tries to ignore. Yet friendship grows into an erotic journey that must cross a divide of different generations, backgrounds and worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prize is the one thing neither is sure he can handle—true love.</description>

  <description>Sex in Seattle: Book Two&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Business tycoon Daniel Derenzo lives for his work until his dying father reminds him life is short. When Daniel starts to reevaluate his world he experiences a startling revelation—he’s attracted to his business partner and best friend, Nick, even though Daniel always believed himself to be straight. In typical type-A fashion, Daniel dissects his newfound desires with the help of the experts at the Expanded Horizons sex clinic. He goes after Nick with the fierce determination that’s won him many a business deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Ross was in love with Daniel years ago, when they were roommates in college. But Daniel was straight and Nick patched his broken heart by marrying Marcia. Two kids and fourteen years later, they go through the motions of their marriage like ships passing in the night. But Nick’s kids mean the world to him, and he’s afraid he’ll never get joint custody if they divorced. If he can trust his heart to an awakening Daniel, they all might find their way to a happily ever after.</description>

  <description>Twenty years before &lt;em&gt;You Can't Choose Your Family&lt;/em&gt;, Jay Molenski saved Fran Galloway's life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Franklyn Galloway is the youngest son of a conservative Evangelical minister, and it goes without saying that he is stuck in the closet. He dreams of being an architect, but his father puts a stop to that faster than Fran can say “Frank Lloyd Wright.” So when Fran meets popular, laid-back Jay Molenski, he does everything he can to deny the sparks flying all around them. It only works for so long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a brutal trip home, Fran finds himself staring down a fifth of vodka and a bottle of sleeping pills. How can Jay and his family make Fran see that he deserves not just love, but the freedom to be himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be the change - $1.20 of every sale will be donated to the It Gets Better Project.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This title is part of the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9745914.2010_Advent_Calendar__Naughty_or_Nice" title="2010 Advent Calendar: Naughty or Nice"&gt;2010 Advent Calendar: Naughty or Nice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his young niece Bailey moves in, Cory knows he needs to end his casual fling with Ken. Bailey’s had enough upheaval in her short life, and Cory doesn't want her to get attached to a “friend” who won't be sticking around. Even so, Cory finds himself continuing to let Ken into his life, but a one-night-stand gone serial isn’t what Cory wants, and so he makes The List: his requirements for the perfect partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helping out during a difficult time, Ken finds himself being pulled into the family unit despite Cory’s previous emotional distance. He hopes he's finally breaking through, on the verge of convincing Cory to make their relationship more than a casual one. Then, while helping Bailey write to Santa, he finds Cory's list and takes it as his cue to bow out—just when Cory needs him the most.</description>

  <description>Leaving home to go to university is an exciting phase in anyone’s life. One that’s full of new places, new friends, and new experiences. But Lewis is not prepared for the sudden and intense crush he develops on his out-and-proud flatmate, Max—given that Lewis had always assumed he was straight. Max starts dating another guy, and Lewis’s jealousy at seeing them together forces him to confront his growing attraction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Max’s relationship goes awry, Lewis is the one to comfort him and one thing leads to another. But after a night together, Lewis is devastated that Max wants to go back to being just friends. Lewis tries his best to move on and their friendship survives, but the feelings he has for Max don’t go away. He faces other challenges as he deals with coming out to his parents, and needs Max’s support more than ever. But Lewis isn’t the only one who’s conflicted. When Max finally admits he cares for Lewis too, Lewis must decide whether he dares risk his heart again on being more than just friends.</description>

  <description>Max and Kaelan, best friends and business partners for five years, are powerful casters with a tendency to get themselves into and out of all kinds of trouble. Pretty much the only thing they've been able to avoid is getting romantically involved – until now. Their sexual attraction hits them like a runaway fireball and they can't keep their hands off each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While their sexual attraction burns out of control, they've attracted the attention of a dark caster named Jannes who's planning a spell so potent that it could end the world. To keep them off balance, he's targeting Max and Kaelan through those they love, and there's no one they love more than each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With friends and family to protect and their only allies a group of casters who find it easier to fight than cooperate, the odds are stacked against them. So can Max and Kaelan keep it together and stop Jannes before he ends the world, or is the best they can do just killing time?</description>

  <description>Nothing scared Christian Beck more than his brothers finding out that he was gay. How could he ever tell his three big, buff, women-loving brothers that he was into dudes? What if they thought it was disgusting? What if they disowned him? He loved his brothers so much and couldn’t bear to lose them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His only problem? He was in love with his best friend, who was now his boyfriend. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with this man. He hated having to hide their relationship, but what choice did he have? It was either hide his relationship or risk losing his family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shea Dempsey’s life has been turned upside down and inside out. First, his parents and sister were killed a couple years back, leaving him without any blood relatives. Now, the one person who he considered his only family told him that he was in love with him. The only issue? It was his best friend Christian, who’s gay. So when Christian told him that they could no longer be friends, Shea made a decision that would forever change him. He decided to become Christian’s boyfriend, because honestly, he would do anything to keep his best friend, even if that meant switching teams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their relationship became more involved, Shea realized that he really enjoyed being with men…okay, maybe not all men, but definitely Christian. But he didn’t want to hide what they had together. The only problem was that Christian would not budge on the subject and refused to tell his family about them. Shea didn’t know how long he could live in secret. Will their years of friendship and love for each other be enough? Or will the ultimatum that Shea gives Christian end everything for good?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New Gay Series To Pay Tribute To Sixteen Candles Movie and Other Awesome John Hughes Movies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam never liked his birthdays because not a single one of them was happy... When he turned 1, he fell face-down into his birthday cake; when he turned 5, he broke his left arm and when he turned 7, he broke his right arm and his left leg; when he turned 12, his house caught fire. Now Sam is about to turn 16 and he is dreading the day. The only birthday wish he has is for Jake who is the Mr. Popular of Arcadia High to even acknowledge his existence, or better yet give him a happy-birthday kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Sam knows that it’s not gonna happen. &lt;em&gt;Or is it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The plot of the books substantially varies from the John Hughes movies and all the references to the movies are made as a tribute to their awesomeness.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Six years ago Christian Blakely lost his way. Fresh from college and sure of his future, an unexpected meeting changed everything. Frightened by the truth behind one night’s surrender to a hidden desire, he ran, determined to drive the memory of that night—that man—from his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the years pass, Christian builds a life around his work, drifting between relationships as the image of one man haunts his steps. Wishing he were free from a mire of what might have been, he is offered a chance at redemption when he comes face-to-face with the man at the root of it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gunnery Sergeant Kevin McGuire understands commitment, whether it’s to his work as a US Marine, or to the happiness of his younger sister Risa. A proud and private man, he has never shared the story of the night with Christian; though years have passed he is still affected by it. When circumstances bring the two of them together again, Kevin is shocked by the depth of anger and passion that the younger man stirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the obstacles of Kevin’s resentment and distrust in his way, Christian is confronted with the same choice of six years ago: stay and fight for what he wants, or run and hide…</description>

  <description>Just when the darkness seems permanent, fate flips a switch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Warner has been drifting in a numb haze since his lover was killed by a drunk driver. As the anniversary of the wreck approaches, Michael's grief grows more suffocating. Yet he must find a way through the maze of pain and secrets to live for their troubled young daughter who struggles with guilt that she survived the crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of the darkness comes a voice, a lifeline he never expected to find--Rebecca O'Neill, a development executive in the studio where Michael works as an electrician.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebecca, a former sitcom celebrity left scarred from a crazed fan's attack, has retreated from the limelight and from life in general, certain no man can ever get past her disfigurement. The instant sparks between her and Michael, who arrives to help her during a power outage, come as a complete surprise--and so does her uncanny bond with his daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time, all three feel compelled to examine their inner and outer scars in the light of love. But trust is hard to come by, especially when you're not sure what to believe when you look in the mirror. The scars? Or the truth?</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jason Carrillo&lt;/strong&gt; is a jock with a steady girlfriend, but he can't stop dreaming about sex...with other guys. &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Kyle Meeks&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; gay, but he is. And he hopes he never has to tell anyone -- especially his parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nelson Glassman&lt;/strong&gt; is "out" to the entire world, but he can't tell the boy he loves that he wants to be more than just friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three teenage boys, coming of age and out of the closet. In a revealing debut novel that percolates with passion and wit, Alex Sanchez follows these very different high-school seniors as their struggles with sexuality and intolerance draw them into a triangle of love, betrayal, and ultimately, friendship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>London&lt;br&gt;1907, twenty years into the zombie Plague&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reuben is a baker living in the slums of London, sharing a room with his father and an extended family of cockroaches. Poor, uneducated, and repressing all his sexual desires, he leads a life of misery, only sometimes sprinkled with gin and a rough tumble in a filthy back alley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when he is abducted into Bylondon to be the slave of a wealthy crime family member named Erik Dal, his values are put to the test. His new master is obsessed with all things equestrian, and Reuben soon learns that if he obeys and performs well as Erik's horse, he might just get everything he yearns for: pampering, foods he never even dreamed of, and shameless sex with a demonically handsome young man in leather riding boots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Copper, Erik's treasured dun stallion, Reuben must submit to his new master's obscene fancy of possessing another man completely. That is, if he yearns for treats and not the lick of a riding crop. Fake tails, harnesses, and a new haircut to his ginger mane help Reuben transform into Copper, but the fear of losing his dignity in the eyes of society might just prove to be a bigger restraint than any bit, bridle, or handcuffs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All that for the small price of his freedom. Though at times, Reuben feels it's his soul that Erik is after instead.</description>

  <description>Jillian Banner is adrift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her brother, Gabe, had been her anchor since she was thirteen. But now he’s gone, leaving behind a pregnant fiancée and a business under investigation by the IRS. Jillian is alone, having left the only man she ever loved under a haze of betrayal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Chambers spent the summer trying to get over the loss of Jillian. Now that he also lost his best friend, Gabe, he’s barely keeping it together. He never betrayed Jillian, but he can’t tell her the truth, even if it was all for her. He made promises, and those promises go beyond the grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mourning, Mark and Jillian tentatively restart a relationship, throwing their support behind the mother of Gabe’s child. As the owner of an aquatic store, Jillian takes on her hardest challenge yet, helping a business partner sell captive-bred seahorses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just when Jillian begins to trust Mark again, she finds the men in her life built walls of lies to protect her. To stay afloat, Jillian has to learn what she wants, what she needs and how to be her own anchor.</description>

  <description>Raised in near seclusion by an agoraphobic mother, Davy Cooper’s social skills are almost nonexistent. Now that his mother has died, he needs to make friends for the first time in his life. He catches Gavin Walker’s eye, but the sexy, confident, bad boy hipster intimidates shy Davy so much that he throws away Gavin’s number every time he offers it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gavin defends Davy from a rude guy, Davy begins to warm to him. However, with his limited experience, he thinks he and Gavin are too different, and anything more than a casual acquaintance will end in complete disaster.</description>

  <description>On his 19th birthday Kyle Beauchamp gets the surprise of his life—a make out session in the back of the bus. With his wide receiver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kevin Beauchamp loves two things, football and Kyle. After a rough game and a discreet blow job in the back of the bus, Kevin’s life will never be the same. But the love of his life is straight, and off limits in more ways than one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kyle returns his feelings, Kevin has to decide if a few nights of intense passion is worth destroying their future. He knows one thing—loving his twin might be wrong, but losing Kyle would be like losing the other half of his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two Point Conversion is available at All Romance ebooks and direct from the author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy links &lt;a href="http://mercyceleste.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_25.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://mercyceleste.blogspot.com/p/bl...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>What would you do to make a buck?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are the objects of desire—dancing on the bar or on boxes at circuit parties, performing for either the video camera or their own webcams, or coming to you for a night of passion at a price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they aren’t gods. They are men with needs and desires of their own, fantasy men with fantasies of their own. Some of today’s top writers of gay erotica take on the notion of using your body to make a living—and the result is a collection of erotica so steamy it might burn your hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Handle with care!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Nothing interesting ever happened to fifteen-year-old orphans Eliot and Fiona while they’ve lived in the strict, oppressive household of their grandmother. A chance visit, however, reveals that there is much more to the twins. They are the offspring of a goddess and Lucifer, Prince of Darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, to settle the epic custody battle between these two families, the fallen angels create three diabolical temptations, and the gods fashion three heroic trials to test Eliot and Fiona. More than ever they need to stick together to survive and to learn how to use their budding supernatural abilities . . . for family allegiances are ever-shifting in the ancient, secret world they have entered.</description>

  <description>Visiting his sister Mary at the lighthouse should be a delightful vacation for Elliot--except he’s going there in disgrace while he awaits his fate from the wizard council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary’s assistant, Rue, is a gentle, self-possessed young man about Elliot’s age. Elliot is drawn to him, and his magic seems to calm down around the handsome and mysterious Rue. Elliot sinks gratefully into the unexpected grace of Rue's kindness and friendship. He doesn’t understand why his magic is broken or why it feels whole again around Rue. But right now he’s just trying to survive, grateful for the reprieve Rue’s friendship provides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then a a potential tragedy on the beach culminates in Rue revealing his true nature: he’s a selkie, both man and seal, with a magic that somehow complements and heals Elliot’s when they’re together. And that might not be possible for much longer.</description>

But everything changes when she discovers Hunter cheating on her with Tori—and she is left trying to decide what to do next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sydney becomes captivated by her mysterious neighbor, Ridge Lawson.

No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Business has been slow.  Okay, business has been dead.  And not even of the undead variety.  You would think Chicago would have a little more action for the only professional wizard in the phone book.  But lately, Harry Dresden hasn't been able to dredge up any kind of work--magical &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; mundane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just when it looks like he can't afford his next meal, a murder comes along that requires his particular brand of supernatural expertise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brutally mutilated corpse.  Strange-looking paw prints.  A full moon.  Take three guesses--and the first two don't count...</description>

  <description>All stability in sixteen-year-old Ridge McCoy’s life crashed and burned in the plane crash that killed his dad. This summer-long basketball camp is his chance to improve his skills and escape his problems back home. But his summer plans take a turn in an unexpected direction when he meets Micah Youngblood, the guy who runs the carousel at the local mall and has a reputation for devouring straight boys’ heterosexuality for breakfast, alongside his chocolate chip pancakes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ridge needs a way to avoid the guys at camp, whose only quest for the summer is to drown in beer and hook up with girls. So when Micah offers to explain how the ten unique horses on the carousel are significant to his tribe, Ridge takes him up on it. Still, Ridge can't decide if this is a bad thing or not. All he knows is that he hasn’t felt this alive since his dad fell from the sky, and as the horse adventures come to an end, Ridge finds himself falling as well – for Micah.</description>

  <description>Faeries don’t exist, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what Osian tells himself. So what if the stranger in the pub, the one that glows in the darkened room, has a beauty that is otherworldly. And that the man is watching him with eyes that promise trouble. So what if the music that drifts across the moor sounds like nothing he's ever heard. So what if it’s the night of the summer solstice, the night when the veil between the human world and the faery world is whisper thin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Osian is not a believer. Not until he is kidnapped by Conall and taken to the world of the fey. In the Otherworld, Osian is offered something he’s never had: the love of another man. But this love comes at the cruelest price. For in order to stay with Conall, Osian must give up his home, his friends, and his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is a way out—if he chooses. It involves letting himself go, allowing himself to trust Conall, and finding the true meaning of his name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Osian trust Conall enough to risk it all? It’s a dangerous game he plays, but the prize—love—may be worth the risk of losing it all</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mac is afraid he'll never recover enough to go back to being a cop, while Tony is afraid that he will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three months after being shot, Detective Jared MacLean is healing, but he's afraid it may not be enough to go back on the job. He won't give up, though. Being a cop is written deep in Mac’s bones, and he'll do whatever it takes to carry his badge again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tony used to wish he could have Mac safely home, but watching his strong husband battle disabilities is far from Tony's dream come true.  When Mac is asked to consult on a case involving one of Tony's students, both men will have to face old demons and new fears to find a way to move forward together.</description>

  <description>Pastry chef and bakery owner Jason Wood bakes a mean chocolate soufflé, yet his love life keeps falling flat. He’d blame his past if he wasn’t trying so hard to avoid it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his family’s farmhouse burns to the ground, he’s summoned to identify a body found in the ashes. Jason returns to Hancock, Michigan, and reunites with a childhood friend, small town vet Henry McCavanaugh. After fifteen years apart, their rekindled friendship soon develops into much more. But Jason’s baggage threatens their blossoming romance, and he leaves town unannounced to escape his feelings—and Henry’s feelings for him. He has learned the hard way if something seems too good to be true, it’s best to run for the hills. Jason stress-bakes more confections than he knows what to do with before wondering if he’s running in the wrong direction.</description>

  <description>Rancher Connor Hawkins despises every drop of demon blood that courses through his veins. He would give just about anything to become human. The only way he can make that happen is to participate in a darkly sensual ritual under a rare full Halloween moon with a woman who loves him unconditionally. He's got the full moon, if only he can risk his heart and tell Cassandra Claire what he really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassie Claire thinks she already knows the real Connor, and she's been in love with him since she was eighteen years old. They've shared a unique friendship from the day her father died and Connor brought her home to live with his family. But she's twenty-three now, and on this Halloween night she's determined to make the stoic, stubborn Connor open his eyes and finally see her for the strong, capable young woman she's become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's hard to trust when you never have, and Connor has precious little time before the full Halloween moon wanes, not to be seen again for many, many years. He has to tell her, but if he does, will she love him enough to do what must be done?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They'll both find out, one passionate night under a Demon Moon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Publisher's Note; This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable.]</description>

  <description>Finding happiness is just as easy, and difficult, as letting go… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only good thing Gabe ever had in his miserable life is Malcolm. Having met in college, they were dorm mates, friends, and now business partners in a marketing web design business. Except from day one, Gabe has had feelings for Malcolm that go way beyond the best friend line. Until one night a moment passes between them, and suddenly Malcolm starts seeing Gabe as more. But Malcolm is from an upper-class political family and Gabe grew up moving from one foster home to the next. Where Malcolm is light, Gabe lives in darkness. Pain is his only indicator that he's still breathing. Yet Malcolm begins to strip away Gabe's hurt, layer by layer, until the choice becomes his to accept happiness, or to stay with the path that has always kept his heart safe. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Simon O'Neal's causing trouble again. And it's up to Gail DeMarco to stop him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gail DeMarco left Whiskey Creek, California, to make a name for herself in Los Angeles. Her PR firm has accumulated a roster of A-list clients, including the biggest box office hit of all—sexy and unpredictable Simon O'Neal. But Simon, who's just been through a turbulent divorce, is so busy self-destructing he won't listen to anything she says. She drops him from her list—and he retaliates by taking the rest of her clients with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to save her company, Gail has to humble herself by making a deal with Simon. The one thing he wants is custody of his son, but that's going to require a whole new image. He needs to marry some squeaky-clean girl who'll drag him off to some small, obscure place like Whiskey Creek….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gail's the only one he can trust. She agrees to become his wife—reluctantly. But she isn't reluctant because he's too hard to like. It's because he's too hard not to love!</description>

  <description>Senior associate attorney Derrick Swain wants it all: a loving husband, a fulfilling career, and a couple of kids. After years of hard work he's on the fast track to a promotion. He’s also met the man of his dreams. A week of daily lunch meetings in Central Park provides the perfect setting to get to know him better, and Derrick thinks it won’t be long before they take the next step and go on a date. But instead of asking him out, the object of his affection stops showing up without explanation, leaving him to wonder what went wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part owner of one of the most prestigious law firms in New York City, Roman Bradford knows that professional success isn’t the be all end all. Although he’s been lucky in life, true love has eluded him for the most part. One too many failed relationships have caused him to be leery of trying again, until he meets a man that can only be described as temptation personified. A few conversations is all it takes for Roman to start believing things will be different this time around. It doesn’t matter that they are boss and employee, or that he’s feeling too much, too fast. Not when he can see the same emotions in Derrick’s eyes. Then life turns on a dime, and Roman has no option but to let his chance at happiness go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A battle of wills ensues when a life-altering case brings them together a year later. Roman wants to do the right thing by not letting anything happen between them, and Derrick is determined to prove they’re meant to be together. Evidence will be presented and final arguments will be made. Will they be able to come to an agreement, or will they opt to have their potential relationship dismissed?</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old best friends Rachel and Riley are in forbidden love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their situation’s. . .complicated. And their timing couldn’t be worse—in just one month, he leaves for California and she starts college in New York. The absolute last thing they need is a reckless secret-love confession mucking up their perfect plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s only one logical option: scientific intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate for a quick fix, they sign up for WAVES, an experimental self-help program led by mysterious scientist David A. Kerning. He swears his Forbidden Love Module can turn passion back to safe platonic friendship in “six easy steps.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when you arm yourself with an untested program, side effects are unpredictable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sometimes when you fight love—love fights back.</description>

  <description>In a kingdom ravaged by the beasts and terrors of an ancient war, the only hope against them is the army of mixed-blood beings known as the King's Legion: dragoons, shadowmarch, sorcerers, titans … and the Princes of the Blood, nigh-invincible warriors of fearsome magic and strength, their only weakness a need for pure human blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his brother runs away, Raffé agrees to undergo the Blooding, but he is a pale imitation of his strong, capable brother. No one expects him to survive and become a Prince, merely to die to save the rest of his family and preserve honor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But runaways and weaklings are the least of the kingdom’s concerns when an ancient evil returns with new tricks, and their only hope lies with knowledge long lost and a fierce bond forged in darkness …</description>

  <description>Rasputin’s kiss is lethal. He’s a ghost – killing and disappearing into the night. With few leads and four bodies on his conscience, Detective Inspector Alex Courtney and his team are running on empty and it’s only a matter of time before Rasputin strikes again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Alex recruits a young detective to play the part of his boyfriend and provide a tempting target for a killer, he knows he is taking a huge risk. He doesn’t expect Conor Trethuan to be a perfect potential submissive. When their mutual attraction becomes more, Alex has to face the conflict between his possessive instincts and the need to push his young lover into danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Investigating their feelings has to come second to investigating the case. There’s no time to decide if what they feel for each other is real. With Rasputin closing in, they may not live to find out.</description>

  <description>"Curiosity never killed this cat, but love could have deadly consequences. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sasha Soskoff has two reasons for moving to Chicago: secure a tenured position in veterinary research medicine, and widen his horizons. After a night at the city s hottest new club, though, a wrong turn down a dark alley narrows his focus to surviving three muggers. As consciousness fades, he catches a glimpse of his rescuer, whose mere appearance is enough to chase the attackers off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neal Harrison doesn t often have to call on his skills as an ex-Marine to maintain control at his club. But with Sasha, he can t seem to keep his hands to himself. Yet there s danger in allowing any close relationships, particularly with a naive young newcomer. The safety of his business depends on the iron-clad secret he and his ex-Marine buddies all hide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Neal seems happy to satisfy Sasha s insatiable curiosity about the erotic scenes played out in the club s private rooms, Sasha senses his new lover is holding something back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the truth claws its way out amid a night of tribal blood and violence, Neal discovers his lover has a secret of his own. And that the forces arrayed against them all could make a mugging look like a walk in the park&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains explicit, adult situations: male on male, more males on several more males, no-holds-barred erotic scenes, no-claws-barred violence, and love forged in the heat of desire.</description>

  <description>With a beautiful, doting fiancée and a dream job at one of New York City’s top law firms, life is going well for ambitious but inexperienced attorney, Ryan Paullson. Handpicked by his new boss, Joseph Van Aardt, to work on the firm’s biggest case, Ryan soon finds himself out of his depth and struggling with a dangerous and irresistible attraction to the charismatic and ruthless Van Aardt—an attraction that seems mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan and Joseph begin a secret affair as they work to build their case against controversial billionaire Jack McNeil. As their affair heats up, Ryan starts to fear how far Joseph is willing to go to win the case, and when two critical witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, Ryan doesn’t know whether to suspect McNeil or his lover. He wants to be with Joseph; he just doesn’t know how far he’ll have to go--or how far he’ll have to fall--to hold onto him.</description>

  <description>What would you do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Carber was in a bad spot. Betrayed and thrown in prison, he had to figure out fast how to survive, and with no idea who to trust and who not to trust. To make matters worse, he had already gotten on the bad side of The Kennel on day one. But his biggest threat was the vacant psychopath named Adder, whose cell he found himself sharing. And with this one, his best tools for survival, his skills as a con man, had no effect at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How would you survive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack faced dangerous enemies, an indifferent prison administration, and an inmate advocate with his own twisted agenda. He was determined to keep himself alive and sane, even as he began to slowly give up on himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as he kept his head down and didn’t fall prey to the fatal mistake of trusting anyone ever again, he’d eventually get out alive... in body if not in spirit. And that seemed like the most he could expect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would keep you going?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sudden revelation and the resulting puzzle, though, throws his world into a wildly different light. He’s unexpectedly clutching at a glimmer of hope, something more than mere survival, and yet fighting to not repeat the mistakes of his past again. But something deep inside him begs him to take that risk one more time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because, exactly how far would you be willing to go to protect the best thing that ever happened to you, especially when it hadn’t even happened?</description>

  <description>When James first discovers he can heal, he thinks he has a rare and miraculous gift. But when he learns the price, it feels more like a curse. He falls passionately and completely in love with every person, male or female, he heals. But only until he heals again, when he becomes hotly infatuated with the next person. He doesn’t dare express feelings he knows are only transitory or hold out hope anyone will love him back under those conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, he meets Ambient, the victim of a car accident, dying, his neck broken. James heals him despite knowing what is in store. He can’t resist Ambient, and to his amazement, Ambient returns his feelings. Thinking Ambient has broken the curse, James heals the next injured person he comes across. To his joy, and confusion, he does not fall in love anew. If anything, his feelings toward Ambient intensify. Awash with the certainty that somehow, he and Ambient are meant for each other, they set out to learn the truth about James’s strange power.</description>

  <description>John Williams, the Viscount of Marsdale, libertine, duelist, dilettante, haphazard philanthropist and philosopher, is asked by his estranged father to start a plantation in Jamaica in 1667. He doesn't realize that he is going to the right island for the wrong reasons until he meets buccaneers and learns he has far more in common with the wild Brethren of the Coast than he does with the nobility of Christendom. Still, he questions joining them and leaving his title and the plantation behind, until he meets Gaston the Ghoul, a mysterious French buccaneer who is purportedly mad. He quickly decides that the freedom of the buccaneer life and even the mere chance of love that a man such as Gaston might offer are better than anything he could ever inherit. But even though Gaston seems intrigued by him, can the crazy Frenchman ever love him?</description>

  <description>Jared Hartley is happy. He has a starring role in a popular West End musical, great friends, adoring fans and his own flat in Central London. A relationship is not something he has ever really wanted. Making big plans for the future is not in his nature – Jared is content with his single status and enjoying all the benefits of that lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;He doesn’t even realise something is missing in his life.&lt;br&gt;Until he meets Fenix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fenix Bergman has a dream – to perform on Broadway. When he gets offered the lead role in Poison – a new musical based in London, he accepts, immediately recognising the huge potential of the show. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fenix thinks he has his life completely figured out – he will move to London, help Poison become the new West End hit and bide his time until Broadway comes knocking on his door. He has never wished for anything else but proving to himself and the world that he is a performer worthy of the biggest theatre stage.&lt;br&gt;Until he meets Jared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared and Fenix’s lives collide and they fill each other’s missing pieces. Neither of them expects to feel so much, so fast for the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither of them expects to need someone so badly when love hasn’t even been in their plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Fenix’s star becomes too bright for London, will the dream he’s chased all his life ruin the dream he’s holding in his hands?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will he survive getting everything he’s ever wanted?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Jared?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*explicit sexual content, graphic language and adult themes. Recommended for readers 18+ only*</description>

  <description>In the latest eBook original novel in Ruthie Knox’s scorching-hot Camelot series, a no-strings fling looks an awful lot like falling in love—or flirting with disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fresh out of a fiasco of a marriage, Katie Clark has retreated to her hometown to start over. The new Katie is sophisticated, cavalier, and hell-bent on kicking butt at her job in her brother’s security firm. But on her first assignment—digging up the truth about the stalker threatening a world-famous singer-songwriter—Katie must endure the silent treatment from a stern but sexy partner who doesn’t want her help . . . or her company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean Owens knows that if he opens his mouth around Katie, she’ll instantly remember him as the geeky kid who sat behind her in high school. Silence is golden, but he can’t keep quiet forever, not with Katie stampeding through their investigation. It’s time for Sean to step up and take control of the case, and his decade-old crush. If he can break through Katie’s newfound independence, they just might find they make a perfect team—on the road, on the job, and in bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: How to Misbehave, Along Came Trouble, and About Last Night.</description>

  <description>Witches and hunters. Blood and magic. Heartache and lust. Will history repeat itself? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lora Smith's life changes forever one day deep in the English fens. Caught up in the Witch trials of 1645, her life ends tragically early, yet her legacy lives on. &lt;br&gt;Regan White is a 21st century Brighton girl who loves to shop, party, and shop some more. Forced to relocate to her aunt's crumbling old house in the fenland of West Norfolk, away from everything she's ever known, Regan's life takes a mysterious twist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A box of old diaries tell of strange happenings, striking a chord with Regan's own recent unnerving experience in the lingering fog of the fens and drawing her deeper into the mystery. Destiny is a big word but it seems that Regan's is irrevocably entwined in this bewitching landscape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do the diaries, her band of new friends, and the captivating American Nate Hunter, all tie together? Will Regan find the link before it is too late, or will she share Lora's fate?</description>

  <description>Born to a prestigious political family, Avery Adams plays as hard as he works. The gorgeous, charismatic attorney is used to getting what he wants, even the frequent one-night stands that earn him his well-deserved playboy reputation. When some of the most prominent men in politics suggest he run for senate, Avery decides the time has come to follow in his grandfather's footsteps. With a strategy in place and the campaign wheels rolling, Avery is ready to jump on the legislative fast track, full steam ahead. But no amount of planning prepares him for the handsome, uptight restaurateur who might derail his political future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy isn't even in the top thousand words to describe Kane Dalton's life after his father, a devout southern Baptist minister, kicks him out of the family home for questioning his sexual orientation. Despite all the rotten tomatoes life throws his way, Kane makes something of himself. Between owning a thriving upscale Italian restaurant in the heart of downtown Minneapolis and managing his long-term boyfriend, his plate is full. He struggles to get past the teachings of his childhood to fully accept his sexuality and rid himself of the doubts brought on by his religious upbringing. The last thing he needs is the yummy, sophisticated, blond-haired distraction sitting at table thirty-four.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Liam Davis is a serious journalist, and he’s good at it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or at least, he &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;. Until the chief of &lt;em&gt;Scribe&lt;/em&gt;, the campus magazine, makes him give up his politics column to write for the party page—the party page that is problematic for two reasons: One, it threatens Liam’s chance of getting the traineeship with his apathetic father at his prestigious newspaper company, and two, he has no idea what it means to party, let alone how to capture this new audience’s attention!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Liam Davis is no quitter. He’s determined to prove to his father, the chief, and above all himself that he can do it—and do it &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life doesn’t make it easy. Not when Freddy Krueger comes stalking out of the shadows to attack him. Luckily the Raven, the campus vigilante—the vigilante getting hate mail sent to &lt;em&gt;Scribe&lt;/em&gt;’s opinions page—comes to his rescue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, between finding the perfect angle for his party page columns and making friends (and perhaps something more?), Liam needs to find this mysterious Raven—not only to thank him, but to warn him to watch his back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~Out Now~&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>To Be Released Summer 2014...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyson Thompson graduated high school at sixteen and left the town of Seafare, Oregon, bound for what he assumed would be bigger and better things. He soon found out the real world has teeth, and he returns to the coast with four years of failure, addiction, and a diagnosis of panic disorder trailing behind him. His brother, Bear, and his brother's husband, Otter, believe coming home is exactly what Tyson needs to find himself again.  Surrounded by family in the Green Monstrosity, Tyson attempts to put the pieces of his broken life back together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But shortly after he arrives home, Tyson comes face to face with inevitability in the form of his childhood friend and first love, Dominic Miller, who he hasn't seen since the day he left Seafare. As their paths cross, old wounds reopen, new secrets are revealed, and Tyson discovers there is more to his own story than he was told all those years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a sea of familiar faces, new friends, and the memories of a mother's devastating choice, Tyson will learn that in order to have any hope for a future, he must fight the ghosts of his past.</description>

  <description>Dreams of the heart aren’t always secret. When the desire is strong enough—or the heart worthy enough—the words whisper on the wind. Tavish Black is the man who hears those secret desires…and sometimes makes them come true. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch thinks he’s about to get that elusive ménage he’s always craved when he accepts an invitation to make his darkest desire come true. When his blindfold is removed and the third member of their trio revealed as his own twin brother, Mitch realizes Tavish Black understood the true forbidden nature of his fantasy, all along. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is book one in a series of erotic short stories involving Tavish Black and his mysterious invitations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This series contains material that may cause your e-reader to spontaneously combust. It is strongly recommended that you read in a place where your moans won’t disturb others. Includes content some readers may find uncomfortable. Especially without plenty of lube. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pulp Friction: Heated Exchange…Leaving you Satisfied For Now</description>

  <description>Jason Day, brilliant designer of video games, is not only a confirmed bachelor, but he’s as gay as a maypole. One wouldn’t think being saddled with his precocious four-year-old nephew for four weeks would be enough to throw him off-kilter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong. Timmy, Jason’s nephew, is a true handful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just when Timmy and Uncle Jason begin to bond, and Jason feels he’s getting a grip on this babysitting business once and for all, he’s thrown for a loop by a couple of visitors—one from Tucson, the other from beyond the grave. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m sorry. Say what? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toss a murder, a hot young stud, an unexpected love affair, and a spooky-ass ghost with a weird sense of humor into Jason’s summer plans, and you’ve got the makings for one hell of a ride.</description>

  <description>Ara Costas has it all—riches, power, and the kind of beauty that attracts all the right people. He’s flying high and loves his life, until a serious car accident leaves him horribly scarred. Ara becomes an angry recluse, hiding away in his Chicago high-rise apartment, running his multimillion-dollar business from behind a computer screen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ilias Adams is a quiet farm boy who keeps his nose buried in books. A great education and stellar resume land him a job as Ara's assistant and liaison to the board of directors. Little did he know when he signed up for this dream job that he’d end up working for the world's moodiest, most uptight boss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ilias is scared of Ara at times, but he recognizes the challenge he faces when he meets Ara and sees the reason for the man’s anger. Ara is guarded and suspicious, since he can’t believe anyone can bear to look at him. Despite all this, Ilias is determined to turn the beast into a beauty again, at least on the inside, and tear down the walls Ara has so carefully constructed around him.</description>

  <description>Prince Alar is notorious... and tormented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prince's decadence is as famous as his extraordinary beauty. Rumor holds that he murdered his own brother to get one step closer to the throne. Some believe him to be the son of a fallen angel. But beneath his icy exterior, the prince burns with secret guilt... and untapped passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Farm boy Garin is innocent... and reckless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garin is shocked when Prince Alar rides into his village and demands that the young men strip for his inspection... so he can select one as his new slave! To protect his brother, Garin volunteers, leaving his peaceful village-- and his innocence-- behind. But even naked and chained, he is no helpless victim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the palace, Garin discovers a new world of decadent sex, dangerous intrigue, and devastating passion. But from the moment the arrogant prince puts a collar around Garin's throat and claims him as his own, the men are bound together in more ways than one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From sadistic sex games to tender caretaking, from erotic awakenings to a deadly gladiatorial match, their journey together pushes both men to their physical and emotional limits... and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A novel of the passion that consumes, the love that sustains, and the ties that bind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This erotic romance is intended for mature readers. It contains graphic scenes of gay sex and gay BDSM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Prince of Silk and Thorns" was originally published in serialized form under the title of "The Prince's Defiant Slave."

  <description>[Siren Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, werewolves, HEA]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loner Matt Urban has somehow ended up as alpha to a pack of outcasts and misfits. When an injured shifter blunders onto their territory one night, swearing he didn’t know it was pack territory, Matt is suspicious. It doesn’t help that the stranger, Jesse Turner, is as stubborn as Matt. Wanting answers, Matt persuades Jesse to stay a while, and the intense attraction they feel for one another soon blazes into heat. That’s when Matt realizes—the stranger with the smart mouth and the attitude problem is his mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt, still mourning the lover he lost years ago, doesn’t want a mate, and Jesse doesn’t believe in mates. Yet neither of them can deny the pull they feel toward one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re still struggling with the situation when a hostile alpha claims Jesse. Matt has to fight to protect Jesse. First, though, he has to fight Jesse’s stubborn independence if he’s to win his heart.</description>

  <description>On September 1, 2011, TJ Klune wrote, "...it's not about the ending, it's about the journey..." in a review of Eric Arvin's Woke Up in a Strange Place. With those words, two men began a journey of love and invited us to ride along. TJ and Eric have shared so much with us: their wonderful books, their smiles, their humor, their lives, and their inspiring devotion to each other. In December of 2013, their journey took a detour when Eric was taken to the emergency room. He survived the surgery to remove a cavernous hemangioma from his brain stem, but the challenges TJ and Eric face are far from over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors in this anthology donated their talent as a way to support Eric's continued recovery, to help bring strength to TJ, and to show both of them just how much love surrounds them. Grand Adventures is a diverse range of stories about the journey of love. We’re going on some grand adventures for a great cause. Thank you for joining us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One hundred percent of the income from this volume goes directly to TJ and Eric.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foreword by S.A.

  <description>In the early 23rd Century, vampires learned how to travel back in time, and created a time-tsunami that threatened life as we know it, until they corrected their mistake. They created the Chronometric Conservation Agency, which is tasked with preserving history and therefore protecting humanity's future. The Touring arm of the Agency offers trips back into the real past, with vampire guides, called travellers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Natalia (Tally) Marta, vampire and traveller, takes her client to visit the siege of Stirling Castle in 1314, she is caught and held hostage for ransom by Robert MacKenzie, a Bruce clansman. Rob finds himself drawn to the wilful, stubborn and very different English lady he has captured and the relationship becomes an intimate, highly-charged sexual pairing. Swiftly, Tally and Rob realize their bond is more than sexual, that the emotions stirring their hearts are true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian Lee Hamilton, vampire, one of the last true southern gentlemen, and Tally's ex-lover, knows the 1314 time marker enough to jump back and help Tally return home. His arrival at Bannockburn adds complications, for Christian finds himself drawn to Rob MacKenzie as much as Tally is. But neither of them can stay in the past forever. To do so means certain death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING:  This book contains two hot, sexy alpha heroes, frequent, explicit and frank sex scenes and sexual language.  It includes heart-stopping sexual scenes between the aforementioned  Sexy heroes, menage scenes, and anal sex.&lt;br&gt;Do not proceed beyond this point if hot love scenes offend you.&lt;br&gt;No vampires were harmed in the making of this novel.</description>

Old rivalries and new resentments flared between Cameron and his brothers, but they tried to put aside their differences for Seth's sake. In the end, a social worker would decide Seth's fate, and as tough as she was beautiful, she had the power to bring the Quinns together--or tear them apart...</description>

  <description>Stella has a passion for planning that keeps her from taking too many risks. But when she opens her heart to a new love, she discovers that she will fight to the death to protect what's hers. — Trying to escape the ghosts of the past, young widow Stella Rothchild, along with her two energetic little boys, has moved back to her roots in southern Tennessee-and into her new life at Harper House and In the Garden nursery. She isn't intimidated by the house-nor its mistress, local legend Roz Harper. Despite a reputation for being difficult, Roz has been nothing but kind to Stella, offering her a comfortable new place to live and a challenging new job as manager of the flourishing nursery. As Stella settles comfortably into her new life, she finds a nurturing friendship with Roz and with expectant mother Hayley. And she discovers a fierce attraction with ruggedly handsome landscaper Logan Kitridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But someone isn't happy about the budding romance...the Harper Bride. As the women dig into the history of Harper House, they discover that grief and rage have kept the Bride's spirit alive long past her death. And now, she will do anything to destroy the passion that Logan and Stella share.</description>

  <description>Detective Cashel 'Cash' Godfrey is big, tattooed and angry so people typically keep their distance. He's fresh out of the police academy, however, no one is looking to partner with the six foot four beast with a huge chip on his shoulder and an inability to trust. When Cash scans the orientation room he wasn't expecting to find sexy hazel eyes locked onto him. Eyes of the handsome Detective Leonidis 'Leo' Day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leo is charming, witty, hilariously sarcastic and the only one that can make Cash smile. He’s proud, out and one bad-ass detective.​&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together Cash and Leo become the most revered and successful narcotics detectives Atlanta’s ever seen. Able to communicate and understand each other, without even having to voice it, they quickly climb up the promotional ranks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Cash saves Leo's life in a raid that turns deadly, Leo begins to see something in the big man that no one else does…something special. But Leo fears he'll never break through the impenetrable wall that protects Cash's heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing Special takes the reader through various emotions throughout the richly fulfilling plot that’s full of erotic gay romance, heartache, passion, trials and tribulations, police action scenes, and an intriguing twist that comes to an amazing ending that’s impossible to see coming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Title and Synopsis created by the LaSalle Sister of Man2Mantastic</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Kiram Kir-Zaki may be considered a mechanist prodigy among his own people, but when he becomes the first Haldiim ever admitted to the prestigious Sagrada Academy, he is thrown into a world where power, superstition and swordplay outweigh even the most scholarly of achievements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the intimidation from his Cadeleonian classmates turns bloody, Kiram unexpectedly finds himself befriended by Javier Tornesal, the leader of a group of cardsharps, duelists and lotharios who call themselves Hellions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However Javier is a dangerous friend to have. Wielder of the White Hell and sole heir of a dukedom, he is surrounded by rumors of forbidden seductions, murder and damnation. His enemies are many and any one of his secrets could not only end his life but Kiram's as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One of the few joys in Dan's life is the TV show Junk Shop, a reality show about antiques hosted by the handsome and charismatic Malcolm Tell. Then an old music box turns up, and Dan's sister encourages him to try to get on the show and meet the object of his affection. He does, and his life changes completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dan and Malcolm first meet, they have a sudden vision of a couple from the past. Is it a glimpse at a past life or something else entirely? They agree to work together to figure out what is going on, and they stumble upon a forgotten Celtic myth that may explain everything. If the myth is true, then Dan and Malcolm could be a pair of lovers who have been reincarnated over and over again over two thousand years. That seems impossible, but it's hard to deny that something very strange is happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dan and Malcolm work to find the truth, they fall for each other hard. But searching for who they really are puts them both in grave danger, and they find themselves racing against time to keep their happily ever after.</description>

  <description>The neighbouring kingdoms of Oscia and Arcathia have been at a tentative peace for three years after centuries of warfare. Prince Severin of Arcathia has been brought up to put duty before all else and as the only son of the King and Queen, it is his duty to marry and produce an heir. His parents want him to marry an Oscian princess to cement that tentative peace. Unfortunately Severin isn't interested in princesses. Now, if he had his pick of princes that would be another matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Havyn has been a slave all his life. When his aptitude for wizardry is discovered, he finds himself purchased and freed by Prince Severin and apprenticed to the royal wizard, Ildar. His duty is to stay chaste to keep his powers strong, but his feelings for Severin sorely test his resolve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With kingdoms at war, the throne hanging in the balance, magic in the air, and outside forces trying to keep them apart, can the two men find happiness together, or is duty more important than love?</description>

  <description>Inspired by Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, BLACK SPRING reimagines the passionate story in a fantasy 19th century society sustained by wizardry and the vengeance code of vendetta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna spent her childhood with Damek and her volatile foster sister Lina, daughter of the Lord of the village. Lina has magical powers, and in this brutal patriarchal society women with magical powers are put to death as babies. Lina’s father, however, refuses to kill her but when vendetta explodes in their village and Lina’s father dies, their lives are changed forever. Their new guardian Masko sends Anna away and reduces Lina to the status of a servant. Damek—mad with love for Lina—attempts to murder Masko, then vanishes for several years. Anna comes home five years later to find Lina about to marry a pleasant young farmer, and witnesses Damek’s vengeful return and its catastrophic consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passionate, atmospheric and haunting, BLACK SPRING will stay with readers long after they turn the final page.</description>

  <description>Wise-cracking Wiley Cantrell is loud and roaringly outrageous—and he needs to be to keep his deeply religious neighbors and family in the Deep South at bay. A failed writer on food stamps, Wiley works a minimum wage job and barely manages to keep himself and his deaf son, Noah, more than a stone’s throw away from Dumpster-diving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah was a meth baby and has the birth defects to prove it. He sees how lonely his father is and tries to help him find a boyfriend while Wiley struggles to help Noah have a relationship with his incarcerated mother, who believes the best way to feed a child is with a slingshot. No wonder Noah becomes Wiley’s biggest supporter when Boston nurse Jackson Ledbetter walks past Wiley’s cash register and sets his sugar tree on fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson falls like a wet mule wearing concrete boots for Wiley’s sense of humor. And while Wiley represents much of the best of the South, Jackson is hiding a secret that could threaten this new family in the making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When North meets South, the cultural misunderstandings are many, but so are the laughs, and the tears, but, as they say down in Dixie, it’s all good.</description>

  <description>In a world where it's unusual but men can carry children, boutique owner Kyle Gerritsen has just about managed to get his life back on an even keel after a pretty rocky couple of years when someone puts a brick through his shop window. Typical of the way his life has gone of late it’s suspected he is the latest victim of a mini crime wave in his neighbourhood and he is horrified when one of the investigating detectives assigned to his case turns out to be Jonah Goldman – otherwise known as the one night stand that has unknowingly fathered Kyle’s beloved son Shea. Kyle doesn’t know whether to be relieved or outraged when it is apparent that Jonah has no memory of their night together but knows that he needs to do everything he can to keep out of the studly detective’s way in future – especially as the gleam in the detective’s eye is all too familiar and the last time he saw it he ended up a single father! Jonah just knows that there’s something about Kyle and he’s just interested enough to ignore Kyle’s increasingly desperate attempts at rejection to try and figure out what it is.</description>

  <description>In this all-new novel from the author of &lt;em&gt;Unbound,&lt;/em&gt; a woman with a rocky past finds romance in the last place she’d ever expect...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie Goodhouse doesn’t need to be warned about bad boys; good sense and an abusive ex have given her plenty of reasons to play it safe. But when she steps into her new role as outreach librarian for Cousins Correctional Facility, no amount of good sense can keep her mind—or eyes—off inmate Eric Collier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric doesn’t claim to be innocent of the crime that landed him in prison. In fact, he’d do it again if that’s what it took to keep his family safe. Loyalty and force are what he knows. But meeting Annie makes him want to know more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eric begins courting Annie through letters, they embark on a reckless, secret romance—a forbidden fantasy that neither imagines could ever be real…until early parole for Eric changes everything, and forces them both to face a past they can’t forget, and a desire they can’t deny.</description>

  <description>A former smuggler and thief, Ariq—better known as the Kraken King—doesn’t know what to make of the clever, mysterious woman he rescues from an airship besieged by marauders. Unsure if she’s a spy or a pawn in someone else’s game, Ariq isn’t about to let her out of his sight until he finds out…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After escaping her fourth kidnapping attempt in a year, Zenobia Fox has learned to vigilantly guard her identity. While her brother Archimedes is notorious for his exploits, Zenobia has had no adventures to call her own—besides the stories she writes. But when she jumps at the chance to escape to the wilds of Australia and acquire research for her next story, Zenobia quickly discovers that the voyage will be far more adventurous than any fiction she could put to paper…</description>

  <description>For those who have loved &lt;em&gt;Seraphina&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Graceling&lt;/em&gt; comes another truly fabulous fantasy...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five centuries, a witch’s curse has bound the trolls to their city beneath the ruins of Forsaken Mountain. Time enough for their dark and nefarious magic to fade from human memory and into myth. But a prophesy has been spoken of a union with the power to set the trolls free, and when Cécile de Troyes is kidnapped and taken beneath the mountain, she learns there is far more to the myth of the trolls than she could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cécile has only one thing on her mind after she is brought to Trollus: escape. Only the trolls are clever, fast, and inhumanly strong. She will have to bide her time, wait for the perfect opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But something unexpected happens while she’s waiting – she begins to fall for the enigmatic troll prince to whom she has been bonded and married. She begins to make friends. And she begins to see that she may be the only hope for the half-bloods – part troll, part human creatures who are slaves to the full-blooded trolls. There is a rebellion brewing. And her prince, Tristan, the future king, is its secret leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Cécile becomes involved in the intricate political games of Trollus, she becomes more than a farmer’s daughter. She becomes a princess, the hope of a people, and a witch with magic powerful enough to change Trollus forever.</description>

  <description>Rush&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Women in his bed, celebs and rockers in his chair and a killer bank account at his disposal, life is pretty freaking swell. Then she walks back into it again. With her mismatched eyes, perfect pink mouth and a laugh that still haunts him, she gave him nothing but marvelous misery. Now she wants his hands on her again. Not for pleasure, but for pain. For Ink. A bleeding heart to match the one she left him with five years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She can’t forget him. No matter how hard she’s tried. The pain she caused him in the past eats at her daily, and she can’t move on with her life. But she has a plan, a hope for redemption – a way for him to take his revenge out on her flesh. But it’ll only work if he lets her inside his exclusive world, under his famous artist’s needle and into his bed—and heart-once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*First Ink can also be found in the Wicked Firsts Anthology releasing on August 19, 2013.*</description>

  <description>After a tragic accident devastates his family, 16-year-old Rick St. James starts his junior year of high school alone in a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah. When he meets Kevin Vincent, he’s too distracted by the promise of new friends to see that Kevin has secrets of his own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having created an environment where he's feared and admired by his classmates, Kevin finds pleasure in using his good looks and violence to control and manipulate those around him. Secretly, he cruises the gay club scene, turning tricks to earn money so he can party and get high. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Rick’s dad becomes increasingly violent and abusive at home, the two form a surprising and volatile trust. In this battle of wills, their precarious friendship will either keep their lives from blowing up around them or possibly light the fuse that will cause the explosion.</description>

  <description>Ethan Abbatt is a wolf shifter who can't shift. Plagued by pain and weakness all his life, he hopes to find an honorable death by joining his pack mates in a vampire attack. Instead, Ethan learns two things: draining his blood releases his pain and his wolf, and he has a true mate - a vampire named Miguel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miguel Rodriguez is more than four centuries old. Strong, powerful, and vicious, he walks through life as a shadow, without happiness or affection. When a young shifter tells Miguel they're true mates, destined to be together, Miguel sends him away. But Ethan is persistent, and Miguel can't resist for long. Once Miguel gives in, being together comes naturally. The challenge is keeping themselves alive so they can stay by each other's side until forever comes.</description>

  <description>Human-like, but not human, the nara ruled Tanyrin for centuries. The most feared among them were their naragi, sorcerers whose power was all but invincible. Not until the coming of Arami Lothlain, King of Tanyrin and Blessed of Loth, did the rein of the nara come to a bloody end. For four hundred years afterwards, the land was at peace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stefn Eldering was the youngest son of the Earl of Shia, the last in a long, proud line of demon hunters. He was also a sin-catcher, living proof of God's displeasure, the shame of his existence atonement for the sins of his ancestors. Michael Arranz was the son of a duke and one of the despised h'naran, half-bloods cursed with the blood of the nara running through their veins. Of all the h'nara, his family alone was immune from the persecution of the powerful Church of Loth, protected by an ancient covenant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In ordinary times, the paths of Michael and Stefn would never have crossed. Alas, times were no longer ordinary. The latest of the Lothlain kings was a weakling, unable to curb the ambitions of an increasingly powerful, corrupt clergy. Famine stalked the land. Fear of the h'nara, fanned by the Church, spread tentacles everywhere. Tanyrin teetered on the edge of chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A loyal and devoted friend to Tanyrin's crown prince, Michael could refuse Severyn Lothlain nothing, not even when Severyn asked the unspeakable of him. Determined to wrest the throne from his brother, Severyn intended nothing less than the resurrection of the ancient naragi. Michael, whose naran blood was the purest in Tanyrin, was the logical choice. But for Michael to become what mankind feared most, he needed a conduit through which to take the powerful, dangerous magic of the Dark Stream. He needed a man who carried the ancient blood of the cethera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He needed Stefn Eldering.</description>

  <description>My name is Jade Lennon and I stand still for money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The night I saw Shane Arthur watching me everything changed. A man in a suit always catches my eye, but it was the way he looked at me that was different. Like he knew me or something. He didn’t know me, especially not in my costume. My sobriety rests on staying away from men, but there was something about him that made me throw caution to the wind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, I was never going to see him again, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Standing still isn’t the only way I make my money. I also bartend at a concert hall. Never in my wildest dreams did I think Shane was going to show up there. Not only that, but he’s the most recent addition to the orchestra. So now on a daily basis I have to resist one of the most beautiful men I’ve ever met &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he plays the violin. For me that’s one hell of a deadly cocktail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wants me to teach him how to live. I’m not sure how much a twenty-six year old recovering alcoholic who works in a bar and moonlights as a living statue can teach a world class concert violinist, but I’m sure going to try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Life with Strings&lt;/em&gt; is a story of music, art, sex, magical realism, and romance that you will never forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expected date of publication: March 24th 2014.</description>

  <description>Over two hundred and fifty years ago the Fallocaust happened, killing almost everything that lived and creating what is now known as the greywastes. A dead wasteland where cannibalism is a necessity, death your reality, and life before the radiation nothing but pictures in dog-eared magazines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reaver is a greywaster, living in a small block controlled by a distant ruler said to have started the Fallocaust. He is a product of the savage world he was raised in and prides himself on being cold and cruel. Then someone new to his town catches his eye, someone different than everyone else. Without knowing why he starts to silently stalk him, unaware of where it will lead him.</description>

  <description>Fifteen years ago, Darcy Walker's parents thought it was a good idea to give her  a unique name: Darcy, meaning "dark walker." Whether that was a stroke of genius or stroke of stupid, they definitely nailed the irony. She lacks direction, her grades stink despite a high IQ, she's boringly average--although flirting admirers claim otherwise--and God help her, she's infatuated with a bad-boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bad-boy that her hottie best friend, Dylan, wishes would get acquainted with his fist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, oh yeah, there's that tattoo that was a royally stupid idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her life spiraling out of control, everything changes when she skips class and finds a dead body...in fact, it gets worse. It jump starts Darcy's inner-verb, and her brain hard-wired for action gets caught up in a situation she can’t let go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the fictional Cincinnati town of Valley, Ohio, Darcy falls into a world of threats, violence, and gangland exploits chasing down every clue to finger the murderer. When a fellow misfit is fingered for the crime, Darcy goes from zero-to-sixty trying to clear his name--constructing aliases, breaking the law, everything that makes perfect sense to her but reeks of Grade A Stupid to everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble is...will she live to see sixteen?</description>

  <description>Benjamin Pepperwhistle has one overriding desire: to handle the glorious machinery that is a gun. So when he decides to run away to join the circus, it's only natural that he should seek out the legendary pistoleer, Cole Beauchamp, and beg to be his assistant. Life in the circus has definite ups and downs, but as Benjamin settles in to his role, he finds that some perks are even better than he'd anticipated.</description>

  <description>What happens when a raunchy, bisexual rock star is the prize in a battle between an angel and a demon? And can it matter? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that dirty, sweaty rock star is going to become a leader and influence a generation, yes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An angel and a demon have been given a challenge by Management. One or the other must win Cash over. To the good, or to the bad. And when supernatural beings battle, any filthy trick and subterfuge is permitted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner take all. With seven deadly sins to play with, it’s going to get creative. And Management may not approve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains bad behavior, hot m/m action, and a lot of sweaty leather. Approx. 16,500+ words plus bonus material.</description>

  <description>Lee may be in a relationship with Tony, but that little fact doesn't stop Lee when Tony agrees to allow him one wild night of no inhibitions. With excitement thrumming through his veins, Lee finds himself letting loose at Hard Candy, a popular cruise-worthy dance club known for its sweet Candymen and even sweeter one night stands. Under the club's pulsing lights, he meets a mysterious man in leather, and things soon get hot and heavy as Lee rediscovers his submissive side under the Dom's firm yet loving guidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lee returns home to Tony, though, will he face repercussions for his night of passion? Or is their relationship not quite as it appears?</description>

  <description>When eighteen-year-old Hunter Jackson and his half sister, Ashlin, return to their dad’s for the first winter in years, they expect everything to be just like the warmer months they’d spent there as kids. And it is—at first. But Chance, the charismatic and adventurous boy who made their summers epic, is harboring deep secrets. Secrets that are quickly spiraling into something else entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason they've never met Chance’s parents or seen his home is becoming clearer. And what the siblings used to think of as Chance's quirks—the outrageous stories, his clinginess, his dangerous impulsiveness—are now warning signs that something is seriously off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Chance's mom turns up with a bullet to the head, and all eyes shift to Chance and his dad. Hunter and Ashlin know Chance is innocent...they just have to prove it. But how can they protect the boy they both love when they can’t trust a word Chance says?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first kidnappings happened two hundred years before. Some years it was two boys taken, some years two girls, sometimes one of each. But if at first the choices seemed random, soon the pattern became clear. One was always beautiful and good, the child every parent wanted as their own. The other was homely and odd, an outcast from birth. An opposing pair, plucked from youth and spirited away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go: the fabled School for Good &amp;amp; Evil, where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon, Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into an enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and devotion to good deeds, she knows she’ll earn top marks at the School for Good and graduate a storybook princess. Meanwhile Agatha, with her shapeless black frocks, wicked pet cat, and dislike of nearly everyone, seems a natural fit for the School for Evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed—Sophie’s dumped in the School for Evil to take Uglification, Death Curses, and Henchmen Training, while Agatha finds herself in the School For Good, thrust amongst handsome princes and fair maidens for classes in Princess Etiquette and Animal Communication.. But what if the mistake is actually the first clue to discovering who Sophie and Agatha really are…?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The School for Good &amp;amp; Evil is an epic journey into a dazzling new world, where the only way out of a fairy tale is to live through one.</description>

  <description>Time-travel tour guide Reegan McNamara's job—taking eager tourists to whenever they want to go—is usually a breeze. A trip back to 2020 to watch a world-changing speech seems no different, until a woman runs away from his tour group before the jump home. Now her tycoon husband is demanding her safe return—or Reegan will lose more than just his job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.I. Saul Kildare's business is running on borrowed time. Due to a messy break with the police, he can't get a referral to save his life. When an enigmatic stranger bangs on his door one night and promises a windfall for a missing-person case, it seems too good to be true. But the two men have an immediate connection, and Saul can't pass up the chance to spend more time with Reegan, even if he's clearly hiding something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saul knows he shouldn't trust Reegan, and Reegan knows he can't get involved with Saul. But as their attraction evolves into feelings neither can deny, will they have the strength to take a leap of faith—together?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;84,000 words</description>

  <description>As the first British footballer to come out at the prime of his career, it helps that Ben Jimmer is in a long-term, committed relationship with university student Henry Brown. Even if that relationship is fake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or: a cheerfully clichéd tale of romance, tattoos, football, and friendship (both with and without benefits). Also, tea. And stupidly complicated feelings, of course. Let's not forget about those.</description>

  <description>"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you . . . "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail. (Everybody in the newsroom knows. It's company policy.) But they can't quite bring themselves to take it seriously. They go on sending each other endless and endlessly hilarious e-mails, discussing every aspect of their personal lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now- reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be "internet security officer," he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers- not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lincoln comes across Beth's and Jennifer's messages, he knows he should turn them in. But he can't help being entertained-and captivated-by their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would he say . . . ?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Miss Jane Fairfield can’t do anything right. When she’s in company, she always says the wrong thing—and rather too much of it. No matter how costly they are, her gowns fall on the unfortunate side of fashion. Even her immense dowry can’t save her from being an object of derision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that’s precisely what she wants. She’ll do anything, even risk humiliation, if it means she can stay unmarried and keep her sister safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Oliver Marshall has to do everything right. He’s the bastard son of a duke, raised in humble circumstances—and he intends to give voice and power to the common people. If he makes one false step, he’ll never get the chance to accomplish anything. He doesn’t need to come to the rescue of the wrong woman. He certainly doesn’t need to fall in love with her. But there’s something about the lovely, courageous Jane that he can’t resist…even though it could mean the ruin of them both.</description>

  <description>There's nothing greater than freedom on the road, but recently divorced truck driver Gunner is growing tired of the same routine. He drives the same route for hours on end, visits the same truck stops, and when he goes home for the weekend, he faced with the same ole', same ole' boring life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one lonely night Cody, a male lot lizard, comes knocking on the side of his truck, and he’s able to live out one of his biggest and most feared of fantasies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to pay the rent on his new apartment, Ethan’s turned on to the idea of “lot lizards” by a local pimp. With his job search leading nowhere but low-wage positions, Ethan takes on the challenge. He changes his name to Cody and steps up to the first truck he sees in that dark parking lot. But when Gunner asks him to stay the night, he can’t say no, and finds a strange solace in the truck driver’s arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cue a year later, will a chance meeting be a relief, or only disappoint them both?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;They're always happy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rory James has worked hard all his life to become a citizen of the idyllic city-state of Beulah. Like every other kid born in the neighboring country of Tophet, he’s heard the stories: No crime or pollution. A house and food for everyone. It’s perfect, and Rory is finally getting a piece of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So is Tate Patterson. He’s from Tophet, too, but he’s not a legal immigrant; he snuck in as a thief. A city without crime seems like an easy score, until he crashes into Rory during a getaway and is arrested for assaulting a citizen. Instead of jail, Tate is enrolled in Beulah’s Rehabilitation through Restitution program. By living with and serving his victim for seven years, Tate will learn the human face of his crimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it seems too good to be true, that’s because it is. Tate is fitted with a behavior-modifying chip that leaves him unable to disobey orders—any orders, no matter how dehumanizing. Worse, the chip prevents him from telling Rory, the one man in all of Beulah who might care about him, the truth: in a country without prisons, Tate is locked inside his own mind.</description>

  <description>(Gay / Erotica / Erotic Romance / Anthology / Collection / Contemporary / Exhibitionism / Public Places / Series) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the pen of best-selling author L. A. Witt comes the tale of two hot-blooded and passionate men, opposites in many ways, yet drawn together by an undeniable and life-changing attraction. Previously available only in electronic format, these sizzling stories of Gay Erotic Romance have now been combined for a paperback edition! Included are the tales......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Off The Ground&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;After being stood up at the altar, compulsive over-planner Elliott Chandler decides to turn a honeymoon on Oahu into a vacation for one. Fate puts a hitch in his plans, however, when the airport is snowed in and his flight is delayed. In the airport, the jilted groom catches the eye of another stranded traveler—the laidback and very sexy Derek Windsor. Derek breaks the ice and strikes up a conversation, and as the temperature drops outside, the heat between them rises. Pity they're both going to different islands, but if their flight doesn't leave soon, Mr. Calm-And-Cool may just tempt Mr. Play-It-Safe to do something reckless. And that plane isn't going anywhere any time soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infinity Pools&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;It started with a snowstorm and ended with a sizzling one-night-stand, but neither man is ready for it to be over. Jilted groom Elliott Chandler doesn't do 'last minute' or 'impulsive,' but at the very last minute, he impulsively changes his flight from Oahu to Maui. What was supposed to be his honeymoon turned into two weeks with a man he just met. Derek Windsor is all about 'last minute' and 'impulsive,' but what he doesn't do is fall in love. He's a happily promiscuous bachelor and that's final. They thought one night together wasn't enough. Two weeks, however, is going to be more than they bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On The List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of swearing left and right he's a bachelor forever, Derek Windsor is ready to settle down with Elliott Chandler. After a long-distance relationship and a few months of wedding planning, it all comes down to this weekend—a wedding on the Washington coast, then they can start their life together on Maui. But with the ceremony just days away, Derek's family drops the bomb—they aren't coming. They refuse to support or be a part of his marriage to another man. All his life, Derek has ached for his parents' approval, and their last-minute wedding snub leaves him reeling. Though Derek doesn't question his love for Elliott, can he still go through with a wedding that could irreparably sever his relationship with his family?</description>

  <description>John Wainwright is having a momentous day. To start off, he lands his first teaching job. Then his brother, Evan, and Evan’s husband, Daniel, take him out to celebrate in Manchester’s gay village. An encounter with a sexy man forces John to admit what he’s been denying for too long—he’s gay. His coming out proves he’s supported and loved by his family and roommates. What more could a man want? There’s just one small problem: John’s dishy Head Teacher, Brett Sanderson, and John’s gigantic crush on him. Too bad Brett is straight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brett Sanderson leads a double life. At thirty-three, he is the Head Teacher of a primary school. But for seven years now, during every school holiday, Brett has fled to Brighton, where he becomes ‘Rob,’ a man who has a different guy in his bed every night but has never had a relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once he’s back in school, Brett is firmly back in that closet, until his newest staff member starts prying open the door. When John pulls out all the stops to get Brett’s attention, neither man is prepared for the consequences.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When looking for someone to help heal his broken heart, Wilson Curtis never dreamed he'd find two someones. Love isn't always conventional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After being publicly outed and his restaurant business in tatters, instead of vacationing with his lover, Wilson Curtis goes to Key West alone where he meets Simon and Adam. Fascinated by this couple, he strikes up conversation and is soon invited into their bed for some holiday fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once isn't enough, and the offer is extended for the remainder of his stay. As they get to know each other, in and out of the bedroom, sparks fly and ten days is all it takes to change their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes time for Wil to leave, with outside tensions closing in and time running out, tempers flare and emotions fray. Beneath the misunderstandings and lack of communication is the realisation these three men aren't ready to say goodbye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book was previously released at another publisher. It has been revised and re-edited for release with Totally Bound. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sam “Solo” Braun lives by one truth, the Grave Diggers Motorcycle Club above all. The creed has served him well, giving him the only real family he’s ever known.He would die for his brothers and them for him, but they don’t know he prefers men over women. Coming out to a group of men who fear no one isn’t high on Solo’s priority list, especially because he’s never indulged in more than one night stands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes after one night with Eric James. For the first time, Solo can’t stop thinking about a single night he’d spent with a man. When fate intervenes, Solo comes face to face with his blue-eyed obsession only to find out Eric is a cop. Solo hates cops, and so do his brothers in the club. However, Solo decides to gamble everything and spend more time with Eric under the guise of getting information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Falling in love with a cop is a very dangerous proposition for a man in Solo’s position, so why can’t he walk away?</description>

  <description>Pain is often needed to achieve redemption Jake and Kyle are partners and lovers who were both abused as children. To others, they seem happy and content with their careers and their lives. But underneath their successful exteriors, the damage remains, and their wounds continue to fester. Jake, the resilient partner, is vigilant in his protection and comfort of Kyle, who is riddled with anxiety.

  <description>One year ago, I graduated from law school and embarked on a career as a purveyor of high priced legal shenanigans. &lt;br&gt;Six months ago, my boyfriend dumped me when I thought he might be proposing. &lt;br&gt;Two weeks ago, I got drunk and joined a secret sex club. &lt;br&gt;Two days ago, I had a torrid one-night stand with a stranger. &lt;br&gt;Today? Well, today I’m contemplating having an affair with my boss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt Connover is all kinds of forbidden temptation wrapped up in a deliciously wicked package, and he’s made it clear… he’s only interested in sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is McKayla Dawson but everyone calls me Mac. I work at the powerhouse firm of Connover &amp;amp; Crown, LLP, where the law has never felt so hot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But between you and me, I’m afraid my heart won’t survive these Legal Affairs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs is a serial romance with a whole lot of hot and a little bit of funny.

  <description>As if being a deeply closeted gay man living in the South isn’t enough, Justice Crawford also suffers from a crippling anxiety disorder. Flying cross country to be the best man in his best friend’s wedding probably isn’t the best idea, right? Forced back into the closet after being rejected by his family, Justice has given up on the idea of finding acceptance and love. He has allowed his disorder and his troubled past to keep him from taking a chance, but love might just find him where he least expects it… in Seattle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sailor and charter boat captain Nic Valentine is still reeling from the unexpected death of his father, when the man of his dreams—literally—falls into his lap. He thinks he’ll never see the man again, but fate has other plans. Nic tries to resist the charms of adorably quirky, nervous Justice, because he has no desire to get tangled up with another closet case. But when life keeps throwing them together, will Nic decide that Justice might be a keeper after all?</description>

  <description>[Siren Classic ManLove: Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, werewolves, HEA]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The visit to Elk Ridge is supposed to be just another assignment for Tom Barrington. Then he encounters Bryce Reynolds, a generous, warmhearted cowboy who has the easiest smile he’s ever seen. It doesn’t take long for Tom to break all his rules and end up in Bryce’s bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bryce Reynolds believes there’s no such thing as a hot politician, right up until he meets Tom Barrington. Tall, dark, and principled, Tom overturns all of Bryce’s prejudices, and Bryce starts to forget that he doesn’t do serious and he doesn’t do commitment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Bryce and Tom struggle to make sense of what’s happening between them, they’re drawn into a political battle—one which could affect the future of every shifter. And when long-buried secrets start coming to light, things turn deadly. Nothing will ever be the same again for the Elk Ridge pack.</description>

  <description>No one can tattoo better than Inigo, a two hundred year old vampire, who works on human and supernatural skins. But he’s never tattooed a faerie and when a bunch of them insist he comes with them to tattoo one of their kind, saying no proves not to be an option. His skin is Oberon, the faerie king, and Inigo fears this will be the last tattoo he’ll ever do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moment Micah lands in the faerie king’s bed chamber, he knows the guy is trouble. But if he’s to save his sister and his family, let alone the job he’s paid to do, he has to stay in Faerieland and endure Oberon’s sadism. When he’s thrown into a vampire’s cell, covered in blood, he fears this day will be his last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book follows on from Jumping in Puddles - though there is no need to read that one first.</description>

  <description>Attorney Jack Larsen may not have everything he wants, but between his successful career and best friend Mark Richfield, he's content. But when Mark comes out of the closet only to declare his love for ex-LAPD officer Steve Miller, Jack is devastated. Months later and still wounded, he's not looking to be swept off his feet, but it's hard to say no to handsome Hollywood hotshot Adam Lewis. Adam Lewis has made a name for himself representing some of today's brightest stars. But when his business partner is accused of unethical behavior, he finds himself in need of legal advice. When Adam walks into the law office of Jack Larsen, it's strictly business until he sets eyes on the powerful and sexy hero that's about to rescue his reputation. When Adam Met Jack is an amazing new novel by Amazon best selling gay fiction author G.A. Hauser featuring characters from Love you Loveday, For Love and Money, and Capital Games. It's got the glamour of the entertainment industry, the drama of the courtroom, and the amazing passion that you've come to expect from every G.A. Hauser book.</description>

  <description>Aiden Cole can be anything men want—naughty schoolboy, palace slave, virgin twink, or slutty secretary. He’s a gifted actor with a gorgeous body who gives legendary head. Aiden could have his pick of any Top in the local leather bar, but is drawn to Scott Runge—a cruel, sexy Dom who pushes Aiden to his limits, allowing Aiden to experience the excitement and danger of the BDSM lifestyle to a degree he never has before. But when Scott goes too far, injuring Aiden, Aiden withdraws from the BDSM scene completely. Until he meets Keaton Hughes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keaton’s looking for something he can’t find in any dungeon: A domestic discipline relationship, in which he can provide his partner with guidance, support, and loving discipline. When Keaton takes Aiden in after Aiden’s traumatic encounter with Scott, he vows not to pursue any sort of relationship with the troubled sub. But as Aiden struggles to overcome the damage Scott has done and get his life back on track, Keaton’s rules might be just what he needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publisher's Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM theme and content, dubious consent, male/male sexual practices, violence.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Ex-cop Isaac Rhodes is a tough and intimidating private investigator with a talent for kicking in doors and knocking bail jumpers' heads together. His only soft spot is for his partner, Nate Washington—though Wash makes him anything but soft. He's silently lusted after Wash for a year, until his desire drives him to finally come out to his partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This confession leads to Wash admitting a few secrets of his own, unleashing needs that result in hot, sweaty, sexy, man-on-man intimacy. Rhodes is elated...until Wash admits he's unsure if he's willing to endure the often prejudice-filled life of an outed gay man. Crushed, Rhodes backs off. But one missing child—and a gun to Wash's head—convinces Rhodes to do whatever it takes to get his man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: Private Dicks burns the pages with scorching scenes of gorgeous men engaging in the most intimate of "investigations". &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>James is nervous when he pulls into the parking lot of the secluded and conservative Caledonian Hotel. He slips off his wedding ring, gives a false name at reception, and checks into his room. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Mark finally arrives, James expects their time together to conform to the usual pattern, but Mark surprises him. Mark wants candlelit dinners and walks on the beach. James, well, James just wants to make up for lost time. More importantly, he doesn’t want to get caught. They have six months left before they can start a new life together and James is desperate to be discrete. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, he never could control himself around Mark. Throw in an interfering old couple and some very public displays of affection and Mark and James’s short hotel stay might just be about to destroy not only the secrecy that has always shrouded their relationship, but also their future together.</description>

  <description>When Daniel Seaton inadvertently trespasses on Tyler Edward's land, things almost go very, very wrong. It's bad enough that Dan's a runaway, but when Tyler nearly shoots him on sight, Dan knows he's in trouble. Tyler's got a lot of years under his belt, and his past doesn't let him accept strangers easily. Dan's situation is dire enough that Tyler takes him home, at least for a little while, and that turns out to be a good decision when Dan decides to stay on and help out with the chores.&lt;br&gt;Tyler might be learning to trust, and Dan might be settling in to a new life, but things are not always what they seem. Between interfering friends, injuries, and their attraction to each other, Tyler and Dan have plenty of troubles. More trouble turns up in the form of Tyler's past, which catches up to them with a vengeance, and they decide to start a new life together, one that requires them to leave everything behind. Can they overcome what lies in the past to have a future with each other?</description>

  <description>Baring It All Generations of werewolves have been secretly residing in a secluded valley a stone's throw from Grundy, Alaska. So when a snooping Outsider comes to Grundy to investigate rumors of lycanthropic shenanigans in the area, the valley's pack alpha, Maggie Graham, resolves to chase him away, even if doing so takes a quick bite on the butt. What a pity that researcher Nick Thatcher turns out to be so drool-worthy, and that his kisses make Maggie want to sit up and beg. Maggie just can't seem to convince Nick to leave . . . and even worse, she can't convince "herself "to stay away from "him. "Cross-species dating is problem enough for a harried alpha female, but on top of that, a rival group of werewolves is trying to move into the valley. With interpack war threatening, Maggie can't afford to be distracted. Combining romance and a career can be tough for anyone; for a werewolf in love with a human, it may be disastrous. . . .</description>

  <description>Iris Scanlon, Half-Moon Hollow’s only daytime vampire concierge, knows more about the undead than she’d like. Running all their daylight errands—from letting in the plumber to picking up some chilled O neg—gives her a look at the not-so-glamorous side of vampire life. Her rules are strict; relationships with vamps are strictly business, not friendship—and certainly not anything else. But then she finds her newest client, Cal, poisoned on his kitchen floor, and only Iris can help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cal - who would be devastatingly sexy, if Iris allowed herself to think that way -  offers Iris a hefty fee for hiding him at her place until he figures out who wants him permanently dead.  Even though he’s imperious, unfriendly and doesn't seem to understand the difference between "employee" and "servant," Iris agrees, and finds herself breaking more and more of her own rules to help him - particularly those concerning nudity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out what her quiet little life needed was some intrigue &amp;amp; romance—in the form of her very own stray vampire.</description>

  <description>Madison is a control freak with one wish—to lose control. Her hidden submissive cravings have led to a string of disastrous relationships. So when she inherits her sister’s North Carolina lingerie shop, Naughty Bits, she jumps at the opportunity to dump her boring finance career and bad history and try her luck down South.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before Madison can settle in, she catches the attention of the owner of the neighboring hardware store. Sexually dominant Logan Scott can see the hunger for command in Madison’s eyes and is anxious to help unleash her submissive desires. He presents her with three very tempting gifts—handcuffs, erotic cards, and an open invitation to join him at a submissive’s training session.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faced with the realization that she can’t sell fantasies to her lingerie customers without embracing her own, Madison accepts Logan’s offer. Now, she’s about to discover just how far her desire can take her…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Experience Ireland—the dramatic beauty, the warm hospitality...and the smoking-hot local guys!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine nursing a pint in a cozy, authentic country pub, far from Cork City’s busy pulse. Getting here took you a plane, bus, taxi, and...erm, bicycle. But just as you’re resigning yourself to drinking beside gray-haired farmers, you see him—a man with the looks and charm to soothe any heartbroken girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s your bartender. Your really, really gorgeous bartender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For American Jamie Webb—recently dumped and housesitting for two weeks—Connor Kelleher is like a six-course feast after a 23-year starvation diet. But it’s gotta be casual. She’s just begun re-routing her life after an extended, man-related detour. Still, a sexy romp (or twenty!) with Sexy McBartender? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what about when Jamie's best-laid plans for no future plans with any man begin to change?</description>

  <description>The Booby Trap, A Pixel Entertainment Brand, is a romance novel based in The Booby Trap, a seedy bar where waitresses' skirts are high, necklines are low, and customers show up for the eye candy. When brainy, beautiful, Harvard Ph.D. candidate Bambi Benson wants to study the women of the Booby Trap for her dissertation, she goes undercover and joins them. All is going well for Bambi until handsome local celebrity Trip Whitley enters the scene. Hoping to shock his high-society family by dating a bimbo, Trip offers to pay Bambi to pretend to be his girlfriend. She accepts his offer and bides her time, waiting for the right moment to reveal her true identity and teach Trip not to judge based on appearances. After a series of dates carefully orchestrated for their publicity value, Bambi's trap is set. But there's one problem: the predator might have fallen in love with her prey.</description>

  <description>For two years, State Trooper Kayne Dobrescu has wanted only one thing: to understand why his wife inexplicably killed their children and then herself. Memories haunt his days and lay siege to his nights, leaving him questioning his reasons for living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jessica Hallstatt became a widow and single mother the night her firefighter husband died in a fiery explosion at an accident scene. While her husband may have died a hero, he left Jessica with deep emotional scars that haven't begun to heal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kayne accepted a transfer to the mountain town of Payson, Arizona, he never expected to meet anyone like Jessica. From the moment he pulled her over for speeding, he was drawn in by her whiskey colored eyes and sassy dimple. But she and her children are a forever type package, and he's vowed never to give anyone the power to destroy him again. Yet fate has other ideas, throwing Kayne and Jessica together in a fight against an unknown enemy to save the life of a child—and hopefully one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains graphic language, explicit sex and one very hot man in uniform.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Genre:&lt;/strong&gt; LGBT Science Fiction/Space Opera  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"As a general rule, you won't find the love of your life while you're on your knees under a table."  &lt;/em&gt; -- Helios Dayspring&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Pasha is a slave, whoring for travelers at the most dangerous bar on Warlan. He has no memory, no future of his own, yet deep inside Pasha knows that that he is meant for better things. The day that Pasha spots the dangerous pirate in the bar, he knows that he mustn't let the stranger slip away, regardless of what he must do to attract his attention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Captain Griffin Hawke spent the greater part of a decade searching for his lost king, only to find Helios Dayspring crouched between his knees, swathed in the robes and shackles of a whore. Though he is appalled by the downfall of his king, the hardened officer finds himself falling for the allure of the sensual creature who has taken his place. Returning Helios to his position on the throne is the only right thing to do, yet Griffin knows that in doing so, he risks losing his lover forever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"A whore is a whore is a whore, unless he's something else completely. I guess I must be an uncommon whore."  &lt;/em&gt; -- Helios Dayspring&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of the bestselling INTO THE WILDERNESS historical series comes an irresistible modern love story...&lt;br&gt;DESCRIPTION OF BOOK&lt;br&gt;Seemingly out of the blue, tiny documentary company Tied to the Tracks is handed the opportunity of breata lifetime: a personal invitation from reclusive literary legend Miss Zula Bragg to make a film about her life. For Angie Mangiamele and her award-winning team, it's almost too good too be true - and impossible to pass up.&lt;br&gt;But for Angie, the prospect of visiting Miss Zula's home town in the Deep South is a mixed blessing because it means coming face to face with the man she once thought was the love of her life. Now head of Ogilvie University's literature department, John Grant is engaged to local beauty Caroline Rose. In a small town rich in tradition and rife with gossip, the sparks that fly when the two former lovers meet again can't escape the attention of the closeknit community, mind Caroline's four sisters and the overbearing Aunt Patty-Cake, who aren't about to let any strangers from the city interfere with the impending nuptials.&lt;br&gt;Beautifully drawn with a vibrant cast of characters more than ready for their close-ups, TIED TO THE TRACKS a sharp, witty and grown up love story.</description>

  <description>Newly divorced Lacey Meyers wasted too many years yawning through sex in the missionary position. Now she’s looking for a hookup with a man who can make her shatter. What she gets is a hot younger cop with handcuffs… and he’s not afraid to use them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter Anderson knows the score—though classy, successful women like Lacey might play with guys like him, at the end of the evening, they walk. But when one night leads to another and then another, he finds himself getting too attached to a woman he can’t have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lacey knows Hunter—gorgeous, hard-edged and eight years younger—won’t want anything permanent. No matter how hot and daring he makes her first public sex, quickie, backseat encounter and secret fantasy role-play, she can’t mistake adventurous sex for emotional involvement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They both know it’s got to end, and soon, or someone’s going to get hurt. But can either of them go back to life without the other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reader Advisory: Lacey’s highly erotic “forced” sex fantasy comes true in this book. Lucky her!</description>

  <description>What if the life you wanted, and the woman you fell in love with, belonged to someone else? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chris and Claire Canton’s marriage is on life support. Downsized during the recession and out of work for a year, Chris copes by retreating to a dark place where no one can reach him, not even Claire. When he’s offered a position that will keep him away from home four nights a week, he dismisses Claire’s concern that time apart could be the one thing their fragile union can’t weather. Their suburban life may look idyllic on the outside, but Claire has never felt so disconnected from Chris, or so lonely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Local police officer Daniel Rush used to have it all, but now he goes home to an empty house every night. He pulls Claire over during a routine traffic stop, and they run into each other again at the 4th of July parade. When Claire is hired to do some graphic design work for the police department, her friendship with Daniel grows, and soon they’re spending hours together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire loves the way Daniel makes her feel, and the way his face lights up when she walks into the room.  Daniel knows that Claire’s marital status means their relationship will never be anything other than platonic. But it doesn’t take long before Claire and Daniel are in way over their heads, and skating close to the line that Claire has sworn she’ll never cross.</description>

  <description>Candace “Candy” Bryce can’t believe her luck when she wins a dinner date with Dave Roads, the lead singer of a hot new band. Not only is he a drop dead gorgeous rock star, but after she lets it slip that she's never been able to reach orgasm with a man, he seems bent on giving Candy what she needs. Who knew all it would take is a little "tie me up," a few toys and Dave's merciless desire for a Taste of Candy?</description>

Life is good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Dominant, Lucas Hunter, has made millions in the construction sector.

Neither wants to get involved in a relationship but neither can walk away.

  <description>When a snow storm strands Javier Castillo in Italy at Christmas, it almost ruins his chance to win back a client his advertising agency desperately needs. The situation isn’t improved by the presence of his colleague, Andrew Young, a silver-tongued account director infamous for having slept with a client. Javier has a hard time respecting a man who would do anything for an account, but proximity may prove that Andrew is not quite the man Javier thought. They might have the opportunity to forge a successful business opportunity—or even a life together—if they don’t get cold feet.</description>

  <description>Owen may be a bit of a country mouse, but he's loving his vacation in London. After a long day playing tourist, he's on the hunt for some cheap beer and a good burger. Instead he finds a man hunting him, an arrogant prick with only one thing on the brain: the kind of meat that doesn't come on a bun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighty-hour weeks at a trading desk don't leave Malcolm Kavanagh much time for meaningful relationships. Besides, in his world, everything's a competition-even sex. When his newest one-night-sub fails to show, Malcolm sets his sights on the pretty young Yank on the bar stool beside him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owen's all for an adventure with a native, but he's not the pushover Malcolm thinks he is, and Malcolm's not as shallow as he tries to be. They both soon learn that nothing's too intimate to share with a stranger, and the strangest things happen when two people share the most important pieces of their hearts.</description>

  <description>Dwelling in the land of Ada and defending magic users called the Jin, Fen Jacin-rei is a trained assassin and an Untouchable, one whose mind hosts the Voices of the Ancestors, spirits of long-dead magicians. His fate should be one of madness and solitude, yet Fen Jacin-rei desperately clings to his sanity and ferociously protects the family he loves. But how does Fen do it? Kamen Malick has every intention of finding out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Malick and his own small band of assassins ambush Fen in an alley, Malick offers Fen one choice: join us or die. Determined to decode the intrigue that surrounds Fen—and to have the Untouchable for himself—Malick sets to unraveling Fen’s past while Fen delves into the mysteries surrounding Malick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Fen’s secrets slowly unfold, Malick is drawn into a crusade that isn’t his, one surprisingly similar to his own quest for vengeance. Yet irony is a bitter reward when Malick discovers the one he wants is already hopelessly entangled with the one he hunts.</description>

Four difficult years later, some of those dreams are starting to come true—but at what cost? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jess has stumbled into a fairly successful modeling career, but it feels like a consolation prize after his failed attempt at acting. He knows too his good looks will only last so long and he wants to try something else, but Sam keeps talking him out of it.

  <description>In the ancient kingdom of Marhavad, noblemen dominate the lower castes, wielding mystic weapons, known as shartas, against any who oppose them. For generations the rule of Marhavad’s kings has been absolute. But now the line of succession is divided, and whispers of revolution are heard in even the royal palace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keshan Adaru, an outspoken man of unearthly charms, welcomes these changes. All his life he has foreseen an uprising that will shatter the castes and end the tyranny of the old laws. His visions have driven him but now, at the brink of their fulfillment, he finds himself obsessed with Prince Jandu Paran-- a man whose entire family must be destroyed if the kingdom is to be freed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tarek Amia would gladly see Jandu Paran brought low. Born the son of a charioteer, Tarek has no love for the royal princes who have slighted and insulted him all his life. Only Keshan’s philosophies have elevated him from the brutal ranks of common soldiers. Tarek owes Keshan his devotion, but he is a pragmatic man and when he discovers Keshan’s reckless affair he realizes that Keshan may have to be sacrificed for the sake of his own revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young Prince Jandu Paran has never concerned himself with court intrigue. His life has been dedicated to the lordly art of archery and mastering the immense powers of the shartas. Handsome and arrogant, he is sure that no man can surpass him and yet Keshan Adaru’s mere touch brings Jandu to his knees. But his desire for Keshan is more than forbidden; it threatens to destroy Jandu’s pride, position and family. In the midst of this turmoil, an unspeakable event forces Jandu to redefine the meaning of honor and loyalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, as armies arise to war, each man must decide where his allegiance lies and what he will sacrifice in his heart and on the battlefield.</description>

  <description>After one mind-shattering night with a stranger at a local leather bar leaves him forever changed, Gabriel lives on the streets as a vagrant to elude the master who hunts him, but the were-shifter is a fierce, stubborn predator who reclaims him soon enough. Gabriel is carried away to the pack’s home territory where his instruction on what it means to be the pet of an alpha begins. Gabriel isn’t just any pet, though. He is the rarest among their kind: a human omega.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treasured? Or cursed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Gabriel’s father, the Distinguished Gentleman from Pennsylvania and stalwart of the conservative party, pushes the considerable resources at his disposal to locate his missing son, Gabriel explores who and what he is under his master’s careful protection. Gabriel falls for the shifter who is lover and destroyer, owner and...friend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM theme and elements, dubious consent, male/male sexual practices.</description>

  <description>The echoes of a war four years' past still resounds in the minds of those who endured it. Jaden longs to search for his sister, though he is bound in the fetters of slavery. When he is given to the very man who conquered his country, he is caught up in his own hatred, yet fascinated by the mystery of his new master, the Emperor of Tranaden, who all say is demonic, without mercy. Trapped in the snare of his master’s beauty, Jaden begins to realize that there is much more beneath the surface...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dersai is Emperor to his fingertips, he is used to command and being obeyed. He will sacrifice anything to see his country safe. Beneath, he is well read, highly intelligent and far sighted in how he views others. Yet, Dersai has an inner demon, a demon that kept his kingdom free and safe from conquerors; only in his dreams can he imagine one strong enough to love him. Now his slave may be the only one who can set him free.</description>

  <description>Shaw is in Fiji to sell a stolen painting to the crime boss, Vornis. It will be the deal of a lifetime, if Shaw can pull it off. But then Vornis parades his latest toy around in front of him—a captured DEA agent whose time is running out. It’s none of Shaw’s business, and it doesn’t matter that under any other circumstances Lee would be exactly Shaw’s type: he’s young, he’s hot, and he might even have a personality if they hadn’t beaten it out of him. Too bad there’s no way Lee is getting off the island. Too bad there’s nothing Shaw can do for him. And too bad there are some lines that even Shaw won’t cross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping his hands off Lee proves harder than he thinks, but Shaw’s not stupid enough to fall for the tortured captive of a dangerous crime boss, is he? If he did, it wouldn’t be just his job he would be risking—it would be his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publisher's Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Readers with a history of rape or sexual abuse may find elements of this story disturbing.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>She had the perfect life - and all she wanted was to escape it. Artisan chocolatier and reluctant matchmaker Annie Devine wants to survive the annual Durna Matchmaking Festival without messing up. She's useless at relationships, and the whole village know it. They've known ever since the day she was left at the altar in her wedding dress. When Jack Miller, charismatic head of Miller Advertising is forced to make an emergency stop on his transatlantic crossing, she mistakes him for a love-lorn bachelor, and sparks fly. Jack's in Ireland to discover his roots, while Annie's desperate to escape hers. Annie longs to win the coveted Chocolate Oscar competition, and claim the ultimate prize, her own shop in Dublin. But with the deadline for Jack's return to New York looming, is she making the right choice?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Between an angel and a desperate woman comes salvation and a raw passion that challenges them at every turn… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Aurora Robinson attempts to open a rift between dimensions to embrace her true heritage, an arrogant Archangel is the only one who can save her from the jaws of hell. And while she owes Gabriel her life, she's determined not to fall at his feet-despite the desire she feels whenever they're together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After his wings were brutally destroyed millennia ago, Gabriel has no compassion for humans like those who ruined him and betrayed the ones he loved. But when he inexplicably finds himself defying ancient protocols to rescue a woman from a fate worse than death, he is shocked by the searing attraction he feels for a mortal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the ancient forces that seek to punish Aurora for her actions close in, Gabriel offers the tempting woman protection at his private sanctuary. But as they both succumb to their desires, they discover an even deeper connection-one that threatens to consume them.</description>

  <description>For fans of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You comes an erotic, emotionally charged romance between a powerful man who’s never heard “no” and a fiery woman who says “yes” on her own terms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was the one man I couldn’t avoid. And the one man I couldn’t resist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien Stark could have his way with any woman. He was sexy, confident, and commanding: Anything he wanted, he got. And what he wanted was me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our attraction was unmistakable, almost beyond control, but as much as I ached to be his, I feared the pressures of his demands. Submitting to Damien meant I had to bare the darkest truth about my past—and risk breaking us apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Damien was haunted, too. And as our passion came to obsess us both, his secrets threatened to destroy him—and us—forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Release Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>Music is the only form of communication Connor Owens controls. No matter how badly he wishes to fit in, friendly banter and casual conversations have never been his thing. College is yet another social universe he has no clue how to navigate—until he meets Jared, a football player with chestnut eyes and a cocky grin that holds the power to shatter his self-imposed prison. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared's attention opens Connor up to a new realm of emotional and physical intimacy. But as Connor's self-confidence grows, so does his fear that everything will fall apart. Because in this socially stratified world, how long can a relationship between an introverted violinist and a closeted football player really last?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-edited edition&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>An old houseboat, a hot young guy, a couple of murders, and more mysterious keys than you can shake a stick at: this is what awaits Gray Vecello after his grandfather, Graham, is killed picking up high blood pressure pills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A letter Graham left behind sends Gray and his unexpected ally, Cooper Key, on a journey downriver in an attempt to unravel the mystery surrounding an unknown treasure. On the way, they encounter both friends and enemies, one of whom will target Gray and Cooper for death. One thing working in Gray’s favor: he has the sight, just as Graham had, but will it be enough to save them both?</description>

  <description>The horror of Evan and Colin's stolen summer may be over but the nightmares remain. Can their love survive the fallout?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing journalist Evan Harrison expects to hear, when he returns from covering the war in Afghanistan, is that his best friend, Colin Williams, is in love with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin, an Oxford Professor with a poet’s soul and a roving eye, turns out to be a temptation Evan can’t resist. What he discovers is that sex with Colin is hot, wild and relentless. The two of them embark on a passionate affair and Evan knows he’s going to spend his days with Colin - after one last assignment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A western journalist in Pakistan is too tempting a target for local insurgents. Evan's 'Oh-shit' sense fails dismally when he is taken hostage and spends four months refusing to let his captors grind him down by clinging to memories of the lover he left behind. Freedom from captivity, however, doesn't bring freedom from terror. The legacy of Evan's ordeal results in meltdowns and nightmares that threaten to destroy his life with Colin. He can't even seek comfort in lovemaking because the pills intended to save his sanity kill his desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan seizes a chance to put his nightmares behind him by taking one final assignment, covering unrest in Jordan. Colin sees Evan’s decision as the end of a relationship he fought hard to save. If Evan makes it back to England in one piece, winning Colin back will be the toughest assignment he’s ever faced.</description>

  <description>Rocked to the core by traitors and spies, the Organization made an unprecedented move in bringing together six highly trained men to track down one rogue wolf: The Archer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three field agents: one at the top of his game, one hoping to retire, and another walking the line; a cold-blooded assassin who can use any weapon known to man; a demolitions expert who can’t resist the allure of fire; and a computer hacker with more tricks in his mouse than Houdini. This team is made up of the best of the best, and if it can’t succeed in this impossible mission, no one can. But no plan survives first contact with the enemy – especially when you can’t even find out who he is!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite what a cluster the assignment is from the start, the six men try to get their act together to track down the rogue operative, and in the process they discover there’s more to life than the next assignment. Now it’s up to them to survive by working together and determining who the real traitor is: an unknown friend, a close-by enemy, or the Organization itself.</description>

  <description>When Adeline Parker decides to celebrate landing a coveted internship at one of Chicago’s most prestigious architectural firms by indulging in a brutally dark and handsome man, she gets more than she bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lost in a maze of hallways on the first day of her new position, she stumbles headlong into a boardroom of suits. Very expensive suits. They are the somebodies of this prestigious firm, and she is, by all accounts, the very definition of a nobody. And sitting at the table with the rest of the principals from the firm is a man—the very man who unwittingly deflowered her only days before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the look of it, Jordan Ellinwood is none too happy to see her again; by his own admission, he’s a one-night-stand man, and the fact she conned him into taking her virginity isn’t sitting well with him either. But as her path is inextricably attached to his, their closeness will no longer be a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an intern, she’s off-limits, and that says nothing of the fact he’s twelve years older than she is. But when coworkers bent on jealousy and resentment threaten her reputation and internship, the long-dormant emotions Jordan has so effectively stifled fight to break free. And as he struggles to get out of his own way long enough to let her see his compassion, her career is jeopardized and leaves him fighting with every last ounce of himself to save her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will it be enough? Can he overcome his emotional shortcomings in time to rescue her future and his own—now so very attached to hers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genre: Erotic Romance</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He's insisting he's a Tide Lord and he's begging us to try again...to kill him, that is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a routine hanging goes wrong, the survivor announces he is Cayal the immortal Prince, a Tide Lord. However, the only known record of the immortal beings of Amyrantha is the Tide LordTarot...and everyone knows it is only a parlour-game, an amusement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arkady Desean, an expert on the legends of the Crasii - a part-animal, part-human race - is sent to interrogate Cayal. But in exposing this would-be immortal, Arkady's own web of deceit threatens to unravel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is as it seems around the Immortal Prince. The lies seem plausible, his stories improbable...and the the truth is more than any of them bargined for.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Currently free at Smashwords&lt;/strong&gt;   Words: 78053 (approx)&lt;br&gt;A single kiss could change both their lives forever, but it’s not his kiss to take…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Evan Harrison has become a recluse, a prisoner inside his own house, felled in his prime by a migraine headache without end.  All he'd ever wanted was to be a doctor, and now he's nothing - until chance delivers a beaten and battered Jamie into his care.  Fourteen years his junior, gorgeous, mouthy, stubborn and...completely and unquestionably straight. Maybe. Or maybe not...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie doesn't know what hit him, other than there were three of them, and that he's broken and in pain and he doesn't know the identity of the kind stranger with the cold stethoscope and warm eyes taking care of him.  And he sure as hell doesn't know why he likes his bossiness or finds him sexy....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chance may have brought them together, but a shared attraction keeps them together long after Jamie’s bruises have faded. As Evan enjoys the longest pain-free stretch he’s known in two years, they begin to explore their attraction, the caresses of a kind Jamie’s never known.  But even as Evan revels in his young lover’s first, tentative touches, the guilt is never far from his mind.  Jamie’s never looked at another man romantically and Evan’s never looked at anything but.  And Jamie won’t kiss him.  That would be… gay.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan wants Jamie’s kiss more than he’s ever wanted anything before in his life, but it’s not his kiss to take, its Jamie’s to give.  Evan knows wanting Jamie is wrong, their relationship unethical, a relationship forbidden with just cause.  He swore an oath to do no harm. And it’s not only his oaths that are going to get broken--he’s never given his heart away before…</description>

Laughing his way through life, he’s never been weighed down by love and lust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one fateful day, his tenuous tie to the earth is severed and he blows away on the wind. He’s rescued by Dmitri, a handsome young woodsman who suffers from a mysterious curse of his own, and the two strangers are irresistibly drawn together. Touched by earthly yearnings for sex and love for the first time, they dive into a delightfully sensual and passionate affair. As the evil witch who cursed them plans her ultimate revenge, Efrosin and Dmitri must fight to find their fairy tale ending and live happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by the Scottish tale The Light Princess.</description>

  <description>The steamy first installment in the Inside Out erotic romance trilogy by Lisa Renee Jones, in the bestselling tradition of Fifty Shades of Grey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sara McMillan finds a stack of journals in a storage unit, she’s shocked and enthralled by the erotic life the writer led. Unable to stop reading, she vicariously lives out dark fantasies through Rebecca, the writer—until the terrifying final entry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certain something sinister has happened, Sara sets out to discover the facts, immersing herself in Rebecca’s life. Soon she’s working at the art gallery Rebecca worked at and meeting Rebecca’s friends. Finding herself drawn to two dangerously sexy men, the manager of the gallery and a famed artist, Sara realizes she’s going down the same path Rebecca took. But with the promise of her dark needs being met by a man with confident good looks and a desire for control, she’s not sure anything else matters. Just the burn for more.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Previously titled &lt;em&gt;WRECK THIS LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the nineties, Abigale Applegate and Zach Barnes were the most beloved sitcom child stars in the world. Then they grew up and left Hollywood behind…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever happened to Abigale Applegate?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s been wondering the same thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her Hollywood dreams long gone, Abigale now has a nice, neat, uncomplicated life—until the day her perfect fiancé needs to talk. Dumped, a little more than shattered, and totally confused, Abigale turns to Zach, her best friend since forever, to help her pick up the pieces. He does it with a gift—a copy of Wreck This Journal. She can vent her frustrations, and sketch out a new plan. Zach just hopes he’s part of it. Because he’s been in love with Abigale his entire life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the journal falls into Zach’s hands, he discovers Abigale wants a new man. And fast. Nothing more than a hot distraction. Zach has a strategy, too. He’s going to be that man. It’s his last chance. Abigale might be out to shake up her life, but Zach’s out to reinvent it. Now, all he has to do is convince Abigale that life can go as planned.</description>

  <description>When a white servant girl violates the order of plantation society, she unleashes a tragedy that exposes the worst and best in the people she has come to call her family. Orphaned while onboard ship from Ireland, seven-year-old Lavinia arrives on the steps of a tobacco plantation where she is to live and work with the slaves of the kitchen house. Under the care of Belle, the master's illegitimate daughter, Lavinia becomes deeply bonded to her adopted family, though she is set apart from them by her white skin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, Lavinia is accepted into the world of the big house, where the master is absent and the mistress battles opium addiction. Lavinia finds herself perilously straddling two very different worlds. When she is forced to make a choice, loyalties are brought into question, dangerous truths are laid bare, and lives are put at risk.</description>

  <description>There are people in this world who are Nobody. No one sees them. No one notices them. They live their lives under the radar, forgotten as soon as you turn away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s why they make the perfect assassins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Institute finds these people when they’re young and takes them away for training. But an untrained Nobody is a threat to their organization. And threats must be eliminated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Claire has been invisible her whole life, missed by the Institute’s monitoring. But now they’ve ID’ed her and send seventeen-year-old Nix to remove her. Yet the moment he lays eyes on her, he can’t make the hit. It’s as if Claire and Nix are the only people in the world for each other. And they are—because no one else ever notices them.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Jocelyn Butler has been hiding from her past for years. But all her secrets are about to be laid bare…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Four years ago, Jocelyn left her tragic past behind in the States and started over in Scotland, burying her grief, ignoring her demons, and forging ahead without attachments. Her solitary life is working well—until she moves into a new apartment on Dublin Street where she meets a man who shakes her carefully guarded world to its core. Braden Carmichael is used to getting what he wants, and he’s determined to get Jocelyn into his bed. Knowing how skittish she is about entering a relationship, Braden proposes an arrangement that will satisfy their intense attraction without any strings attached. But after an intrigued Jocelyn accepts, she realizes that Braden won’t be satisfied with just mind-blowing passion. The stubborn Scotsman is intent on truly knowing her… down to the very soul.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Gabe, Jace, and Ash: three of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the country. They’re accustomed to getting anything they want. Anything at all. For Gabe, it’s making one particular fantasy come true with a woman who was forbidden fruit. Now she’s ripe for the picking...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gabe Hamilton saw Mia Crestwell walk into the ballroom for his hotel’s grand opening, he knew he was going to hell for what he had planned. After all, Mia is his best friend’s little sister. Except she’s not so little anymore. And Gabe has waited a long time to act on his desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe has starred in Mia’s fantasies more than once, ever since she was a teenager with a huge crush on her brother’s best friend. So what if Gabe’s fourteen years older? Mia knows he’s way out of her league, but her attraction has only grown stronger with time. She’s an adult now, and there’s no reason not to act on her most secret desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Gabe pulls her into his provocative world, she realizes there’s a lot she doesn’t know about him or how exacting his demands can be. Their relationship is intense and obsessive, but as they cross the line from secret sexual odyssey to something deeper, their affair runs the risk of being exposed—and vulnerable to a betrayal far more intimate than either expected.</description>

  <description>The strength of Sloane's heart is about to be put to the ultimate test. After the Eclipse - the night vampires began openly slaughtering human victims - everything changed. Out of fear, the government salvaged what remained of the human population and enclosed them in massive, security-laden cities called White Sectors, while marking the vampire infested territory as Red Sectors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When seventeen-year-old Sloane McAllister's twin brother disappears, she seems to be the only one who thinks he isn't dead, and she vows to stop at nothing to find him. Gathering her courage, she braves the Red Sector to search for clues to his whereabouts. By chance, she encounters Aden, a handsome, charismatic vampire with a hidden agenda. He turns Sloane against her will and whisks her away to his underground city. Enemies quickly become friends as Sloane struggles against her attraction to Aden and resists her growing loyalties to the creatures that ruined her life. But the vampires themselves are the least of her problems. The city is harboring a devastating secret, one that could change the tide of the war and destroy everything Sloane has come to believe in.</description>

  <description>Love doesn't come easy. For Joey, he didn't care if it ever came at all. He was much too busy adding notches to his bedpost and preparing for life as an adult. But when a casual fling waxes nostalgic about the one that got away, Joey starts to wonder if he isn't missing something after all, if there really is something to be learned from the language of love.</description>

  <description>It began with a brutal attack in a posh Minneapolis neighborhood.  And from the first killing to the next, Todd Mills was at the center of the story.  The son of Polish immigrants, Todd had changed his name and risen to the top of his field as a TV news reporter, winning two Emmy Awards along the way.  Then his world came crashing down.  Suddenly, the double life he'd hidden for so long was brutally uncovered: he was the secret lover of the first man to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Michael was murdered, Todd lost everything--including a life lived as a lie.  Now he's out of the closet and under suspicion, desperately investigating the killings himself, moving through a world of gay bars, steamy nightclubs, and double identities--where the one secret that matters most belongs to a killer who will strike again . . . and again.</description>

  <description>AN OBJECT AT REST&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quiet, down-to-earth Detroit handyman Derrick Chance has had enough loss for a lifetime and he has no intention of ever risking his heart again. Living alone in the old house his grandparents left him, with only his dog and a few close friends for companionship, he has written off the possibility of romance or even sex. He refuses to consider himself lonely, or wonder what he might be missing. His life is organized, predictable, and, best of all, risk-free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the day he installs shelves for accountant Gavin Hayes. With his contradictory combination of confidence and self-doubt, Gavin draws Derrick in with an intensity he's never known. As undeniable as gravity, Derrick finds himself falling for Gavin in defiance of all his usual slow and methodical ways. But Gavin carries wounds of his own. Fresh from an emotionally abusive relationship that ended with a dangerous betrayal, his future is far from certain. Can Derrick choose passion over safety, and let himself believe that Gavin is worth the risk?</description>

  <description>Johnny begins to come to terms with his sexual orientation after a friend opens his eyes to the world beyond his homophobic upbringing. Looking back, Johnny recognizes there were signs all his life that he was gay, but what about his dark fantasies of bondage, whips and domination?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While at a club, Johnny spots a gorgeous man across the room and immediately feels the pull of the dark and dangerous, passionate sexual energy that is Eric Mende. Frightened by his own reaction, and thinking he has nothing to offer a man like Eric, Johnny runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Eric pursues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric yearns to teach Johnny about love and erotic submission, but for Johnny, the price of accepting those gifts is high, maybe too high. His family, his job, the life he's always known, could all be forfeited if he follows his heart.</description>

  <description>Detective Nicholas Valenti, tall, dark and stoic, has been best friends with his partner, Sean O'Brian for six years. The two men have seen each other through divorce, disaster, and danger, and saved each other's asses more times than Valenti can count. Exactly when he started seeing his blond, intense partner in another light, Valenti isn't really sure. He only knows that he wants O'Brian in a way that had nothing to do with friendship and everything to do with possession. It is a desire he will have to hide forever because O'Brian is undeniably straight. &lt;br&gt; Just as Valenti is coming to grips with his new, unacceptable feelings for his partner their police captain puts them on a new case that could blow Valenti's cover once and for all. He and O'Brian are going undercover at the country's largest and most infamous gay resort to bust a notorious drug lord and stop the shipments of poison cocaine that are flooding the gay bars all over the city. &lt;br&gt; Now Valenti will have to make a choice between friendship and desire. He and O'Brian will play the roles of gay men that will push the limits of their relationship to the breaking point. Will their time at the RamJack forge a new bond between them or destroy their partnership forever?  "I'll Be Hot for Christmas," a Loose Id Stocking Stuffer featuring Valenti and O'Brian, heroes from "The Assignment" &lt;br&gt; It's a year after their assignment at the RamJack where they first confessed their feelings for each other. Valenti and O'Brian have been sharing an exclusive and white-hot relationship when Valenti suddenly pulls away. Understandably upset, O'Brian is determined to find out why his partner/lover is giving himthe cold shoulder on Christmas, even if it means handcuffing Valenti to the bed to get the truth out of him &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Publisher's Note: " The Assignment "and" I'll Be Hot for Christmas "are male-male love stories and contains homoerotic sex acts that may be offensive to some readers."</description>

  <description>When you fall for a fantasy, how do you know if it's more than make-believe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis, an unquestionably straight college student, finds himself in a financial bind. He'll do anything legal - including going gay for pay - and spends a weekend as Craig Rocke, letting gay porn star Marston Cougar have his way with him on film. Marston tells him to remember it's all just a fantasy for the camera, even though it sure feels like more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gary, also known as Marston Cougar, has a respectable day job. A straight guy, he started out making gay porn to pay his way through college. After getting his heart broken he has a no-dating rule. Now paired with "virgin" Craig Rocke, he finds it hard to keep it make-believe when he's losing his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gary's young niece needs surgery, and he almost has enough money to quit for good. But now that he feels a true connection with his fantasy co-star, will he be able to find a happily ever after with him when it's more than make-believe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains a modern fairy tale, hot manlove, movie magic, flipped perceptions, and a cranky three year-old who really wants her pizza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content Warning: Graphic language, sensual and explicit scenes of m/m sexuality including oral sex, anal sex/play, sex toys, public exhibition, group sex, and public sex.</description>

  <description>Sebastian Craig and Isabella Bryne have been best friends for five years in the Neverland of academia, and that's where they're planning to stay. So when Bella's brother, Asa, offers them a rent-free summer in his gorgeous home before they move to their next college and degree, they jump at the chance. It looks like a good deal at first... but there's more to Asa than meets the eye, and Sebastian finds himself suddenly hip-deep in complicated, grown-up problems and the frightening, bemusing prospect of having a family that will miss him when he's gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the best summer of his life finally ends, Sebastian has to make a difficult decision between staying in perpetual childhood forever, and facing adulthood—with all of its joys and fears. It seems that when Sebastian and Bella came up with a master plan for the future, they didn't count on Sebastian being bewitched by Bella's brother.</description>

  <description>Brent Kelly was a laid-back tradesman, whose only concerns were drinks with friends and which man to bed next. In need of a new accountant to sort out his shoebox of receipts, he's referred to Logan Willis, a quiet spoken, science-fiction loving geek. He didn't expect the geeky guy with an English accent and dark-rimmed glasses, wearing a TARDIS-blue shirt to be so intriguing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He didn't expect to be fascinated by him, let alone attracted to him. He most certainly didn't expect to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From jock to geek, both men know the differences between them are vast. But in this opposites-attract erotic drama, maybe it wasn’t the differences between them that would drive them apart. Maybe it was the differences between them that made it worth the fight.</description>

  <description>Joss Ravid works security for a major tribe on Kari's Star, but he'll tell anyone that he doesn't actually care if the ruling families kill each other off. He’s not interested in politics; he just likes getting paid to hit jerks, and also the many opportunities for hitting on straight men. The Galactic-imposed Interdiction may keep Kari citizens stuck on their war-torn world, but Joss has connections. If the situation gets too messy, he can leave whenever he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’ll also tell anyone he doesn’t care about girls, but that doesn’t stop him from rescuing 12-year-old Paige Carlyle, newly arrived on the planet and newly orphaned by tribe violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Joss were making a “don’t care” list, though, at the very top would be Zeke Cayden, Heir to powerful Tribe Cayden. Never mind that he and Joss were lovers; that’s long gone. Saving Zeke’s life when the shooting starts is just business. Some tribes don’t want peace, and killing a Galactic citizen like Paige—or controlling Cayden through the Heir—would serve them well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Joss is on the run, risking his life, his pretty face, and his precious liberty to keep Paige and Zeke alive and the peace plan that can lift the Interdiction on track. Why? Because…how often does a guy get to piss off half a planet while displaying his talents for woodcraft, cross-dressing, and scaring straight men?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Paige is kidnapped, though, the lives of Paige and Zeke, the leadership of Cayden and the future of Kari’s Star all ride on the wrinkled shoulders of Joss' work suit and he has to decide—does he care, or not?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Though this book is set in the Dream'verse, it is not a sequel to Knight Errant.)</description>

  <description>The story you are about to read celebrates love, sex and romance between men. It is a product of the Love Is Always Write Event sponsored by the Goodreads M/M Romance group and is published as a free gift to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is Love Is Always Write?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Goodreads M/M Romance group invited members to choose a photo and pen a letter asking for a short M/M romance story inspired by the image; authors from the group were encouraged to select a letter and write an original tale. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A written description of the image that inspired this story is provided along with the original request letter. If you’d like to view the photo, please feel free to join the Goodreads M/M Romance group (&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/20149" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/group/show/2...&lt;/a&gt;) and visit the discussion section: Love Is Always Write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHOTO DESCRIPTION:&lt;/strong&gt; Two young men stand in the riveted steel doorway of a ship.  The one inside the doorway is young and classically handsome, hatless, with wavy dark hair falling over his forehead.  His eyes are narrowed against the sunlight and a small smile hovers on his lips as he braces himself in the doorframe.  The man in front of him is younger still. His attractiveness is more the flush of youth and good health than perfection of features.  He grins, squinting in the brightness, dressed in the white hat and shirt of the WWII US Navy.  Although the two men stand only casually close together, the sailor in front has one hand raised, over his shoulder, to keep a firm grip on the shirt of the man in the doorway behind him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STORY LETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Author,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We met onboard, both of us so very young - still in our teens - but we were old enough to serve our country. And against all odds, and the many risks involved, we fell in love and have managed to stay together for the last 60 years.

  <description>As a young gay man—and a werepanther—all Jin Rayne yearns for is a normal life. Having fled his past, he wants nothing more than to start over, but Jin’s old life doesn’t want to let him go. When his travels bring him to a new city, he crosses paths with the leader of the local were-tribe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan Church is a shock and an enigma, and Jin fears that Logan is both the mate he fears and the love of his life. Jin doesn't want to go back to the old ways, and mating would irrevocably tie him to them. But Jin is the mate Logan needs at his side to help him lead his tribe, and he won't give Jin up so easily. It will take time and trust for Jin to discover the joy in belonging to Logan and how to love without restraint.</description>

  <description>Trevan Bean has a job that’s going from illegal to frightening, a boyfriend who may not be in his right mind, and a guardian angel who might actually be evil incarnate. Add to that the reappearance of his boyfriend’s estranged family, death threats, kidnapping, and the struggle of saving money to realize a dream, and Trevan has a lot on his plate. But Trevan is up to the challenge: he promised Landry a happily ever after, and Landry’s going to have it if it kills him!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It just might.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Landry Carter was a broken doll when they met two years ago but has grown into a partner who can stand at Trevan’s side… most of the time. Now that Trevan’s life just got scary—and Landry just got himself kidnapped—Trevan has to hope Landry’s love stays strong through this newest challenge, because the happily ever after won’t happen if Trevan has to go it alone.</description>

  <description>Ava Delaney calls herself a hybrid - a living, breathing human who happens to have vampire poison running through her veins. The only thing greater than her thirst for human blood is her capacity for guilt. She does her best to avoid the human world, for everyone's sake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ava accidentally enslaves a human while saving him from a vampire, she realises she has to look for help setting him free. Despite her misgivings, she expands her world but finds herself dragged into a possible vampire civil war. With the help of some new friends with ambiguous loyalties, she tries to find a way to keep her human, and herself, alive.</description>

  <description>Ellie is horrified to discover the pharmaceutical company she works for is doing illegal experiments. Company scientists have spliced human and animal DNA, creating exotic new species. One such “experiment” captures her heart and she’ll do anything to save him—even if he hates her for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fury has never known compassion or love. He’s spent his life in a cell, chained and abused by humans. The one woman he allowed himself to trust betrayed him. Now he’s free and set on vengeance. He vows to end her life but when she’s finally in his grasp, harming her is the last thing he wants to do to the sexy little human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fury can’t resist Ellie—the touch of her hands, her mouth on his skin, her body wrapped around his. He’s obsessed with the scent of his woman. And Ellie wants Fury—always has. She craves his big, powerful body and wants to heal his desolate heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But loving Fury is one thing…taming him is another.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Part of Men Under the Mistletoe Anthology from Carina Press; but also available separately.&lt;/em&gt;  (26,000 words)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up in rural Texas, Mitchell Evans' ambition to be a dancer made him a target. Though he found success in New York City, Mitch is at a crossroads, and heads home for the first time in twelve years to figure things out. When what appears to be a reindeer jumps out in front of his car, he drives off the road and into the path of the one man he hoped to avoid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last person Texas Ranger Web Eisley expects to see four days before Christmas is his first love. He hasn't seen Mitch since they quarreled over coming out to their friends and family years ago. Though he's not in the closet now, Web has worked hard for the respect of his fellow officers, but he still regrets the loss of Mitch in his life. And his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attraction between them is as strong as ever, and it doesn't take long for the men to pick up where they left off. But is love enough to keep Mitch in town in the New Year?</description>

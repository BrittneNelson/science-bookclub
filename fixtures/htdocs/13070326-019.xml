  <description>Camden Pike has been grief-stricken since his girlfriend, Viv, died. He’d give anything to have just one more glimpse of her. But when Cam visits the site of Viv’s deadly car accident, he sees an apparition. Her name is Nina, and she’s a girl from a parallel world. When Cam follows her there and makes an unbelievable discovery, it’s as if all his wildest dreams have come true. But things are very different in this other world. Nina is hiding a secret, and the window between the worlds is shrinking every day. As Cam comes to terms with the truth, he’s forced to make a choice that will change his life forever.</description>

  <description>Anna and Bennett were never supposed to meet: she lives in 1995 Chicago and he lives in 2012 San Francisco. But Bennett's unique ability to travel through time and space brings him into Anna's life, and with him, a new world of adventure and possibility. As their relationship deepens, they face the reality that time might knock Bennett back where he belongs, even as a devastating crisis throws everything they believe into question. Against a ticking clock, Anna and Bennett are forced to ask themselves how far they can push the bounds of fate-and what consequences they can bear in order to stay together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fresh, exciting, and deeply romantic, &lt;em&gt;Time Between Us&lt;/em&gt; is a stunning and spellbinding debut from an extraordinary new talent in YA fiction.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Maggie Bennet's life is in tatters. Her mother has disappeared, and is presumed dead. The next thing she knows, her father has dragged Maggie away from their elegant Newport home, off on some mad excursion to Yellowstone in Montana. Torn from the only life she's ever known, away from her friends, from society, and verging on no prospects, Maggie is furious and devastated by her father's betrayal. But when she arrives, she finds herself drawn to the frustratingly stubborn, handsome Tom Rowland, the son of a park geologist, and to the wild romantic beauty of Yellowstone itself. And as Tom and the promise of freedom capture Maggie's heart, Maggie is forced to choose between who she is and who she wants to be.</description>

  <description>Lilly has always been plagued by dreams; she dreams of another place and time, a place of pure beauty and light that suddenly erupts into fire and destruction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, there is a man with the haunting blue eyes that seem to look through to her very soul. In one fateful afternoon Lilly learns that the dreams are more real than she could've ever imagined. They are a link to who she really is; the Gatekeeper to the realms. Born from both light and dark, with her memories bound, she learns that it is her destiny to gather the relics of the flower of life. Lilly must do this in order to close the gates before the under realm destroys them all, but there are those who will stop at nothing to keep her from fulfilling her destiny. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are those who will try to sway her into the dark. She is torn between the love of two brothers; one, her loyal warrior, who has loved her since the beginning, and the other with the enthralling blue eyes that speak to her soul. One brother fights for the light, while the other fell into the darkness. Will she choose the brother that her soul longs for, or the brother that her heart calls out to?</description>

  <description>Lucky Linderman didn't ask for his life. He didn't ask his grandfather not to come home from the Vietnam War. He didn't ask for a father who never got over it. He didn't ask for a mother who keeps pretending their dysfunctional family is fine. And he didn't ask to be the target of Nader McMillan's relentless bullying, which has finally gone too far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lucky has a secret--one that helps him wade through the daily mundane torture of his life. In his dreams, Lucky escapes to the war-ridden jungles of Laos--the prison his grandfather couldn't escape--where Lucky can be a real man, an adventurer, and a hero. It's dangerous and wild, and it's a place where his life just might be worth living. But how long can Lucky keep hiding in his dreams before reality forces its way inside?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael L. Printz Honor recipient A.S. King's smart, funny and boldly original writing shines in this powerful novel about learning to cope with the shrapnel life throws at you and taking a stand against it.</description>

  <description>This is the story of Paul, a sophomore at a high school like no other: The cheerleaders ride Harleys, the homecoming queen used to be a guy named Daryl (she now prefers Infinite Darlene and is also the star quarterback), and the gay-straight alliance was formed to help the straight kids learn how to dance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Paul meets Noah, he thinks he’s found the one his heart is made for. Until he blows it. The school bookie says the odds are 12-to-1 against him getting Noah back, but Paul’s not giving up without playing his love really loud. His best friend Joni might be drifting away, his other best friend Tony might be dealing with ultra-religious parents, and his ex-boyfriend Kyle might not be going away anytime soon, but sometimes everything needs to fall apart before it can really fit together right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a happy-meaningful romantic comedy about finding love, losing love, and doing what it takes to get love back in a crazy-wonderful world.</description>

  <description>A provocative manifesto, &lt;em&gt;Whipping Girl &lt;/em&gt;tells the powerful story of Julia Serano, a transsexual woman whose supremely intelligent writing reflects her diverse background as a lesbian transgender activist and professional biologist. Serano shares her experiences and observations—both pre- and post-transition—to reveal the ways in which fear, suspicion, and dismissiveness toward femininity shape our societal attitudes toward trans women, as well as gender and sexuality as a whole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serano's well-honed arguments stem from her ability to bridge the gap between the often-disparate biological and social perspectives on gender. She exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this �feminine” weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activist must work to embrace and empower femininity—in all of its wondrous forms.</description>

  <description>Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead. She may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read. She must lie on her back once a month and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if their ovaries are viable. Offred can remember the years before, when she lived and made love with her husband, Luke; when she played with and protected her daughter; when she had a job, money of her own, and access to knowledge. But all of that is gone now...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Grave witch Alex Craft can speak to the dead, but that doesn’t mean she likes what they have to say.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a private investigator and consultant for the police, Alex Craft has seen a lot of dark magic. But even though she’s on good terms with Death himself—who happens to look fantastic in a pair of jeans—nothing has prepared her for her latest case. Alex is investigating a high profile murder when she’s attacked by the ‘shade’ she’s raising, which should be impossible. To top off her day, someone makes a serious attempt on her life, but Death saves her. Guess he likes having her around...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To solve this case Alex will have to team up with tough homicide detective Falin Andrews. Falin seems to be hiding something—though it’s certainly not his dislike of Alex—but Alex knows she needs his help to navigate the tangled webs of mortal and paranormal politics, and to track down a killer wielding a magic so malevolent, it may cost Alex her life...and her soul.</description>

  <description>The year is 1871...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tiki has been making a home for herself and her family of orphans in a deserted hideaway adjoining Charing Cross Station in central London. Their only means of survival is by picking pockets. One December night, Tiki steals a ring, and sets off a chain of events that could lead to all-out war with the Fey. For the ring is a reservoir that holds a truce between the English royals and the world of the Fey. But there are many who want the ring, including the mysterious Rieker, a handsome pickpocket who has been watching Tiki, and a rebel group of UnSeelie fey who would do anything to break the truce...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A delicious blend of urban fantasy and heart-stopping suspense, the story of THE FAERIE RING takes you from the gritty slums of London to the glittering ballrooms of the Royal Palace to the menacing Otherworld - in a spellbinding tale of mystery and suspense where nothing is what it seems...&lt;br&gt; &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It's 1811, and the threat of revolution haunts the upper classes of King George III's England. Then a beautiful young woman is found raped and savagely murdered on the altar steps of an ancient church near Westminster Abbey. A dueling pistol discovered at the scene and the damning testimony of a witness both point to one man, Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, a brilliant young nobleman shattered by his experience in the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a fugitive running for his life, Sebastian calls upon his skill as an agent during the war to catch the killer and prove his own innocence. In the process, he accumulates a band of unlikely allies, including the enigmatic beauty Kat Boleyn, who broke Sebastian's heart years ago. In Sebastian's world of intrigue and espionage, nothing is as it seems, yet the truth may hold the key to the future of the British monarchy, as well as to Sebastian's own salvation....</description>

  <description>Mackie Doyle is not one of us. Though he lives in the small town of Gentry, he comes from a world of tunnels and black murky water, a world of living dead girls ruled by a little tattooed princess. He is a Replacement, left in the crib of a human baby sixteen years ago. Now, because of fatal allergies to iron, blood, and consecrated ground, Mackie is fighting to survive in the human world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mackie would give anything to live among us, to practice on his bass or spend time with his crush, Tate. But when Tate's baby sister goes missing, Mackie is drawn irrevocably into the underworld of Gentry, known as Mayhem. He must face the dark creatures of the Slag Heaps and find his rightful place, in our world, or theirs.</description>

  <description>Love ties them together. Death can't tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best. Birthday. Ever. At least, it was supposed to be. With Logan's band playing a critical gig and Aura's plans for an intimate after-party, Aura knows it will be the most memorable night of her boyfriend's life. She never thought it would be his last. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan's sudden death leaves Aura devastated. He's gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, sort of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like everyone born after the Shift, Aura can see and hear ghosts. This mysterious ability has always been annoying, and Aura had wanted nothing more than to figure out why the Shift happened so she can undo it. But not with Logan's violet-hued spirit still hanging around. Because dead Logan is almost as real as ever. &lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't help that Aura's new friend Zachary is so understanding - and so very alive. His support means more to Aura than she cares to admit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Aura's relationships with the dead and the living grow ever complicated, so do her feelings for Logan and Zachary. Each holds a piece of Aura's heart - and clues to the secret of the Shift.</description>

  <description>Pictures of the Past is a compelling saga sweeping through Chicago, Paris and Berlin, reliving events from pre-World War II Europe, but beginning in contemporary times. An Impressionist painting, hanging for decades in the Art Institute of Chicago and donated by the charismatic philanthropist Taylor Woodmere, is challenged by an elderly woman as a Nazi theft. Taylor's gripping and passionate story takes us back to 1937. Sent to Paris on family business, he reluctantly leaves his girlfriend Emily, a spoiled debutante from Newport, Rhode Island. But once in Europe, he immediately falls in love - first with an Henri Lebasque painting, and then with the enchanting Sarah Berger of Berlin. After Taylor returns home, the Berger family becomes trapped in the Nazi web, and any attempts for the new lovers to be reunited are thwarted. Interwoven with this narrative is the story of Rachel Gold, a beautiful and bright Chicago girl caught up in the times of the late 1960's. Pregnant and abandoned by her boyfriend Court Woodmere, Taylor's son, she moves to New York to live with her aunt, a Holocaust survivor. Years later, as the controversy surrounding the provenance of the painting becomes public, Rachel's grown son is disturbed by his inexplicable familiarity with the work of art. And it is only Taylor Woodmere who can unravel the complicated puzzle of their lives. With a heart-grabbing ending, Pictures of the Past is historical fiction at its best, giving a personalized window to the powerful events and intriguing venues of the eras. From a world torn by the horrors of war, a love story emerges that endures through years of separation.</description>

  <description>Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs back into his life - dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge - he follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After their all-nighter ends and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues - and they're for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer Q gets, the less Q sees the girl he thought he knew.</description>

  <description>In her startlingly sensual new story, “Rules for Virgins”—this 43-page jewel of a tale is the first fiction she has published in six years—beloved bestselling author Amy Tan (“The Joy Luck Club,” “The Bonesetter’s Daughter”) takes us deep into the illicit world of 1912 Shanghai, where beautiful courtesans mercilessly compete for the patronage of wealthy gentlemen. For the women, the contest is deadly serious, a perilous game of economic survival that, if played well, can set them up for life as mistresses of the rich and prominent. There is no room for error, however: erotic power is hard to achieve and harder to maintain, especially in the loftiest social circles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter veteran seducer, Magic Gourd, formerly one of Shanghai’s “Top Ten Beauties” and now the advisor and attendant of Violet, an aspiring but inexperienced courtesan. Violet may have the youth and the allure, but Magic Gourd has the cunning and the knowledge without which the younger woman is sure to fail. These ancient tricks of the trade aren't written down, though; to pass them on to her student, Magic Gourd must reach back into her own professional past, bringing her lessons alive with stories and anecdotes from a career spent charming and manipulating men who should have known better but rarely did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world of sexual intrigue that Tan reveals in "Rules for Virgins" actually existed once, and she spares no detail in recreating it. But this story is more than intriguing (and sometimes shocking) historical literary fiction. Besides inviting us inside a life that few writers but Tan could conjure up, the intimate confessions of Magic Gourd add up to a kind of military manual for the War of the Sexes’ female combatants. The wisdom conveyed is ancient, specific, and timeless, exposing the workings of vanity and folly, calculation and desire that define the mysterious human heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In the rodeo arena, all you have to worry about is surviving.  But in the arena of love and ecstasy, things get much more complicated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lainie Capshaw has been servicing injured cowboys long enough to know that a charming Western drawl combined with a fine physical form doesn't mean you should fall for a man.  As a sports therapist, she travels the rodeo circuits patching up riders - and fending off their sweet-talking, swaggering advances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So no one is more surprised than Lainie when she finds herself involved with not one, but two different men on different circuits. Hank Lawson, a bullfighter, and Kyle Gilchrist, a bull rider trying to stage a comeback.  Lainie feels guilty about her two-timing, but it doesn't keep her from doubling her fun -until Hank catches her with Kyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's shocked that Hank isn't mad. She's more shocked to learn Hank and Kyle are hometown buddies. But when the men offer to share her - she knows that both of them are going to try to win her, body and soul.  Now it's up to Lainie to choose the one man who can give her the ride of her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If Singletree’s only florist didn’t deliver her posies half-drunk, I might still be married to that floor-licking, scum-sucking, receptionist-nailing hack-accountant, Mike Terwilliger."&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lacey Terwilliger’s shock and humiliation over her husband’s philandering prompt her to add some bonus material to Mike’s company newsletter: stunning Technicolor descriptions of the special brand of "administrative support" his receptionist gives him. The detailed mass e-mail to Mike’s family, friends, and clients blows up in her face, and before one can say "instant urban legend," Lacey has become the pariah of her small Kentucky town, a media punch line, and the defendant in Mike’s defamation lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her seemingly perfect life up in flames, Lacey retreats to her family’s lakeside cabin, only to encounter an aggravating neighbor named Monroe. A hunky crime novelist with a low tolerance for drama, Monroe is not thrilled about a newly divorced woman moving in next door. But with time, beer, and a screen door to the nose, a cautious friendship develops into something infinitely more satisfying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacey has to make a decision about her long-term living arrangements, though. Should she take a job writing caustic divorce newsletters for paying clients, or move on with her own life, pursuing more literary aspirations? Can she find happiness with a man who tells her what he thinks and not what she wants to hear? And will she ever be able to resist saying one . . . last . . . thing?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Amelia Gray. I’m a cemetery restorer who sees ghosts. In order to protect myself from the parasitic nature of the dead, I’ve always held fast to the rules passed down from my father. But now a haunted police detective has entered my world and everything is changing, including the rules that have always kept me safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It started with the discovery of a young woman’s brutalized body in an old Charleston graveyard I’ve been hired to restore. The clues to the killer—and to his other victims— lie in the headstone symbolism that only I can interpret. Devlin needs my help, but his ghosts shadow his every move, feeding off his warmth, sustaining their presence with his energy. To warn him would be to invite them into my life. I’ve vowed to keep my distance, but the pull of his magnetism grows ever stronger even as the symbols lead me closer to the killer and to the gossamer veil that separates this world from the next.</description>

  <description>In a society where unwanted teens are salvaged for their body parts, three runaways fight the system that would "unwind" them.&lt;br&gt;Connor's parents want to be rid of him because he's a troublemaker. Risa has no parents and is being unwound to cut orphanage costs. Lev's unwinding has been planned since his birth, as part of his family's strict religion. Brought together by chance, and kept together by desperation, these three unlikely companions make a harrowing cross-country journey, knowing their lives hang in the balance. If they can survive until their eighteenth birthday, they can't be harmed -- but when every piece of them, from their hands to their hearts, are wanted by a world gone mad, eighteen seems far, far away. &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Unwind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe/Horn Book&lt;/em&gt; Award winner Neal Shusterman challenges readers' ideas about life -- not just where life begins, and where it ends, but what it truly means to be alive.</description>

  <description>KIRKUS REVIEW: &lt;br&gt;A remarkable journey of self-discovery and survival, as the author navigates a perfect storm of homosexuality, religion and military service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gay-themed memoirs have become more and more common, but this work stands out based on the unique circumstances surrounding the author’s life. Tripp describes his childhood in Montana as a kind of war zone: “Growing up in an alcoholic home, I was never sure where the beginning was or where on the path I would hit a landmine and have the evening explode in front of me.” He eventually seeks refuge in the structure and discipline of the armed forces but incurs the psychological burden of having to hide his true nature. Tripp’s inclusion of excerpts from his personnel file adds another layer to the narrative, underscoring his criticism of the massive amount of resources expended by the military in an effort to weed out homosexual service members. Amid the subterfuge, the author finds tender moments of human connection as a lonely teenager working in a nursing home, a sexually repressed young man living on a submarine and a decorated officer approaching retirement. In fact, a submarine is the ideal metaphor for Tripp’s odyssey: He attempts to move undetected through largely hostile waters while facing potentially disastrous consequences if discovered. The author also has a knack for explaining decisions that lead him to pursue “reparative therapy,” heterosexual marriage and fatherhood. The only drawback is Tripp’s fondness for well-worn or clunky similes, which will strike some readers as folksy or distracting. Regardless, this memoir full of sharp insights will appeal to a wide audience—not only gay men, but anyone who wants to better understand a loved one struggling with sexual orientation and identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful testament to the importance of self-acceptance and perseverance.</description>

  <description>When Rachel Bertsche first moves to Chicago, she’s thrilled to finally share a zip code with her boyfriend. But shortly after getting married, she realizes that her new life is missing one thing: friends. Sure, she has plenty of BFFs—in New York and San Francisco and Boston and Washington, D.C. Still, in her adopted hometown, there’s no one to call at the last minute for girl talk over brunch or a reality-TV marathon over a bottle of wine. Taking matters into her own hands, Bertsche develops a plan: Meeting people everywhere from improv class to friend rental websites, she'll go on fifty-two friend-dates, one per week for a year, in hopes of meeting her new Best Friend Forever.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Pawnee: More Exciting than New York, More Glamorous than Hollywood, Roughly the Same Size as Bismarck, North Dakota In "Pawnee," Leslie Knope (as played by Amy Poehler on NBC's hit show "Parks and Recreation") takes readers on a hilarious tour through her hometown, the Midwestern haven known as Pawnee, Indiana. The book chronicles the city's colorful citizens and hopping nightlife, and also explores some of the most hilarious events from its crazy history--like the time the whole town was on fire, its ongoing raccoon infestation, and the cult that took over in the 1970s. Packed with laugh-out-loud-funny photographs, illustrations, and commentary by the other inhabitants of Pawnee, it's a must-read that will make you enjoy every moment of your stay in the Greatest Town in America. Praise for" Pawnee" "Carrying this book around is a good way of picking up girls with glasses." --Tom Haverford "I have read over four books, and this is by far the one that has me in it the most." --Andy Dwyer "Literally the greatest endeavor of human creativity in the history of mankind." --Chris Traeger</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Vinculum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A word hastily scrawled on a scrap of paper left behind by his long dead parents, becomes much more than a mystery. It becomes Adriel’s world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adriel struggled with his life, travelling the world and searching for his place in it. His pale green eyes and snow-white hair instantly singled him out in a crowd, but that wasn’t what made him different. As he struggled with conformity, he also waged war with himself—never able to control the raging pressure that swelled deep within him, alluring him with dark desires, tempting him to think of unspeakable things. Things no human should ever think about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he awakens from a vicious attack, he is reborn in a world where the unspeakable is real. And they are more terrifying than the one he has fought within himself for so long. Blood-sucking creatures, terrors with razor-sharp claws, and strategists with lethal plans lurk in the shadows, living in a world of darkness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Adriel is one of them.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Don’t miss this spectacular new series that will steal your heart and haunt your dreams,  Welcome to Shadow Falls camp, nestled deep in the woods of a town called Fallen…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night Kylie Galen finds herself at the wrong party, with the wrong people, and it changes her life forever.  Her mother ships her off to Shadow Falls—a camp for troubled teens, and within hours of arriving, it becomes painfully clear that her fellow campers aren’t just “troubled.”  Here at Shadow Falls, vampires, werewolves, shapeshifters, witches and fairies train side by side—learning to harness their powers, control their magic and live in the normal world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kylie’s never felt normal, but surely she doesn’t belong here with a bunch of paranormal freaks either.  Or does she?  They insist Kylie is one of them, and that she was brought here for a reason.  As if life wasn’t complicated enough, enter Derek and Lucas.  Derek’s a half-fae who’s determined to be her boyfriend, and Lucas is a smokin’ hot werewolf with whom Kylie shares a secret past.  Both Derek and Lucas couldn’t be more different, but they both have a powerful hold on her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Kylie feels deeply uncertain about everything, one thing is becoming painfully clear—Shadow Falls is exactly where she belongs…</description>

  <description>How do you defy destiny?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen Hamilton has spent her entire sixteen years trying to hide how different she is—no easy task on an island as small and sheltered as Nantucket. And it's getting harder. Nightmares of a desperate desert journey have Helen waking parched, only to find her sheets damaged by dirt and dust. At school she's haunted by hallucinations of three women weeping tears of blood . . . and when Helen first crosses paths with Lucas Delos, she has no way of knowing they're destined to play the leading roles in a tragedy the Fates insist on repeating throughout history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Helen unlocks the secrets of her ancestry, she realizes that some myths are more than just legend. But even demigod powers might not be enough to defy the forces that are both drawing her and Lucas together—and trying to tear them apart.</description>

  <description>A mesmerizing, moving, and elegantly written debut novel, &lt;em&gt;The Language of Flowers&lt;/em&gt; beautifully weaves past and present, creating a vivid portrait of an unforgettable woman whose gift for flowers helps her change the lives of others even as she struggles to overcome her own troubled past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Victorian language of flowers was used to convey romantic expressions: honeysuckle for devotion, asters for patience, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it’s been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now eighteen and emancipated from the system, Victoria has nowhere to go and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. Soon a local florist discovers her talents, and Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But a mysterious vendor at the flower market has her questioning what’s been missing in her life, and when she’s forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it’s worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.</description>

  <description>Ashley Byrne only wants one thing in life: to finish his tattoo apprenticeship and fulfill his dream of owning his own shop. In the meantime, he spends his nights partying, flirting, and having sex. After all, what else is there for him to worry about? Aside from his hair and his clothes, not much. He’s hot, and rest assured no one knows it better than him. He’s also used to getting what he wants—until he meets Felipe Navarro. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fee Navarro has everything he needs: a great IT job, a nice apartment, and all the high-tech toys his geeky heart could ever want. He doesn’t do casual, and he knows guys like Ash are nothing but. Ash may burn hot for Fee, but Fee isn’t willing to take a chance on a vain, little party boy with too many tats and an oversized ego. He wants someone to share his life with, and he won’t settle for anything less. Too bad Ash has never been the type to give up easily. He has a plan, and he’s not stopping until he proves he’s more than just a pretty face—he’s someone worthy of winning Fee’s heart.</description>

  <description>There has only been three people in Jaxxon Carter's life who truly mattered to her. Her mum, who committed suicide. Her sister, who she hasn’t seen since her teens. And Connor McKenzie, who disappeared from her life the same day he left their foster home. The hardest part of that was that he never completely left her life because she was forever seeing him on T.V. or in magazines as a Formula One Driver. But Jaxxon refuses to live a ‘woe is me’ life, even in spite of living alone in her one-roomed flat and being expected to survive on a ridiculously low income. Then one night she is offered a modelling job and before she knows it she has been catapulted to the peak of success, gaining fame, fortune and security. Oh and a stalker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor McKenzie is busy trying to shake off his crazy ex-girlfriend – another woman who thought she could get around his no marriage rule – when he sees Jaxxon on the cover of a magazine. Remembering how close they had once been, he’s shocked when she doesn’t respond to his attempts to contact her and then acts indifferently to him when they meet. But Connor can’t let it go. The only reason he had kept his hands off her ten years ago was that she had been younger than him. Now that they’re adults, he isn’t prepared to allow anything – not even Jaxxon – to stop him from having her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This novel contains a bitchy female who curses like a sailor, a persistent alpha male who doesn’t understand the word ‘no’, and explicit hot sex in some very public places.</description>

  <description>A simple touch and suddenly, Paige is in the past - living someone else's life, seeing the world through their eyes, and feeling their deepest emotions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paige used to think memories only existed in one's mind. But now, she knows better. She can't explain how or why, but she has glimmers: special moments that have remained behind - clinging to a letter, a ring, even a worn-out pair of boots. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Paige returns from each glimmer, a small part of her has changed. Who is this gourmet cook, fashion designer, feisty lover? And how is she supposed to explain this to her family without them thinking she has completely lost her mind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paige thought her new talent was a gift, until…she was suddenly transported into her sister’s memory, and caught a glimmer of her secret life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take this humorous and romantic journey, as Paige learns about true love through the lives of three extraordinary women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glimmers is a timeless romance, resembling other literary novels: southern charm of The Notebook, light-hearted comedy of Bridget Jones Diary, and classic romance of Pride and Prejudice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;eLit Book Awards (Illuminating Digital Publishing Excellence)2012 ~ First place in Romance&lt;br&gt;Kindle Book Review Best Indie Author 2012 ~ Semifinalist in Romance&lt;br&gt;New York Book Festival 2012 ~ Runner-up in Romance</description>

  <description>Beautiful, wild-child Nicole Tepper is hit by a car and left for dead. But when she wakes the next morning, Nicole finds herself in bed without a scratch. Perhaps she was more intoxicated than usual, as her mother is giving her the silent treatment and her friends are ignoring her as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things take a turn for the weird when Nicole soon discovers she is actually hovering between life and death. Her body is lying in the forest while her spirit is searching for anyone who can hear her. Unfortunately the only person who can is Dale Finnigan, the guy she publicly humiliated with a sharp-tongued insult that has left him branded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate, Nicole has no choice but to haunt Dale and convince the freaked-out senior to help her. Will he find her body before it's too late? Or will the guy who tried to kill her with his car, beat him there and finish her off before anyone finds out?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;How To Tame A Willful Wife:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Forbid her from riding astride&lt;br&gt;2. Hide her dueling sword&lt;br&gt;3. Burn all her breeches and buy her silk drawers&lt;br&gt;4. Frisk her for hidden daggers&lt;br&gt;5. Don't get distracted while frisking her for hidden daggers...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony Carrington, Earl of Ravensbrook, expects a biddable bride. A man of fiery passion tempered by the rigors of war into steely self-control, he demands obedience from his troops and his future wife. Regardless of how fetching she looks in breeches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Promised to the Earl of Plump Pockets by her impoverished father, Caroline Montague is no simpering miss. She rides a war stallion named Hercules, fights with a blade, and can best most men with both bow and rifle. She finds Anthony autocratic, domineering, and...ridiculously gorgeous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a duel of wit and wills in this charming retelling of The Taming of the Shrew. But the question is...who's taming whom?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Excerpt from HOW TO TAME A WILLFUL WIFE:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “You need to work on the way you hold a blade,” Lord Ravensbrook said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caroline turned to find Anthony just beyond the riding ring. He stood with one polished boot raised on the lower rung of the fence. His obsidian hair fell to his collar in rich waves. His chestnut eyes held her as if she belonged to him already.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I have been told I have a great deal of skill with a blade, my lord, both with a rapier and a dagger.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Then you’ve been lied to. I think we discovered your prowess is lacking when we met last night.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She felt a frisson of irritation at that jibe, but she swallowed it down. “Do you fence, my lord?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Not with women or youths who do not know enough to hold the proper form.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And which am I? A woman, or a youth?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Dressed as you are, I cannot tell.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caroline laughed, her eyes gleaming with mischief. She knew she had scored a point. In spite of his words, she saw his eyes roaming over the curves of her hips and thighs, the softness of her breasts beneath her vest. He might call her boyish, but he was lying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Perhaps you will spar with me here.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I do not tutor amateurs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Is that so?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Not in fencing, at any rate.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wondered what else he might seek to tutor her in. From the desire in his eyes, she could begin to guess.</description>

  <description>Joshua Cody, a brilliant young composer, was about to receive his PhD when he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Facing a bone marrow transplant and full radiation, he charts his struggle: the fury, the tendency to self-destruction, and the ruthless grasping for life and sensation; the encounter with beautiful Ariel, who gives him cocaine and a blow job in a Manhattan restaurant following his first treatment; the detailed morphine fantasy complete with a bride called Valentina while, in reality, hospital staff are pinning him to his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Moving effortlessly between references to Don Giovanni and the Rolling Stones, Ezra Pound and Buffalo Bill, and studded with pages from his own diaries and hospital notebooks, &lt;em&gt;[sic]&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing, hallucinatory glimpse into a young man’s battle against disease and a celebration of art, language, music, and life.</description>

  <description>John Irving’s&lt;strong&gt; A Prayer for Owen Meany&lt;/strong&gt; is the inspiring modern classic that introduced two of the author’s most unforgettable characters, boys bonded forever in childhood: the stunted Owen Meany, whose life is touched by God, and the orphaned Johnny Wheelwright, whose life is touched by Owen. From the accident that links them to the mystery that follows them–and the martyrdom that parts them–the events of their lives form a tapestry of fate and faith in a novel that is Irving at his irresistible best.</description>

  <description>As long ago as forever and as far away as Selidor, there lived the dragonlord and Archmage, Sparrowhawk, the greatest of the great wizards - he who, when still a youth, met with the evil shadow-beast; he who later brought back the Ring of Erreth-Akbe from the Tombs of Atuan; and he who, as an old man, rode the mighty dragon Kalessin back form the land of the dead. And then, the legends say, Sparrowhawk entered his boat, &lt;em&gt;Lookfar,&lt;/em&gt; turned his back on land, and without wind or sail or oar moved westward over the sea and our of sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore&lt;/strong&gt; - Ursula Le Guin's brilliant and magical trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover Illustration: Jonathan Field</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I WILL COME TO YOU LIKE THE WIND ... I AM YOUR DESTINY.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned seven years ago after witnessing the brutal murder of her parents at the hands of the Comanche people, golden-haired Loretta Simpson still lives in terror that the warriors will return. Her fear is so powerful, she can no longer speak a word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Called the U.S. Army's most cunning adversary, Hunter of the Wolf believes that Loretta is the "honey-haired woman with no voice" of ancient prophecy --- the woman he must honor for all eternity. But Loretta can see Hunter only as the enemy who has stolen her, and she refuses to succumb to his control ... or his touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the hatred intensifying between their peoples, Loretta and Hunter gradually find their prejudices giving to respect, then flaring into feelings too dangerous to express.

  <description>Once he had scorched the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had driven back overwhelming darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had loved with such passion, his name was legend...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAIREN SOUL&lt;br&gt;Long ago, in the magical holocaust known as the Mage Wars, the immortal Fey and their allies fought to defeat the grasping evil of the Elden Mages and their dark-gifted supporters. During those wars, in a fit of grief-induced madness caused by the death of his mate, Fey shapeshifter Rain Tairen Soul nearly destroyed the world in a blaze of tairen fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a thousand years later, a new threat calls him from the Fading Lands, back into the world that had cost him so dearly. Now an ancient, familiar evil is regaining its strength, and a new voice beckons him--more compelling, more seductive, more maddening than any before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the power of his most bitter enemy grows and ancient alliances crumble, the wildness in his blood will not be denied. The tairen must claim his truemate and embrace the destiny woven for him in the mists of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Violet Ambrose is grappling with two major issues: Jay Heaton and her morbid secret ability. While the sixteen-year-old is confused by her new feelings for her best friend since childhood, she is more disturbed by her "power" to sense dead bodies—or at least those that have been murdered. Since she was a little girl, she has felt the echoes that the dead leave behind in the world... and the imprints that attach to their killers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet has never considered her strange talent to be a gift; it mostly just led her to find the dead birds her cat had tired of playing with. But now that a serial killer has begun terrorizing her small town, and the echoes of the local girls he's claimed haunt her daily, she realizes she might be the only person who can stop him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his fierce protectiveness over her, Jay reluctantly agrees to help Violet on her quest to find the murderer—and Violet is unnerved to find herself hoping that Jay's intentions are much more than friendly. But even as she's falling intensely in love, Violet is getting closer and closer to discovering a killer... and becoming his prey herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;�Oliver Twist with a twist…Waters spins an absorbing tale that withholds as much as it discloses. A pulsating story.”—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The New York Times Book Review &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sue Trinder is an orphan, left as an infant in the care of Mrs. Sucksby, a "baby farmer," who raised her with unusual tenderness, as if Sue were her own. Mrs. Sucksby’s household, with its fussy babies calmed with doses of gin, also hosts a transient family of petty thieves—fingersmiths—for whom this house in the heart of a mean London slum is home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, the most beloved thief of all arrives—Gentleman, an elegant con man, who carries with him an enticing proposition for Sue: If she wins a position as the maid to Maud Lilly, a naïve gentlewoman, and aids Gentleman in her seduction, then they will all share in Maud’s vast inheritance. Once the inheritance is secured, Maud will be disposed of—passed off as mad, and made to live out the rest of her days in a lunatic asylum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With dreams of paying back the kindness of her adopted family, Sue agrees to the plan. Once in, however, Sue begins to pity her helpless mark and care for Maud Lilly in unexpected ways...But no one and nothing is as it seems in this Dickensian novel of thrills and reversals</description>

  <description>A Victorian boarding school story, a Gothic mansion mystery, a gossipy romp about a clique of girlfriends, and a dark other-worldly fantasy--jumble them all together and you have this complicated and unusual first novel.  &lt;p&gt;  Sixteen-year-old Gemma has had an unconventional upbringing in India, until the day she foresees her mother's death in a black, swirling vision that turns out to be true. Sent back to England, she is enrolled at Spence, a girls' academy with a mysterious burned-out East Wing. There Gemma is snubbed by powerful Felicity, beautiful Pippa, and even her own dumpy roommate Ann, until she blackmails herself and Ann into the treacherous clique. Gemma is distressed to find that she has been followed from India by Kartik, a beautiful young man who warns her to fight off the visions. Nevertheless, they continue, and one night she is led by a child-spirit to find a diary that reveals the secrets of a mystical Order. The clique soon finds a way to accompany Gemma to the other-world realms of her visions "for a bit of fun" and to taste the power they will never have as Victorian wives, but they discover that the delights of the realms are overwhelmed by a menace they cannot control. Gemma is left with the knowledge that her role as the link between worlds leaves her with a mission to seek out the "others" and rebuild the Order. &lt;em&gt;A Great and Terrible Beauty&lt;/em&gt; is an impressive first book in what should prove to be a fascinating trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A riveting portrait of life after abuse from an award-winning novelist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-Year-Old Jace Witherspoon arrives at the doorstep of his estranged brother Christian with a re-landscaped face (courtesy of his father’s fist), $3.84, and a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; He tries to move on, going for new friends, a new school, and a new job, but all his changes can’t make him forget what he left behind—his mother, who is still trapped with his dad, and his ex-girlfriend, who is keeping his secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At least so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Worst of all, Jace realizes that if he really wants to move forward, he may first have to do what scares him most: He may have to go back. Award-winning novelist Swati Avasthi has created a riveting and remarkably nuanced portrait of what happens &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;. After you’ve said enough, after you’ve run, after you’ve made the split—how do you begin to live again? Readers won’t be able to put this intense page-turner down.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An enthralling historical novel about a young woman's struggle to become a doctor during the Civil War &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this stunning first novel, Mary Sutter is a brilliant, head­strong midwife from Albany, New York, who dreams of becoming a surgeon. Determined to overcome the prejudices against women in medicine-and eager to run away from her recent heartbreak- Mary leaves home and travels to Washington, D.C. to help tend the legions of Civil War wounded. Under the guidance of William Stipp and James Blevens-two surgeons who fall unwittingly in love with Mary's courage, will, and stubbornness in the face of suffering-and resisting her mother's pleas to return home to help with the birth of her twin sister's baby, Mary pursues her medical career in the desperately overwhelmed hospitals of the capital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Like Charles Frazier's &lt;em&gt;Cold Mountain&lt;/em&gt; and Robert Hicks's &lt;em&gt;The Widow of the South, My Name Is Mary Sutter&lt;/em&gt; powerfully evokes the atmosphere of the period. Rich with historical detail (including marvelous depictions of Lincoln, Dorothea Dix, General McClellan, and John Hay among others), and full of the tragedies and challenges of wartime, &lt;em&gt;My Name Is Mary Sutter&lt;/em&gt; is an exceptional novel. And in Mary herself, Robin Oliveira has created a truly unforgettable heroine whose unwavering determination and vulnerability will resonate with readers everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty-five-year-old Julie Jacobs is heartbroken over the death of her beloved Aunt Rose. But the shock goes even deeper when she learns that the woman who has been like a mother to her has left her entire estate to Julie’s twin sister. The only thing Julie receives is a key—one carried by her mother on the day she herself died—to a safety-deposit box in Siena, Italy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This key sends Julie on a journey that will change her life forever—a journey into the troubled past of her ancestor Giulietta Tolomei. In 1340, still reeling from the slaughter of her parents, Giulietta was smuggled into Siena, where she met a young man named Romeo. Their ill-fated love turned medieval Siena upside-down and went on to inspire generations of poets and artists, the story reaching its pinnacle in Shakespeare’s famous tragedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But six centuries have a way of catching up to the present, and Julie gradually begins to discover that here, in this ancient city, the past and present are hard to tell apart. The deeper she delves into the history of Romeo and Giulietta, and the closer she gets to the treasure they allegedly left behind, the greater the danger surrounding her—superstitions, ancient hostilities, and personal vendettas. As Julie crosses paths with the descendants of the families involved in the unforgettable blood feud, she begins to fear that the notorious curse—“A plague on both your houses!”—is still at work, and that she is destined to be its next target. Only someone like Romeo, it seems, could save her from this dreaded fate, but his story ended long ago. Or did it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Anne Fortier comes a sweeping, beautifully written novel of intrigue and identity, of love and legacy, as a young woman discovers that her own fate is irrevocably tied—for better or worse—to literature’s greatest star-crossed lovers.</description>

  <description>Budo is Max's imaginary friend. But though only Max can see him, he is real. He and the other imaginary friends watch over their children until the day comes that the child stops imagining them. And then they're gone. Budo has lasted a lot longer than most imaginary friends - four years - because Max needs him more. His parents argue about sending him to a special school. But Max is perfectly happy if everything is just kept the way it is, and nothing out of the ordinary happens. Unfortunately, something out of the ordinary is going to happen - and then he'll need Budo more than ever...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;Kevin Smith? The guy who did “Clerks” a million years ago? Didn’t they bounce his fat ass off a plane once? What could you possibly learn from the director of “Cop Out”? How about this: he changed filmmaking forever when he was twenty-three, and since then, he’s done whatever the hell he wants. He makes movies, writes comics, owns a store, and now he’s built a podcasting empire with his friends and family, including a wife who’s way out of his league. So here’s some tough shit: Kevin Smith has cracked the code.  Or, he’s just cracked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tough Sh*t&lt;/em&gt; is the dirty business that Kevin has been digesting for 41 years and now, he’s ready to put it in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; hands. Smear this shit all over yourself, because this is your blueprint (or brownprint) for success. Kev takes you through some big moments in his life to help you live &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; days in as Gretzky a fashion as you can: going where the puck is &lt;em&gt;gonna&lt;/em&gt; be. Read all about how a zero like Smith managed to make ten movies with no discernible talent, and how when he had everything he thought he’d ever want, he decided to blow up his own career. Along the way, Kev shares stories about folks who inspired him (like George Carlin), folks who befuddled him (like Bruce Willis), and folks who let him jerk off onto their legs (like his beloved wife, Jen). So make this your daily reader. Hell, read it on the toilet if you want. Just make sure you grab the bowl and push, because you’re about to take one &lt;em&gt;Tough Sh*t&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>When her widower father drowns at sea, Gemma Hardy is taken from her native Iceland to Scotland to live with her kind uncle and his family. But the death of her doting guardian leaves Gemma under the care of her resentful aunt, and it soon becomes clear that she is nothing more than an unwelcome guest at Yew House. When she receives a scholarship to a private school, ten-year-old Gemma believes she's found the perfect solution and eagerly sets out again to a new home. However, at Claypoole she finds herself treated as an unpaid servant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Gemma's delight, the school goes bankrupt, and she takes a job as an au pair on the Orkney Islands. The remote Blackbird Hall belongs to Mr. Sinclair, a London businessman; his eight-year-old niece is Gemma's charge. Even before their first meeting, Gemma is, like everyone on the island, intrigued by Mr. Sinclair. Rich (by Gemma's standards), single, flying in from London when he pleases, Hugh Sinclair fills the house with life. An unlikely couple, the two are drawn to each other, but Gemma's biggest trial is about to begin: a journey of passion and betrayal, redemption and discovery, that will lead her to a life of which she's never dreamed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in Scotland and Iceland in the 1950s and '60s, &lt;em&gt;The Flight of Gemma Hardy&lt;/em&gt;--a captivating homage to Charlotte Brontë's &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;--is a sweeping saga that resurrects the timeless themes of the original but is destined to become a classic all its own.</description>

  <description>My name is Chloe Saunders and my life will never be the same again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I wanted was to make friends, meet boys, and keep on being ordinary. I don't even know what that means anymore. It all started on the day that I saw my first ghost - and the ghost saw me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now there are ghosts everywhere and they won't leave me alone. To top it all off, I somehow got myself locked up in Lyle House, a "special home" for troubled teens. Yet the home isn't what it seems. Don't tell anyone, but I think there might be more to my housemates than meets the eye. The question is, whose side are they on? it's up to me to figure out the dangerous secrets behind Lyle House...before its skeletons come back to haunt me.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of Pulled and Take This Regret comes a gripping new tale of loss and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William has spent six years running from his past and the last eight months trying to rid his mind of the dreams that increasingly haunt his nights. Trapped in a world of false ambitions and feigned affections, William knows he’s reached a breaking point and something’s going to give.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie had lived her entire life without hope until one man showed her what it meant to be loved.

He is unable to ignore the buried desires and the hope for the future they’d once believed they’d have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now William is ready to fight to take back what had been stolen from him six years before.&lt;br&gt;But he never imagined what that fight might cost him.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A.L.

  <description>Biographer Margaret Lea returns one night to her apartment above her father’s antiquarian bookshop. On her steps she finds a letter. It is a hand-written request from one of Britain’s most prolific and well-loved novelists. Vida Winter, gravely ill, wants to recount her life story before it is too late, and she wants Margaret to be the one to capture her history. The request takes Margaret by surprise — she doesn’t know the author, nor has she read any of Miss Winter’s dozens of novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late one night while pondering whether to accept the task of recording Miss Winter’s personal story, Margaret begins to read her father’s rare copy of Miss Winter’s &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation&lt;/em&gt;. She is spellbound by the stories and confused when she realizes the book only contains twelve stories. Where is the thirteenth tale? Intrigued, Margaret agrees to meet Miss Winter and act as her biographer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Vida Winter unfolds her story, she shares with Margaret the dark family secrets that she has long kept hidden as she remembers her days at Angelfield, the now burnt-out estate that was her childhood home. Margaret carefully records Miss Winter’s account and finds herself more and more deeply immersed in the strange and troubling story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both women will have to confront their pasts and the weight of family secrets... and the ghosts that haunt them still.</description>

  <description>From the internationally bestselling author of "The House at Riverton," an unforgettable new novel that transports the reader from the back alleys of poverty of pre-World War I London to the shores of colonial Australia where so many made a fresh start, and back to the windswept coast of Cornwall, England, past and presentA tiny girl is abandoned on a ship headed for Australia in 1913. She arrives completely alone with nothing but a small suitcase containing a few clothes and a single book -- a beautiful volume of fairy tales. She is taken in by the dockmaster and his wife and raised as their own. On her twenty-first birthday they tell her the truth, and with her sense of self shattered and with very little to go on, "Nell" sets out on a journey to England to try to trace her story, to fi nd her real identity. Her quest leads her to Blackhurst Manor on the Cornish coast and the secrets of the doomed Mountrachet family. But it is not until her granddaughter, Cassandra, takes up the search after Nell's death that all the pieces of the puzzle are assembled. At Cliff Cottage, on the grounds of Blackhurst Manor, Cassandra discovers the forgotten garden of the book's title and is able to unlock the secrets of the beautiful book of fairy tales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a novel of outer and inner journeys and an homage to the power of storytelling. "The Forgotten Garden" is fi lled with unforgettable characters who weave their way through its spellbinding plot to astounding effect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morton's novels are #1 bestsellers in England and Australia and are published in more than twenty languages. Her fi rst novel, "The House at Riverton," was a "New York Times" bestseller.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An extraordinary debut novel of love that survives the fires of hell and transcends the boundaries of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The narrator of &lt;em&gt;The Gargoyle&lt;/em&gt; is a very contemporary cynic, physically beautiful and sexually adept, who dwells in the moral vacuum that is modern life. As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide — for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life — and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete — and her time on earth will be finished.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; Fall in love with the first book in the Blood Rose trilogy-a romance of the Old West by a phenomenal new talent &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On a stagecoach traveling through New Mexico Territory, Jessica Thornton is a long way from the cool mists and lush gardens of her native England. An authoress and milliner, she carries the weight of a scandalous secret-a horrible shame that has brought her to the West on a desperate search for the only family she can trust: her brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; No one prepared Jessica for the heat and the hardships. And no one prepared her for a man like Brady Wilkins. For, despite the rancher's rough-hewn appearance and her own misgivings, Jessica must put her life in his hands after their stagecoach crashes. And she begins to see the man behind the callused hands and caustic wit. A man strong enough to carve out a home in the wilderness, brave enough to fight for his own, and passionate enough to restore her faith in herself-and in her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>When the heir to MacKlenna Farm, paramedic Kit MacKlenna, discovers she is not who she thinks she is, she uses the magic of the ruby brooch to travel back in time to the mid-19th century American west to uncover her true identity. Her coming-of-age quest leads her down a dangerous path that could cost her not only her heart, but her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scottish lawyer Cullen Montgomery has a well-planned future that doesn't include an eccentric, risk-taking woman, but that doesn't stop his defenses from slipping when he sees Kit risk her life to save her traveling companions. Will Cullen stay his course and fulfill his commitments in California, or will he surrender to the only woman whose heart beats to the same rhythm as his own?</description>

Suddenly her anxiety over college and her broken friendship with Charlie seem like small change compared to the war she now finds herself stuck in the middle of.

She has no idea who she can trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the truth burns through her life in its determination to turn it to ashes, Ari will have to battle with ancient deadly creatures, epic family drama and heart-wrenching romantic entanglements.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Knowing the outcome doesn’t always make a choice easier . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison Coleman’s life is one big “What if?” As a Searcher, whenever Addie is faced with a choice, she can look into the future and see both outcomes. It’s the ultimate insurance plan against disaster. Or so she thought. When Addie’s parents ambush her with the news of their divorce, she has to pick who she wants to live with—her father, who is leaving the paranormal compound to live among the “Norms,” or her mother, who is staying in the life Addie has always known. Addie loves her life just as it is, so her answer should be easy. One Search six weeks into the future proves it’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one potential future, Addie is adjusting to life outside the Compound as the new girl in a Norm high school where she meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive artist who understands her. In the other path, Addie is being pursued by the hottest guy in school—but she never wanted to be a quarterback’s girlfriend. When Addie’s father is asked to consult on a murder in the Compound, she’s unwittingly drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything she holds dear. With love and loss in both lives, it all comes down to which reality she’s willing to live through . . . and who she can’t live without.</description>

  <description>Chantal Breelan is a ward of the state, living under the care of a woman who is cold and heartless. Her past is a mystery, and her future is even more uncertain. She can’t recall why she had been taken from her parents and so she’s left with nothing but an empty hole where her childhood should have been. When she awakens from her nightmares, she’s left with terrible, violent images, as well as a boy whose face is oddly familiar, yet can’t be placed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scared and alone, Chantal begins to confide in an imaginary friend – a shadow in the shape of a man who stands in the corner of her room. She is comforted when she believes he listens to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her eighteenth birthday, Chantal is forced to leave her foster home. She moves to New York City, but the start of her new life doesn’t begin as smoothly as she’d hoped. In this environment, she faces a whole new set of challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night at a subway station, Chantal meets a young boy who runs away from her, and she’s compelled to follow him down into the tunnels. But this Rabbit Hole reveals a world where reality is a nightmare. Her dreams are clues to her future, and her life becomes twisted and dangerous when she learns that things that go bump in the night are not just in fairy tales and childhood stories.</description>

  <description>Sierra Kastian has been raised by her mother in Silver Dust, Nevada. She was told from birth that she has no other living relatives. Her childhood memories consist of hours spent in casino lobbies, while her mother invested every dime she had into psychic gambling. Though her mother's talents often supplied her the jackpots she sought, she'd always put the majority of the money right back into the machines. While Sierra doesn't hesitate to confirm her mother's magical feats, she's always kept her own abilities to herself.&lt;br&gt;She longs for a normal life, without the confusion her extra-sensory powers cause. &lt;br&gt;Today, on the verge of turning thirty and co-owning a coffee shop with her best friend, a hot stranger walks into the cafe and hands her an envelope that will change her life forever. In it, there is a letter from an estranged woman claiming to be her dying aunt and a tarot card entitled, The Fool. If that isn't bad enough, she is asked to accompany the handsome messenger to an undisclosed destination.&lt;br&gt;Hayden Wells isn't too happy to have to travel from Hailey, Alaska to an over-crowded part of Nevada to fetch the long, lost daughter of the Ivory witches coven. But, he doesn't have a choice if he wants to continue to live. Being a werewolf has its' perks, but being left unmated, isn't one of them. He must convince Sierra Kastian that she has an aunt and a destiny that she cannot escape, or his pack will have no future and her family's legacy and powers will be lost.&lt;br&gt;Sierra's best friend convinces her to take the journey, but it will be up to her to accept her powers and her place in a delicate balance of nature and magic, all hidden from the outside world in the Alaskan wilderness.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>‘I have lived more years than I can remember, probably more than the sum of all your years combined. Kings have called me friend and brigands have sworn to burn the flesh from my bones even if they have to search all seven halls of the shadowland to find me.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the night of midwinter’s eve, a storyteller takes his listeners back to the Dark ages and a tale from his youth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deserted by its Roman masters, Britain has been invaded by the Saxons at the invitation of Vortigern, traitorous leader of the Britons. Now, as the tribes unite to reclaim their land, one man must rise to lead them and become their true and only king.</description>

  <description>Sonnet Gray has problems, and not just those of a typical 18 year old.  Her family is one of the Lost; time travelers who have no power over their journeys.  Hopelessly old fashioned and yet more modern than most girls, Sonnet speaks several languages and takes care of her motley crew back home by working in a coffee shop and playing guitar.  Over time, the Lost leave behind those they love and pick up new characters along the way.  In twenty-first century America, Sonnet meets Emme, a Lost young woman with a questionable line of work, Luke, a mysterious photographer, and Israel, a young doctor .  But no one can take the place of Sonnet's sister, Rose, who was left behind as a baby in the fifteenth century.  The ghost of her beckons from each time and place; but what's real and what isn't? Is Rose Gray trying to contact her before it's too late?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A ghost story with a sci-fi, Gothic romance twist, Shadows Gray will keep you up at night, wondering: is the redemptive power of love enough to change history?</description>

  <description>Irreverent twenty-something, Dylan Hart, has her little black heart set to cashing-in on the blood-drained bodies of seven prostitutes scattered throughout southern California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In search of the culprit of the media-dubbed Vampire Massacres, journalist Dylan Hart dives head first into L.A.’s sanguinary ‘vampire’ subculture, in an attempt to write her first best-selling novel and pay off her ever growing student debt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not your daughter’s vampire story, THE SCENE escorts readers into an all too real sanguinarian lifestyle and drags them through a bloody good mystery. Horrible pun intended.</description>

  <description>For one-thousand years, Druid prophecies foretold of a young witch destined to alter the fate of both human and immortal alike. This witch-turned-vampire would be capable of harnessing the supernatural abilities of both and, in a bloody rise to power, would rule with unwavering control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unwillingly thrust into a world she never dreamed existed, Liz Markum is catapulted into an ancient war between rival vampire factions.  She must choose between those she loves and the ever-present darkness attempting to devour her very soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only one question remains: Will Liz claim her birthright or surrender to the dark gift?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two destinies.</description>

  <description>Can romance develop between a Heavenly Light-Bearer and a Hellish Vampire Blood-Hunter? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabbruis is an extremely attractive Blood-Hunter who has reconciled himself to be alone forever. Over millennia Tabbruis has wandered the Earth alone, aimlessly living through many historical events. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charleen (aka Charmeine) was found in 1997 as a teenager, unable to remember where she was from or where her family was.  She was sent to an orphanage where she met her best friend, Shane.  With determination, she works hard and becomes a school teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabbruis comes to her aid when she is attacked by a Blood-Hunter.  Charmeine’s power as a Light-Bearer, one who throws lightning, is triggered when she meets Tabbruis, and it grows exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they meet, the attraction is immediate, romantic and passionate. They are polar opposites and clash together in a dramatic way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Charmeine and Tabbruis fulfill their destinies? Will they realize their importance in both the Blood-Hunter and Light-Bearer world? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Charmeine” is an action-packed emotional roller-coaster of passion and fury!</description>

  <description>Som så mange andre teenagere dribler syttenårige Alice omkring og prøver at klare sig nogenlunde gennem highschool, mens hun halvhjertet fordriver tid med sin veninde, Jane, og med noget mere overbevisning tager sig af sin lillebror, Milo. Men hendes liv skifter fuldstændig kurs, da hun en aften møder den sjove og charmerende Jack. Alice forstår ikke helt, hvad det er ved Jack, som gør ham så tiltrækkende, og heller ikke hans besynderlige livsstil, men de bliver hurtigt venner. Og måske også lidt mere end det . I hvert fald indtil hun møder Jacks bror, Peter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Et enkelt blik fra Peter er nok til at indfange Alice fuldstændig, og hun kan slet ikke tænke klart, når han er i nærheden. Og det til trods for, at han tydeligvis ikke kan fordrage hende eller ønsker hende i nærheden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice er klar over, at Jack og Peter og deres familie ikke er som alle andre. Men præcis hvad der er med dem, er hun ikke klar over. Heller ikke hvor stor en rolle hun kommer til at spille for familiens fremtid - fanget som hun er mellem to brødre, der hver især gør krav på hende .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book #1 of the Bestselling Consequences Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony Rawlings had a plan—to teach Claire Nichols to behave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Nichols had a plan—to survive!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an unfamiliar bedroom within a luxurious mansion, Claire Nichols wakes to memories of a brutal abduction. All of her recollections have one common denominator, the man she just met—Anthony Rawlings. Unbeknownst to Claire, Anthony has had her in his sights for a long time. Every action has consequences—and his actions resulted in their chance meeting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing incomprehensible circumstances, Claire must learn to survive as she comes to terms with her new reality—every aspect of her livelihood is now dependent upon the tall, dark-haired, dark-eyed tycoon. Anthony may appear to the world as a prosperous, benevolent, kind businessman, but in reality Claire learns he is also a menacing, controlling captor with very strict rules: do as your told, public failure is not an option, and don’t divulge private information. Failure to follow these rules and more, are met with serious consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an effort to earn her freedom, Claire learns her lessons well and before long, she unknowingly captivates her captor. Anthony/ Tony reluctantly becomes enthralled with Claire’s beauty, resilience and determination. Their interaction instigates strong emotions, including—fear, anger, love, and lust—as their journey flows into uncharted waters of intrigue and passion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the opening criminal abduction, through the twists and turns, to the unlikely romantic thrills, the suspense climaxes as Aleatha Romig utilizes vivid detail, allowing this novel to unfold like a movie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you put the pieces of the puzzle together? Claire Nichols abduction wasn’t a random act—did she learn her lessons well enough? Will these unlikely lovers remain true--or will she learn the truth before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>It's been six weeks since angels of the apocalypse descended to demolish the modern world. Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anything, including making a deal with an enemy angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival.  Together, they journey toward the angels' stronghold in San Francisco where she'll risk everything to rescue her sister and he'll put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for ages 16 and up.</description>

While her life, and those of who she loves, hangs in the balance, she must endeavour to embrace her new nature and assist in identifying the hidden threat before it succeeds in its dark purpose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Urban Fantasy filled with moon-praising, flat-dwelling vampires, chic corporate werewolves, bar-tending warlocks, ravenous demons and much, much more. &lt;br&gt;Step inside…</description>

  <description>When her home is attacked by murderous vampires, 17-year-old Alexa is forced to leave her mother for dead in order to save her sister. She soon learns that she is the last known member of an elite race of supernatural Warriors, and is thrust into a world full of vampires and werewolves who all seem to regard her as some sort of savior. Meanwhile, Alexa battles a monster within herself that seeks to gain control; a monster that seeks blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hidden city she finds herself in appears perfect, but Alexa's instincts tell her that all is not right within its walls. When she is asked to attend a school of fighters, whose exams consist of gladiator-style competitions, she must decide who she can trust among the smiling faces. And, when she meets Kayden, a vampire she feels undeniably drawn to, she must decide if she can trust herself.</description>

  <description>Everyone dreams of that first kiss. Of that magic moment when your lips finally meet those of that special person you’ve waited your whole life for. A little awkward, a little scary, a little hot and every bit amazing. We speculate that the whole world will shake and time will just stop. No one, however, ever imagines that kiss to bring Death himself knocking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen year old Mercy Moore's life just got more complicated. The kiss that originally could have meant she would finally have a boyfriend now was the kiss that could have very nearly ended his life. A small detail her mother conveniently never told her will take her life for an abrupt u-turn. Dating, no love, was now completely and utterly impossible. And the boy well, that boy would never be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life, however cruel, goes on. Far too soon for her taste, Mercy finds herself at a senior party with the elite students of her school and her best friend. And of all things, playing a stupid game that could very well mean the death of someone in that small room. If it were not for her best friend, the hottest guys in school, and a small need to fit in, she may have been able to escape the disaster that was to come. Her worst nightmare, her personal curse, her very life, only gets dangerously worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a young adult paranormal romance novel.</description>

His instincts are proven correct on the night he is awakened by a voice calling to him from outside his window. As he sleepily peers into his yard, his eyes slowly focus on a woman who says she is there to take him to Eden. Aiden is about to fulfill the life purpose he never knew he had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is in Eden, a land on the brink of war, where Aiden will finally learn to trust himself and those around him.

Betrothed to a man she has no intention of marrying, Elisa is caught between the need to prove herself and her desire for true happiness. And now that she has met Aiden, she is more confused than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this action-packed fantasy tale, romance, adventure, and intrigue surround Aiden as he learns just what he is capable of when he discovers confidence and courage.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Her feet are already bleeding - if you like feet..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are places in the world where darkness rules, where it's unwise to walk. Sunshine knew that. But there hadn't been any trouble out at the lake for years, and she needed a place to be alone for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, she wasn't alone. She never heard them coming. Of course you don't, when they're vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They took her clothes and sneakers. They dressed her in a long red gown. And they shackled her to the wall of an abandoned mansion - within easy reach of a figure stirring in the moonlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows that he is a vampire. She knows that she's to be his dinner, and that when he is finished with her, she will be dead. Yet, as dawn breaks, she finds that he has not attempted to harm her. And now it is he who needs her to help him survive the day...</description>

  <description>An acclaimed bestseller and international sensation, Patrick Suskind's classic novel provokes a terrifying examination of what happens when one man's indulgence in his greatest passion—his sense of smell—leads to murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the slums of eighteenth-century France, the infant Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is born with one sublime gift-an absolute sense of smell.  As a boy, he lives to decipher the odors of Paris, and apprentices himself to a prominent perfumer who teaches him the ancient art of mixing precious oils and herbs.  But Grenouille's genius is such that he is not satisfied to stop there, and he becomes obsessed with capturing the smells of objects such as brass doorknobs and frest-cut wood.  Then one day he catches a hint of a scent that will drive him on an ever-more-terrifying quest to create the "ultimate perfume"—the scent of a beautiful young virgin.  Told with dazzling narrative brillance, &lt;strong&gt;Perfume&lt;/strong&gt; is a hauntingly powerful tale of murder and sensual depravity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Translated from the German by John E. Woods.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The muscular dog appears out of nowhere, like a mythological creature from the dark side, making a beeline for Pippin. Amy freezes, pulling the tiny Yorkie behind her, then screams as the dog opens its huge jaws and clamps them around Pippin. A yelp, then all is quiet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Amy Adamson thinks her life can’t get any worse…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six months ago, Amy Adamson felt like she had it all, until overnight, everything changed. Everyone said Eric was bad news, but surely he would change for her… wouldn’t he? His constant partyin, her fear of losing him if she didn’t keep up, led to her losing her job, he apartment, and now, it seems, her whole life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A surprise visit to the apartment to collect her things finds Eric in bed with her roommate. Who’s also stolen her Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser. Bitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Amy wants is her old life back, but with no job offers, and no money, she’s back in her parents’ suburban house, squeezing into jeans that are rapidly becoming too small, and cursing an unexpected case of teenage acne thanks to the loss of her Biore. Who the hell has acne at twenty six anyway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only people her age left in town are the losers, or the ones who married their childhood sweethearts, taking every opportunity to show off their “adorable home” and 2.4 children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when she thinks it can’t get any worse, she’s walking their pet Yorkie by the beach when it’s attached by a large dog that has escaped the ramshackle home of a reclusive woman known only as Mrs. Warner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mrs. Warner isnt’ home. Her grandson, William, is. A screenwriter, he’s funny, warm, and has a smile that makes Amy tingle in places she’s forgotten about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life starts looking up thanks to a date with William and Biore Fighting Ice Cleanser. Until Amy opens the wrong door to discover a dead body in the guest room. Is William truly the nice guy he seems? Can the Biore create the miracle she needs? Will Amy, in short, find that luck might finally be on her side?</description>

  <description>Where do you go when nowhere is safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen years after a deadly virus wiped out most of Earth's population, the world is a perilous place. Eighteen-year-old Eve has never been beyond the heavily guarded perimeter of her school, where she and two hundred other orphaned girls have been promised a future as the teachers and artists of the New America. But the night before graduation, Eve learns the shocking truth about her school's real purpose and the horrifying fate that awaits her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing the only home she's ever known, Eve sets off on a long, treacherous journey, searching for a place she can survive. Along the way she encounters Arden, her former rival from school, and Caleb, a rough, rebellious boy living in the wild. Separated from men her whole life, Eve has been taught to fear them, but Caleb slowly wins her trust... and her heart. He promises to protect her, but when soldiers begin hunting them, Eve must choose between true love and her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this epic new series, Anna Carey imagines a future that is both beautiful and terrifying.</description>

  <description>Kate, the daughter of a lawyer and marine biologist, has just moved to a small beach town in Florida. She’s forced to start over in the middle of the summer, but is used to it by now, since she’s moved around her entire life. When Kate meets Rico and Adriana on her second day at the beach house, everything changes. Kate is introduced to the world of Light and Darkness, and is thrown into the middle of it when a mysterious being attacks her one night. As Kate’s nights continue to get weirder, her friendship with Rico and Adriana grows stronger, and for the first time Kate has real friends. When Rico sits Kate down to tell her what is really happening to her, things start to click for Kate, and she is forced to make a decision to quit or fight for her body and soul.</description>

  <description>Headstrong and determined, Hannah always knew that she would become the Guardian. She was the keeper and the protector of all supernatural beings. What she didn't expect was that it would mean she would have to endure the agonising death of her mother first hand as their supernatural connection brings her to her knees, or that it would mean that she could never be with the man she loved.&lt;br&gt;Blond haired, blue eyed Gabriel was her handsome childhood friend, but would circumstances prevent her from ever being able to explore her true feelings for him?&lt;br&gt;Jesse, the dark alluring but incorrigible vampire would give anything to be with her, but as the guardian Hannah is forbidden to fall in love with the supernatural.&lt;br&gt;With her life in turmoil over her conflicting emotions about Gabriel and Jesse and her frustration at being unable to exact revenge for her mother’s horrific death, Hannah flees her life in an attempt to start over. But can we ever really escape from ourselves? &lt;br&gt;There is no escaping destiny no matter how hard she might try and Hannah must learn to reconcile her commitment to her family with her responsibility as the Guardian and her duty to her heart.</description>

  <description>CLARITY MILLER always thought of her life as semi-normal. She had friends that would do anything for her, a boyfriend that was madly in love with her, and a roof over her head that she shared with her aunt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	Everything seemed to be falling into place. That is, until the day she met Sam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	When Sam informs her that he’s her guardian angel and that she has been given the gifts of a Seer, her life starts spiraling out of control. She wants nothing to do with the spiritual realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	All she wants is to have a normal life as a teenager, but when a tragedy occurs that causes the whole town of Garlandton to fall to its knees she realizes that she has a very important decision to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should she embrace the life of a Seer?&lt;br&gt;Only time will tell . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A woman fated to die. A vision that could save her ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicolas Crystan, struggling to cope with his traumatic past, shuffles through life, keeping mostly to himself ... until he has a disturbing daydream of a woman's death. At first he tries to forget it, but when real life mimics the daydream, he realises it was no ordinary fantasy—it was a vision of the future. To save a life, he must act fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Juliet Maystone escapes death, defying fate, she becomes 'displaced' in this world. All she wants is to return to her bustling day-to-day routine, successfully running her own business, but as hard as she tries, she can't ignore that things have changed for her. She has to face up to the fact that being 'displaced' comes with an unexpected ability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Lansin Island, a quaint place with a dark history of its own, Nicolas and Juliet must learn to use their newfound abilities and work together to unravel a mystery more connected to Nicolas than he could ever have imagined ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Death Displaced&lt;/strong&gt; is the first book in a paranormal suspense/contemporary fantasy series with light romance.</description>

  <description>Sweet tea, corn bread, and soup beans—everyday fare for eight-year-old Alix French, the precocious darling of a respected southern family. But nothing was ordinary about the day she met ten-year-old Nick Anderson, a boy from the wrong side of town. Armed with only a tin of bee balm and steely determination, Alix treats the raw evidence of a recent beating that mars his back, an act that changes both of their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through childhood disasters and teenage woes they cling together as friendship turns to love. The future looks rosy until the fateful night when Frank Anderson, Nick's abusive father, is shot to death in his filthy trailer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Nick is gone—leaving Alix alone, confused and pregnant. For the next fifteen years she wrestles with the pain of Nick's abandonment, a bad marriage, her family and friends. But finally, she's starting to get her life back together. Her divorce is almost final, her business is booming, and she's content if not happy—until the day she looks up and sees Nick standing across the counter. He's back…and he's not alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again Alix is plunged into turmoil and pain as Nick tries to win her love, something she resists with all her strength. Only one thing might break the protective wall she's built around her emotions—the truth about Frank Anderson's death. But when that truth comes out and those walls crumble, neither Alix nor Nick is prepared for the emotional explosion that could destroy as well as heal.</description>

See &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16067864-the-binding"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two nights after her eighteenth birthday, Lily is attacked while out jogging, but is saved by Tharin Lunar, a Sidhe prince. When she discovers that her attacker is her own brother, Lucas, who disappeared four years ago, Lily refuses to believe that her brother would truly hurt her and becomes determined to find Lucas and bring him home. Lily finds that Lucas’ disappearance is somehow tied to Tharin; so when he informs her that she is his betrothed and must return with him to Velesi, fulfill a treaty between their families and unite the two strongest clans through their marriage, Lily agrees. However, she’s not going to Velesi for a wedding, but to bring home her only family, Lucas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On their journey to the borders of Velesi, the realm of the Thirteen Clans, they’re pursued by a Sidhe assassin group call the Ange, meet with an ogre crime lord that ends badly, deal with a sleazy troll motel manager, and when they discover that there’s a bounty on their heads, they must keep one step ahead of every assassin, bounty hunter and low-life criminal in Velesi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protecting Lily has become the biggest challenge of Tharin’s life. Lucky for him he has help in the form of his twin brother, Tolan, Lily’s best friend Julia and his three bodyguard cousins.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Never tease anything that wants to eat you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is April Tate and my blood is the new gold. Vampires and hybrids have overrun my world, once vibrant with life, but now a graveyard of death shrouded in shadows. I fight to survive; I fight for my mother and brother. The journey is full of turns that I am quite unprepared for. And I'm just hoping to make it to the next Vegas sunrise..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a post-apocalyptic world, a viral epidemic has wiped out most of the earth’s population, leaving behind few humans but untold numbers of mutated vampires. April is a seventeen-year-old girl who lives in the remains of Las Vegas one year after the outbreak. She has become a ferocious vampire killer and after her family is abducted, she goes searching for them. What she finds is a new breed of vampire, unlike any she has seen before. Unsure of whom she can trust, she discovers that her view of the world is not as black and white as she once thought, and she's willing to bend the rules to rescue her family. But in trying to save them, she may only succeed in bringing her fragile world crashing down around her.</description>

  <description>When seventeen year-old Isis Martin is having trouble sleeping due to perturbing dreams of a horrific growling beast, she decides to confront her fear. But what Isis discovers is something other than a menacing entity. The human-like creature offers Isis assurance that he is not a figment of her imagination. Unwilling to accept his avowal, Isis sets his words to contest by asking the entity to prove himself - a dare, he readily welcomes. It is in her dreams that Isis innocently stumbles upon the silent existence of the divine lineage of those that man has long forgotten. In a quaint town, deep in south Texas, this story leads Isis onto the path of impermissible love and captivating life-changing truths. Isis Martin's journey is sure to leave any reader ravenous for more.</description>

  <description>"Growing up in New York City, I thought I’d been exposed to the stranger parts of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then a night-club singer warned me that my father was going to disappear—and the next day he did, leaving my apartment trashed and full of poisonous dog-demons that nobody but my brother &amp;amp; I could see. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s not even the weird part. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s weird is the boy from my French class who first tried to drown me, and then saved my life. What’s weird is the Rose Queen, a real-life fairy queen with the hots for my dad and who wants to destroy the world. What’s extra-oh-my-god-seriously? weird are the dozens of fairy tale characters who are A) real and B) not as innocent as I remember. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I’m being chased by demons and wicked princes and racing to meet a deadline set a thousand years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to my life. My name is Kat Finnegan, I’m 17, and this is the part where the chaos begins."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;​</description>

  <description>“Being a werewolf is harder than it looks. Everyone thinks it’s just morph at the full moon, kill, morph back. That’s not true. It’s a lot harder than that. Especially if you are seventeen years old.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willow has the worst luck. First she has to deal with her narcissistic foster mother, Bella; then of course there’s her horrid little sister Ivy; not to mention the pack of werewolves that belong to Bella. Now, they have to move and start a new school - again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Willow thinks things can’t get any worse, Blake shows up from a council she never knew existed to name her leader of a pack she never knew existed. How was she supposed to teach a bunch of teenagers how to be wolves when she herself hated everything about her life?</description>

  <description>Some secrets should never be revealed... Brylee Branson begrudgingly made the excruciating move with her family from the warm sandy beaches of California to small town living in New Jersey. As if she wasn't miserable enough, they've moved into a creepy old house that everyone in the area claims is haunted. Brylee dismisses the idea of ghosts and hauntings, until she begins to see and hear things that can't be explained... Brylee has no choice but to seek the help of new friends to unlock the secrets of this place she now calls home. But some secrets should never be revealed. Can the teens find a way to release the spirits imprisoned within the walls? Or will the curse claim them, too?</description>

  <description>New Adult / Contemporary Romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rose tagged along with her big sister to a baby shower the last thing she expected was to meet a guy. But this wasn’t just any guy. This was the exciting, sexy as sin, way out of her league black sheep of his family--Vincent Moreno. Even more surprising, this heart-stopping bad boy seemed interested in &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fate&lt;/em&gt; always had a way of interfering in Vince’s best-laid plans. His forced attendance to his annoyingly perfect cousin’s baby shower was no different. He was sure to be bored out of his skull, but instead, he met sweet little Rosie Zendejas.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What begins as a unlikely friendship between two very different people turns into one of the most intense and passionate relationships that neither ever saw coming. But just like it had so many times in Vince’s troubled past, &lt;em&gt;Fate&lt;/em&gt; steps in once again, threatening  to take away the one thing he can’t seem to even breathe without now—Rose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mature YA - New Adult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fate is a Moreno Brothers spinoff series.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Michelle Cross is an average, seventeen year old girl growing up in a small town in New Jersey. Up until her senior year, her life has consisted of a rather unglamorous existence. Her closet friend Cami has been by her side since kindergarten, she has a loving if somewhat absente father, and a mother who is unique to say the least. Michelle’s mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was twelve years old, and ever since then she has had delusions of angels and demons battling over her only child. Michelle accepts her mother’s delusions as schizophrenic ramblings, until a handsome new boy finds her at school. Little by little Michelle’s world is turned upside down. The new boy claims to be the Archangel Gabriel cast from heaven, her best friend falls for the Antichrist, and come to find out Michelle’s mother has seen it coming all along. So instead of being consumed with prom and graduation, Michelle finds herself battling the evils of Hell in her small town. The four horsemen of the apocalypses have descended on her high school and with the help of Gabriel, her very own angel; she must stop the events leading to the apocalypse. What surprises Michelle even more than her role in saving humanity is the love that develops between Gabriel and herself. Can their love bridge the world between heaven and earth? Can Michelle stop the powers of Hell in time? Michelle and Gabriel find themselves the pawns in a very dangerous game between an ancient power with a mysterious message and Satan himself.</description>

  <description>Millions have already died, and thousands more are perishing daily. As a last ditch effort to preserve the human race, the government implements Project ELE.  With the earth heating at rapid speeds, all remaining survivors are forced to turn to F.E.M.A. shelters to wait out ELE's wrath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Willow Mosby's life, as she knows it, ends the moment she walks through the shelter's door. Willow has to quickly adapt to the new challenges that shelter life demands, the least of which includes making new friends and working a full time job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon after making an interesting discovery, Willow and her friends start exhibiting strange abilities. Seeking answers, they embark on a mission to find out what these new abilities mean and whether they are a gift or a curse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new adventure can send her world crashing down around her. The question is: Can Willow survive the fall?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***We've heard your reviews and have since corrected all of the errors we could find that were mentioned in the reviews.

  <description>Girl gone wild…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;College is supposed to be a time of discovery, but Danielle Vaughn never imaged it would be like this: heightened senses, supernatural powers, and a sudden craving for human blood. Dani is a demi-vamp, the daughter of a human psychic and a vampire noble, a living secret kept hidden for twenty-one years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dani’s heritage manifests itself, her thirst for blood is matched only by her hunger for Chase Diedrick. But as the son of the Vampire Council’s most powerful ruling family, Chase is already promised to another. Dani saw Council politics destroy her mother’s life; she won’t let the same thing happen to her. Besides, there’s no shortage of men who are eager to satisfy her every need, including the alluring vampire Kayden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Dani also has no shortage of enemies. Her heightened powers of telepathy and telekinesis attract the attention of a rogue vamp who preys on gifted vampires, absorbing their skills along with their lifeblood. Now, Dani must seek the Council’s help to quickly master her new vampire life…or risk losing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is  a full length novel &lt;br&gt;Warning: Adult Content</description>

  <description>Orphaned at thirteen, Avery Maye spent most of her life keeping her head down and blending into the shadows, trying to survive in a world bent on self-destruction through warfare and a never-ending quest for power. Unable to trust any but herself, her only friend was an apparition named Alec.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, she fell asleep in the home she’d always known, only to wake in a new world, galaxies away. She soon discovered that her imaginary friend, Alec, was not an apparition at all, but very much real, as were the creatures from her best dreams and the monsters from her worst nightmares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overnight, she gains everything she ever wanted and more: a new home, new friends, and powers beyond her imagination. On a new path to self-discovery, while learning lessons in love and loss, Avery is finally given the opportunity to do more than simply survive. She can finally start living.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in every paradise lurks a snake. Her newfound peace is rattled by the arrival of a pair of mysterious visitors from the world she has been fighting to forget. Will they bring the fate of Earth down on her new refuge?</description>

  <description>Two secrets. One bet. Who will break first?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor Caldwell can't decide if she wants to kiss her new college roommate or punch him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the one hand, Hunter Zaccadelli is a handsome blue-eyed bundle of charm. On the other, he's a tattooed, guitar-playing bad boy. Maybe that's why Taylor's afraid of falling in love with him, or anyone else. She doesn't want to get burned, so she needs him gone before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter himself has been burned before, but Taylor's sexy laugh and refusal to let him get away with anything make her irresistible. Determined not to be kicked out of her life without a fight, Hunter proposes a bet: if she can convince him she either truly loves or hates him, he'll leave the apartment;and leave her alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the man behind Taylor's fear of giving up her heart resurfaces, she has to decide: trust Hunter with her greatest secret, or do everything in her power to win that bet and drive him away forever.</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a typical love story. This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. It’s intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesn’t happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and develops—with hurt, sacrifice, and heartache—over the span of a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When she’s a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the club—but that’s where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himself—a man worthy of love—and Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he can’t live without.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Eva and Deuce’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t easy. &lt;br&gt;Nothing worth doing ever is.&lt;br&gt;And love is worth everything.</description>

  <description>Last year as college freshman, narrator Cal was infected by  exotic goth Morgan with a parasite that caused following girlfriends to become vampire-like ghouls he calls parasite-positives "Peeps". A carrier without symptoms, he hunts his progeny for the centuries old bureaucratic Night Watch. But victims are showing more sanity, pretty human Lacey is pushing his buttons, and her apartment building basement houses fierce hordes of ravening rats, red-eyed cats, and monstrous worms that threaten all. Morgan has the secret to a centuries-old conspiracy and upcoming battle to save the human race.</description>

  <description>Eva’s life is not her own. She is a creation, an abomination—an echo. Made by the Weavers as a copy of someone else, she is expected to replace a girl named Amarra, her “other”, if she ever died. Eva studies what Amarra does, what she eats, what it’s like to kiss her boyfriend, Ray. So when Amarra is killed in a car crash, Eva should be ready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fifteen years of studying never prepared her for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she must abandon everything she’s ever known—the guardians who raised her, the boy she’s forbidden to love—to move to India and convince the world that Amarra is still alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Eva finds is a grief-stricken family; parents unsure how to handle this echo they thought they wanted; and Ray, who knew every detail, every contour of Amarra. And when Eva is unexpectedly dealt a fatal blow that will change her existence forever, she is forced to choose: Stay and live out her years as a copy or leave and risk it all for the freedom to be an original. To be Eva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From debut novelist Sangu Mandanna comes the dazzling story of a girl who was always told what she had to be—until she found the strength to decide for herself.</description>

  <description>Fierce, seductive mermaid Syrenka falls in love with Ezra, a young naturalist. When she abandons her life underwater for a chance at happiness on land, she is unaware that this decision comes with horrific and deadly consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost one hundred forty years later, seventeen-year-old Hester meets a mysterious stranger named Ezra and feels overwhelmingly, inexplicably drawn to him. For generations, love has resulted in death for the women in her family. Is it an undiagnosed genetic defect . . . or a curse? With Ezra’s help, Hester investigates her family’s strange, sad history. The answers she seeks are waiting in the graveyard, the crypt, and at the bottom of the ocean—but powerful forces will do anything to keep her from uncovering her connection to Syrenka and to the tragedy of so long ago.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Cosmically fast-paced and wildly imaginative, this debut novel is a perfect potion of magic and suspense&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once a city of enormous wealth and culture, Prague was home to emperors, alchemists, astronomers, and, as it’s whispered, hell portals. When music student Sarah Weston lands a summer job at Prague Castle cataloging Beethoven’s manuscripts, she has no idea how dangerous her life is about to become. &lt;em&gt;Prague is a threshold, &lt;/em&gt;Sarah is warned, &lt;em&gt;and it is steeped in blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;      Soon after Sarah arrives, strange things begin to happen. She learns that her mentor, who was working at the castle, may not have committed suicide after all. Could his cryptic notes be warnings? As Sarah parses his clues about Beethoven’s “Immortal Beloved,” she manages to get arrested, to have tantric sex in a public fountain, and to discover a time-warping drug. She also catches the attention of a four-hundred-year-old dwarf, the handsome Prince Max, and a powerful U.S. senator with secrets she will do anything to hide.&lt;br&gt;      &lt;em&gt;City of Dark Magic &lt;/em&gt;could be called a rom-com paranormal suspense novel—or it could simply be called one of the most entertaining novels of the year.</description>

  <description>For seventeen-year-old Janie, getting sucked into other people's dreams is getting old. Especially the falling dreams, the naked-but-nobody-notices dreams, and the sex-crazed dreams. Janie's seen enough fantasy booty to last her a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;She can't tell anybody about what she does they'd never believe her, or worse, they'd think she's a freak. So Janie lives on the fringe, cursed with an ability she doesn't want and can’t control.&lt;br&gt;Then she falls into a gruesome nightmare, one that chills her to the bone. For the first time, Janie is more than a witness to someone else's twisted psyche. She is a participant.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Blood doesn't lie...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sydney is an alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of human and vampires. They protect vampire secrets - and human lives. When Sydney is torn from her bed in the middle of the night, at first she thinks she's still being punished for her complicated alliance with dhampir Rose Hathaway. But what unfolds is far worse. Jill Dragomir - the sister of Moroi Queen Lissa Dragomir - is in mortal danger, and the Moroi must send her into hiding. To avoid a civil war, Sydney is called upon to act as Jill's guardian and protector, posing as her roommate in the last place anyone would think to look for vampire royalty - a human boarding school in Palm Springs, California.

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Kyra has grown up in an isolated community without questioning the fact that her father has three wives and she has twenty brothers and sisters, with two more on the way. That is, without questioning them much---if you don’t count her secret visits to the Mobile Library on Wheels to read forbidden books, or her meetings with Joshua, the boy she hopes to choose for herself instead of having a man chosen for her. &lt;p&gt;But when the Prophet decrees that she must marry her sixty-year-old uncle---who already has six wives---Kyra must make a desperate choice in the face of violence and her own fears of losing her family forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this Newbery Honor-winning novel, Gary D. Schmidt offers an unforgettable antihero.&lt;em&gt; The Wednesday Wars &lt;/em&gt;is a wonderfully witty and compelling story about a teenage boy’s mishaps and adventures over the course of the 1967–68 school year in Long Island, New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Holling Hoodhood, a seventh-grader at Camillo Junior High, who must spend Wednesday afternoons with his teacher, Mrs. Baker, while the rest of the class has religious instruction. Mrs. Baker doesn’t like Holling—he’s sure of it. Why else would she make him read the plays of William Shakespeare outside class? But everyone has bigger things to worry about, like Vietnam. His father wants Holling and his sister to be on their best behavior: the success of his business depends on it. But how can Holling stay out of trouble when he has so much to contend with? A bully demanding cream puffs; angry rats; and a baseball hero signing autographs the very same night Holling has to appear in a play in yellow tights! As fate sneaks up on him again and again, Holling finds Motivation—the Big M—in the most unexpected places and musters up the courage to embrace his destiny, in spite of himself.</description>

  <description>It is the twilight of mankind. Depleted by generations of war with a dark race, the human kingdoms and their ancient alliance stand on the brink of extinction. The outlands are soaked with the blood of the fallen. The midlands are rotting with decadence and despair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elfkind, estranged by past crimes, watches and waits for nature to run its course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then the two collide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ayden's life has long been guided by two emotions: love for his sister, and hatred of all things human. When he's captured in battle, he must for his sister's sake swallow his pride and endure slavery in the service of a human prince, Freyrik Farr.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freyrik's always known elves to be beautiful and dangerous, but never has one affected him as deeply as Ayden. Can his life of service to his people leave room for this attraction? Dancing on a dagger's edge between duty and high treason, Freyrik discovers that some choices can change a life, and some an entire world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between prejudice, politics, pride, and survival, Ayden and Freyrik must carve a new path, no matter how daunting. For nothing less than the fate of both their peoples rests on the power of their perseverance and their love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This edition is a re-release of the same novel first published in 2010 by Guiltless Pleasure Publishing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title is #1 of the Song of the Fallen series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Warning, this title contains the following sensitive themes: explicit violence"</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER • &lt;strong&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE • &lt;/strong&gt;Hailed as the top nonfiction book of the year by &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine • Winner of the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Prize for biography and the Indies Choice Adult Nonfiction Book of the Year award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in &lt;em&gt;Seabiscuit&lt;/em&gt;. Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Extraordinarily moving . . . a powerfully drawn survival epic.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “[A] one-in-a-billion story . . . designed to wrench from self-respecting critics all the blurby adjectives we normally try to avoid: It is amazing, unforgettable, gripping, harrowing, chilling, and inspiring.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—New York&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Staggering . . . mesmerizing . . . Hillenbrand’s writing is so ferociously cinematic, the events she describes so incredible, you don’t dare take your eyes off the page.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “A meticulous, soaring and beautifully written account of an extraordinary life.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Ambitious and powerful . . . a startling narrative and an inspirational book.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Marvelous . . . &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; is wonderful twice over, for the tale it tells and for the way it’s told. . . . It manages maximum velocity with no loss of subtlety.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Moving and, yes, inspirational . . . [Laura] Hillenbrand’s unforgettable book . . . deserve[s] pride of place alongside the best works of literature that chart the complications and the hard-won triumphs of so-called ordinary Americans and their extraordinary time.”&lt;strong&gt;—Maureen Corrigan, &lt;em&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Hillenbrand . . . tells [this] story with cool elegance but at a thrilling sprinter’s pace.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; is too much book to hope for: a hellride of a story in the grip of the one writer who can handle it.”&lt;strong&gt;—Christopher McDougall, author of &lt;em&gt;Born to Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>It all begins with a stupid question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a Global Vagabond?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, but 18-year-old Bria Sandoval wants to be. In a quest for independence, her neglected art, and no-strings-attached hookups, she signs up for a guided tour of Central America—the wrong one. Middle-aged tourists with fanny packs are hardly the key to self-rediscovery. When Bria meets Rowan, devoted backpacker and dive instructor, and his outspokenly humanitarian sister Starling, she seizes the chance to ditch her group and join them off the beaten path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bria's a good girl trying to go bad. Rowan's a bad boy trying to stay good. As they travel across a panorama of Mayan villages, remote Belizean islands, and hostels plagued with jungle beasties, they discover what they've got in common: both seek to leave behind the old versions of themselves. And the secret to escaping the past, Rowan’s found, is to keep moving forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bria comes to realize she can't run forever, no matter what Rowan says. If she ever wants the courage to fall for someone worthwhile, she has to start looking back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirsten Hubbard lends her artistry to this ultimate backpacker novel, weaving her drawings into the text. Her career as a travel writer and her experiences as a real-life vagabond backpacking Central America are deeply seeded in this inspiring story.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;What kind of woman becomes the wife of two kings, and the mother of two more?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saxon England, 1002. Not only is Æthelred a failure as King, but his young bride, Emma of Normandy, soon discovers he is even worse as a husband. When the Danish Vikings, led by Swein Forkbeard and his son, Cnut, cause a maelstrom of chaos, Emma, as Queen, must take control if the Kingdom-and her crown-are to be salvaged. Smarter than history remembers, and stronger than the foreign invaders who threaten England's shores, Emma risks everything on a gamble that could either fulfill her ambitions and dreams or destroy her completely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emma, the Queen of Saxon England, comes to life through the exquisite writing of Helen Hollick, who shows in this epic tale how one of the most compelling and vivid heroines in English history stood tall through a turbulent fifty-year reign of proud determination, tragic despair, and triumph over treachery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Set against the starkly beautiful landscape of Cornwall, PENMARRIC is the totally enthralling saga of a family divided against itself. At the center of the novel is the great mansion called Penmarric. It is to Penmarric that Mark Castallack, a proud, strange, and sensitive man, brings his bride Janna--the first act in a tempestuous drama that was to span three generations....</description>

  <description>Nothing ever happens in Norway. But at least Ellie knows what to expect when she visits her grandmother: a tranquil fishing village and long, slow summer days. And maybe she’ll finally get out from under the shadow of her way-too-perfect big brother, Graham, while she’s there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Ellie doesn’t anticipate is Graham’s infuriating best friend, Tuck, tagging along for the trip. Nor did she imagine boys going missing amid rumors of impossible kidnappings. Least of all does she expect something powerful and ancient to awaken in her and that strange whispers would urge Ellie to claim her place among mythological warriors. Instead of peace and quiet, there’s suddenly a lot for a girl from L.A. to handle on a summer sojourn in Norway! And when Graham vanishes, it’s up to Ellie—and the ever-sarcastic, if undeniably alluring Tuck—to uncover the truth about all the disappearances and thwart the nefarious plan behind them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deadly legends, hidden identities, and tentative romance swirl together in one girl’s unexpectedly-epic coming of age.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For centuries they’ve lived in secret among northern England’s green and misted hills. Creatures of extraordinary beauty, power, and sensuality, they possess the ability to shape-shift from human to dragon and back again. Now their secret—and their survival—is threatened by a temptation that will break every boundary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dubbed the Smoke Thief, a daring jewel thief is confounding the London police. His wealthy victims claim the master burglar can walk through walls and vanish into thin air. But Christoff, the charismatic Marquess of Langford, knows the truth: the thief is no ordinary human but a "runner" who's fled Darkfrith without permission. As Alpha leader of the &lt;em&gt;drákon&lt;/em&gt;, it's Kit's duty to capture the fugitive before the secrets of the tribe are revealed to mortals. But not even Kit suspects that the Smoke Thief could be a woman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarissa Rue Hawthorne knew her dangerous exploits would attract the attention of the &lt;em&gt;drákon&lt;/em&gt;. But she didn't expect Christoff himself to come to London, dangling the tribe's most valuable jewel—the Langford Diamond—as bait. For as long as she could remember, Rue had lived the life of a halfling—half &lt;em&gt;drákon&lt;/em&gt;, half mortal—and an outcast in both worlds. She'd always loved the handsome and willful Kit from the only place it was safe: from afar. But now she was no longer the shy, timid girl she'd once been. She was the first woman capable of making the Turn in four generations. So why did she still feel the same dizzying sense of vulnerability whenever he was near?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment he saw her, Kit knew that the alluring and powerful beauty was every bit his Alpha equal and destined to be his bride. And by the harsh laws of the &lt;em&gt;drákon&lt;/em&gt;, Rue knew that she was the property of the marquess. But they will risk banishment and worse for a chance at something greater. For now Rue is his prisoner, the diamond has disappeared, and she's made the kind of dangerous proposition a man like Kit cannot resist.</description>

  <description>Nalena Maxwell has been branded ‘The Waste’ at her new school, due to her mom's obsessive paper hoarding. Nalena desperately wants something to change in her life, but when she receives a sign (and it's the wrong dang one) inviting her into a mysterious, ancient community, too much changes.  What she knew of her family, what she thought of her life and what she believed about her future, is no longer applicable.  Seventeen years worth of family skeletons come crashing into Nalena's life and it is the boy...the one that smiles at her like he wants to hear everything she'll ever say...that already knows her powerful secrets.  But it is only Nalena that can choose between protecting the life that is already crumbling beneath her feet and the one that might sacrifice everything she could ever have.</description>

  <description>While trying to save her brother from a witch’s fire four years ago, Greta was thrown in herself, falling through a portal to Mylena, a dangerous world where humans are the enemy and every ogre, ghoul, and goblin has a dark side that comes out with the eclipse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To survive, Greta has hidden her humanity and taken the job of bounty hunter—and she’s good at what she does. So good, she’s caught the attention of Mylena’s young goblin king, the darkly enticing Isaac, who invades her dreams and undermines her will to escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Greta’s not the only one looking to get out of Mylena. An ancient evil knows she’s the key to opening the portal, and with the next eclipse mere days away, every bloodthirsty creature in the realm is after her—including Isaac. If Greta fails, she and the lost boys of Mylena will die. If she succeeds, no world will be safe from what follows her back...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What if your life wasn’t your own?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liv comes out of a coma with no memory of her past and two distinct, warring voices inside her head. Nothing, not even her reflection, seems familiar. As she stumbles through her junior year, the voices get louder, insisting she please the popular group while simultaneously despising them. But when Liv starts hanging around with Spencer, whose own mysterious past also has him on the fringe, life feels complete for the first time in, well, as long as she can remember.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liv knows the details of the car accident that put her in the coma, but as the voices invade her dreams, and her dreams start feeling like memories, she and Spencer seek out answers. Yet the deeper they dig, the less things make sense. Can Liv rebuild the pieces of her broken past, when it means questioning not just who she is, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; she is?</description>

  <description>What would you do if you were born to be a predator? Would you fight your natural instincts or give in to your nature? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden is a soul eater closing in on her awakening. Her family has convinced her that soon she will have to take a life in order to save her own. It’s a decision Eden doesn’t want to deal with even as her hunger for souls grows stronger every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To complicate her impossible position, new guy in school Noah Valois’ determination to befriend her puts Eden in touch with a humanity she’s never known. Addicted to his company, his friendship and affection, she becomes more and more terrified that giving into her hunger will mean losing him forever…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;… But when she discovers that Noah is not what he seems, his betrayal forces her to face two choices. One will offer her revenge and the destruction of a boy she loved. The other may offer her a life of eternal redemption…</description>

But one tragic night shatters their friendship and their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ella used to be a rule-breaker with fiery attitude who wore her heart on her sleeve. But she left everything behind when she went to college and transformed into someone that follows the rules, keeps everything together, and hides all her problems. But now it's summer break and she has nowhere else to go but home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ella fears everything she worked so hard to bury might resurface, especially with Micha living right next door. If Micha tries to tempt the old her back, she knows that it will be hard to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micha is sexy, smart, confident, and can get under Ella’s skin like no one else can. He knows everything about her, including her darkest secrets. And he’s determined to bring his best friend, and the girl he loves back, no matter what it takes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(New Adult Contemporary)&lt;br&gt;*Mature Content** Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual situations and language.</description>

  <description>Camilla can set her watch by her hunky rocket-scientist neighbor who jogs past her window each day. She relishes each glimpse of his shirtless abs, and is dying to see more. But it's hard to connect with a man who doesn't seem to know she exists...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ivan feels at home in the lab, not in social situations. When he finally approaches his attractive neighbor, it's not for a date—he wants tutoring in how to behave at an important fundraiser. Ivan doesn't expect the chemistry between them to be quite so explosive, and is surprised when Cami actually accepts his proposal to embark on a series of "lessons."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cami soon discovers Ivan's schedule isn't the only thing he likes to be strict about—he needs to be charge in the bedroom as well. She's shocked at how much she comes to enjoy her submissive side, but wonders if a real relationship is in the equation...</description>

  <description>A groundbreaking work of science fiction, &lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants can choose -and change - their gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Embracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, &lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of Darkness&lt;/em&gt; stands as a landmark achievement in the annals of intellectual science fiction.</description>

  <description>The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, five Hugo Awards and five Nebula Awards, the renowned writer Ursula K. Le Guin has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves. Now, in The Birthday of the World, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity.</description>

  <description>Living paycheck to paycheck in Paris, American book translator Chloe Underwood would give anything for some excitement and passion--even a little danger. So when she's offered a lucrative weekend gig translating at a business conference in a remote chateau, she jumps at the chance to shake things up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then by chance Chloe discovers her employers are anything but the entrepreneurs they appear, and suddenly she knows far too much. Her clients are illegal arms dealers, and one of them is ordered to kill her. But instead, Bastien Toussaint drags Chloe away, and the next thing she knows she's on the run with the most terrifying and seductive man she's ever met. What were his motives--and would she live long enough to find out?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Love is the hardest limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm an Aries. We don't submit." "I'm a Leo. Wanna bet?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destiny Blake senses that her boredom with blond pretty boys is about to come to a flesh-tingling end. Since her first love left her for a more experienced Domme, she's honed her topping skills to a fine edge. Yet the idea of bottoming for the hard-bodied owner of her favorite BDSM club is an erotic challenge she can't resist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destiny isn't Johnny Delcorral's type. Tangling with her, even for one night, is a dangerous proposition for a man with good reason for needing his women submissive. But he suspects she's hiding a submissive streak under her dreadlocks and leather, and he hungers to make her obey-and curb her reckless spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle is on, both in the bedroom and out. Under Johnny's knowing hands, she is dismayed to discover she's enjoying submission more than she cares to admit. And Johnny finds himself relishing her defiance instead of curbing it-and fighting a growing unease with his inability to find her boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until one night he pushes one step too far-and comes hard up against the one boundary he never expected to find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: This book contains naked power struggles, sexually charged spankings, kink from chains to canes, an Upstairs sex club, a hot m/f/m menage, and absolutely everything the title promises.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It's 1920s New York City. It's flappers and Follies, jazz and gin. It's after the war but before the depression. And for certain group of bright young things it's the opportunity to party like never before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Evie O'Neill, it's escape. She's never fit in in small town Ohio and when she causes yet another scandal, she's shipped off to stay with an uncle in the big city. But far from being exile, this is exactly what she's always wanted: the chance to show how thoroughly modern and incredibly daring she can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But New York City isn't about just jazz babies and follies girls. It has a darker side. Young women are being murdered across the city. And these aren't crimes of passion. They're gruesome. They're planned. They bear a strange resemblance to an obscure group of tarot cards. And the New York City police can't solve them alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evie wasn't just escaping the stifling life of Ohio, she was running from the knowledge of what she could do. She has a secret. A mysterious power that could help catch the killer - if he doesn't catch her first.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;His powers - Inhuman...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His passion - Beyond immortal...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All her life, Ashlyn Darrow has been tormented by voices from the past. To end the nightmare, she has come to Budapest seeking help from men rumored to have supernatural abilities, not knowing she'll be swept into the arms of Maddox, their most dangerous member -- a man trapped in a hell of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither can resist the instant hunger than calms their torments... and ignites an irresistible passion. But every heated touch and burning kiss will edge them closer to destruction -- and a soul-shattering test of love...&lt;br&gt;Though they carry an eternal curse, the Lords of the Underworld are irresistibly seductive -- and unimaginably powerful...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Don’t miss this incredible new paranormal series from Gena Showalter!&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A SACRED OATH&lt;br&gt;A FALLEN ANGEL&lt;br&gt;A FORBIDDEN LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romance was not part of Nora Grey's plan. She's never been particularly attracted to the boys at her school, no matter how hard her best friend, Vee, pushes them at her. Not until Patch comes along. With his easy smile and eyes that seem to see inside her, Patch draws Nora to him against her better judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after a series of terrifying encounters, Nora's not sure whom to trust. Patch seems to be everywhere she is and seems to know more about her than her closest friends. She can't decide whether she should fall into his arms or run and hide. And when she tries to seek some answers, she finds herself near a truth that is way more unsettling than anything Patch makes her feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For she is right in the middle of an ancient battle between the immortal and those that have fallen - and, when it comes to choosing sides, the wrong choice will cost Nora her life.</description>

  <description>Paris, July 1942: Sarah, a ten year-old girl, is brutally arrested with her family by the French police in the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup, but not before she locks her younger brother in a cupboard in the family's apartment, thinking that she will be back within a few hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paris, May 2002: On Vel' d'Hiv's 60th anniversary, journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write an article about this black day in France's past. Through her contemporary investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connect her to Sarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl's ordeal, from that terrible term in the Vel d'Hiv', to the camps, and beyond. As she probes into Sarah's past, she begins to question her own place in France, and to reevaluate her marriage and her life.</description>

  <description>Recently fired and almost broke, thirty-year old Ellie decides to push all distractions aside and form a crash-or-burn plan to save herself and finally pursue her dreams. She gives herself one month to make the near-impossible happen, otherwise she has to leave New York City and move into her niece's toy room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The plan seems simple but becomes complicated by a nosey best friend, a difficult roommate, a dreamy stranger, and a really bad ring. As the month progresses, Ellie must confront the realization that by deciding to focus on herself, she may have become completely self-centered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she let her own ambitions, insecurities, and assumptions ruin her friendships and get in the way of a possible romance? Ruled by endless lists and fueled by several plates of pie, Ellie's comical thoughts and mishaps drive this story from the office to the coffee shop during a month that will leave her with a broken foot, a great pair of shoes, and a forever changed life.</description>

  <description>For the last four years, good girl Lane has regretted breaking up with Noel Falcon. She thought she was sensible when she told him his dreams of being a rock star would get him nowhere, but now that he's a rock god and her career is stagnant, she realizes just how wrong she was. When Noel hires the marketing company where Lane is an intern, she’s forced to see him again. If she wants to land her dream job as executive within the company, she has to win him over and secure his account. Too bad Noel is still pissed at her for breaking his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lane’s company flies her to a Black Falcon concert to gain Noel’s attention, emotions run high the moment she sees him and realizes she’s far from over him. But Noel’s countless trysts with groupies and his cocky attitude make Lane believe he isn’t the same guy she once loved—now he seems to only want her body. Then after Lane discloses she needs him to procure a job, Noel proves he’s a changed man by forcing her to go on the road with him in order to get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Lane reluctantly takes Noel up on his offer, she becomes willing to do whatever it takes to keep him satisfied, even if it means succumbing to his seductive ways. Lane soon finds deception is a dangerous game and she’s not the only one playing.</description>

  <description>It's been twelve years since Tru Bennett last saw Jake Wethers, her former best friend and boy she once loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Wethers, sexy, tattooed and deliciously bad lead singer, and brains behind The Mighty Storm, one of the biggest bands in the world, left Tru with a broken heart when he moved from England to America with his family when they were both fourteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent to interview Jake for her music column by the magazine she works for, they are both unprepared for the sparks that fly the instant they reconnect. Only, there’s a complication to their instant feelings for one another—Will, Tru’s boyfriend of two years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Jake makes Tru a job offer she can't refuse—travelling the world with him and his band. But taking the job means leaving Will behind, and being on the road with the band means spending an inordinate amount of time with Jake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Tru strong enough to resist the delectable bad boy who once held her heart so completely, or will she willingly risk it all for one night with the world's most notorious womanizer?</description>

  <description>It is a Dark Era, one when a lusty lass will do what she must to survive. Even if it means bartering flesh for a palmful of coins…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to watch her mother burned at the stake and separated from her siblings in the aftermath, Jessie Taskill is similarly gifted, ripe with a powerful magic that must stay hidden. Until one night when she's accused by a rival, and Jessie finds herself behind prison walls with a roguish priest unlike any man of the cloth she has known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality, Gregor Ramsay is as far from holy as the devil himself, but his promise of freedom in return for her services may be her salvation. Locked into a dubious agreement, Jessie resents his plan to have her seduce and ruin his lifelong enemy. But toying with Gregor’s lust for her is enjoyable, and she agrees to be his pawn while secretly intending to use him just as he is using her.</description>

  <description>The fifty contestants in the Miss Teen Dream pageant thought this was going to be a fun trip to the beach, where they could parade in their state-appropriate costumes and compete in front of the cameras. But sadly, their airplane had another idea, crashing on a desert island and leaving the survivors stranded with little food, little water, and practically no eyeliner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's a beauty queen to do? Continue to practice for the talent portion of the program - or wrestle snakes to the ground? Get a perfect tan - or learn to run wild? And what should happen when the sexy pirates show up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the heart of non-exfoliated darkness. Your tour guide? None other than Libba Bray, the hilarious, sensational, Printz Award-winning author of A Great and Terrible Beauty and Going Bovine. The result is a novel that will make you laugh, make you think, and make you never see beauty the same way again.</description>

  <description>Climbing to the top of the social ladder is hard—falling from it is even harder.  Regina Afton used to be a member of the &lt;em&gt;Fearsome Fivesome&lt;/em&gt;, an all-girl clique both feared and revered by the students at Hallowell High... until vicious rumors about her and her best friend's boyfriend start going around.  Now Regina's been "frozen out" and her ex-best friends are out for revenge.  If Regina was guilty, it would be one thing, but the rumors are far from the terrifying truth and the bullying is getting more intense by the day.  She takes solace in the company of Michael Hayden, a misfit with a tragic past who she herself used to bully.  Friendship doesn't come easily for these onetime enemies, and as Regina works hard to make amends for her past, she realizes Michael could be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than just a friend... if threats from the &lt;em&gt;Fearsome Foursome&lt;/em&gt; don't break them both first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tensions grow and the abuse worsens as the final days of senior year march toward an explosive conclusion in this dark new tale from the author of &lt;em&gt;Cracked Up To Be&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Even in Grundy, Alaska, its unusual to find a naked guy with a bear trap clamped to his ankle on your porch. But when said guy turns into a wolf, recent southern transplant Mo Wenstein has no difficulty identifying the problem. Her surly neighbor Cooper Graham,who has been openly critical of Mo's ability to adapt to life in Alaska, has trouble of his own. Werewolf trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Cooper, an Alpha in self-imposed exile from his dysfunctional pack, its love at first sniff when it comes to Mo. But Cooper has an even more pressing concern on his mind. Several people around Grundy have been the victims of wolf attacks, and since Cooper has no memory of what he gets up to while in werewolf form, hes worried that he might be the violent canine in question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a wolf cries wolf, it makes sense to listen, yet Mo is convinced that Cooper is not the culprit. Except if hes not responsible, then who is? And when a werewolf falls head over haunches in love with you, what are you supposed to do anyway? The rules of dating just got a whole lot more complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LENGTH&lt;br&gt;9 hrs and 12 mins</description>

  <description>Veronica Cason lives in a small apartment with no clear view of the sky. It’s uncertain which might crush her first: her debt or the buildings squeezed in so tight that they surround her like ominous sentinels. She can’t breathe in the city. Her success is a lie, and her debt is coming to collect her—unless someone else gets there first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a stranger offers her a job at a ranch, it feels like salvation, but it could also mean her death if his motives aren’t pure. Which door has the tiger behind it? The claustrophobia of the city or ranch life under an open sky?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: Big Sky is dark, literary erotica and is intended for a mature adult audience.</description>

Known as "The Wolf"; his very name strikes terror in the hearts of his enemies. But proud Jennifer will have nothing to do with the fierce English warrior who holds her captive, this handsome rogue who taunts her with his blazing arrogance. Boldly she challenges his will . . . until the night he takes her in his powerful embrace, awakening in her an irresistible hunger. And suddenly Jennifer finds herself ensnared in a bewildering web . . . a seductive, dangerous trap of pride, passion, loyalty, and overwhelming love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Maya Banks' beguiling new trilogy features three unforgettable brothers risking everything to save their clan and their legacy—and to surrender their hearts to love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ewan McCabe, the eldest, is a warrior determined to vanquish his enemy. Now, with the time ripe for battle, his men are ready and Ewan is poised to take back what is his—until a blue-eyed, raven-haired temptress is thrust upon him. Mairin may be the salvation of Ewan's clan, but for a man who dreams only of revenge, matters of the heart are strange territory to conquer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The illegitimate daughter of the king, Mairin possesses prized property that has made her a pawn—and wary of love. Her worst fears are realized when she is rescued from peril only to be forced into marriage by her charismatic and commanding savior, Ewan McCabe. But her attraction to her ruggedly powerful new husband makes her crave his surprisingly tender touch; her body comes alive under his sensual mastery. And as war draws near, Mairin's strength, spirit, and passion challenge Ewan to conquer his demons—and embrace a love that means more than revenge and land.</description>

  <description>Annabelle Walsh thought she had it all. She was the star of her swim team, had a loving family, a great boyfriend, and to top it off, she’d be starting at UCLA in the fall. One day, she’d be referred to as Dr. Annabelle Walsh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was living every girl’s dream – until her life was turned upside down. All starting with finding out that she's not just a human, but also a water spirit. Half-human, half-sprite to be exact. Although not just any sprite, Annabelle is prophesied to be the only one who can save both the sprites and mankind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a mix of current events, anecdotes from Greek mythology, tidbits of folklore, and Leigh’s own imagination, we join Annabelle in her journey to restore order beneath the sea. Each step of the way her mind, body, and soul are pushed to the limit begging the question, how much can one half-human, half-sprite take?</description>

  <description>Working at a Suicide Prevention Center in San Francisco, Lily Goodwill thinks she’s heard it all—then she gets a call from a man about to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. Something about the caller, maybe his yummy British accent or Lily’s ability to understand his crushing ennui, makes her break all the rules and rush to meet him. After all, she is a vampire and if she can’t talk him down she can glamour him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things don’t go according to plan. Her caller glows with blue fire and turns out to be a vampire-hating Djinn. Suddenly, for the first time in centuries he’s found something intriguing. Is Lily really a vampire with a conscience and an obsessive-compulsive disorder, involving Handi-wipes and Lysol, or is she just another bloodsucker? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add in another vampire, with a history of female lovers stretching over three centuries, who swears he’s reformed and declares his undying love for Lily. Stir in a mean pair of witches and a vicious warlock, who are staking vampires around the city and you have a recipe for riotous adventure of supernatural proportions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily Goodwill is a quick thinking, smart-talking vampire who’s still figuring out how she feels about dining al fresco in the City by the Bay.</description>

  <description>At Westish College, a small school on the shore of Lake Michigan, baseball star Henry Skrimshander seems destined for big league stardom. But when a routine throw goes disastrously off course, the fates of five people are upended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry’s fight against self-doubt threatens to ruin his future. College president Guert Affenlight, a longtime bachelor, has fallen unexpectedly and helplessly in love. Owen Dunne, Henry’s gay roommate and teammate, becomes caught up in a dangerous affair. Mike Schwartz, the Harpooners’ team captain and Henry’ best friend, realizes he has guided Henry’s career at the expense of his own. And Pella Affenlight, Guert’s daughter, returns to Westish after escaping an ill-fated marriage, determined to start a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the season counts down to its climactic final game, these five are forced to confront their deepest hopes, anxieties, and secrets. In the process they forge new bonds, and help one another find their true paths. Written with boundless intelligence and filled with the tenderness of youth, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Fielding&lt;/em&gt; is an expansive, warmhearted novel about ambition and its limits, about family and friendship and love, and about commitment—to oneself and to others.</description>

  <description>HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO?  &lt;p&gt; All Meg has ever wanted is to get away. Away from high school. Away from her backwater town. Away from her parents who seem determined to keep her imprisoned in their dead-end lives. But one crazy evening involving a dare and forbidden railroad tracks, she goes way too far...and almost doesn't make it back.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John made a choice to stay. To enforce the rules. To serve and protect. He has nothing but contempt for what he sees as childish rebellion, and he wants to teach Meg a lesson she won't soon forget. But Meg pushes him to the limit by questioning everything he learned at the police academy. And when he pushes back, demanding to know why she won't be tied down, they will drive each other to the edge -- and over....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths - until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of nonstop action, suspense, and romance, this novel is sure to move readers as much as it thrills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2011 Marie Lu (P)2011 Penguin Audio</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the end of the world. Six students have taken cover in Cortege High but shelter is little comfort when the dead outside won’t stop pounding on the doors. One bite is all it takes to kill a person and bring them back as a monstrous version of their former self. To Sloane Price, that doesn’t sound so bad. Six months ago, &lt;em&gt;her &lt;/em&gt;world collapsed and since then, she’s failed to find a reason to keep going. Now seems like the perfect time to give up. As Sloane eagerly waits for the barricades to fall, she’s forced to witness the apocalypse through the eyes of five people who actually &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to live. But as the days crawl by, the motivations for survival change in startling ways and soon the group’s fate is determined less and less by what’s happening outside and more and more by the unpredictable and violent bids for life—&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;death—inside. When everything is gone, what do &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;hold on to?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I'm dreaming of the boy in the tree. I tell him stories. About the Jellicoe School and the Townies and the Cadets from a school in Sydney. I tell him about the war between us for territory. And I tell him about Hannah, who lives in the unfinished house by the river. Hannah, who is too young to be hiding away from the world. Hannah, who found me on the Jellicoe Road six years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor is leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School. She has to keep the upper hand in the territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs - the enigmatic leader of the cadets, and someone she thought she would never see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now Hannah, the person Taylor had come to rely on, has disappeared. Taylor's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago. She needs to find out more, but this means confronting her own story, making sense of her strange, recurring dream, and finding her mother - who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moving, joyous and brilliantly compelling new novel from the best-selling, multi-award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Looking for Alibrandi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saving Francesca&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>At a freshman party she doesn't remember, Jess Jordan was almost raped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Almost. Very nearly. Not quite. Three years later, Jess has managed to make everyone believe she's better. Over it. Because she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Almost. Very nearly. Not quite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, until Jess proves she's back to normal activities, her parents won't discuss college. So, she lands a summer internship and strikes a deal with hockey jock, Gray Porter: He gets $8,000. She gets a fake boyfriend and a social life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jess has no idea Gray signed on for reasons other than money. She also never expects to fall in love. But Gray’s amazingly hot, holds her hand all the time, and makes her forget that he’s simply doing his job. It’s like having a real boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Almost. Very nearly. Not quite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gray Porter is hiding secrets of his own. About Jess Jordan. About why he’s driven to protect her, why he won't cash her checks, or deny her anything she asks.</description>

  <description>Lina is just like any other fifteen-year-old Lithuanian girl in 1941. She paints, she draws, she gets crushes on boys. Until one night when Soviet officers barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they've known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin's orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lina finds solace in her art, meticulously--and at great risk--documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father's prison camp to let him know they are still alive. It is a long and harrowing journey, spanning years and covering 6,500 miles, but it is through incredible strength, love, and hope that Lina ultimately survives. &lt;em&gt;Between Shades of Gray&lt;/em&gt; is a novel that will steal your breath and capture your heart.</description>

  <description>Anna and Abel couldn't be more different. They are both seventeen and in their last year of school, but while Anna lives in a nice old town house and comes from a well-to-do family, Abel, the school drug dealer, lives in a big, prisonlike tower block at the edge of town. Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It's a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his enemies begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she? Award-winning author Antonia Michaelis moves in a bold new direction with her latest novel: a dark, haunting, contemporary story that is part mystery, part romance, and part melodrama.</description>

  <description>Jocelyn Rhodes is a single mother with a demanding career and a long-neglected libido. Frustrated with the dating scene and way overdue for some satisfying sex, she takes a friend’s advice and hires Sabian, a deliciously sexy escort. He’s well worth the money, and the sheets haven’t even cooled off before she’s ready to call him again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more time she spends with him, the more she realizes she and Sabian have more in common than she thought. She’s a single mom, he’s a prostitute, and when it comes to dating, they’re both damaged goods. To most potential mates, Jocelyn and Sabian are in a category akin to dented soup cans, but if the two of them can look past each other’s respective dents, they just might find something they’ve both been missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even if they do find that something, how on earth can she make a relationship work with a man who sleeps with other women for a living?</description>

  <description>Eveline Armstrong is fiercely loved and protected by her powerful clan, but outsiders consider her “touched.” Beautiful, fey, with a level, intent gaze, she doesn’t speak. No one, not even her family, knows that she cannot hear. Content with her life of seclusion, Eveline has taught herself to read lips and allows the outside world to view her as daft. But when an arranged marriage into a rival clan makes Graeme Montgomery her husband, Eveline accepts her duty—unprepared for the delights to come. Graeme is a rugged warrior with a voice so deep and powerful that his new bride can hear it, and hands and kisses so tender and skilled that he stirs her deepest passions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Graeme is intrigued by the mysterious Eveline, whose silent lips are ripe with temptation and whose bright, intelligent eyes can see into his soul. As intimacy deepens, he learns her secret. But when clan rivalries and dark deeds threaten the wife he has only begun to cherish, the Scottish warrior will move heaven and earth to save the woman who has awakened his heart to the beautiful song of a rare and magical love.</description>

  <description>Fourteen year old Willa Burkett has been waiting her whole life to leave Hoosick Falls—a nowhere place that fails to hold even a single good memory.&lt;br&gt; But, when a series of vengeful incidents stir Willa’s mother Stella to impulsively pack-up and go, it is only to find themselves stranded in yet another ugly, near extinct town, only now, with a broken down car and no ready way out.&lt;br&gt; Unable to move on until an alternate plan shows itself, they accept a job working for Omega Pearl Bodie, proprietress of the Moonglow motel—a long forgotten, steadily decaying relic, where mostly nothing happens—except now, when everything does. &lt;br&gt;It is here in this place of desperate loneliness and restless boredom that Willa will have her world rocked to the core in ways she doesn't immediately comprehend.The craziness of the life she’s left behind all but eclipsed by the dark turn of the here and now, as Willa attempts to keep one step ahead of the ever-twisting whims of a mother prone to keeping secrets and telling lies, a murderous arsonist returned to the scene of his earlier crimes to dole out revenge one fiery victim at a time—and Jesse Truman.  A boy with indigo eyes that Omega Pearl has hired&lt;br&gt;as handyman at the Moonglow—who Willa longs to save—if only she understood what it is he needs saving from.</description>

  <description>Early one morning' after a sandstorm had ripped through north Texas' I wandered into Mr. Tilly's circus. I wore a black suit and blood ran down my face. When some of the carnies came up to me, I said, "I'm numb." This became my name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man with no memory who feels no pain, Numb travels to New York City after a short stint with the circus, following the one and only clue he holds to his hidden history: a brittle, bloodstained business card. But once there, word of his condition rapidly spreads--sparked by the attention he attracts by letting people nail his hands to wooden bars for money--and he quickly finds himself hounded on all sides by those who would use his unique ability in their own pursuits of fame and fortune. It is a strange world indeed that Numb numbly stumbles through, surrounded by crowds of suck-ups and opportunists, as he confronts life's most basic and difficult question: Who am I?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean Ferrell's Numb is a wildly entertaining examination of identity, friendship, pain, and the cult of celebrity that heralds the arrival of a fresh and uniquely inventive literary voice.</description>

  <description>Behind closed doors, they're laying down the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to the laws of attraction...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Payton Kendall and J.D. Jameson are lawyers who know the meaning of objection. A feminist to the bone, Payton has fought hard to succeed in a profession dominated by men. Born wealthy, privileged, and cocky, J.D. has fought hard to ignore her. Face-to-face, they're perfectly civil. They have to be. For eight years they have kept a safe distance and tolerated each other as coworkers for one reason: to make partner at the firm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are no rules...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all bets are off when they're asked to join forces on a major case. Though apprehensive at first, they begin to appreciate each other's dedication to the law—and the sparks between them quickly turn into attraction. But the increasingly hot connection does not last long when they discover that only one of them will be named partner. Now it's an all-out war. And the battle between the sexes is bound to make these lawyers hot under the collar.</description>

  <description>No woman could resist him—except the one he wanted most...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cool, Calm, Collected...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing fazes Taylor Donovan. In the courtroom she never lets the opposition see her sweat. In her personal life, she never lets any man rattle her—not even her cheating ex-fiancé. So when she's assigned to coach People's "Sexiest Man Alive" for his role in his next big legal thriller, she refuses to fall for the Hollywood heartthrob's charms. Even if he is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Jason Andrews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confident, Famous, Irresistible...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Andrews is used to having women fall at his feet. When Taylor Donovan gives him the cold shoulder, he's thrown for a loop. She's unlike any other woman he's ever met: uninterested in the limelight, seemingly immune to his advances, and shockingly capable of saying no to him. She's the perfect challenge. And the more she rejects him, the more he begins to realize she may just be his perfect match.</description>

  <description>When twenty-eight-year-old Lexi Smart wakes up in a London hospital, she’s in for a big surprise. Her teeth are perfect. Her body is toned. Her handbag is Vuitton. Having survived a car accident—in a Mercedes no less—Lexi has lost a big chunk of her memory, three years to be exact, and she’s about to find out just how much things have changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow Lexi went from a twenty-five-year-old working girl to a corporate big shot with a sleek new loft, a personal assistant, a carb-free diet, and a set of glamorous new friends. And who is this gorgeous husband—who also happens to be a multimillionaire? With her mind still stuck three years in reverse, Lexi greets this brave new world determined to be the person she…well, seems to be. That is, until an adorably disheveled architect drops the biggest bombshell of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly Lexi is scrambling to catch her balance. Her new life, it turns out, comes complete with secrets, schemes, and intrigue. How on earth did all this happen? Will she ever remember? And what will happen when she does?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the same wicked humor and delicious charm that have won her millions of devoted fans, Sophie Kinsella, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Shopaholic &amp;amp; Baby, returns with an irresistible new novel and a fresh new heroine who finds herself in a life-changing and utterly hilarious predicament…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I’ve lost it. :( The only thing in the world I wasn’t supposed to lose. My engagement ring. It’s been in Magnus’s family for three generations. And now the very same day his parents are coming, I’ve lost it. The very same day! Do not hyperventilate, Poppy. Stay positive :) !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Poppy Wyatt has never felt luckier. She is about to marry her ideal man, Magnus Tavish, but in one afternoon her “happily ever after” begins to fall apart. Not only has she lost her engagement ring in a hotel fire drill but in the panic that follows, her phone is stolen. As she paces shakily around the lobby, she spots an abandoned phone in a trash can. Finders keepers! Now she can leave a number for the hotel to contact her when they find her ring. Perfect!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Well, perfect except that the phone’s owner, businessman Sam Roxton, doesn’t agree. He wants his phone back and doesn’t appreciate Poppy reading his messages and wading into his personal life.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; What ensues is a hilarious and unpredictable turn of events as Poppy and Sam increasingly upend each other’s lives through emails and text messages. As Poppy juggles wedding preparations, mysterious phone calls, and hiding her left hand from Magnus and his parents . . . she soon realizes that she is in for the biggest surprise of her life.</description>

  <description>In this resplendent love story a dazzling era comes vividly to life as one woman's passionate struggle to follow her heart takes her from the opulent cotillions of Edinburgh to the London court of half-mad King George III . . . from a famed salon teeming with politicians and poets to a picturesque castle on the secluded, lush Island of the Swans. . . .&lt;br&gt;Best friends in childhood, Jane Maxwell and Thomas Fraser wreaked havoc on the cobbled streets of Edinburgh with their juvenile pranks. But years later, when Jane blossoms into a beautiful woman, her feelings for Thomas push beyond the borders of friendship, and he becomes the only man she wants. When Thomas is reportedly killed in the American colonies, the handsome, charismatic Alexander, Duke of Gordon, appeals to a devastated Jane. Believing Thomas is gone forever, Jane hesitantly responds to the Duke, whose passion ignites her blood, even as she rebels at his fierce desire to claim her.&lt;br&gt;But Thomas Fraser is not dead, and when he returns to find his beloved Jane betrothed to another, he refuses to accept the heartbreaking turn of events. Soon Jane's marriage is swept into a turbulent dance of tender wooing and clashing wills--as Alex seeks truly to make her his, and his alone. . . .</description>

Caroline Maxwell would like nothing more than to join her brother, Eddie, and his friend, Jack Culhane, on their adventures. While Jack and Eddie are off seeing the world, buying up businesses and building wildly successful careers, Caroline's stuck at home frightening off the men her mother hopes will ask for her hand in marriage.  When her mother sets her sights on the questionable Lord Bremerton as a possible suitor, Caroline struggles with her instincts and the true nature of her heart.  She longs for adventure, passion, love, and most of all . . . Jack Culhane, an unconventional Irish-American bachelor with new money and no title. A completely unacceptable suitor in the eyes of Caroline's mother. But Caroline's dark hair, brilliant eyes and quick wit have Jack understanding just why it is people fall in love and get married.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in New York City in 1894, &lt;em&gt;The Husband List &lt;/em&gt;is an American gilded age romantic mystery. It evokes memories of the lavish lifestyles and social expectations of the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers—a time when new money from the Americas married Old World social prestige and privilege. Dresses by Worth, transcontinental ocean voyages, lavish parties, a little intrigue, and a lot of romance await in, &lt;em&gt;The Husband List&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>The king's scholar, the magus, believes he knows the site of an ancient treasure. To attain it for his king, he needs a skillful thief, and he selects Gen from the king's prison. The magus is interested only in the thief's abilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Gen is interested in is anyone's guess. Their journey toward the treasure is both dangerous and difficult, lightened only imperceptibly by the tales they tell of the old gods and goddesses.</description>

  <description>From the heart of an intersex teen, one who must ultimately choose male or female—family or true love—comes the story of a deeply emotional and perilous journey home. This is a young adult novel unlike any other—an authentic portrayal of the issues faced by a child growing up with a sexually ambiguous body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jameson can be like other boys after minor surgery and a few years on testosterone Well, at least that’s what his parents always say. But Jamie sees an elfin princess in the mirror, and male hormones would only ruin her pretty face. For him to become the man his parents expect, Jameson must leave behind the hopes and dreams of a little girl. But what is so wrong with Jamie’s dreams that they can’t be her life?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Incapable. Awkward. Artless. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what the other girls whisper behind her back. But sixteen-year-old Adelice Lewys has a secret: She wants to fail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gifted with the ability to weave time with matter, she’s exactly what the Guild is looking for, and in the world of Arras, being chosen to work the looms is everything a girl could want. It means privilege, eternal beauty, and being something other than a secretary. It also means the power to manipulate the very fabric of reality. But if controlling what people eat, where they live, and how many children they have is the price of having it all, Adelice isn’t interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that her feelings matter, because she slipped and used her hidden talent for a moment. Now she has one hour to eat her mom’s overcooked pot roast. One hour to listen to her sister’s academy gossip and laugh at her dad’s jokes. One hour to pretend everything’s okay. And one hour to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because tonight, they’ll come for her.</description>

  <description>Maggie is a seventeen year old girl who's had a bad year. She was smart and on track, but then her mom left, her dad is depressed, she's graduating - barely - and her boyfriend of almost three years dumped her for a college football scholarship. Lately she thinks life is all about hanging on by a thread and is gripping tight with everything she has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she saves the life of Caleb and instantly knows there's something about him that's intriguing. But things change when they touch, sparks ignite. Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They imprint with each other and she sees their future life together flash before her eyes. She learns that not only is she his soul mate, and can feel his heartbeat in her chest, but there is a whole other world of people with gifts and abilities that she never knew existed. She herself is experiencing supernatural changes unlike anything she's ever felt before and she needs the touch of his skin to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, not only has her dad come out of his depression to be a father again, and a pain as well, but Caleb's enemies know he's imprinted and are after Maggie to stop them both from gaining their abilities and take her from him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Caleb save her or will they be forced to live without each other after just finding one another?</description>

Thank you for thinking of me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Respectfully,&lt;br&gt;Alejandra Perez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. It's not Allie. It's Ale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meet T.C., who is valiantly attempting to get Alejandra to fall in love with him; Alejandra, who is playing hard to get and is busy trying to sashay out from under the responsibilities of being a diplomat's daughter; and T.C.'s brother Augie, who is gay and in love and everyone knows it but him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Amber Appleton lives in a bus. Ever since her mom's boyfriend kicked them out, Amber, her mom, and her totally loyal dog, Bobby Big Boy (aka Thrice B) have been camped out in the back of Hello Yellow (the school bus her mom drives). Still, Amber, the self-proclaimed princess of hope and girl of unyielding optimism, refuses to sweat the bad stuff. But when a fatal tragedy threatens Amber's optimism—and her way of life, can Amber continue to be the rock star of hope? With an oddball cast of characters, and a heartwarming, inspiring story, this novel unveils a beautifully beaten-up world of laughs, loyalty, and hard-earned hope.</description>

  <description>Ananna of the Tanarau abandons ship when her parents try to marry her off to an allying pirate clan: she wants to captain her own boat, not serve as second-in-command to her handsome yet clueless fiance. But her escape has dire consequences when she learns the scorned clan has sent an assassin after her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when the assassin, Naji, finally catches up with her, things get even worse. Ananna inadvertently triggers a nasty curse — with a life-altering result. Now Ananna and Naji are forced to become uneasy allies as they work together to break the curse and return their lives back to normal. Or at least as normal as the lives of a pirate and an assassin can be.</description>

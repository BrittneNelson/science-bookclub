  <description>Twenty-year-old Ward de’Ath expected this to be a simple job—bring a nobleman’s daughter back from the dead for fifteen minutes, let her family say good-bye, and launch his fledgling career as a necromancer. Goddess knows he can’t be a surgeon—the Quayestri already branded him a criminal for trying—so bringing people back from the dead it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Ward wakes the beautiful Celia Carlyle, he gets more than he bargained for. Insistent that she’s been murdered, Celia begs Ward to keep her alive and help her find justice. By the time she drags him out her bedroom window and into the sewers, Ward can’t bring himself to break his damned physician’s Oath and desert her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, nothing is as it seems—including Celia. One second, she’s treating Ward like sewage, the next she’s kissing him. And for a nobleman’s daughter, she sure has a lot of enemies. If he could just convince his heart to give up on the infuriating beauty, he might get out of this alive…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A lady does not smoke cheroot. She does not ride astride. She does not fence or attend duels. She does not fire a pistol, and she never gambles at a gentlemen's club.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Calpurnia Hartwell has always followed the rules, rules that have left her unmarried—and more than a little unsatisfied. And so she's vowed to break the rules and live the life of pleasure she's been missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to dance every dance, to steal a midnight kiss—to do those things, Callie will need a willing partner. Someone who knows everything about rule-breaking. Someone like Gabriel St. John, the Marquess of Ralston—charming and devastatingly handsome, his wicked reputation matched only by his sinful smile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she's not careful, she'll break the most important rule of all—the one that says that pleasure-seekers should never fall hopelessly, desperately in love.</description>

  <description>Marnie comes to the remote fishing hamlet of Torcurra as the reluctant bride of Isake Isherwood, a lord of her parents' farm. But two days later, while thatching the roof, Isake falls to his death. Marnie's only kindness comes from Father Brannan, the village priest, and Raver, the strange mad boy whose incoherent cries belie his gentle heart. Taking him in one windy night, Marnie makes a startling discovery: Raver is not mad but deaf.&lt;br&gt;Determined to communicate with the boy whom Marnie now calls Raven, she invents a system of hand-words. Raven learns quickly and has soon all but shed his madness. Yet while Marnie and Raven forge a deep bond, the villagers, already suspicious of Marnie's role in Isake's death, see his transformation as the result of witchcraft. Even as Marnie's and Raven's bond turns to love, and as they uncover the mysterious value of their cottage, Marnie is forced into a witchcraft trial where the test of the iron bar will determine her fate.&lt;br&gt;Set in the times when magic was a force to be reckoned with, &lt;em&gt;The Raging Quiet&lt;/em&gt; is the epic saga of a remarkable woman whose only crime is being different.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old September lives in Omaha, and used to have an ordinary life, until her father went to war and her mother went to work. One day, September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket), who invites her on an adventure, implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle, and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods, and if she doesn’t . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends, including a book-loving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday. &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With exquisite illustrations by acclaimed artist Ana Juan, &lt;em&gt;Fairyland &lt;/em&gt;lives up to the sensation it created when the author first posted it online. For readers of all ages who love the charm of &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; and the soul of &lt;em&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/em&gt;, here is a reading experience unto itself: unforgettable, and so very beautiful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Life can get pretty complicated for any seventeen-year-old girl, but for a home-schooled telepathic black girl trying to survive in a prestigious private school in small-town Jonesborough, Tennessee, it can be maddening; especially when her telepathic father keeps eavesdropping on her thoughts!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaycie Lerner's family isn't the usual mom-dad-kid setup. Jaycie's mom is MIA, but Allison, her personal live-in trainer, is more than a mom, with her own special abilities, like being able to lift cars and run incredibly fast. And Jaycie's godfather John is more than persuasive; he can literally convince anyone to do anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as the rest of the world's concerned, Jaycie's on the outside looking in. The townsfolk love Jaycie's paediatrician father, but she doesn't fit in with "normal" kids, and she doesn't really want to. Most of her free time is spent training to keep her telekinetic and telepathic powers under control. But there's one thing she can't control; and that's her feelings, especially when her best friend Matt is nearby. If only he knew what she was truly capable of...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything seems to be status quo for Jaycie until she receives a cryptic message from a stranger and meets a very unusual girl new to Jonesborough. Then all hell breaks loose!</description>

  <description>A Winner of the Alex Award, a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for First Fiction, named a Best Book of the Year by NPR, Los Angeles Times, and San Francisco Chronicle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon away from life as a San Francisco web-design drone and into the aisles of Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore. But after a few days on the job, Clay discovers that the store is more curious than either its name or its gnomic owner might suggest. The customers are few, and they never seem to buy anything—instead, they “check out” large, obscure volumes from strange corners of the store. Suspicious, Clay engineers an analysis of the clientele’s behavior, seeking help from his variously talented friends. But when they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the bookstore’s secrets extend far beyond its walls. Rendered with irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan's Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(description from Amazon.com)</description>

  <description>In this pithy and hilarious book, Karl Pilkington is in conversation with (the often bewildered) Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, the writers and stars of &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Extras&lt;/em&gt;, unwittingly outwitting even those comedy Goliaths as he struggles in vain to make sense of the world around him. Unencumbered by erudition and impervious to logic, Karl ambles down a heuristic path to enlightenment under the edifying influence of Ricky and Steve. His pronouncements on such diverse and contentious topics as population control, simian affairs within human society, the sartorial deliberations of solitary spacemen and how long you can stay alive with your head chopped off, are matched in the vehemence with which they are proposed only by the degree to which they are ill-conceived. Featuring Karl's original illustrations, imaginative scribblings and the best conversations of the world record-breaking Podcasts, &lt;em&gt;The Ricky Gervais Show&lt;/em&gt;, this is a unique trip into the world of one of our most innovative thinkers, visionaries and prophets, or as Gervais knows him, "the funniest man I've ever met."</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When lust turns to love, it’s one fire he can’t extinguish…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merle Cameron’s not looking for love. Between her job as a university lecturer and caring for a mother recovering from breast cancer, she has no room in her schedule for a demanding relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While visiting her sister in New Zealand, however, she’s happy to indulge in some hot holiday sex with kind, hunky firefighter Neon Carter. After all, they live on opposite sides of the world. There’s no chance things will turn serious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neon Carter is a catch. At least, that’s what the ladies apparently think. All they seem to want is a quick trip down the aisle, but Neon’s in no rush to settle down. Light-hearted summer loving with a sexy blonde is something different, though, and Neon’s happy to offer his services until Merle has to return to England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The weather’s hot, the sex even hotter. But when it’s time for Merle to go home, they both realize they’re in deeper than they thought. And there’s no solution that won’t break someone’s heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Please do not read if you are allergic to any of the following: love at first sight, one-night stands in a one-man tent, rugby hakas, firemen rescuing children, and rough caveman sex guaranteed to put hair on your chest. May contain nuts.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Reflections can be deadly, at least in the mind of fifteen-year old Norah. Nurtured in an environment of self-hate and passive aggression, she finds comfort in dieting to the point of near starvation. With her family’s reassurance, she builds a ladder of rigid willpower only to find the steps too slippery to sustain her. Abandoned by her parents and in the hands of strangers, Norah rages. Her uniquely internal battle is carefully drawn outside of her as she wages war on her imagined captors. In her mind, there is little doubt that there is anything more frightening than the prison of her body. A lively tale into the mind of a quite ordinary anorexic, Norah arrives at the final examination. Will she eat or die? It is her defining struggle that arouses the hope in the reader as she champions her recovery.</description>

  <description>Seoafin "Finnie" Wilde was taught by her parents that life was meant to be lived, every breath was a treasure and to seek every adventure she could find. And she learns this lesson the hard way when they perish in a plane crash when she's fifteen. But she never forgets and when she discovers there is a parallel universe where every person has a twin, she finds a witch who can send her there so she can see her parents again and have the adventure of a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nearly upon arrival in the Winter Wonderland of Lunwyn, she realizes she's been played by her twin of the alternate universe and shortly finds herself walking down the aisle to be wed to The Drakkar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instantly thrown into inauspicious circumstances, with years of practice (she did, of course, survive that elephant stampede, if she could do that, she can do anything), Finnie bests the challenges and digs into her adventure. But as Frey Drakkar discovers the woman who is his new wife is not Princess Sjofn, a woman he dislikes (intensely) but instead, his Finnie, a free-spirit with a thirst for venture just like him (not to mention she is his destiny), without her knowledge he orders his new bride bound to his frozen world, everlasting.</description>

  <description>‘If she’d waited less than two weeks, she’d be June who died in June. But I guess my sister didn’t consider that.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Scott’s older sister has always been the perfect one so when June takes her own life a week before her high school graduation, sixteen-year-old Harper is devastated. Everyone’s sorry, but no one can explain why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her divorcing parents decide to split her sister’s ashes into his-and-her urns, Harper takes matters into her own hands. She’ll steal the ashes and drive cross-country with her best friend, Laney, to the one place June always dreamed of going, California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Jake Tolan. He’s a boy with a bad attitude, a classic-rock obsession and nothing in common with Harper’s sister. But Jake had a connection with June, and when he insists on joining them, Harper’s just desperate enough to let him. With his alternately charming and infuriating demeanour and his belief that music can see you through anything, he might be exactly what she needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except June wasn’t the only one hiding something. Jake’s keeping a secret that has the power to turn Harper’s life upside down again.</description>

  <description>Anxious to leave her destructive past behind, Amelia Caldwell moves to Willowberg, excited for a fresh start. Once there, she discovers that her birthmark is more than it seems. She has been marked by a vampire’s soul. Not only does she hold his soul, but Amelia is also his soulmate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After almost a century of searching for his soulmate, Mitchell Lang fears the worst—he is going to lose Amelia to another man. His heart takes over, and his impulsive decision to take away her free will and to intensify their bond quickly turns her growing love into hate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they become trapped in the emotional rollercoaster of their souls' bond, open conflict erupts. Amelia has no intentions of belonging to anyone, not even her soulmate, and Mitchell refuses to let her go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While she frantically searches for a way to escape his grasp, Amelia unlocks the painful memories of her past and uncovers a powerful secret. But before she has a chance to explore her newfound edge, she finds herself caught in the middle of a deadly game of revenge and is forced to realize that YOU CANNOT RUN FROM DESTINY.</description>

  <description>On the last night of 1937, twenty-five-year-old Katey Kontent is in a second-rate Greenwich Village jazz bar with her boardinghouse roommate stretching three dollars as far as it will go when Tinker Grey, a handsome banker with royal blue eyes and a tempered smile, happens to sit at the neighboring table. This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of Condé Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wooed in turn by a shy, principled multi-millionaire and an irrepressible Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, befriended by a single-minded widow who is a ahead of her time,and challenged by an imperious mentor, Katey experiences firsthand the poise secured by wealth and station and the failed aspirations that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her life, she begins to realize how our most promising choices inevitably lay the groundwork for our regrets.</description>

  <description>Angus: My mixed-breed cat, half domestic tabby, half Scottish wildcat. The size of a small Labrador, only mad. Likes to stalk Mr. and Mrs. Next Door's poodle. I used to drag him around on a lead, but, as I explained to Mrs. Next Door, he ate it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thongs: Stupid underwear worn by old Swotty Knickers, Lindsay. What's the point of them, anyway? They just go up your bum, as far as I can tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full-Frontal Snogging: Kissing with the trimmings, lip to lip, open mouth, tongues...everything (apart from dribble, which is never acceptable). As taught to me by a professional snogger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this wildly funny journal of a year in the life of Georgia Nicolson, British author Louise Rennison has perfectly captured the soaring joys and bottomless angst if being a teenager. In the spirit of "Bridget Jones' Diary," this fresh, irreverent, and simply hilarious book will leave you laughing out loud. As Georgia would say, it's "fabbity fab fab!"</description>

  <description>E. Lockhart’s spot-on dialogue and descriptions of painfully but hilariously relatable situations make this young adult novel an addictive read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Ruby has had a rough ten days. During that time she: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   * lost her boyfriend (#13 on the list) &lt;br&gt;   * lost her best friend (Kim)&lt;br&gt;   * lost all her other friends (Nora, Cricket)&lt;br&gt;   * did something suspicious with a boy (#10) &lt;br&gt;   * did something advanced with a boy (#15)&lt;br&gt;   * had an argument with a boy (#14)&lt;br&gt;   * had a panic attack&lt;br&gt;   * lost a lacrosse game (she's the goalie)&lt;br&gt;   * failed a math test (she'll make it up)&lt;br&gt;   * hurt Meghan's feelings (even though they aren't really friends)&lt;br&gt;   * became a social outcast (no one to sit with at lunch)&lt;br&gt;   * had graffiti written about her in the girls' bathroom (who knows what was in the&lt;br&gt;   boys'!?!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But don't worry—Ruby lives to tell the tale. And make more lists.</description>

  <description>All Noelle Cunningham has ever wanted is a life beyond–beyond the walls of Eden, where only the righteous are allowed to remain, and beyond her stiflingly restrictive existence as a councilman’s daughter. But only ruins lie outside the City, remnants of a society destroyed by solar storms decades earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sectors surrounding Eden house the corrupt, the criminal–men like Jasper McCray, bootlegger and cage fighter. Jas clawed his way up from nothing to stand at the right hand of Sector Four’s ruthless leader, and he’ll defend the O’Kane gang with his life. But no fight ever prepared him for the exiled City girl who falls at his feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her innocence is undeniable, but so is their intense sexual attraction, and soon they’re crossing every boundary Noelle barely knew she had. But if she wants to belong to Jas, first she’ll have to open herself to the gang, to a dangerous world of sex, lust and violence. A world where passion is power, and freedom is found in submission.</description>

  <description>In the beginning, there's a boy standing in the trees . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clara Gardner has recently learned that she's part angel. Having angel blood run through her veins not only makes her smarter, stronger, and faster than humans (a word, she realizes, that no longer applies to her), but it means she has a purpose, something she was put on this earth to do. Figuring out what that is, though, isn't easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her visions of a raging forest fire and an alluring stranger lead her to a new school in a new town. When she meets Christian, who turns out to be the boy of her dreams (literally), everything seems to fall into place and out of place at the same time. Because there's another guy, Tucker, who appeals to Clara's less angelic side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Clara tries to find her way in a world she no longer understands, she encounters unseen dangers and choices she never thought she'd have to make between honesty and deceit, love and duty, good and evil. When the fire from her vision finally ignites, will Clara be ready to face her destiny?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unearthly is a moving tale of love and fate, and the struggle between following the rules and following your heart.</description>

  <description>A gripping memoir and medical suspense story about a young New York Post reporter’s struggle with a rare and terrifying disease, opening a new window into the fascinating world of brain science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, Susannah Cahalan woke up in a strange hospital room, strapped to her bed, under guard, and unable to move or speak. Her medical records—from a month-long hospital stay of which she had no memory—showed psychosis, violence, and dangerous instability. Yet, only weeks earlier she had been a healthy, ambitious twenty-four year old, six months into her first serious relationship and a sparkling career as a cub reporter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Susannah’s astonishing memoir chronicles the swift path of her illness and the lucky, last-minute intervention led by one of the few doctors capable of saving her life. As weeks ticked by and Susannah moved inexplicably from violence to catatonia, $1 million worth of blood tests and brain scans revealed nothing. The exhausted doctors were ready to commit her to the psychiatric ward, in effect condemning her to a lifetime of institutions, or death, until Dr. Souhel Najjar—nicknamed Dr. House—joined her team. He asked Susannah to draw one simple sketch, which became key to diagnosing her with a newly discovered autoimmune disease in which her body was attacking her brain, an illness now thought to be the cause of “demonic possessions” throughout history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With sharp reporting drawn from hospital records, scientific research, and interviews with doctors and family, Brain on Fire is a crackling mystery and an unflinching, gripping personal story that marks the debut of an extraordinary writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a teenager and young man, Justin Lee felt deeply torn. Nicknamed "God Boy" by his peers, he knew that he was called to a life in the evangelical Christian ministry. But Lee harbored a secret: He also knew that he was gay. In this groundbreaking book, Lee recalls the events--his coming out to his parents, his experiences with the "ex-gay" movement, and his in-depth study of the Bible--that led him, eventually, to self-acceptance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But more than just a memoir, TORN provides insightful, practical guidance for all committed Christians who wonder how to relate to gay friends or family members--or who struggle with their own sexuality. Convinced that "in a culture that sees gays and Christians as enemies, gay Christians are in a unique position to bring peace," Lee demonstrates that people of faith on both sides of the debate can respect, learn from, and love one another.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>When Lady Johanna learned that she was a widow, she vowed she would never marry again. Only sixteen, already she possessed a strength of will that impressed all who looked past her golden-haired beauty. Yet when King John demanded that she remarry and selected a bridegroom for her—it seemed she must acquiesce, until her beloved foster brother suggested she wed his friend, the handsome Scottish warrior Gabriel MacBain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first Johanna was shy, but as Gabriel tenderly revealed the splendid pleasures they would share, she came to suspect that she was falling in love with her gruff new husband. And it was soon apparent to the entire Highlands clan that their brusque, gallant laird had surrendered his heart completely. But now a desperate royal intrigue threatened to tear her from his side—and to destroy the man whose love meant more to her than she had ever dreamed!</description>

  <description>When Kate Mitchell decided to research the mysterious portrait in the student gallery, she had no idea how her life would change. She thought she knew what she wanted. She had a great boyfriend, a promising career, and a clear path.&lt;br&gt; How could one simple portrait change all that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A photograph. A sculpture. A painting. One clue leads to another, and Kate learns that pieces of the past might leave unexpected marks on her own future, too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And how, exactly, did she end up in an irritable sculptor’s studio? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One portrait may hold the answers, but learning its secrets will challenge everything Kate thought she knew about love, art, and life. A single picture can tell more than one story, and in the end, a young artist will discover that every real love story is a unique work of art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Genius and the Muse is a contemporary romance novel for adult readers.</description>

  <description>By the king's edict, Alec Kincaid, mightiest of the Scottish lairds, must take an English bride. And Jamie the youngest daughter of Baron Jamison, is his choice. From his first glimpse of the proud and beautiful English lady, Alec felt a burning hunger stir within him. This was a woman worthy of his fearless warrior's spirit. And he aches to touch her, tame her, possess her...forever. &lt;p&gt; But with the wedding vows, Jamie pledges her own secret oath: She will never surrender her love to this Highland barbarian. He was everything her heart warned her against -- an arrogant, brooding scoundrel whose rough good looks and seductive embrace fire her blood. But when strange accidents begin to threaten Jamie's life and an old rumor that Alec killed his first wife spreads anew, something far more dangerous than desire threatens to conquer her senses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A Story of Love That Won't Let Go - No Matter What!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;California’s gold country, 1850. A time when men sold their souls for a bag of gold and women sold their bodies for a place to sleep.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angel expects nothing from men but betrayal. Sold into prostitution as a child, she survives by keeping her hatred alive. And what she hates most are the men who use her, leaving her empty and dead inside.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Michael Hosea, a man who seeks his Father’s heart in everything. Michael obeys God’s call to marry Angel and to love her unconditionally. Slowly, day by day, he defies Angel’s every bitter expectation, until despite her resistance, her frozen heart begins to thaw.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with her unexpected softening comes overwhelming feelings of unworthiness and fear. And so Angel runs. Back to the darkness, away from her husband’s pursuing love, terrified of the truth she no longer can deny: Her final healing must come from the One who loves her even more than Michael does…the One who will never let her go.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful retelling of the story of Gomer and Hosea, Redeeming Love is a life-changing story of God’s unconditional, redemptive, all-consuming love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes a six-part reading group guide!</description>

  <description>Port Fare, New York, has fallen into the clutches of true evil. The Dreser brothers have arrived with a scheme to increase drug sales in the area by whatever means possible. Seth Prescott is part of MET (Mobile Enforcement Teams) a branch of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). He's been assigned to work undercover at Port Fare High, and things aren't going very well, until senior Maggie Brown enters the equation. He's harbored a secret crush on her from day one, and now that she is in the center of the case, he's trying to stay clear and objective while walking the line between business and unrequited love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie is truly the poster child for Heroin Chic, complete with jutting bones and dark-ringed eyes, but is she an addict, or is there another reason for her appearance? She struggles with her feelings for Seth, fearing he is just another person who will eventually let her down, as everyone in her life has done thus far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie has spent her life caring for her alcoholic mother. A task that has left her heavily burdened and alone. Before long, her mother's health takes a turn for the worst, sending Maggie's life into a tale-spin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Seth works relentlessly to inject fear into the dealers and flush them out into the open, Maggie fights to stay alive as the hunt turns deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth and Maggie's romantic journey is one of humor, heartbreak, and self-discovery.</description>

  <description>This novel is intended for adults only. It includes lots of cursing, descriptive sex, biting sarcasm, and dark themes. HYDE was inspired by Stevenson's novella but is not a retelling, in part because he and this author have very different definitions of 'bad boy'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honesty is impossible when you don't know the truth to begin with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitchell Turner is everything women want most in a man--he's charismatic, successful, and undeniably gorgeous. But he's not a man--he's a monster. By venting his rage 24/7, Mitch keeps people out of the danger zone that surrounds him. But, after the most incredible night of his life, he realizes that might not be possible. Except the woman he wakes up with claims she doesn't remember any of it. And that kind of thing can make a guy insecure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden Colfax is kind, loyal, honest to a fault, and cavity-inducing sweet. To rid herself of the monsters that haunted her broken childhood, Eden doesn't lie, doesn't curse, and definitely never wakes up naked in strangers' beds...until the day she does. Then the flashbacks start--places she's never been, people she's never met, blood she's never spilled. And the only person with any answers is a man she never wants to see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they don't know is that someone is manipulating them, determined to find out exactly what they're capable of. And when the truth leaves them nothing to hold onto, they will be forced into a partnership neither expected. Or wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in life, who you trust is as important as who you are. And when you can't even trust yourself, sometimes the only person you can rely on is the last person on earth you should be falling for.</description>

  <description>It takes a remarkable writer to make an old story as fresh and compelling as the first time we heard it. With &lt;em&gt;The Winter King, &lt;/em&gt;the first volume of his magnificent Warlord Chronicles, Bernard Cornwell finally turns to the story he was born to write: the mythic saga of King Arthur.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tale begins in Dark Age Britain, a land where Arthur has been banished and Merlin has disappeared, where a child-king sits unprotected on the throne, where religion vies with magic for the souls of the people. It is to this desperate land that Arthur returns, a man at once utterly human and truly heroic: a man of honor, loyalty, and amazing valor; a man who loves Guinevere more passionately than he should; a man whose life is at once tragic and triumphant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Arthur fights to keep a flicker of civilization alive in a barbaric world, Bernard Cornwell makes a familiar tale into a legend all over again.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A hand-picked cadre of warriors, they had the fierce courage of their Scots forefathers, combined with the stealth and cunning of the Indians who lived beside them in the wilderness. Battling the French in a no-holds-barred combat, they forged a new brand of honor, became a new breed of men...&lt;strong&gt;MacKinnon's Rangers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iain MacKinnon had been forced to serve the British crown, but compassion urged him to save the lovely lass facing certain death at the hands of the Abenaki. He'd defied his orders, endangered his brothers, his men and his mission, all for a woman. But when he held Annie's sweet body in his arms, he could feel no regret. Though he sensed she was hiding something from him, it was too late to hold back his heart. In love and war, there are times when the only course of action is...&lt;strong&gt;Surrender&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

  <description>Linus is taken prisoner from earth by a barbaric civilization rampaging through our galaxy. He is to be a slave in an Empire ruled by invincible tyrants. They have powers to make any wish come true, just by thinking of it. And the depravity of the rulers filters down to every level of society. The rulers control vast armies with advanced technology far beyond that any of the colonized planets. Linus is an ordinary person, not a superhero with fantastic powers or fighting abilities. His journey through this society is not just a thrilling adventure, but a philosophical analysis of people and the power they covet.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This novel is 157,000 words (about twice the average sci-fi book). It is not intended for children or teenagers, but will be entertaining to thinking adults.

  <description>After uncovering and writing in a three-thousand-year-old book, eighteen-year-old Ava Baker escapes through a portal that she believes is nothing more than a vivid dream. Her urge to write isn’t solely based on her journey, but also by an alluring man named, Collin, whom she meets between the pages. Their mutual unabiding affection has them bound to each other in ways much deeper than either one can explain. When Collin divulges secrets to Ava, and reveals that the book is being hunted by rival secret societies, it sends their relationship and Ava’s life into a tailspin. The very thing that brought them together is also what threatens to tear them apart. Are Collin and the revelations only figments of her imagination? Or, is it all, a reality and her divine destiny?</description>

  <description>Jessica's sole priority for the past thirteen years has been to keep her father alive in the hope he will wake up from his coma and save her. Threatening to cut off his lifeline at any sign of independence, her mother has controlled her life, even to the point of an arranged engagement to Seth, whom Jessica fears even more than her mother. When Jessica accepts this most outrageous demand yet she then discovers her father has "passed away" anyway, she knows she has to escape.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     She runs until she is lost and bewildered in a Georgia swamp, where she discovers the existence of the wonderful place her father hinted at to her when she was only a child. In this magical, unreal world, just as she begins to discover the truth about her twisted family roots, three young men set their eyes on Jessica.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One will win her heart, one will try to steal it, and one will try to kill her.</description>

  <description>Luca Minaldi is powerful, rich and mesmerizing.  But he is also a reclusive enigma.  He lives in Malta, a fairytale-like place filled with sunshine and sea, beauty and secrets.  And Luca’s darkest of secrets is the best kept of them all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Talbot is spending the summer in Malta to finish up her doctoral dissertation.  When she meets Luca, a mysterious and handsome shipping magnate, there is an instant attraction.  He has a disturbing and beautiful energy that she has never felt before.  But she senses the darkness that lives within him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva is hired to care for his mother, a woman who suffers from dementia, but it is Luca who Eva will eventually risk everything to save.  She desperately wants to reach inside of him and fix what is broken, while at the same time, she knows that she is falling for him.  Her life becomes a swirling chaos of darkness and romance, of secrets and mystery.  And the question that emerges will become the most important answer of all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she save Luca from the darkness that plagues him without losing herself? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer is a matter of life or death.</description>

  <description>Red-hot author Miranda Kenneally hits one out of the park in this return to Catching Jordan's Hundred Oaks High.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parker Shelton pretty much has the perfect life. She’s on her way to becoming valedictorian at Hundred Oaks High, she’s made the all-star softball team, and she has plenty of friends. Then her mother’s scandal rocks their small town and suddenly no one will talk to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Parker wants a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she quits softball. Drops twenty pounds. And she figures why kiss one guy when she can kiss three? Or four. Why limit herself to high school boys when the majorly cute new baseball coach seems especially flirty?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how far is too far before she loses herself completely?</description>

  <description>Luke Carney has no idea what possessed him to move back to Shelter Springs, Colorado, to set up his veterinarian practice. His parents have long since left, the small farming community is on the brink of extinction, and only one close friend from his childhood remains--Taycee Emerson, his best friend’s little sister, who isn’t so little anymore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there’s the matter of &lt;em&gt;Shelter’s Bachelorette&lt;/em&gt;, an online reality dating show created to raise some much needed funds for the town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unwittingly cast as the bachelorette, Taycee wants out, especially when she discovers that Luke, her childhood crush, is back in town and will be one of the bachelors. To make matters worse, it's up to the viewers--not her--to decide which bachelors stay or go.  And they all seem to like Luke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unwilling to let him break her heart again, Taycee launches a subtle attack on Luke’s good name with the hope of getting him voted off the show. But she’d forgotten that Luke's an eye-for-an-eye kind of guy, and when he discovers what she's up to, it means revenge.</description>

  <description>Jodie and Amelia were almost sisters once, before college degrees, careers, and grown-up love entered their lives. Before Jodie's brother broke up with Amelia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After so many disappointments, Amelia is finally happy. Or something like it. She's given her love and trust to her best friend, Drew, who is sweet, sensitive, loyal, and everything she's always wanted. She's calculated the perfect path to inner peace and healing by surrounding herself with people who would never break her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jodie hates that all her friends are pairing up to begin their futures. She hates dating, hates romance in general. She hates that she can't forget one night, a year ago, which Drew doesn't seem to remember the same way. Everyone is moving on without her, but that's fine, because she never needed anyone in her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Never" has a way of proving itself wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With vivid characters, generous doses of humor, and palpable emotion, Exactly Where They'd Fall is a story about three friends forced to explore the complicated and fragile bonds of friendship and love. Fans of heartfelt, witty literary fiction, and smart women's fiction will enjoy this charming and honest debut.</description>

  <description>Haole Wood A Novel By Dee DeTarsio When San Diego weathercaster, Jaswinder Park, is mysteriously summoned to the island of Maui in Hawaii to help her grandmother, she ends up losing her job. This fair-haired, light-skinned foreigner, called haole by the natives, decides to stay in Maui for a couple of days until she can figure out what to do with her life. She realizes that her quick trip to Maui may not be all she's hoping for when: -She has to bail her Hawaiian/Korean grandmother out of jail for possession of pakalolo. -The only thing she can understand her grandmother say is: "Not that." -She can't decide which hurts worse, her sunburn, hangover, or memories of the night before. -She's labeled the "Liquor Licker" on the front page of the Maui News in a photo that shows her doing a shot of tequila with a hunky Hawaiian who's been found dead. -It seems she's had orgasms that have lasted longer than her career. -She scrapes the bottom of the barrel to find her guardian angel. Beautiful fabric found in her grandmother's closet unfolds a future for Jaswinder as she designs sensuous silky wraps called sunshminas that provide sun protection. She tries for a Hollywood connection, but her company, Haole Wood, has some growing pains. From trying to find a killer, to selling her sunshminas, to lusting after Dr. Jac, the island dermatologist, to trying to ignore her so-called guardian angel, can Jaswinder learn to embrace the island way of life? Aloha!</description>

  <description>Gemma Hart never knows when her father is going to whisk her back in time. Her toes start tingling and she has a few minutes to find a secret haven where she can disintegrate and appear in another time and place. While “across the line,” her training and skills are put to the test as she completes a mission that will change history for the lucky few her father has selected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gemma's parents are adamant that secrecy is paramount to her family’s safety. If people knew what they were capable of, they could be "used and abused", as her mother always says. Afraid she might accidentally utter the truth and break the ancient oath of her people, Gemma spends her school days as a loner. Only one thing can throw her sheltered life askew... Harrison Granger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harrison never expected to talk to the strange Hart girl, but after a brief encounter he can't stop thinking about her. He begins a campaign to chisel away her icy veneer and is met with unexpected consequences. As he slowly wins this girl over, he enters a surreal world that has him fighting to keep his newfound love and his life.</description>

  <description>The majority of Prosaic City’s residents don’t know that their town exists on top of another place -- Necropolis, City of the Undead. For the most part, the two planes of existence manage to remain separate. And when they don’t, Necropolis Enforcement has beings in place to ensure the general human population remains blithely clueless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victoria Wolfe is more than just a policewoman. She’s an undercover werewolf assigned by Necropolis Enforcement to work Prosaic City Police’s Night Beat. Victoria’s comfortable working the shift where all the weird comes out to play, especially since her partner is also her perfect man. Or would be, if Victoria could ever work up the nerve to tell him she isn’t like other girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s hard enough being a werewolf in disguise, but when a creature from the Depths of Hell shows up in an alley preferred by junkies, bums, and hookers, it’s going to take more than just Victoria’s special gun and werewolf skills to subdue the ancient Sumerian demon. Especially when the demon is merely the start of what appears to be a major takeover attempt by the Prince of Darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon all of Necropolis Enforcement’s Undead Brigade is involved in the fight to stop the Prince’s Major Minions from taking over Prosaic City and the rest of the human plane. But it’s Victoria who has to face the Adversary and figure out what intricate plan Lucifer has up his wings before everyone she cares about is destroyed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, it’s just another day on the Night Beat.</description>

  <description>“I tried to push him back, but he was too strong, like iron.  Suddenly his head snapped up like he heard something; he craned his neck to listen and then he let out a hiss.  He kissed next to my ear and softly whispered, “I think breaking you will be much more fun.  I’ll see you soon.”  And then he added, as if an afterthought, “Tell him hello for me.”  Then I felt his mouth lock onto the base of my neck and something pierce my flesh.  It hurt.  Despite my panic, after a few moments, my heart slowed, and everything became distorted as the blackness came for me.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After breaking up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year old Aleria “Ali” Hayes finally feels liberated.  Unfortunately, her ex’s buddies are not making it easy on her. When his friends harass her one night, a mysterious stranger, Bowen, steps in to rescue her. But just as this new relationship seems to be taking off, Ali is attacked by something far worse than spiteful high school boys. When she awakes, her eyes are opened to a world where gods still walk the earth, where vampires and other immortals fight for supremacy— and where fate may be stronger than free will. Now, Ali must decide who she can trust, and whether the world of mortals is worth saving at all.</description>

  <description>Dave Newell’s Southern literature debut chronicles love lost, hope taken, and the enduring consequences of selfish devotion. This dark, psychological literary puzzle has been described as “eccentric” and “beautiful” with an effortless plot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Douglas Howard’s days as a small-town physician are numbered. He is in debt, and the only way out he sees is to take up with the lonely, calculating wife of a dying patient who will leave behind a sizable fortune. As they wait, their lives become complicated by the troubles of Dr. Howard’s desperate secretary, Miss Derringer, who has her affections set on the doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is a fatal scandal and an exploration of human expression, desire and manipulation all in the name of love. In the middle of it all is a strange and beautiful parrot, innocent from everything that goes on around her, but thoroughly involved.</description>

  <description>A romantic adventure from the days of wooden ships and iron men, Captain Blackwell’s Prize is a story of honor, duty, social class and the bond of sensual love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A small, audacious British frigate does battle against a large but ungainly Spanish ship.  British Captain James Blackwell intercepts the Spanish La Trinidad, outmaneuvers and outguns the treasure ship and boards her.  Fighting alongside the Spanish captain, sword in hand, is a beautiful woman.  The battle is quickly over.  The Spanish captain is killed in the fray and his ship damaged beyond repair.  Its survivors and treasure are taken aboard the British ship, Inconstant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Blackwell’s Prize features sword fights and sea battles alongside the manners, ideas, and prejudices of men and women from the time of Nelson and Napoleon.</description>

  <description>What do you do when you have nowhere to go? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meg's whole world has crumbled out from under her. Her only family, her father, has died, leaving her alone and destitute. She can only see one option-- driving away to wherever the road takes her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her road ends in Trinity, Newfoundland, a place of rare beauty, and the frigid sea all around. Meg has never seen the sea before, and is captivated by it, drawn to the ocean to the point of obsession. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she meets Devin Horan, he completely shreds all the truths she thought she knew about herself and the world around her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And opens up the possibility of knowing a mother who may not have drowned after all.</description>

  <description>TORN With the sudden, mysterious death of her father, Samantha discovers her life isn’t what it seems. Not only isn’t she the normal teenage girl she thought she was, Sam must now take her father’s place in the fight between two groups of fallen angels, the Faithful and the Exiled, in a race to save humanity. In addition to dealing with a devastating betrayal—and having feelings for someone she’s forbidden to love—Sam must also fight the growing darkness within her as she struggles to make a choice between fighting alongside the Faithful or succumbing to the temptation of the Exiled. Both sides require sacrifices Sam isn’t sure she can make.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Ava-Claire Sullivan's mother is dying. Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that her greatest solace comes from someone who's already dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Hart saves her one night in a graveyard from an attacker just as strange as he is, and now Ava can't stop thinking about him. She wants to see him again – even after he warns her he's dangerous, and she begins to realize what he is. Her best friends don't know anything about death, but Peter does, intimately. He's waiting for her the next night she comes to the cemetery, and the next...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their growing bond comes up against a promise Peter made a long time ago, a promise that could destroy them both. Now Ava has to decide just what she's willing to give up to hold onto the one thing that could last forever.</description>

  <description>Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We’d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fledgling witch Morgana must defend her love, her home, and her life in this enthralling tale perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Discovery of Witches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her small Welsh town, there is no one quite like Morgana.  She has never spoken, and her silence as well as the magic she can't quite control make her a mystery. Concerned for her safety, her mother quickly arranges a marriage with Cai Bevan, the widower from the far hills who knows nothing of the rumours that swirl around her. After their wedding, Morgana is heartbroken at leaving, but she soon falls in love with Cai’s farm and the rugged mountains that surround it, while slowly Cai himself begins to win her heart. It’s not long, however, before her strangeness begins to be remarked upon in her new village.  A dark force is at work there—a person who will stop at nothing to turn the townspeople against Morgana, even at the expense of those closest to her.  Forced to defend her home, her love, and herself from all comers, Morgana must learn to harness her power, or she will lose everything.</description>

  <description>Riana has learned how to stay out of trouble. She spends her days studying written texts in the government’s Office of Readers, and she spends her nights taking care of her sick sister. She always—always—follows the rules. Despite her low profile, she has mysteriously become a target. Someone has kidnapped her sister. Someone else is trying to kill her. And someone has sent a Soul-Breather to beguile her out of her secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her help comes from the mythic leader of an underground rebel movement. A man who used to be her friend. A man who has silently loved her for years. He disappeared from her life without a word, and now he expects her to trust him again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there’s the Soul-Breather, a man who can taste her spirit with only a touch. He makes her feel things she’s never experienced before, but she doesn’t know if the feelings are real. Hired to deceive and betray her, he offers to help her instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without both men, she can’t rescue her sister. And she can’t discover the world-changing knowledge—buried in her memory—that has made her a target in the first place.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Rose Zarelli, self-proclaimed word geek and angry girl, has some confessions to make…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. I'm &lt;em&gt;livid&lt;/em&gt; all the time. Why? My dad died. My mom barely talks. My brother abandoned us. I think I'm allowed to be &lt;em&gt;irate,&lt;/em&gt; don't you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. I make people &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; regularly. Want an example? I kissed Jamie Forta, a badass guy who &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be dating a cheerleader. She is now &lt;em&gt;enraged&lt;/em&gt; and out for blood. Mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. High school might as well be Mars. My best friend has been replaced by an alien, and I &lt;em&gt;see red&lt;/em&gt; all the time. (Mars is red and "seeing red" means being angry—get it?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some other vocab words that describe my life: &lt;em&gt;Inadequate. Insufferable. Intolerable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Don't know what they mean? Look them up yourself.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sorry. That was rude.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Inhale. Exhale. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world is dead. &lt;br&gt;The survivors live under the protection of Breathe, the corporation that found a way to manufacture oxygen-rich air. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALINA&lt;br&gt;has been stealing for a long time. She’s a little jittery, but not terrified. All she knows is that she’s never been caught before. If she’s careful, it’ll be easy. If she’s careful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;QUINN&lt;br&gt;should be worried about Alina and a bit afraid for himself, too, but even though this is dangerous, it’s also the most interesting thing to happen to him in ages. It isn’t every day that the girl of your dreams asks you to rescue her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEA&lt;br&gt;wants to tell him that none of this is fair; they’d planned a trip together, the two of them, and she’d hoped he’d discover her out here, not another girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as they walk into the Outlands with two days’ worth of oxygen in their tanks, everything they believe will be shattered. Will they be able to make it back? Will they want to?</description>

  <description>What girl wouldn't want to be surrounded by the sexy guys from the hottest teen rock sensation in the country?  18-year-old Never "Neve" Knight, not only is surrounded by the hottest boys to hit the music charts, but she is the band's lead singer. As the band's lead singer and manager, Never formed and shaped the band to where it is today, a band on the rise and on the brink of being signed by a label. As one of the guys, she knew each of the band members since they were all snot-nose ten-year-olds. While her boys were the cutest guys and they would protect her like knights, she couldn't date any one of them and ruin the chance at being signed with the record label of her dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That changes when one of the band members suddenly drops out of the band, and in walks Danny Blue, with his dreamy blue eyes, hot body, and British accent. Suddenly, Never's solid world has turned to mush, and her rule for not dating one of her band members is seriously challenged. Can she keep her head straight and get her band signed with a label without losing her heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YA Mature/New Adult</description>

Discover these stories and a world filled with magic, forbidden love, elves, sprites, dragons, and the most powerful creatures of all— the fairies —in &lt;em&gt;Bonded&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of three fairy tale inspired novellas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CINDERS:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt; sequel. Money can’t buy love, but magic isn’t a sure bet either. Cinderella, now officially a princess, finds royal life is not what she once dreamed. When a mysterious elf from her past stirs up long-suppressed passion, Cinderella begins to wonder if there really is love beneath the spell that captured her husband’s heart. But undoing magic can be harder than casting the initial spell, and the results are even less predictable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIRDS:&lt;/strong&gt; A retelling of the Grimm’s fairy tale, &lt;em&gt;One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three-Eyes&lt;/em&gt;. Issina is surrounded by magic, yet none of it belongs to her. Despised and abused by her mother and sisters, she finds comfort when she meets the beautiful elves living in the nearby woods. The elves want to help her discover her own magic, but it’s not the kind of power she hoped for, and she learns there is more to magic than getting what you want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCALES:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;em&gt;Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt; prequel. The sun never sets in the realm of the fairies. When the young fairy Serina looks into her sister’s eyes, she sees darkness for the first time. After her mother is murdered, Serina defies fairy law to follow her sister to the human realm. There she discovers the strength of a bond, the weight of a promise, and the darkness in her own heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &amp;amp; USA TODAY BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I see it, Jack. Your muse is back. The thing that gave you passion, tormented you, and haunted you is back. You're reeling in ecstasy and dread. It's something you want, but can't ever have. And the one that brings the pain is pure, white as snow... and standing in front of you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One kiss could have changed Abby's life, but when it didn't happen, she ran. Jack was everything to her and when he didn't respond, Abby couldn't bear it. Everything about that night--leaning in close to his face, feeling the night breeze teasing her hair, the way his scent filled her head--was burned vividly into her mind, including the moment when Jack pulled away. There was no kiss. Abby was wrong. She was wrong about him, wrong about them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe she didn't have to go to college two thousand miles away, but she did. She had to forget about him. Abby threw herself off the grid, disappearing completely from the life she knew.  After completing her undergraduate degree, she enrolled in seminary. All contact with her old life was severed and she never looked back, until she was forced to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Abby puts idealism into practice, her congregation throws her out. If she can survive a year on her own, they'll take her back, and continue to pay off her student loans--but if she fails, Abby is on her own with enough debt to fund a small town. Seminary wasn't cheap. With no place left to go, Abby returns to New York and her best friend takes her in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to make it on her own and prove she was right, Abby follows a job lead to an art studio on Long Island. It isn't until she hears Jack's voice that she freezes. The hairs on the back of her neck prickle as she turns to see Jack, ten years later, looking even more tempting than before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fate is cruel. Abby left this life behind, but she's thrown back into it, head first. It's like someone hit rewind on her life and its ten years earlier. She's the cotton-mouthed girl that she always was around Jack, and now her future relies on the man who rejected her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SCANDALOUS 2 WILL BE RELEASED SPRING 2013&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>For the past five months Essallie Hanley has been trying to forget about the frightening murder of her boyfriend. Haunted by vivid nightmares and hallucinations of the event she does anything she can to pretend she's like every other normal girl in High School. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Essallie is far from normal. Able to conjure blue fire and a shimmering silhouette of wings from her body, she seeks the only known solace left to her name; her first home in Belfast, Maine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she soon realizes that her return home is only the beginning of a long and twisted road taking her as far from her humanity as possible, with Kayden, the demon originally summoned to slaughter her, leading the way. Unable to touch her but oddly curious, he joins Essallie in her search to find out just what she is. But neither of them were prepared for the secrets they've begun to unravel, secrets that will change Essallie and everyone around her forever.</description>

Her friends, the Huntsmen, have never stepped over the line while patrolling the streets of Luinhall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was before the murder of Ash’s beloved guardian, Genevieve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Ash Lenthard is out for blood and even when the hunt sends her to the palace, on a collision course with a past identity she would do anything to forget, Ash cannot, will not, back down.</description>

  <description>Gabriella is a witch. The problem is, she doesn't remember. She repressed the memories of her powers years ago when her mother was murdered. Now, the warlock who was responsible for her mother's death has set his sights on Gabriella. He is determined to use her fear to turn her to the dark side of magick…even if it kills her. Her mother's spirit is reaching out to warn her, but even that she pushes away. Desperate to save her daughter, the spirit finds a male witch–one that just happens to be in love with Gabriella. Darron is more than willing to help but the two young witches will have way more to battle than just an evil warlock. There are overbearing jocks and petty rich girls who get tempers flaring and often set Gabrielle and Darron at odds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is more to the story than Gabrielle and Darron could even imagine. There are terrible secrets to be revealed, battles to be waged, and lives will be lost. Only after Gabrielle and Darron both come to terms with who they really are, and open themselves up to the true meaning of magick, can they have any hope of fulfilling their destiny.</description>

  <description>Composed from true life events and personal manuscripts, &lt;em&gt;This Shadow Follows Me&lt;/em&gt;, is a riveting fiction novel of Alec Andrews and the friends and family that faltered around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story begins with the death bed of Andrew's ex-boyfriend Troy who was dying of AIDS complications. Alec tries to tell his life story in hopes that he can make up for all that he could not tell Troy when he was alive. Alec's life story lurks with the self destruction of a family that drove him to crucify himself, in hopes they would be correct with their religious beliefs. From a homophobic family to a homophobic upbringing, Alec fights to find himself free from the illusions that capture him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alec is ultimately haunted by a dream where he took his own life. In the dream he killed himself, only to be told he would have to live his life over again without making the same mistakes, but not able to remember the previous mistakes to stop them from coming true. Will Alec and the ones around him find their way to claw out of the pain of the lives they create? Find out in this fictional and painfully honest memory of &lt;em&gt;This Shadow Follows Me&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>From the pages of Newbery Medal winner Neil Gaiman's THE SANDMAN comes fan-favorite character Death in a new deluxe hardcover edition collecting her solo adventures!The first story introduces the young, pale, perky, and genuinely likable Death. One day in every century, Death walks the Earth to better understand those to whom she will be the final visitor. Today is that day. As a young mortal girl named Didi, Death befriends a teenager and helps a 250-year old homeless woman find her missing heart. What follows is a sincere musing on love, life and (of course) death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second story, a rising star of the music world wrestles with revealing her true sexual orientation just as her lover is lured into the realm of Death that Death herself should make an appearance. A practical, honest, and intelligent story that illuminates "the miracle of death."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new hardcover collects the DEATH: THE HIGH COST OF LIVING and DEATH: THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE miniseries, a must have for any fan.</description>

  <description>The monikers &lt;em&gt;drunk&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;addict&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;abuser&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;boozehound &lt;/em&gt;were Caleb Daniloff’s for fifteen years. Now, the introduction that fits him best is &lt;em&gt;My name is Caleb and I am a runner&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Running Ransom Road, Daniloff, many years sober, confronts his past by setting out, over the course of eighteen months, to run marathons in the cities where he once lived and wreaked havoc. Competing from Boston to New York, Vermont to Moscow, Daniloff explores the sobering and inspiring effects of running as he traverses the trails of his former self, lined with dark bars, ratty apartments, lost loves, and lost chances. With each race he comes to understand who he is, and by extension who he was, and he finds he is not alone. There are countless souls in sneakers running away from something, or better, running past and through whatever it is that haunts them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this powerful story of ruin, running, and redemption, Daniloff illuminates the connection between running and addiction and shows that the road to recovery is an arduous but conquerable one. Strapping on a pair of Nikes won't banish all your demons, but it can play an important role in maintaining a clean life. For Daniloff, sweat, strained lungs, and searing muscles are among the paving stones of empowerment, and, if he's lucky, perhaps even self-forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Got Wings?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elijah and Cassie aren’t your old-school angels chilling in the heavens and strumming harps. They’re members of the Guardians, an elite force of angels masquerading under the guise of high school teens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their newest mission is no walk in the clouds. In an effort to seek out troubled teens, they, along with fellow angels, Rafe, Sophie and Gabriel, will pose as a family of adopted brothers and sisters and enroll in high school. Along with their gift of “emotional divination”, which is to take on the pain of those who are suffering, they experience their own roller coaster rides of teenage emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accustomed to working with children, shy Elijah is overwhelmed when he is assigned to Abby, an honor roll cheerleader. When she discovers she is pregnant and her boyfriend abandons her, Abby turns to Elijah for support. As his feelings for Abby intensify, Elijah also struggles with the desire to be a guardian to Abby’s unborn baby. However, as Elijah is trying to do good, a dark force hovers over him in the form of Lucius—one of Satan’s demons. Things escalate when Elijah threatens Lucius. It will come to a fight to the finish with Elijah either being defeated or damning Lucius back to Hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Song bird Cassie sings her way into the lead of the school musical and into the life of Zach, a guitar-strumming lost soul. After constant beatings from his step-father drive Zach to a suicide attempt, Cassie must teach him about hope and faith. However, a dark force in the area leads Cassie to mistakenly interpret that Zach is her assignment. Instead she was meant for Lauren, her musical rival and the girl who has an intense crush on Zach. Cassie must somehow find a way to befriend Lauren, help her along and continue to help Zach without destroying Lauren in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To fail means death for their assignments, and to fall in love ensures a fall from grace. No one ever said high school was easy.</description>

  <description>Fate can mark one early for a particular future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madison Wescott’s life is Hell on earth. Her father, a Baptist Preacher, convinces her she’s morally corrupt when men notice her blooming beauty. She strives to be unnoticeable, but nothing satisfies her condemning parents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And sometimes fate has nothing to do with one’s potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temptation rears its head when Micah Dominus visits her father’s church on Christmas morning, but she is unprepared for her physical reaction to him. Frightened by her own emotions, she is grateful she’ll never see him again. But when he shows up again at a friend’s funeral, and at other times in her life, she’s swayed by his charisma. Micah becomes her white knight through the good and bad, but can they create the perfect life together? Or has she just located the beginning of the Road to Hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supernatural forces more powerful than fate can claim one’s destiny…</description>

  <description>All 18-year-old Celeste Garrett wants is to head off to college and make those fun, yet ill-advised, choices college kids are known for.  And maybe to spend some time with the hot cameraman she just met.  Instead, because of a pact her ancestors made in the 17th century with a mythical creature, she has to save the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While normal kids are slamming energy drinks and cramming for exams, Celeste will get her adrenaline rush fighting a fire breathing dragon.  She wants to meet friends in the quad to exchange lecture notes, but first she must exchange blows with a shapeshifting demon on the rooftop.  Life isn’t always fair for a superhero, but at least she doesn’t have to do it alone.  With her brother and sister as sidekicks, they alternate between saving lives and getting on each others’ nerves.  Together the trio encounters unspeakable odds, mystical forces and comes face-to-face with an image that will haunt them forever—their grandmother in a leopard print bikini.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Okay, little side note here.  If a psychopathic killer asks if you want to see a trick, say no.  That’s the smart thing to do.  I, on the other hand, responded, “Bring it.”&lt;br&gt;-excerpt from THE CONDUIT</description>

  <description>Deep in the backwoods of North Dakota, twenty–one year old Sarah Ross is searching for a missing child when she is attacked by a glowing–eyed, transparent... creature. Sarah survives, destroying the monster by using mysterious abilities she didn’t even know she had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bloody and bruised, Sarah flees the scene and runs directly into Evan Valente, a handsome, charismatic stranger who helps her back to safety. But what is Evan doing out in the forest at five in the morning?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turning to a healer, Sarah is shocked to learn her eyes bear the mark of the Indigo Child—an evolved human with the ability to feel the emotions of others. But her indigo aura also makes her an easy target for those who wish to consume her powerful essence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Sarah is falling deeply in love with Evan and wants nothing more than to follow her heart and trust that he is the man he says he is. But she can't ignore the lingering feeling that Evan is hiding a terrible secret. The deeper she digs, the more danger she faces, leading her on a course that will force her to face the darkest, innermost parts of her soul.</description>

  <description>"No secret stays hidden forever."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A phone call from an old friend sets Dr. Giovanni Vecchio back on the path of a mystery he'd abandoned years before. He never expected a young librarian could hold the key to the search, nor could he have expected the danger she would attract. Now he and Beatrice De Novo will follow a twisted maze that leads from the archives of a university library, through the fires of Renaissance Florence, and toward a confrontation they never could have predicted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Hidden Fire is a paranormal mystery/romance for adult readers. It is the first book in the Elemental Mysteries Series.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gwyneth Shepherd's sophisticated, beautiful cousin Charlotte has been prepared her entire life for traveling through time. But unexpectedly, it is Gwyneth, who in the middle of class takes a sudden spin to a different era!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gwyneth must now unearth the mystery of why her mother would lie about her birth date to ward off suspicion about her ability, brush up on her history, and work with Gideon--the time traveler from a similarly gifted family that passes the gene through its male line, and whose presence becomes, in time, less insufferable and more essential. Together, Gwyneth and Gideon journey through time to discover who, in the 18th century and in contemporary London, they can trust.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Last Unicorn&lt;/em&gt; is one of the true classics of fantasy, ranking with Tolkien's &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;, Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy, and Lewis Carroll's &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Beagle writes a shimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a book no fantasy reader should miss; Beagle argues brilliantly the need for magic in our lives and the folly of forgetting to dream. &lt;em&gt;--Nona Vero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Life sucks for orphans Callum Tate and Harper Bailey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kicked out of their foster homes because they suffer the 'eighteen disease' with nothing but a hundred dollar check from the government and a pat on the back, they're forced to rely on a system that failed them miserably. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So they sit. They sit inside Social Services, waiting for their social workers to call their names and offer them the miracle they know will never come but they sit anyway because they have nowhere else to go, no other options on their very literal and figurative empty plates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as they sit, they notice the other. Although captivated, they each come to the conclusion that life is complicated enough without throwing in a boiling tension that can't ever be acted upon because they're both too busy thinking about where their next meal will come from but when their names are called and both are placed on a year long waiting list for permanent housing, suddenly relying on each other seems like a very viable plan B. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, oh, how lovely Plan B's can be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, except for the psycho from Harper's past that haunts her and, oh, yeah, there's the little issue that neither of them knows they're in love with the other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Needless to say, Callum &amp;amp; Harper's life just got a bit more complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“One day, you and I are gonna’ wake up and be alright. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow but one day. One day. I promise you.” - Callum Tate</description>

  <description>It is the late 12th century and lovely Lady Judith Hampton is making plans to leave her home in England for a dangerous journey to Scotland. She is keeping a childhood promise to attend her dearest friend, Frances Catherine, in childbirth. But Judith has a private reason for visiting the Highlands: to locate the father she has never known. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing has prepared Judith for the sight of Iain Maitland, Frances Catherine's brother-in-law, the Scottish warlord who comes to escort her to his land. The Laird of his clan, Iain is the handsomest, most compelling man Judith has ever met. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though he finds Judith as stubborn as she is enchanting, passion rages between them from their first kiss--and grows into a love so great that he fears for their future together... for her father's identity is a devastating secret that could shatter the boldest alliance and the most glorious of loves!</description>

  <description>What would you do if you could start your life over again?  What if you didn’t have a choice?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what happens to Andy Meyers.  He has all the normal trappings of life: a beautiful wife, a nice house, and a good job.  But all that vanishes when he wakes to find himself reliving his own childhood.  He is suddenly nine-years-old again, and he is poised to reenact a terrible chain of events that altered his life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that’s just the beginning.  Things get even more complicated when Andy discovers an impossible note.  Someone knows he has come back.  Someone who doesn’t want him to change anything.  And they will stop at nothing to keep him from it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Andy starts to unravel his own past, he begins to find that things are much different than he ever imagined.  His family has a secret.  A secret so big that it could change everything.</description>

  <description>On the precipice of her sixteenth birthday, the last thing lone wolf Cat Crawford wants is an extravagant gala thrown by her bubbly stepmother-to-be and well-meaning father. So even though Cat knows the family’s trip to Florence, Italy, is a peace offering, she embraces the magical city and all it offers. But when her curiosity leads her to an unusual gypsy tent, she exits . . . right into Renaissance &lt;em&gt;Firenze&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrust into the sixteenth century armed with only a backpack full of contraband future items, Cat joins up with her ancestors, the sweet Alessandra and protective Cipriano, and soon falls for the gorgeous aspiring artist Lorenzo. But when the much-older Niccolo starts sniffing around, Cat realizes that an unwanted birthday party is nothing compared to an unwanted suitor full of creeptastic &lt;em&gt;amore&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she find her way back to modern times before her Italian adventure turns into an Italian forever?</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2010 John Newbery Medal &lt;br&gt;"Four mysterious letters change Miranda's world forever.&lt;br&gt;"&lt;br&gt;By sixth grade, Miranda and her best friend, Sal, know how to navigate their New York City neighborhood. They know where it's safe to go, like the local grocery store, and they know whom to avoid, like the crazy guy on the corner. &lt;br&gt;But things start to unravel. Sal gets punched by a new kid for what seems like no reason, and he shuts Miranda out of his life. The apartment key that Miranda's mom keeps hidden for emergencies is stolen. And then Miranda finds a mysterious note scrawled on a tiny slip of paper: " &lt;br&gt;I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. &lt;br&gt;I must ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter. &lt;br&gt;"The notes keep coming, and Miranda slowly realizes that whoever is leaving them knows all about her, including things that have not even happened yet. Each message brings her closer to believing that only she can prevent a tragic death. Until the final note makes her think she's too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A romantic time travel story that's ideal for fans of novels by Meg Cabot and Donna Jo Napoli--and, of course, Shakespeare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Miranda has Shakespeare in her blood: she hopes one day to become a Shakespearean actor like her famous parents. At least, she does until her disastrous performance in her school's staging of &lt;em&gt;The Taming of the Shrew&lt;/em&gt;. Humiliated, Miranda skips the opening-night party. All she wants to do is hide. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fellow cast member, Stephen Langford, has other plans for Miranda. When he steps out of the backstage shadows and asks if she'd like to &lt;em&gt;meet&lt;/em&gt; Shakespeare, Miranda thinks he's a total nutcase. But before she can object, Stephen whisks her back to 16th century England—the world Stephen's really from. He wants Miranda to use her acting talents and modern-day charms on the young Will Shakespeare. Without her help, Stephen claims, the world will lost its greatest playwright. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miranda isn't convinced she's the girl for the job. Why would Shakespeare care about her? And just who is this infuriating time traveler, Stephen Langford? Reluctantly, she agrees to help, knowing that it's her only chance of getting back to the present and her "real" life. What Miranda doesn't bargain for is finding true love . . . with no acting required.</description>

  <description>A powerful debut novel about the gray space between truth and perception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn’s done the unthinkable: she kissed a guy who is not Carey, her boyfriend. And she got caught. Being branded a cheater would be bad enough, but Quinn is deemed a traitor, and shunned by all of her friends. Because Carey’s not just any guy—he’s serving in Afghanistan and revered by everyone in their small, military town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn could clear her name, but that would mean revealing secrets that she’s vowed to keep—secrets that aren’t hers to share. And when Carey goes MIA, Quinn must decide how far she’ll go to protect her boyfriend…and her promise.</description>

  <description>Cheerleader Isobel Lanley is horrified when she is paired with Varen Nethers for an English project, which is due—so unfair—on the day of the rival game. Cold and aloof, sardonic and sharp-tongued, Varen makes it clear he’d rather not have anything to do with her either. But when Isobel discovers strange writing in his journal, she can’t help but give this enigmatic boy with the piercing eyes another look. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Isobel finds herself making excuses to be with Varen. Steadily pulled away from her friends and her possessive boyfriend, Isobel ventures deeper and deeper into the dream world Varen has created through the pages of his notebook, a realm where the terrifying stories of Edgar Allan Poe come to life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As her world begins to unravel around her, Isobel discovers that dreams, like words, hold more power than she ever imagined, and that the most frightening realities are those of the mind. Now she must find a way to reach Varen before he is consumed by the shadows of his own nightmares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His life depends on it.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>In Toni Aleo’s exhilarating debut, the first in a series featuring the hockey hunks of the Nashville Assassins, a reformed bad boy helps a charming, willful woman face off against the demons of her past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    No matter how hard she tries, Eleanor Fisher never thinks she’s good enough, from her job to her weight to her love life. After enduring years of abuse at the hands of an ex-boyfriend, Elli has been drifting through life in a daze. Until, that is, she meets Shea Adler on a promotional shoot for the NHL’s Nashville Assassins. Before Elli knows what’s happening, the gorgeous Shea breaks the ice and shatters her world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    A brilliant athlete inside the rink, Shea Adler is tired of the life he’s living outside of it: the girls, the money, the drinking. But everything changes when he meets Elli. After laying eyes on this feisty, witty, beautiful woman, he feels like he’s just taken the hardest hit of his life. No matter how skeptical she is, Shea knows they are meant to be together—if only he can convince Elli to put her insecurities aside throw her insecurities out the window before she misses out on a shot at love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: Trying to Score, Empty Net, and Along Came Trouble.</description>

  <description>4. The number of times my delicate wings have been broken and clamped behind my back. &lt;br&gt;68. The number inked upon my skin, marking me the sixty-eighth pixie to be stolen.&lt;br&gt;87. The number of days I’ve been wrongfully imprisoned.&lt;br&gt;88. The first day the faeries will regret stealing me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Healthy. Cheery. Vivacious. All traits Rosalie has before becoming enslaved by the faeries to make an endless supply of pixie dust. Now that Rosalie has been traumatized by slave labor, extreme desolate conditions and multiple deaths, this hardened pixie is anything but. When this rebellious teenager attempts an escape, she’s isolated in cramped quarters until she learns her place. Just as she begins to let go of all that hope, she finds an unlikely friend in Jack, the faerie assigned to guard her. Interspecies dating is forbidden in the fae world, so their growing attraction is unacceptable. And even if Jack can find a way to free her, they know the prison is the only place they can truly be together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clean YA Fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://devonashleywrites.blogspot.com/p/of-dust-and-darkness.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://devonashleywrites.blogspot.com...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Reese can’t remember anything from the time between the accident and the day she woke up almost a month later. She only knows one thing: She’s different now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Across North America, flocks of birds hurl themselves into airplanes, causing at least a dozen to crash. Thousands of people die. Fearing terrorism, the United States government grounds all flights, and millions of travelers are stranded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reese and her debate team partner and longtime crush David are in Arizona when it happens. Everyone knows the world will never be the same. On their drive home to San Francisco, along a stretch of empty highway at night in the middle of Nevada, a bird flies into their headlights. The car flips over. When they wake up in a military hospital, the doctor won’t tell them what happened, where they are—or how they’ve been miraculously healed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things become even stranger when Reese returns home. San Francisco feels like a different place with police enforcing curfew, hazmat teams collecting dead birds, and a strange presence that seems to be following her. When Reese unexpectedly collides with the beautiful Amber Gray, her search for the truth is forced in an entirely new direction—and threatens to expose a vast global conspiracy that the government has worked for decades to keep secret.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She does not know what awaits her at the enemy's gate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elisa is a hero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She led her people to victory over a terrifying, sorcerous army. Her place as the country's ruler should be secure. But it isn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her enemies come at her like ghosts in a dream, from foreign realms and even from within her own court. And her destiny as the chosen one has not yet been fulfilled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To conquer the power she bears, once and for all, Elisa must follow a trial of long-forgotten—and forbidden—clues, from the deep, hidden catacombs of her own city to the treacherous seas. With her go a one-eyed spy, a traitor, and the man whom—despite everything—she is falling in love with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she's lucky, she will return from this journey. But there will be a cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Faith, I tell them, is a mystery, elusive to many, and never easy to explain.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping and lyrical, spellbinding and unforgettable, David Ebershoff’s &lt;em&gt;The 19th Wife &lt;/em&gt;combines epic historical fiction with a modern murder mystery to create a brilliant novel of literary suspense. It is 1875, and Ann Eliza Young has recently separated from her powerful husband, Brigham Young, prophet and leader of the Mormon Church. Expelled and an outcast, Ann Eliza embarks on a crusade to end polygamy in the United States. A rich account of a family’s polygamous history is revealed, including how a young woman became a plural wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after Ann Eliza’s story begins, a second exquisite narrative unfolds–a tale of murder involving a polygamist family in present-day Utah. Jordan Scott, a young man who was thrown out of his fundamentalist sect years earlier, must reenter the world that cast him aside in order to discover the truth behind his father’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Ann Eliza’s narrative intertwines with that of Jordan’s search, readers are pulled deeper into the mysteries of love and faith.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It's the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune--and remarkable power--to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved--that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt--among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life--and love--in the real world he's always been so desperate to escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world at stake. &lt;br&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize. &lt;br&gt;Are you ready?</description>

  <description>The world as we know it is gone. The ice caps have melted and shifted south, devastating the northern territories and eradicating major cities such as New York and London, which are now under water and frozen. Humans died off during an epidemic prior to the ice disaster, and many more died during the floods at the start of this new ice age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These events have forced vampires out of hiding. In order to ensure that their food source wouldn't completely die off, the vampires have sequestered the remaining humans into farms and taken control of all that remains of civilization. Over time, the humans breeding on these farms became anemic. Their blood no longer sustains the master race. But not all of the humans were captured and sent to the farms. Some of the humans evaded the hunters, hiding in safe houses across the frozen tundra. As decades passed, the free humans disappeared, died, or were captured, until all that remains is one. Kahli is the last wild human. BANE is her story.</description>

  <description>A man hanged himself in the front room of the now abandoned old mansion; Rachael Price, along with everyone in the village, knew the story. But that was a long time ago and the tale had become nothing more than an urban myth by the time Rachael was born. Eighty-nine-year-old Carrie Howell, dressed in her Sunday-best, asks her grand-daughter, Rachael, to stop a while in front of the rambling old mansion-Autumn Manor. Who were these people her grandmother is remembering and what is her connection to the 'haunted house' that Rachael avoided as a child? Why is the house abandoned? Who owns Autumn Manor now?</description>

  <description>The new novel from the New York Times and internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Distant Hours&lt;/em&gt; is a spellbinding mix of mystery, thievery, murder, and enduring love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During a party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood tree house and is dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the road and sees her mother speak to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress, living in London. She returns to the family farm for Dorothy’s ninetieth birthday and finds herself overwhelmed by questions she has not thought about for decades. From pre-WWII England through the Blitz, to the fifties and beyond, discover the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds—Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy—who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Keeper&lt;/em&gt; explores longings and dreams, the lengths people go to fulfill them, and the consequences they can have. It is a story of lovers, friends, dreamers, and schemers told—in Morton’s signature style—against a backdrop of events that changed the world.</description>

  <description>Exiled exorcist Lucian Negru deserted his lover in Hell in exchange for saving his sister Catarina's soul, but Catarina doesn't want salvation. She wants Lucian to help her fulfill her dark covenant with the Fallen Angels by using his power to open the Hell Gates. Catarina intends to lead the Fallen's hordes out of Hell and into the parallel dimension of Woerld, Heaven's frontline of defense between Earth and Hell. When Lucian refuses to help his sister, she imprisons and cripples him, but Lucian learns that Rachael, the lover he betrayed and abandoned in Hell, is dying from a demonic possession. Determined to rescue Rachael from the demon he unleashed on her soul, Lucian flees his sister, but Catarina's wrath isn't so easy to escape!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>King, warrior, and lover Brian Boru was stronger, braver, and wiser than all other men-the greatest king Ireland has ever known. Out of the mists of the country's most violent age, he merged to lead his people to the peak of their golden era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His women were as remarkable as his adventures: Fiona, the druidess with mystical powers; Deirdre, beautiful victim of a Norse invader's brutal lust; Gormlaith, six-foot, read-haired goddess of sensuality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against the barbaric splendors of the tenth century, this is a story rich in truth and legend-in which friends become deadly enemies, bedrooms turn into battlefields, and dreams of glory are finally fulfilled. Morgan Llywelyn has written one of the greatest novels of Irish history.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;The Gift&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annie Trimble lives in a solitary world that no one enters or understands. As delicate and beautiful as the tender blossoms of the Oregon spring, she is shunned by a town that misinterprets her affliction. But cruelty cannot destroy the love Annie holds in her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Montgomery is horrified to learn his wild younger brother forced himself on a helpless "idiot girl." Tormented by guilt, Alex agrees to marry her and raise the babe she carries as his own. But he never dreams he will grow to cherish his lovely, mute, misjudged Annie—her childlike innocence, her womanly charms and the wondrous way she views her world. And he becomes determined to break through the wall of silence surrounding her;to heal...and to healed by Annie's sweet song of love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Meanwhile, Hugh must give up the woman he really loves in order to marry the reluctant Bess. Far apart in age and haunted by the past, can Hugh and Bess somehow make their marriage work?&lt;br&gt;Just as walls break down and love begins to grow, the merciless plague endangers all whom the couple holds dear, threatening the life and love they have built.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning author Susan Higginbotham's impeccable research will delight avid historical fiction readers, and her enchanting characters will surely capture every reader's heart. Fans of her first novel, &lt;em&gt;The Traitor's Wife&lt;/em&gt;, will be thrilled to find that this story follows the next generation of the Despenser family.</description>

  <description>In this novel, Sharon Kay Penman brings to life a dark period in English history, painting a canvas rich in the textures and colors of the era. Here is the pain and suffering of the innocents, the conniving and duplicity of the barons; here is the terrible reality of lawlessness - the burning towns, ravaged countryside, weary people. But above all, here are two extraordinary adversaries: A woman whose courage outran her common sense, who found that her skirts bound her more tightly than any rope. And a man of inordinate charm, as valiant in battle as he was able in friendship - but a man whose life was based on a broken oath and a treacherous lie, tragic flaws that would destroy him. Beginning as friends, they ended in the bitterest enmity, their bloodiest wounds self-inflicted. And if Stephen lost the crown, Maude would never wear it. But in a final irony for both, Maude would indeed be the mother of kings, for it was her eldest, Henry, who would establish the Plantagenet dynasty and, with Eleanor of Aquitaine, electrify the medieval world.</description>

  <description>Barcelona, 1945: A city slowly heals in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, and Daniel, an antiquarian book dealer’s son who mourns the loss of his mother, finds solace in a mysterious book entitled The Shadow of the Wind, by one Julián Carax. But when he sets out to find the author’s other works, he makes a shocking discovery: someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book Carax has written. In fact, Daniel may have the last of Carax’s books in existence. Soon Daniel’s seemingly innocent quest opens a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets--an epic story of murder, madness, and doomed love.</description>

  <description>There are some mistakes we make that we will regret for the rest of our lives.  For Christian, it was the day he betrayed Elizabeth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian Davison has a plan for his life.  He is determined to become an attorney and to one day take his place as partner in his father’s law firm.  Nothing will stand in his way, not even Elizabeth Ayers and their unborn child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Christian cuts her from his life, Elizabeth spends the next five years struggling to provide for her daughter and willing to sacrifice anything to give her child a safe, comfortable life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five years, Christian has regretted the day he walked away from his family and will do anything to win them back just as Elizabeth will do anything to protect her daughter from the certain heartache she believes Christian will bring upon them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Christian wrestles his way into their lives, Elizabeth is faced with asking herself if it is possible to forgive someone when they’ve committed the unforgivable and if it is possible to find a love after it has been buried in years of hate.  Or are there some wounds that go so deep they can never heal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say everyone deserves a second chance.</description>

But something happened and Feb broke Colt’s heart then she turned wild and tragedy struck. Colt meted out revenge against the man who brought Feb low but even though Colt risked it all for her, Feb turned her back on him and left town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen years later, Feb comes back to help run the family bar.

  <description>Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old. No matter what ingenious schemes Indy used to capture his attention, Lee never showed an interest and Indy finally gave up. Now Indy's employee, Rosie, has lost a bag of diamonds and bad guys are shooting at him. When Indy gets involved, Lee is forced to help. Complicating matters, Lee has decided he's interested, Indy's decided she's not. But she can't seem to keep Lee out of her life when she's repeatedly stun gunned, kidnapped and there are car bombs exploding (not to mention she's finding dead bodies).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indy's best bet is to solve the mystery of the diamonds before Lee. Lee's challenge is to keep Indy alive and, at the same time, win back her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She could save the world—or destroy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Evangeline "Evie" Greene leads a charmed life, until she begins experiencing horrifying hallucinations. When an apocalyptic event decimates her Louisiana hometown, Evie realizes her hallucinations were actually visions of the future—and they're still happening. Fighting for her life and desperate for answers, she must turn to her wrong-side-of-the-bayou classmate: Jack Deveaux.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But she can't do either alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his mile-long rap sheet, wicked grin, and bad attitude, Jack is like no boy Evie has ever known. Even though he once scorned her and everything she represented, he agrees to protect Evie on her quest. She knows she can't totally depend on Jack. If he ever cast that wicked grin her way, could she possibly resist him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can Evie trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jack and Evie race to find the source of her visions, they meet others who have gotten the same call. An ancient prophesy is being played out, and Evie is not the only one with special powers. A group of twenty-two teens has been chosen to reenact the ultimate battle between good and evil. But it's not always clear who is on which side.</description>

  <description>The Challenge: Piper has one month to get the rock band Dumb a paying gig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Deal: If she does it, Piper will become the band's manager and get her share of the profits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Catch: How can Piper possibly manage one egomaniacal pretty boy, one talentless piece of eye candy, one crush, one silent rocker, and one angry girl? And how can she do it when she's deaf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Piper can't hear Dumb's music, but with growing self-confidence, a budding romance, and a new understanding of the decision her family made to buy a cochlear implant for her deaf baby sister, she discovers her own inner rock star and what it truly means to be a flavor of Dumb.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Just when she thought she had life &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; love all figured out...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Divorce attorney Harper James can't catch a break. Bad enough that she runs into her ex-hubby, Nick, at her sister's destination wedding, but now, by a cruel twist of fate, she's being forced to make a cross-country road trip with him. And her almost-fiancé back at home is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; likely to be sympathetic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper can't help that Nick has come blazing back into her life in all of his frustratingly appealing, gorgeous architect glory. But in Nick's eyes, Harper's always been the one. If they can only get it right this time, forever might be waiting—just around the bend.</description>

  <description>In a childless and unhappy marriage, Clare Royland is rich and beautiful - but lonely. And fueling her feelings of isolation is a strange, growing fascination with an ancestress from the distant past. Troubled by haunting inexplicable dreams that terrify - but also powerfully compel - her, Clare is forced to look back through the centuries for answers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1306, Scotland is at war. Isobel, Countess of Buchan, faces fear and the prospect of untimely death as the fighting surrounds her. But passionate and headstrong, her trials escalate when she is persecuted for her part in crowning Robert the Bruce, her lover. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Duncairn, Isobel's home and Clare's beloved heritage, becomes a battleground for passions that span the centuries. As husband Paul's recklessness threatens their security, Clare must fight to save Duncairn, and to save herself from the powers of Isobel...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“ I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.” &lt;/em&gt;January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she’s never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society’s members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives. Captivated by their stories, she sets sail for Guernsey, and what she finds will change her forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written with warmth and humor as a series of letters, this novel is a celebration of the written word in all its guises, and of finding connection in the most surprising ways.</description>

  <description>She didn’t know what she wanted until he made her beg for it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan O’Malley has seen a lot of kinky things as the hostess of a cable sex talk show. But she’s never met a man like Jack Cole before. A self-proclaimed dominant, he’s as alpha as a male can get–and good for Morgan to have around when an obsessed stalker ratchets up his attempts to get to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Jack is a bodyguard, Morgan feels anything but safe in his presence. Because slowly and seductively, Jack is bringing her deepest fantasies to the surface. And when he bends her to his will, what’s more shocking than her surrender is how much she enjoys it–and starts to crave his masterful touch. A willing player in Jack’s games, Morgan knows that his motives aren’t pure, but she has no idea how personal they are…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; An exciting debut: a vivid, richly imagined saga of ancient Rome from a masterful new voice in historical fiction &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thea is a slave girl from Judaea, passionate, musical, and guarded. Purchased as a toy for the spiteful heiress Lepida Pollia, Thea will become her mistress's rival for the love of Arius the Barbarian, Rome's newest and most savage gladiator. His love brings Thea the first happiness of her life-that is quickly ended when a jealous Lepida tears them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As Lepida goes on to wreak havoc in the life of a new husband and his family, Thea remakes herself as a polished singer for Rome's aristocrats. Unwittingly, she attracts another admirer in the charismatic Emperor of Rome. But Domitian's games have a darker side, and Thea finds herself fighting for both soul and sanity. Many have tried to destroy the Emperor: a vengeful gladiator, an upright senator, a tormented soldier, a Vestal Virgin. But in the end, the life of the brilliant and paranoid Domitian lies in the hands of one woman: the Emperor's mistress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; Vikram Seth's novel is, at its core, a love story: Lata and her mother, Mrs. Rupa Mehra, are both trying to find -- through love or through exacting maternal appraisal -- a suitable boy for Lata to marry. Set in the early 1950s, in an India newly independent and struggling through a time of crisis, &lt;em&gt;A Suitable Boy&lt;/em&gt; takes us into the richly imagined world of four large extended families and spins a compulsively readable tale of their lives and loves. A sweeping panoramic portrait of a complex, multi ethnic society in flux, &lt;em&gt;A Suitable Boy&lt;/em&gt; remains the story of ordinary people caught up in a web of love and ambition, humor and sadness, prejudice and reconciliation, the most delicate social etiquette and the most appalling violence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When Sara McMillan finds a stack of journals in a storage unit, she’s shocked and enthralled by the erotic life the writer led. Unable to stop reading, she vicariously lives out dark fantasies through Rebecca, the writer—until the terrifying final entry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certain something sinister has happened, Sara sets out to discover the facts, immersing herself in Rebecca’s life. Soon she’s working at the art gallery Rebecca worked at and meeting Rebecca’s friends. Finding herself drawn to two dangerously sexy men, the manager of the gallery and a famed artist, Sara realizes she’s going down the same path Rebecca took.  But with the promise of her dark needs being met by a man with confident good looks and a desire for control, she’s not sure anything else matters. Just the burn for more.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;A medieval tale of pride and strife, of coming-of-age in a world where chivalry is a luxury seldom afforded, especially by men of power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;England, 1148---ten-year-old Brunin FitzWarin is an awkward misfit in his own family. A quiet child, he is tormented by his brothers and loathed by his powerful and autocratic grandmother. In an attempt to encourage Brunin's development, his father sends him to be fostered in the household of Joscelin de Dinan, Lord of Ludlow. Here Brunin will learn knightly arts, but before he can succeed, he must overcome the deep-seated doubts that hold him back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hawise, the youngest daughter of Lord Joscelin, soon forms a strong friendship with Brunin. Family loyalties mean that her father, with the young Brunin as his squire, must aid Prince Henry of Anjou in his battle with King Stephen for the English crown. Meanwhile, Ludlow itself comes under threat from Joscelin's rival, Gilbert de Lacy. As the war for the crown rages, and de Lacy becomes more assertive in his claims for Ludlow, Brunin and Hawise are drawn into each other's arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Brunin must defeat the shadows of his childhood and put to use all that he has learned. As the pressure on Ludlow intensifies and a new Welsh threat emerges against his own family's lands, Brunin must confront the future head on, or fail on all counts.... &lt;br&gt;

  <description>Shawn has a skyrocketing musical career, fans, fame, money, his beautiful girlfriend Amy, and all the women he wants.  Everything changes: Amy has enough and leaves him stranded in a Scottish castle tower overnight.  He wakes up in medieval Scotland.  Mistaken for the castle's future laird, he is forced to make a dangerous cross-country trek with a beautiful woman wielding a knife, pursued by English soldiers and a Scottish traitor, to raise men for the critical battle at Bannockburn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niall Campbell, Shawn's opposite in everything except looks, is no more happy to find himself caught in Shawn's life, pursued by women, the target of an angry girlfriend, expected to play a sell-out concert, and hearing the account of his own death and Scotland's annihilation at Bannockburn.  He vows to figure out what went wrong at the battle, and find a way back to change it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blue Bells of Scotland is both an action-packed adventure and a tale of redemption that will be remembered long after the last page has been turned.</description>

  <description>Karleen Koen's sweeping saga contains unforgettable characters consumed with passion: the extraordinarily beautiful fifteen-year-old noblewoman, Barbara Alderley; the man she adores, the wickedly handsome Roger MontGeoffry; her grandmother, the duchess, who rules the family with cunning and wit; and her mother, the ineffably cruel, self-centered and licentious Diana. Like no other work, Through a Glass Darkly is infused with intrigue, sweetened by romance and awash in the black ink of betrayal.</description>

  <description>For almost two years now, Kiera's boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she's ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her. When they head off to a new city to start their lives together, Denny at his dream job and Kiera at a top-notch university, everything seems perfect. Then an unforeseen obligation forces the happy couple apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeling lonely, confused, and in need of comfort, Kiera turns to an unexpected source—a local rock star named Kellan Kyle. At first, he's purely a friend that she can lean on, but as her loneliness grows, so does their relationship. And then one night everything changes...and none of them will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Darkly handsome and rich beyond imagining, the bold English conqueror was called Lyon for his-lion like fierceness. He had no match among enemies, or women ... until he met Lyonene, the green-eyed beauty whose fiery spirit matched his own. Through a whirlwind romance and stormy marriage, she endured every peril to be by his side... until jealousy and vicious lies drove her across the Irish Sea and into grave danger. One man could save her -- only the fierce Black Lyon had the courage to destroy the ruthless plot that had driven them apart and threatened the bond of love they had vowed could never be broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When tragedy strikes Michele Windsor’s world, she is forced to uproot her life and move across the country to New York City, to live with the wealthy, aristocratic grandparents she’s never met. In their old Fifth Avenue mansion filled with a century’s worth of family secrets, Michele discovers a diary that hurtles her back in time to the year 1910. There, in the midst of the glamorous Gilded Age, Michele meets the young man with striking blue eyes who has haunted her dreams all her life – a man she always wished was real, but never imagined could actually &lt;em&gt;exist.&lt;/em&gt; And she finds herself falling for him, into an otherworldly, time-crossed romance.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Michele is soon leading a double life, struggling to balance her contemporary high school world with her escapes into the past. But when she stumbles upon a terrible discovery, she is propelled on a race through history to save the boy she loves – a quest that will determine the fate of both of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;They were torn between pride and passion. . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a boastful wager, a bold flirtation meant to win a proposal from the most eligible officer in His Majesty's Royal Dragoons. How was the spoiled and pampered Catherine Augustine Ashbrooke to know the handsome stranger with the brooding midnight eyes would see through her plot and make her the pawn in a dangerous game of his own?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;United by a reckless game of chance. . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexander Cameron may have won the highborn English beauty in a duel, but not even the lure of long-forgotten desires could keep him from his meeting with destiny. He had no choice but to carry his reluctant bride off to the Highlands, to a world of ancient blood feuds and a brewing rebellion--a world where fiery passion and breathtaking courage would prove that even legendary warriors could lose their hearts.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Dream of Desire Awakened...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful Lady Emily dreams of the rapture of love and the joys of marriage. The youngest daughter of an English lord at war, she is shaken by the arrival of a mysterious stranger to her father's castle. Could this breathtaking man be Emily's yearned-for lover? Indeed, Draven de Montague, Earl of Ravenswood, has come for Emily...but romance has nothing to do with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Tender Embrace of an Enemy...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Draven would never have entered the home of his most hated adversary had not the King himself ordered him to take in his foe's daughter for a year to forge bonds of peace between their two feuding houses. Worse still, here is a lass whose exquisite loveliness could tempt Draven to betray his sworn vow never to let anther close to his heart. Emily knows the searing heat of her passion could burn down the defenses of this proud warrior. But will the surrender of the sweet nectar of his lips and his bold, sensuous caress ignite a blaze so hot it consumes them both?</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In Lori Lansens' astonishing second novel, readers come to know and love two of the most remarkable characters in Canadian fiction. Rose and Ruby are twenty-nine-year-old conjoined twins. &lt;br&gt;Born during a tornado to a shocked teenaged mother in the hospital at Leaford, Ontario, they are raised by the nurse who helped usher them into the world. Aunt Lovey and her husband, Uncle Stash, &lt;br&gt;are middle-aged and with no children of their own. They relocate from the town to the drafty old farmhouse in the country that has been in Lovey's family for generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joined to Ruby at the head, Rose's face is pulled to one side, but she has full use of her limbs. Ruby has a beautiful face, but her body is tiny and she is unable to walk. &lt;br&gt;She rests her legs on her sister's hip, rather like a small child or a doll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of their situation, the girls lead surprisingly separate lives. Rose is bookish and a baseball fan. &lt;br&gt;Ruby is fond of trash TV and has a passion for local history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose has always wanted to be a writer, and as the novel opens, she begins to pen her autobiography. &lt;br&gt;Here is how she begins:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have never looked into my sister's eyes. I have never bathed alone. I have never stood in the grass at night and raised my arms to a beguiling moon. &lt;br&gt;I've never used an airplane bathroom. Or worn a hat. Or been kissed like that. I've never driven a car. Or slept through the night. Never a private talk. Or solo walk. I've never climbed a tree.&lt;br&gt; Or faded into a crowd. So many things I've never done, but oh, how I've been loved. And, if such things were to be, I'd live a thousand lives as me, to be lovedso exponentially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Ruby, with her marvellous characteristic logic, points out that Rose's autobiography will have to be Ruby's as well — and how can she trust Rose to represent her story accurately? &lt;br&gt;Soon, Ruby decides to chime in with chapters of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novel begins with Rose, but eventually moves to Ruby's point of view and then switches back and forth.&lt;br&gt; Because the girls face in slightly different directions, neither can see what the other is writing, and they don't tell each other either. The reader is treated to sometimes overlapping&lt;br&gt; stories told in two wonderfully distinct styles. Rose is given to introspection and secrecy. Ruby's style is "tell-all" — frank and decidedly sweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We learn of their early years as the town "freaks" and of Lovey's and Stash's determination to give them as normal an upbringing as possible. &lt;br&gt;But when we meet them, both Lovey and Stash are dead, the girls have moved back into town, and they've received some ominous news. &lt;br&gt;They are on the verge of becoming the oldest surviving craniopagus (joined at the head) twins in history, but the question of whether they'll live to celebrate their thirtieth&lt;br&gt; birthday is suddenly impossible to answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Rose and Ruby, Lori Lansens has created two precious characters, each distinct and loveable in their very different ways,&lt;br&gt;and has given them a world in Leaford that rings absolutely true. The girls are unforgettable. &lt;strong&gt;The Girls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is nothing short of a tour de force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Kresley Cole introduces a thrilling new romance trilogy featuring fierce Scottish brothers with dangerous lives, dark desires, and a deadly curse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he exact revenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High in the Pyrenees, a band of mercenaries led by Courtland MacCarrick wages war for General Reynaldo Pascal. When Court turns on the evil general, Pascal orders him killed, but Court narrowly escapes and exacts revenge by kidnapping Pascal's exquisite Castilian fiancée.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can she deny her passions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Annalía Tristán Llorente despises her towering, barbaric captor almost as much as she does Pascal. Her inexplicable attraction to the Highlander only fuels her fury. But nothing will stop her from returning to Pascal—for if she doesn't wed him, she signs her brother's death warrant, as well as her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can there be love between them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment Court discovers that Anna's prim façade masks a fiery, brave lass, his heart's ensnared, and he dares to defy the curse that has shadowed his life—&lt;em&gt;to walk with death or walk alone.&lt;/em&gt; But Pascal vows that he'll hunt the two, never stopping until he's destroyed them both.</description>

  <description>Private investigator Charlotte Davidson was born with three things: looks; a healthy respect for the male anatomy; and the rather odd job title of grim reaper. Since the age of five, she has been helping the departed solve the mysteries of their deaths so they can cross over. Thus, when three lawyers from the same law firm are murdered, they come to her to find their killer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the meantime, Charley's dealing with a being more powerful - and definitely sexier - than any spectre she's ever come across before. With the help of a pain-in-the-ass skip tracer, a dead pubescent gangbanger named Angel, and a lifetime supply of sarcasm, Charley sets out to solve the highest profile case of the year and discovers that dodging bullets isn't nearly as dangerous as falling in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In a place where ecstasy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can cost you your life . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's a demon-slayer who hungers for sensual pleasure-but fears it will always be denied her. Until Tayla Mancuso lands in a hospital run by demons in disguise, and the head doctor, Eidolon, makes her body burn with unslakable desire. But to prove her ultimate loyalty to her peers, she must betray the surgeon who saved her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two lovers will dare to risk all.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eidolon cannot resist this fiery, dangerous woman who fills him with both rage and passion. Not only is she his avowed enemy, but she could very well be the hunter who has been preying upon his people. Torn between his need for the truth and his quest to find his perfect mate before a horrific transformation claims him forever, Eidolon will dare the unthinkable-and let Tayla possess him, body and soul . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: Lena Haloway is content in her safe, government-managed society. She feels (mostly) relaxed about the future in which her husband and career will be decided, and looks forward to turning 18, when she’ll be cured of deliria, a.k.a. love. She tries not to think about her mother’s suicide (her last words to Lena were a forbidden “I love you”) or the supposed “Invalid” community made up of the uncured just beyond her Portland, Maine, border. There’s no real point—she believes her government knows how to best protect its people, and should do so at any cost. But 95 days before her cure, Lena meets Alex, a confident and mysterious young man who makes her heart flutter and her skin turn red-hot. As their romance blossoms, Lena begins to doubt the intentions of those in power, and fears that her world will turn gray should she submit to the procedure. In this powerful and beautifully written novel, Lauren Oliver, the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt;, throws readers into a tightly controlled society where options don’t exist, and shows not only the lengths one will go for a chance at freedom, but also the true meaning of sacrifice. --&lt;em&gt;Jessica Schein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lauren Oliver’s &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; Playlist &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117060.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117061.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, the government requires that all teenagers be cured of love, a.k.a. deliria, to keep society safe. But 95 days before her treatment, Lena Haloway falls for a boy--and must face the truth about her own feelings and the world in which she lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this exclusive playlist, Lauren Oliver shares the songs that capture this haunting novel about the power of love and what one will risk in order to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Gayle Forman and Lauren Oliver: Author One-on-One&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gayle Forman is is a self-described "perpetual teenager" and an award-winning author and journalist whose articles have appeared in numerous publications. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and children.  She is the author of &lt;em&gt;Where She Went&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;.  Recently she sat down with Lauren Oliver to discuss their work. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Lauren interviewed Gayle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Gayle Forman&lt;/em&gt;: Lauren Oliver is kind of mind-blowing. She wrote her intensely moving debut, Before I Fall when she was 26, which seems impossible given the book’s depth and wisdom. She followed up with the deliciously provocative love story &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, the first of a trilogy, and her first middle-grade book, &lt;em&gt;Liesl &amp;amp; Po&lt;/em&gt; comes out in the fall of 2011. On top of that, she’s constantly cooking up book ideas for her literary development company. Somehow, she managed to slow down long enough for us to talk shop over lunch in our mutual hometown, Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img alt="Gayle Forman" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117062.gif" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; You have like 100 balls in the air. Are you one of those people who thrives on an insane amount of activity?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been busy and overextended my whole life. I wrote half of &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; while I had a full-time job, was a full-time grad student, and worked part-time in a nightclub. I wrote the first half of the book on my phone on the subway. I’d email the chapters to myself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; You wrote the book on your phone?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s very rare that I write on my computer. A lot of times I’m writing on subways or in the back of cabs or on airplanes. I know the exact quantity of lines on my BlackBerry and how it relates to word count.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that brings me right to my question about process. How does an idea become a book for you? How did &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; arrive?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’d read an essay by Gabriel Garcia Marquez that said that all great books are either about death or love and I’d already written about death. And I started thinking that I’d never written a love story. It was out of my comfort zone. The next day I was at the gym, and the TV was on and the news report was all about the swine flu epidemic. It was the latest in the flu scares. And I thought it was so weird how easily people become panicked. You can convince people that anything is an epidemic. So much is propaganda. And the two ideas just combined in my head. And the character of Lena started narrating immediately.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img alt="Lauren Oliver" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117063.gif" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Moral of the story, budding writers: Go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of my breakthrough ideas come at the gym or while showering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Me too!  And I’ll run out and start writing and be dripping in a towel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve actually ruined computers that way. I think what happens is punctuated equilibrium: a period when changes are accumulating but not visibly, the simmering is happening. Then, when your mind is very relaxed, what was unconscious becomes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; On the surface, there’s a very big leap between your first two books. &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; follows Sam, a prototypical mean girl who has to relive the last day of her life while &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; follows Lena who lives in a creepy world in which love has been outlawed. But really, both of these girls start out conformists and challenge the constraints on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Transformation is very important to me. I definitely am very interested in how people become who they are. In change. In characters who are damaged who and who feel initially unlovable—and in their redemption through feelings of love.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Who are you more like, Lena or Sam?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Sam is more similar to how I was in high school. I was rebellious. I went out and partied and did all the bad things that she did. Lena is just… she’s so obedient and so scared of doing anything wrong. I was so fond of her. I kind of loved her in this way, I felt so protective of her. She’s so fragile and also brave.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; That was exactly how I felt about Mia in &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;. I loved the strength of both Sam and Lena, in relation to their love interests. Even in &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, where Alex is the one who sparks Lena’s rebellion, she’s no damsel in distress.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t believe in damsels. That’s not a model of femininity or heroism I subscribe to. Everyone has to learn to save themselves. It can be through the mechanisms of loving other people but you have to learn to save yourself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Dystopian fiction is very hot right now. Did you have any idea you’d be on the cutting edge of this trend?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I never heard that word when I wrote &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, I knew what it meant but not as a category. &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to be a meditation on love, what it does, good and bad. Because there have been times when if I could have reached inside to take out my own heart out, I would’ve. Books can’t come from categories; they come from a desire to say something about the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"Lavishly crammed with the songs, smells, and costumes of late Victorian England" (&lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;), this delicious, steamy debut novel chronicles the adventures of Nan King, who begins life as an oyster girl in the provincial seaside town of Whitstable and whose fortunes are forever changed when she falls in love with a cross-dressing music-hall singer named Miss Kitty Butler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kitty is called up to London for an engagement on "Grease Paint Avenue," Nan follows as her dresser and secret lover, and, soon after, dons trousers herself and joins the act. In time, Kitty breaks her heart, and Nan assumes the guise of butch roue to commence her own thrilling and varied sexual education - a sort of Moll Flanders in drag - finally finding friendship and true love in the most unexpected places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing comparison to the work of Jeanette Winterson, Sarah Waters' novel is a feast for the senses - an erotic, lushly detailed historical novel that bursts with life and dazzlingly casts the turn of the century in a different light.</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring.... until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>When Jacqueline follows her longtime boyfriend to the college of his choice, the last thing she expects is a breakup two months into sophomore year. After two weeks in shock, she wakes up to her new reality: she's single, attending a state university instead of a music conservatory, ignored by her former circle of friends, and failing a class for the first time in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving a party alone, Jacqueline is assaulted by her ex's frat brother. Rescued by a stranger who seems to be in the right place at the right time, she wants nothing more than to forget the attack and that night - but her savior, Lucas, sits on the back row of her econ class, sketching in a notebook and staring at her. Her friends nominate him to be the perfect rebound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own. Suddenly appearances are everything, and knowing who to trust is anything but easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mature Young Adult / New Adult</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created 'perfect' life is about to unravel before her eyes. She's forced to be lab partners with Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the other side of town, and he is about to threaten everything she's worked so hard for: her flawless reputation, her relationship with her boyfriend, and the secret that her home life is anything but perfect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex is a bad boy and he knows it. So when he makes a bet with his friends to lure Brittany into his life, he thinks nothing of it. But soon Alex realizes Brittany is a real person with real problems, and suddenly the bet he made in arrogance turns into something much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a passionate story about looking beneath the surface, Simone Elkeles breaks through the stereotypes and barriers that threaten to keep Brittany and Alex apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A passionate, sweeping novel of a love that transcends time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;When twenty-something Wall Street analyst Kate Wilson attracts the notice of the legendary Julian Laurence at a business meeting, no one’s more surprised than she is. Julian’s relentless energy and his extraordinary intellect electrify her, but she’s baffled by his sudden interest. Why would this handsome British billionaire—Manhattan’s most eligible bachelor—pursue a pretty but bookish young banker who hasn’t had a boyfriend since college?&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The answer is beyond imagining . . . at least at first. Kate and Julian’s story may have begun not in the moneyed world of twenty-first-century Manhattan but in France during World War I, when a mysterious American woman emerged from the shadows of the Western Front to save the life of Captain Julian Laurence Ashford, a celebrated war poet and infantry officer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in modern-day New York, Kate and Julian must protect themselves from the secrets of the past, and trust in a true love that transcends time and space.</description>

  <description>A tunnel, a light, a door. And beyond it ... the unimaginable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Joanna Lander is a psychologist specializing in near-death experiences. She is about to get help from a new doctor with the power to give her the chance to get as close to death as anyone can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brilliant young neurologist, Dr. Richard Wright has come up with a way to manufacture the near-death experience using a psychoactive drug. Joanna’s first NDE is as fascinating as she imagined — so astounding that she knows she must go back, if only to find out why that place is so hauntingly familiar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But each time Joanna goes under, her sense of dread begins to grow, because part of her already knows why the experience is so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet just when Joanna thinks she understands, she’s in for the biggest surprise of all — ashattering scenario that will keep you feverishly reading until the final climactic page.</description>

  <description>No beauty in England could outshine Elizabeth Cameron, Countess of Havenhurst. But beneath her exquisite emerald eyes and cloud of golden hair lived a girl of rare gentleness, pride, and splendid, even ferocious, courage. In Ian Thornton's powerful embrace, Elizabeth felt the first stirrings of a passion that blazed through her senses, never to be denied. Yet for Thornton, a dangerously handsome man of secret wealth and mysterious lineage, the voyage to Elizabeth's heart was fraught with intrigue, scandal and a venomous jealousy! From London's salons to Scotland's Highlands, "Almost Heaven" weaves its sensuous spell...a tempestuous, dramatic romance between two lovers destined for each other, and for love's wildest abandon.</description>

  <description>WRITTEN IN MY OWN HEART’S BLOOD is the eighth novel in the world-famous OUTLANDER series. In June of 1778, the world turns upside-down. The British army withdraws from Philadelphia, George Washington prepares to move from Valley Forge in pursuit, and Jamie Fraser comes back from the dead to discover that his best friend has married Jamie’s wife. The ninth Earl of Ellesmere discovers to his horror that he is in fact the illegitimate son of the newly-resurrected Jamie Fraser (a rebel _and_ a Scottish criminal!) and Jamie’s nephew Ian Murray discovers that his new-found cousin has an eye for Ian’s Quaker betrothed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Claire Fraser deals with an asthmatic duke, Benedict Arnold, and the fear that one of her husbands may have murdered the other. And in the 20th century, Jamie and Claire’s daughter Brianna is thinking that things are probably easier in the 18th century: her son has been kidnapped, her husband has disappeared into the past, and she’s facing a vicious criminal with nothing but a stapler in her hand. Fortunately, her daughter has a miniature cricket bat and her mother’s pragmatism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best of historical fiction with a Moebius twist, WRITTEN IN MY OWN HEART’S BLOOD weaves the fibers of a family’s life through the tapestry of historical drama.</description>

  <description>Under the streets of London there's a place most people could never even dream of. A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Mayhew, a young businessman, is going to find out more than enough about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre. And a strange destiny awaits him down here, beneath his native city: Neverwhere.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nobody said love was perfect...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roman Draganesti is charming, handsome, rich...he's also a vampire. But this vampire just lost one of his fangs sinking his teeth into something he shouldn't have. Now he has one night to find a dentist before his natural healing abilities close the wound, leaving him a lop-sided eater for all eternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things aren't going well for Shanna Whelan, either. After witnessing a gruesome murder, she's next on the mob's hit list. And her career as a dentist appears to be on a downward spiral, because she's afraid of blood. When Roman rescues her from an assassination attempt, she wonders if she's found the one man who can keep her alive. Though the attraction between them is immediate and hot, can Shanna conquer her fear of blood to fix Roman's fang? And if she does, what will prevent Roman from using his fangs on her?</description>

  <description>Nine-year-old Oskar Schell is an inventor, amateur entomologist, Francophile, letter writer, pacifist, natural historian, percussionist, romantic, Great Explorer, jeweller, detective, vegan, and collector of butterflies. When his father is killed in the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Centre, Oskar sets out to solve the mystery of a key he discovers in his father's closet. It is a search which leads him into the lives of strangers, through the five boroughs of New York, into history, to the bombings of Dresden and Hiroshima, and on an inward journey which brings him ever closer to some kind of peace.</description>

  <description>Last year, Annabel was "the girl who has everything" — at least that's the part she played in the television commercial for Kopf's Department Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, she's the girl who has nothing: no best friend because mean-but-exciting Sophie dropped her, no peace at home since her older sister became anorexic, and no one to sit with at lunch. Until she meets Owen Armstrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tall, dark, and music-obsessed, Owen is a reformed bad boy with a commitment to truth-telling. With Owen's help, maybe Annabel can face what happened the night she and Sophie stopped being friends.</description>

  <description>For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime. The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn't want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for herself--and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.</description>

Her future looks bleak until, on a trip to the South of France, she meets Max de Winter, a handsome widower whose sudden proposal of marriage takes her by surprise.  She accepts, but whisked from glamourous Monte Carlo to the ominous and brooding Manderley, the new Mrs de Winter finds Max a changed man.  And the memory of his dead wife Rebecca is forever kept alive by the forbidding housekeeper, Mrs Danvers...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not since Jane Eyre has a heroine faced such difficulty with the Other Woman.  An international bestseller that has never gone out of print, &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; is the haunting story of a young girl consumed by love and the struggle to find her identity.</description>

  <description>A phenomenal worldwide bestseller for over thirty years, Richard Adams's Watership Down is a timeless classic and one of the most beloved novels of all time. Set in England's Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale of adventure, courage and survival follows a band of rabbits on their flight from the intrusion of man and the certain destruction of their home. Led by a stouthearted pair of brothers, they journey forth from their native Sandleford Warren through the harrowing trials posed by predators and adversaries, to a mysterious promised land and a more perfect society.</description>

  <description>One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Last Summer (of You and Me)&lt;/em&gt; comes an imaginative, inspired, magical book-a love story that lasts more than a lifetime. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Daniel has spent centuries falling in love with the same girl. Life after life, crossing continents and dynasties, he and Sophia (despite her changing name and form) have been drawn together-and he remembers it all. Daniel has "the memory", the ability to recall past lives and recognize souls of those he's previously known. It is a gift and a curse. For all the times that he and Sophia have been drawn together throughout history, they have also been torn painfully, fatally, apart. A love always too short.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Interwoven through Sophia and Daniel's unfolding present day relationship are glimpses of their expansive history together. From 552 Asia Minor to 1918 England and 1972 Virginia, the two souls share a long and sometimes torturous path of seeking each other time and time again. But just when young Sophia (now "Lucy" in the present) finally begins to awaken to the secret of their shared past, to understand the true reason for the strength of their attraction, the mysterious force that has always torn them apart reappears. Ultimately, they must come to understand what stands in the way of their love if they are ever to spend a lifetime together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A magical, suspenseful, heartbreaking story of true love, &lt;em&gt;My Name is Memory&lt;/em&gt; proves the power and endurance of a union that was meant to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A glorious novel of the controversial Richard III---a monarch betrayed in life by his allies and betrayed in death by history&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this beautifully rendered modern classic, Sharon Kay Penman redeems Richard III---vilified as the bitter, twisted, scheming hunchback who murdered his nephews, the princes in the Tower---from his maligned place in history with a dazzling combination of research and storytelling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born into the treacherous courts of fifteenth-century England, in the midst of what history has called The War of the Roses, Richard was raised in the shadow of his charismatic brother, King Edward IV. Loyal to his friends and passionately in love with the one woman who was denied him, Richard emerges as a gifted man far more sinned against than sinning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This magnificent retelling of his life is ?lled with all of the sights and sounds of battle, the customs and lore of the ?fteenth century, the rigors of court politics, and the passions and prejudices of royalty.</description>

  <description>Getting a boy to fall head-over-heels in love with you isn’t easy. Especially when he’s been in love with your cousin for as long as you can remember.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lana has lived her life in her cousin’s shadow. Ashton always made perfect grades, had tons of friends, and looks model-perfect. And she’s always had Sawyer Vincent—the only boy Lana’s ever wanted—wrapped around her finger. But now things are different. Lana has a chance to make Sawyer see her, and she’s taking it. If only he’d get over Ashton—because Lana is sick of second-best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sawyer’s heart is broken. He’s lost his best girl to his best friend. And then Lana comes to town. Ashton’s cousin has always been sweet and soft-spoken, but now she’s drop-dead gorgeous as well. Sawyer doesn’t know if Lana can heal his broken heart, but spending time with her might at least make Ashton jealous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as a carefree fling becomes a lusty game of seduction. Sawyer and Lana may have different motives, but their scintillating hookups are the same kind of steamy. . . .</description>

  <description>What happens when you're stalked by Death? You fall in love with him, of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pagan Moore doesn't cheat Death, but instead, falls in love with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen year old Pagan Moore has seen souls her entire life. Once she realized the strangers she often saw walking through walls were not visible to anyone else, she started ignoring them. If she didn't let them know she could see them, then they left her alone. Until she stepped out of her car the first day of school and saw an incredibly sexy guy lounging on a picnic table, watching her with an amused smirk on his face. Problem is, she knows he's dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only does he not go away when she ignores him, but he does something none of the others have ever done. He speaks. Pagan is fascinated by the soul. What she doesn't realize is that her appointed time to die is drawing near and the wickedly beautiful soul she is falling in love with is not a soul at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is Death and he's about to break all the rules.</description>

  <description>Rose loves Dimitri, Dimitri might love Tasha, and Mason would die to be with Rose...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s winter break at St. Vladimir’s, but Rose is feeling anything but festive. A massive Strigoi attack has put the school on high alert, and now the Academy’s crawling with Guardians—including Rose’s hard-hitting mother, Janine Hathaway. And if hand-to-hand combat with her mom wasn’t bad enough, Rose’s tutor Dimitri has his eye on someone else, her friend Mason’s got a huge crush on her, and Rose keeps getting stuck in Lissa’s head while she’s making out with her boyfriend, Christian! The Strigoi are closing in, and the Academy’s not taking any risks... This year, St. Vlad’s annual holiday ski trip is mandatory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the glittering winter landscape and the posh Idaho resort only create the illusion of safety. When three friends run away in an offensive move against the deadly Strigoi, Rose must join forces with Christian to rescue them. But heroism rarely comes without a price...</description>

  <description>Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go — especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil — and also her father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings — and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this breathtaking sequel to &lt;em&gt;City of Bones&lt;/em&gt;, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meghan Chase has a secret destiny; one she could never have imagined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something has always felt slightly off in Meghan's life, ever since her father disappeared before her eyes when she was six. She has never quite fit in at school or at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a dark stranger begins watching her from afar, and her prankster best friend becomes strangely protective of her, Meghan senses that everything she's known is about to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she could never have guessed the truth - that she is the daughter of a mythical faery king and is a pawn in a deadly war. Now Meghan will learn just how far she'll go to save someone she cares about, to stop a mysterious evil, no faery creature dare face; and to find love with a young prince who might rather see her dead than let her touch his icy heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Being connected to Daemon Black sucks…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection. So I’ve sworn him off, even though he’s running more hot than cold these days. But we’ve got bigger problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something worse than the Arum has come to town…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Department of Defense are here. If they ever find out what Daemon can do and that we're linked, I’m a goner. So is he. And there's this new boy in school who’s got a secret of his own. He knows what’s happened to me and he can help, but to do so, I have to lie to Daemon and stay away from him. Like that's possible. Against all common sense, I'm falling for Daemon. Hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But then everything changes…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve seen someone who shouldn’t be alive. And I have to tell Daemon, even though I know he’s never going to stop searching until he gets the truth. What happened to his brother? Who betrayed him? And what does the DOD want from them—from me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one is who they seem. And not everyone will survive the lies…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The new king of Camelot wears no shining armor: Arthur and his knights have fallen and a new king rules. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; In the darkest forest... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A scared, forsaken youth has become the most powerful –– and feared –– man in the world. Ruthless and unrestrained, Kerrigan has long ceased to be human. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the heart of London...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spirited peasant mired in drudgery, Seren dreams of becoming her own woman, but never expects that by fleeing her fate, she will meet her destiny. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their worlds are forever changed... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kerrigan's goal is simple: barter or kill Seren to claim Arthur's Round Table. Yet she is the one person who holds no fear of him. More than that, her nobility sparks something foreign inside him. In his nether realm, kindness is weakness and a king who harbors any sort of compassion loses his throne. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For countless centuries, Kerrigan has lived alone in the shadows. Now Seren's courage has forced him into the light that will bring either salvation to both of them...or death.</description>

  <description>The land of Terre d'Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that angels found the land and saw it was good...and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye. Sold into indentured servitude as a child, her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with very a special mission...and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel's Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundations of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further. And in the doing, it will take her to the edge of despair...and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies. Not since Dune has there been an epic on the scale of Kushiel's Dart-a massive tale about the violent death of an old age, and the birth of a new.</description>

  <description>East London, 1888 - a city apart. A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams. &lt;br&gt;But Fiona's life is shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit propels her rise from a modest West Side shop-front to the top of Manhattan's tea trade. But Fiona's old ghosts do not rest quietly, and to silence them, she must venture back to the London of her childhood, where a deadly confrontation with her past becomes the key to her future.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Werewolves can be dangerous if you get in their way, but they'll leave you alone if you are careful. They are very good at hiding their natures from the human population, but I'm not human. I know them when I meet them, and they know me, too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mercy Thompson's sexy next-door neighbor is a werewolf. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's tinkering with a VW bus at her mechanic shop that happens to belong to a vampire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then, Mercy Thompson is not exactly normal herself... and her connection to the world of things that go bump in the night is about to get her into a whole lot of trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An unabridged recording (9 hours, 14 minutes).</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From acclaimed historical novelist Kathleen Givens comes a magnificently conceived, intricately detailed novel that brings to vivid life the tumult, adventure, and passion of thirteenth-century Scotland, when Norse invaders laid claim to the land and its people—and an explosive clash of cultures, politics, and personal pride changed the world forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Scotland's western shore, the village of Somerstrath prepares for the joyous wedding celebration of Margaret MacDonald, the laird's daughter. But a dark storm of bloodshed and betrayal is closing in, as a merciless band of Vikings threatens the Highlands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Margaret is determined to hold the MacDonald clan together and to locate her abducted younger brother. But can she trust the noblemen from King Alexander's court, who insist that only by adhering to a betrothal conceived for political gain will she find safety? Or should she put her trust in an imposing half-Irish, half-Norse warrior? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gannon MacMagnus alone offers her hope of reuniting her family and vanquishing the barbarous Norsemen who would continue to rob her people of their God-given right to determine their own destinies. In whom should Margaret entrust the fate of the rugged, magnificent land she calls home?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &lt;em&gt;March&lt;/em&gt;, the journey of a rare illuminated manuscript through centuries of exile and war&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, is offered the job of a lifetime: analysis and conservation of the famed Sarajevo Haggadah, which has been rescued from Serb shelling during the Bosnian war. Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding - an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair - she begins to unlock the book's mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book's journey from its salvation back to its creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siècle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city's rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah's extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna's investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics. Her experiences will test her belief in herself and the man she has come to love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by a true story, &lt;em&gt;People of the Book&lt;/em&gt; is at once a novel of sweeping historical grandeur and intimate emotional intensity, an ambitious, electrifying work by an acclaimed and beloved author.</description>

By nightfall, he's in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an America made colourless by prohibition and the Depression, the circus is a refuge of sequins and sensuality.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first book in Alyson Noël's extraordinary new Immortals series. Enter an enchanting new world, where true love never dies...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a horrible accident claims the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever Bloom can see people's auras, hear their thoughts, and know someone's entire life story by touching them. Going out of her way to avoid human contact to suppress her abilities, she has been branded a freak at her new high school — but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damen is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy. He's the only one who can silence the noise and random energy in her head - wielding a magic so intense, it's as though he can peer straight into her soul. As Ever is drawn deeper into his enticing world of secrets and mystery, she's left with more questions than answers. And she has no idea just who he really is - or &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; he is. The only thing she knows to be true is that she's falling deeply and helplessly in love with him.</description>

  <description>At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the "gift" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: "Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally." When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.</description>

  <description>If you had the chance to change the course of history, would you? Would the consequences be what you hoped?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Epping, 35, teaches high-school English in Lisbon Falls, Maine, and cries reading the brain-damaged janitor's story of childhood Halloween massacre by their drunken father. On his deathbed, pal Al divulges a secret portal to 1958 in his diner back pantry, and enlists Jake to prevent the 11/22/1963 Dallas assassination of American President John F. Kennedy. Under the alias George Amberson, our hero joins the cigarette-hazed full-flavored world of Elvis rock'n'roll, Negro discrimination, and freeway gas-guzzlers without seat belts. Will Jake lurk in impoverished immigrant slums beside troubled loner Lee Harvey Oswald, or share small-town friendliness with beautiful high school librarian Sadie Dunhill, the love of his life?</description>

  <description>In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.</description>

  <description>Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, it’s his cousin Beau who catches Ashton’s eye. Beau is the sexiest guy she’s ever seen, and even though he’s dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on Sawyer’s girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. That’s why he does his best to keep his distance, even though he’s been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in Sawyer’s absence, Beau knows he should say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashton and Beau don’t want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. It’s getting way too hard to resist....</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meet Bridget Jones—&lt;/strong&gt;a 30-something Singleton who is certain she would have all the answers if she could:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;a. lose 7 pounds&lt;br&gt;b. stop smoking&lt;br&gt;c. develop Inner Poise&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;"123 lbs. (how is it possible to put on 4 pounds in the middle of the night? Could flesh have somehow solidified becoming denser and heavier? Repulsive, horrifying notion), alcohol units 4 (excellent), cigarettes 21 (poor but will give up totally tomorrow), number of correct lottery numbers 2 (better, but nevertheless useless)..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridget Jones' Diary&lt;/em&gt; is the devastatingly self-aware, laugh-out-loud daily chronicle of Bridget's permanent, doomed quest for self-improvement — a year in which she resolves to: reduce the circumference of each thigh by 1.5 inches, visit the gym three times a week not just to buy a sandwich, form a functional relationship with a responsible adult, and learn to program the VCR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the year, Bridget loses a total of 72 pounds but gains a total of 74. She remains, however, optimistic. Through it all, Bridget will have you helpless with laughter, and — like millions of readers the world round — you'll find yourself shouting, "Bridget Jones is me!"</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"No one tried to get involved with me, and I kept to myself.  This was the place where everything was supposed to be safe and easy.  How could Evan Mathews unravel my constant universe in just one day?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the affluent town of Weslyn, Connecticut, where most people worry about what to be seen in and who to be seen with, Emma Thomas would rather not be seen at all. She’s more concerned with feigning perfection while pulling down her sleeves to conceal the bruises - not wanting anyone to know how far from perfect her life truly is. Without expecting it, she finds love. It challenges her to recognize her own worth - but at the risk of revealing the terrible secret she’s desperate to hide. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reason to Breathe is an electrifying page turner from start to finish, a unique tale of life-changing love, unspeakable cruelty, and one girl’s fragile grasp of hope.</description>

  <description>Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate... until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.</description>

  <description>To save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian. With Valentine mustering the full force of his power to destroy all Shadowhunters forever, their only chance to defeat him is to fight alongside their eternal enemies. But can Downworlders and Shadowhunters put aside their hatred to work together? While Jace realizes exactly how much he's willing to risk for Clary, can she harness her newfound powers to help save the Glass City - whatever the cost?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love is a mortal sin and the secrets of the past prove deadly as Clary and Jace face down Valentine in the third installment of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling series The Mortal Instruments.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Our journey began in fire...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness—beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other's most private wounds... and desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An A-List Movie Star. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Christensen just wanted to be an actor. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine a life where fans would chase him, paparazzi would stalk him, and Hollywood studios would want to own him. While filming in Seaport, Rhode Island, Ryan ducks into a neighborhood bar for a quick escape from legions of screaming fans . . . and finds much more than he expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Small-Town Girl. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Nursing a recent heartbreak, Taryn Mitchell believes men are best kept at a safe distance. But when Ryan Christensen unexpectedly bursts through the front door of her pub, she can’t help but be drawn in by his humor, charm, and undeniable good looks. At six foot two, with dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and an incredible body, Ryan has every girl in Seaport swooning. But Taryn isn’t every other girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Relationship That Doesn’t Follow the Script. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Despite her better judgment, Taryn soon finds herself falling hard for Ryan. But is their bond strong enough to survive the tabloid headlines, the relentless paparazzi, and the jealous fans who seem determined to tear them apart?</description>

  <description>There’s something achingly familiar about Daniel Grigori.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious and aloof, he captures Luce Price’s attention from the moment she sees him on her first day at the Sword &amp;amp; Cross boarding school in sultry Savannah. He’s the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce – he goes out of his way to make that very clear. But she can’t let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, Luce has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret...even if it kills her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dangerously exciting and darkly romantic, FALLEN is a page-turning thriller and the ultimate love story.</description>

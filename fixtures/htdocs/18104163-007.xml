  <description>Inspired by Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, BLACK SPRING reimagines the passionate story in a fantasy 19th century society sustained by wizardry and the vengeance code of vendetta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna spent her childhood with Damek and her volatile foster sister Lina, daughter of the Lord of the village. Lina has magical powers, and in this brutal patriarchal society women with magical powers are put to death as babies. Lina’s father, however, refuses to kill her but when vendetta explodes in their village and Lina’s father dies, their lives are changed forever. Their new guardian Masko sends Anna away and reduces Lina to the status of a servant. Damek—mad with love for Lina—attempts to murder Masko, then vanishes for several years. Anna comes home five years later to find Lina about to marry a pleasant young farmer, and witnesses Damek’s vengeful return and its catastrophic consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passionate, atmospheric and haunting, BLACK SPRING will stay with readers long after they turn the final page.</description>

  <description>Ethan Godrick, bookstore employee and struggling grad student, always thought the stories he'd been told as a boy were just myths - he'd always believed none of it was real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when he comes across a musty, old book written about the legend that's mystified humankind for centuries, he finds himself catapulted into the very universe he'd dismissed as mere fantasy: Medieval Camelot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With King Arthur ascending the throne, his half-sister Morgana le Fay has dispatched assassins to end the King's life. Dissension has been born in Camelot, and dark magic is tearing the medieval city apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what role does Ethan play in all of this? Why did the book bring him to Camelot? How can an adventurous, technology-dependant nobody be of any use in a place where magic thrives off the weak, eradicates the strong, and makes even the least of us...into kings?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What happens when your family wants nothing more to do with you and you are left for dead?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare Evens is on her own. Her work-obsessed family no longer gives her the time of day, and after months of enduring neglect, she decides she's had enough. With only a small bag filled with clothes, her ID, and the clothes on her back, Clare boards a plane to Paris, hoping to start her life over far away from her family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucas Manners is a local Parisian trying to avoid his own disturbed home situation. He, too, seems to be searching for something in life, but doesn't know where to look to find it. Fate seems to smile on Lucas when he runs into his reason for living in the street one morning. Literally. She introduces herself as Clare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clare and Lucas continue to get to know one another, hoping that this is their golden opportunity to start a new life. Preferably together. But their families have other plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is worth fighting harder for? Family? Or love? And what would you be willing to sacrifice in order to keep that bond strong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you've lost everything can one person change you forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Due to sexual content and language, this book is recommended for 17+ Adult Contemporary Romance).</description>

  <description>After Morgana's defeat, Ethan Godrick's safety soon becomes the top priority for everyone in Camelot. Despite the tight security, Ethan finds himself increasingly taken with the fair maiden Kate, but his knowledge of her past makes him fear for their future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgana waits in the cells of Arthur's citadel, biding her time until she can achieve her traitorous agenda. Smith's death has set in motion several biological events that are destroying Camelot, and to Morgana's delight, Arthur will soon realize that bringing Smith back may be the only way to save his beloved city. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A threatening power is about to be unleashed, and its wielder wants nothing more than to see the world burn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the author that brought The Prophecy of Godrick comes the second book of the highly addicting Camelot Chronicles.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She gave him her innocence…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Aline Marsden was brought up for one reason: to make an advantageous marriage to a member of her own class. Instead, she willingly gave her innocence to John McKenna, a servant on her father's estate. Their passionate transgression was unforgivable—John was sent away, and Aline was left to live in the countryside…an exile from London society…and he took her love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…and he took her love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now McKenna has made his fortune, and he has returned—more boldly handsome and more mesmerizing than before. His ruthless plan is to take revenge on the woman who shattered his dreams of love. But the magic between them burns as bright as ever. And now he must decide whether to let vengeance take its toll…or risk everything for his first, and only, love.</description>

  <description>A Legendary Spellbook. Everyone desires it, but he controls it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most feared mercenary in the New Realms, Merc takes what he thinks is a routine job – guarding a magic spellbook until a secret auction takes place, one where only the most powerful and influential will have the opportunity to bid. But one moment of carelessness makes this job the most personal he has ever had, and if that wasn’t enough, his dreams are being invaded by a woman who his every instinct warns is trouble, but he can’t stop wanting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Legendary Power. Everyone covets it, but can she master it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One moment of terror took away Amana’s security and her brother’s freedom. Now her life is doing whatever she must to survive, all the while trying to find the way to release her brother from prison. Her answer comes in an offer from the Guild, but the cost is high – using a power she has kept locked away on a man who terrifies her even as he fascinates her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the auction draws ever closer, Merc and Amana are drawn into a game of cat-and-mouse, captor and captive as they battle for control, even as they work together to thwart the various factions who are willing to do anything to collect the spellbook for themselves. While grudging respect and mutual desire begin to shape their relationship, in the end, only one can prevail. What will be the ultimate decision, when the price of victory means the end to the other’s dearest dream?</description>

  <description>His Monster…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wulver has known captivity – the lash of the whip, the leather of the collar, the clang of prison bars. He has lived it, escaped it, and is determined to never experience it again. Only now, for the good of his pack, he is forced to work alongside a threat to his freedom – a pale-eyed woman who smells of moonlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…Will Not Submit to Her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Known as the Master of Monsters, Rule is able to bend even sentient creatures to her will. Revered and reviled in equal measure for her extraordinary powers, Rule is used to suspicious glances and outright hostility. Not that it matters, not even when it comes from an alpha werewolf whose beast calls to her unlike any other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, Wulver and Rule must uncover why werewolves are disappearing. As they follow a twisted path through the underbelly of the New Realms, Wulver has two battles to face – the battle to keep his beast from submitting to the Master of Monsters, and the battle to keep himself from claiming Rule.</description>

  <description>Sometimes scars are ugly. Sometimes scars are beautiful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Adam Desmarais is a boy who has never felt beautiful but has always borne many scars. He lives in a world where every day it is the same routine of playing pretend, where beauty never shows its face and life doesn’t stop for anybody. And that’s just fine, until he discovers the world outside might care something for the boy it left behind. Until he discovers that sometimes, you don’t have to be transparent and hide your scars to be safe and boundless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You just have to fall, and someone out there is going to catch you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;______________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Warning: This novel contains some triggering material, including sexual abuse of a minor. It is intended for mature teen readers.)&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>For as long as she can remember, Wren Gray’s goal has been to please her parents. But as high school graduation nears, so does an uncomfortable realization: Pleasing her parents once overlapped with pleasing herself, but now... not so much. Wren needs to honor her own desires, but how can she if she doesn’t even know what they are?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie Parker, on the other hand, is painfully aware of his heart’s desire. A gentle boy with a troubled past, Charlie has loved Wren since the day he first saw her. But a girl like Wren would never fall for a guy like Charlie—at least not the sort of guy Charlie believes himself to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet certain things are written in the stars. And in the summer after high school, Wren and Charlie’s souls will collide. But souls are complicated, as are the bodies that house them...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexy, romantic, and oh-so-true to life, this is an unforgettable look at first love from one of young adult fiction’s greatest writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Bad boy, meet bad girl.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante has a shiny new cuff wrapped around his ankle, and he doesn't like that mess one bit. His new accessory comes straight from Big Guy himself and marks the former demon as a liberator. Despite his gritty past and bad boy ways, Dante Walker has been granted a second chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dante is given his first mission as a liberator to save the soul of seventeen-year-old Aspen, he knows he’s got this. But Aspen reminds him of the rebellious life he used to live and is making it difficult to resist sinful temptations. Though Dante is committed to living clean for his girlfriend Charlie, this dude’s been a playboy for far too long…and old demons die hard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Charlie becoming the girl she was never able to be pre-makeover and Aspen showing him how delicious it feels to embrace his inner beast, Dante will have to go somewhere he never thought he’d return to in order to accomplish the impossible: save the girl he’s been assigned to, and keep the girl he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have more questions about the romance in THE LIBERATOR? Read a note from the author about Aspen's involvement in the story: &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/asl8qyy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://tinyurl.com/asl8qyy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>War between heaven and hell is coming, but Dante Walker makes it look damn good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante’s girlfriend, Charlie, is fated to save the world. And Aspen, the girl who feels like a sister, is an ordained soldier. In order to help both fulfill their destiny and win the war, Dante must complete liberator training at the Hive, rescue Aspen from hell, and uncover a message hidden on an ancient scroll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante is built for battle, but even he can’t handle the nightmares where spiders crawl from Aspen’s eyes, or the look on Charlie’s face that foretells of devastation. To make matters worse, the enemy seizes every opportunity to break inside the Hive and cripple the liberators. But the day of reckoning is fast approaching, and to stand victorious, Dante will have to embrace something inside himself he never has before—faith.</description>

  <description>In 2083, chocolate and coffee are illegal, paper is hard to find, water is carefully rationed, and New York City is rife with crime and poverty. And yet, for Anya Balanchine, the sixteen-year-old daughter of the city's most notorious (and dead) crime boss, life is fairly routine. It consists of going to school, taking care of her siblings and her dying grandmother, trying to avoid falling in love with the new assistant D.A.'s son, and avoiding her loser ex-boyfriend. That is until her ex is accidently poisoned by the chocolate her family manufactures and the police think she's to blame. Suddenly, Anya finds herself thrust unwillingly into the spotlight--at school, in the news, and most importantly, within her mafia family.&lt;p&gt;Engrossing and suspenseful, &lt;em&gt;All These Things I've Done&lt;/em&gt; is an utterly unique, unputdownable read that blends both the familiar and the fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In 2083, chocolate and coffee are illegal, paper is hard to find, water is carefully rationed, and New York City is rife with crime and poverty. And yet, for Anya Balanchine, the sixteen-year-old daughter of the city's most notorious (and dead) crime boss, life is fairly routine. It consists of going to school, taking care of her siblings and her dying grandmother, trying to avoid falling in love with the new assistant D.A.'s son, and avoiding her loser ex-boyfriend. That is until her ex is accidently poisoned by the chocolate her family manufactures and the police think she's to blame. Suddenly, Anya finds herself thrust unwillingly into the spotlight--at school, in the news, and most importantly, within her mafia family.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Written with the riveting storytelling and moral seriousness of authors like Emma Donoghue, Adam Johnson, Ann Patchett, and Curtis Sittenfeld, &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel &lt;/em&gt;is a suspenseful and haunting novel of an American foreign exchange student arrested for murder, and a father trying to hold his family together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Lily Hayes arrives in Buenos Aires for her semester abroad, she is enchanted by everything she encounters: the colorful buildings, the street food, the handsome, elusive man next door. Her studious roommate Katy is a bit of a bore, but Lily didn’t come to Argentina to hang out with other Americans.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Five weeks later, Katy is found brutally murdered in their shared home, and Lily is the prime suspect. But who is Lily Hayes? It depends on who’s asking. As the case takes shape—revealing deceptions, secrets, and suspicious DNA—Lily appears alternately sinister and guileless through the eyes of those around her: the media, her family, the man who loves her and the man who seeks her conviction. With mordant wit and keen emotional insight, &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel&lt;/em&gt; offers a prismatic investigation of the ways we decide what to see—and to believe—in one another and ourselves.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Jennifer duBois’s debut novel, &lt;em&gt;A Partial History of Lost Causes,&lt;/em&gt; was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Fiction and was honored by the National Book Foundation’s 5 Under 35 program. In &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel,&lt;/em&gt; duBois delivers a novel of propulsive psychological suspense and rare moral nuance. Who is Lily Hayes? What happened to her roommate? No two readers will agree. &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel&lt;/em&gt; will keep you guessing until the final page, and its questions about how much we really know about ourselves will linger well beyond.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Broken Harbour&lt;/em&gt;, a ghost estate outside Dublin – half-built, half-inhabited, half-abandoned – two children and their father are dead. The mother is on her way to intensive care. Scorcher Kennedy is given the case because he is the Murder Squad’s star detective. At first he and his rookie partner, Richie, think this is a simple one: Pat Spain was a casualty of the recession, so he killed his children, tried to kill his wife Jenny, and finished off with himself. But there are too many inexplicable details and the evidence is pointing in two directions at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scorcher’s personal life is tugging for his attention. Seeing the case on the news has sent his sister Dina off the rails again, and she’s resurrecting something that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control: what happened to their family, one summer at Broken Harbour, back when they were children. The neat compartments of his life are breaking down, and the sudden tangle of work and family is putting both at risk . . .</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She's trying to break out of prison--even though if she succeeds, she'll be the Commonwealth's most wanted fugitive. Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit's grandmother is missing. It turns out there are many things Scarlet doesn't know about her grandmother or the grave danger she has lived in her whole life. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother's whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder. Now, all of them must stay one step ahead of the vicious Lunar Queen Levana, who will do anything for the handsome Prince Kai to become her husband, her king, her prisoner.</description>

  <description>When your ex husband is a frightening psychopath and your new husband ends up mysteriously dead, it would seem logical to wonder... But Kate truly hadn’t. She had buried her tracks so deeply. And Lex’s death had seemed a tragic accident... Until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the space of three nights everything changes. A frightening encounter with a stranger on a lonely roadside, a prowler in the house when she returns home, a body found hanging in the bush...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear prods Kate into action. Has Wade found her after all these years? Was Lex’s death really an accident? She has to pull herself together and tamp down the impulse to cut all her ties and run as far and fast as she can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lots of people have secrets. This doesn’t have to be about her. How much did she know about Lex, really?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do people with a past somehow find each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From a former CIA officer comes the riveting account of a royal Middle Eastern family exiled to the American suburbs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When her father is killed in a coup, 15-year-old Laila flees from the war-torn middle east to a life of exile and anonymity in the U.S. Gradually she adjusts to a new school, new friends, and a new culture, but while Laila sees opportunity in her new life, her mother is focused on the past.

  <description>In classic fairy tale style, we embark on an enchanted journey with a young blacksmith—Joran—whose only desire is to live a peaceful, uncomplicated life in his forest village, a desire shattered by the sudden and bizarre disappearance of his wife, Charris. Later, Joran is plagued by nightmares of an unimaginable sea, where Charris remains trapped in a sand castle at the whim of the Moon. The goose woman insists he will find no rest from his nightmares until he solves the riddle of three keys. She tells him to travel the treacherous journey to the house of the Moon to find the answers he seeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to ignore the urgings of his nightmares, Joran sets out north seeking the Moon. Leaving a town and family where he never felt truly at home, Joran’s journey becomes more than just a search for his wife. His path also leads inward, for he must face emotions that have tormented him his entire life—feelings of alienation and anger, of despair and hurt. Along the way he rescues a wolf—a huge, imposing creature that becomes a companion, and eventually a trusted friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joran has the uncanny ability to speak with animals, and learns from the wolf, Ruyah, that he can manipulate his dreams to affect the real world. With Ruyah’s humor and guidance, Joran finds the courage and fortitude to press on, despite setbacks and disappointments. With the wolf by his side he endures the darkness at the end of the world and the ravings of the lunatic Moon, who sends him off—more confused than before—to the Palace of the Sun with a seemingly useless gift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After trekking through a vast, unmerciful desert, Joran arrives at the Palace of the Sun, where he meets the Sun’s mother, Sola. She helps Joran understand part of his riddle and then sends him, with the gift of a sunstone, to the cave of the South Wind, whom, she says, will finally reveal the truth to him about his wife—if he dares hear it. He and Ruyah travel south through jungle, and finally arrive at the cave. There Joran is swept along a vision where he sees his past, and in horror, learns truths that send him into deep despair. The South Wind dismisses him with one last gift—but like the other two gifts, he has no idea what they are for or how they will help him rescue his wife. She tells him to find the sea of his dreams—far west, beyond his imagining.</description>

  <description>Fall Pryor was a broken man, a man who had already fallen prior to the fateful day where he chases a kid who stole from his mall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His chase of a shoplifter leads him to an underground gang, notorious for their use of children; making them steal, sell drugs, sell their bodies and their souls. It's one soul that the gang has up for barter that Fall Pryor knows very well: his fifteen year old daughter who he hasn't seen in ten years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not because he chose to be erased out from her life, but because he hadn't known she was alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fall Pryor, the broken man, has to trudge through his demons, his horrible, hurtful mistakes and the pain he's eluded and hid from for the last ten years, to be the man his lost daughter needs, or he could lose her again and his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is The Chase.</description>

  <description>The ancient and acclaimed land of Ethryn is dying from pervasive drought, and while the king searches to find water, a mighty tower is uncovered in the desert. King Kael hopes the scroll found near the altar will tell of water sources, but when he touches the gemstone set in the altar, he falls into a coma that transports him back five thousand years where he is a slave building the tower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sha’kath, the wizard who oversaw the building of the tower all those centuries ago, had cast a spell that brings sand bubbling up from the ground so the workers can make bricks and complete the tower’s construction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the past, the king, whose is a young villager named Lael, is pursued relentlessly by God, given visions and declarations that he has been chosen to be a deliverer and a prophet , but Lael keeps fleeing. Then, when the tower is completed, heaven appoints him as deliverer, and he and his companions escape and head to their villages. God directs Lael to the sacred site and makes him the Keeper, then reveals his great power as he brings down judgment upon the world, confusing languages and scattering all in rebellion and defiance. Lael is shown the beginnings of Ethryn—a fertile and prosperous land that will become a great kingdom—and then he returns home to his family, where he fully embraces his destiny and delivers those who will listen. God then destroys his village with fire, but Lael leads his contingent to the sacred site and a new beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At the end of his life, Lael—who has watched Ethryn grow and prosper and who has been a gifted healer—returns to the tower to place his poem in the chest and put the gemstone on the altar. Before he takes his last breath, he turns and sees a girl—who is Ra’daf of the future—and when he dies, King Kael in the future wakes from his long sleep. Upon awakening he finds Ra’daf nearly dead by his bed—for the vizier had tried to stop her from waking the king with the amaranth in the vase. Lael heals her, and the vizier flees, unable to locate his secret chamber, but intent on discovering the locations of all seven sites and destroying them all. Kael, upon reviving, now knows where the site is buried under sand and takes his people there, where he again is set up as Keeper, and now, with heaven’s blessing, water erupts from the ground and ends the drought.</description>

A rift in space-time. Alien dogs that can camouflage and sniff rips in time with their supervac noses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be prepared to traverse shifting time streams and deeply entrenched shadow worlds in a wild and crazy fantasy/sci-fi near-future that will make your head spin and your heart pound. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chock-full of science and romance (yes, the two are compatible!), follow Bria Harrison, brilliant teenage daughter of two prominent scientists, as she searches for her mother, whom she insists is alive, despite the devastating explosion at the National Laboratory. While re-creating her mother's last experiment in her basement, Bria, her autistic brother Dylan, and four friends cause a rip in time-space--and out of the resultant black hole tumbles K-Six, a time sniffer who has come to get them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This doglike alien takes them back through the rip to his training world, where the teens must be altered to adapt to dangerous time confluences and worlds they must traverse to save the scientists trapped in a time eddy. If the scientists cannot be rescued soon, dark energy, now streaming into the galaxy at an alarming rate, will cause horrific destruction--including the end of all life on earth&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you like wild time-travel paradoxes, this novel's for you!</description>

  <description>When Pythius, the wicked young king of Paladya, learns of the hidden realm of Elysiel and the crystal scepter that protects that northern land, he journeys to kill the Keeper and steal the scepter. But his defiant act unleashes a terrible curse, and the Seer foretells his death one day at the hand of his son, now a newborn babe. To thwart the prophecy, he attempts to murder his child, but the queen escapes and sends the babe off in a trunk across the sea, where he is found and raised by a humble fisherman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later, Perthin, the cast-off babe now grown, hears his call of destiny, and is visited by a specter who tells him of the land of Elysiel and of the Gorgon—the evil creature fomenting war in the Northern Wastes. Perthin’s village of Tolpuddle is being ravaged by a monstrous sea beast sent by this enemy, and Perthin accepts the challenge to kill the creature by cutting off its head—although anyone who looks upon it turns to stone. Armed with magical shoes and a legendary sword, Perthin arrives in Elysiel, where the trolls lead him to the ice cavern where the sacred site made of crystal slabs awaits him to show him his future. Perthin feels a strange connection to this land, unaware that he is the heir to Elysiel’s throne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of heaven’s army, Perthin bests the enemy and returns to stop the sea monster as the beast is ravaging the kingdom of Paladya. He rescues the princess, who has been set out in the harbor as a sacrifice for the beast, and then stops the sea monster by exposing it to the Gorgon’s head, yet through his heroic efforts he unknowingly fulfills the prophecy foretold by the Seer. He returns to Tolpuddle a hero, where many surprising revelations await him as to his heritage and legacy, for he learns he is not truly a fisherman’s son but a king foretold. &lt;em&gt;The Crystal Scepter&lt;/em&gt; is an adventurous retelling of the classic story of Perseus and Medusa with a twist, as the heart of the story involves the gates of heaven—the sacred sites erected by heaven to prevent evil from taking over the world of mankind. It also has parallels to the story or Oedipus Rex, the 17th-century play by Spanish playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca entitled &lt;em&gt;Life is a Dream&lt;/em&gt;, and Shakespeare’s &lt;em&gt;The Comedy of Errors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15754878-a-thin-film-of-lies"&gt;alternate cover edition of ISBN13: 9781622080830&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story tells of a homicide detective, Fran Anders, whose next case throws her into the lives of Mike and Alisa Jepson, a couple whose marriage is disintegrating fast. When leads coming into the precinct point at Mike Jepson as guilty of murder, Fran watches the damage wrought on this couple, yet is unable to ignore the incriminating evidence. When Mike ends up arrested and in jail, Alisa takes comfort in a friend—Dee Dee—who moves in with her but soon becomes her worst nightmare. Mike hires a PI who uncovers clues to who is setting Mike up, but Alisa is caught in a trap before Mike can protect her. Although Fran reaches out to Alisa during her crisis of faith, she is unable to stop events from barreling toward a crash. Yet, despite the tragedies to follow, Fran sees how God has used the Jepsons’ trials and pain to bring Alisa back into His arms, with hope that Mike might follow suit.&lt;br&gt;Fran is a dedicated, no-frills cop who takes her job seriously but with a wry sense of humor. She suffers from the unbearable heat, from unrelenting allergies, but does not suffer fools. As much as she wants to please her superiors, she knows her true boss is—God—and she answers first and foremost to his leading, which sometimes takes her beyond the call of duty, often to the ire of those around her. A middle-aged, divorced, single parent with two teens, Fran hopes someday to find a great man and remarry, but she’s not holding her breath. Right now, she just wants to be a good cop and mother, and use her faith to help those she encounters in her line of work learn there’s someone “up there” who truly cares for them.</description>

  <description>1971: Jake Abrams is desperate to leave his oppressive home in Colorado and begina new life in college in LA, but his dreams are waylaid when he meets Leah, an antiwar protester who pushes him into marriage and family. Through four decades Jake struggles to raise a family, facing tragedy and heartbreak, searching for meaning and faith and challenging a silent God as he wanders through his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intended for Harm is a contemporary family saga set between 1971 to present day loosely derived from the biblical story of Jacob and his family. The title comes from Gen 50:20: “What you intended for harm, God intended for good—for the saving of life...” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intended for Harm explores the depth of a heart that doubts, and how it finds its way home to a God who has never been absent. It delves into the theme of harm—how those suffering loss and unmet needs intend harm toward others, but can find redemption through grace and humility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in a contemporary flash-fiction style, Intended for Harm civers forty years, each chapter a year, with a theme from a hit song for that year. Each scene is a fifteen-minute snapshot of the Abrams family, a "photo album" of Jake's life of wandering "through the wilderness" and coming home to faith at the end of his life. Anyone familiar with the Bible will recognize many similarities to the famous story of Jacob and his son Joseph. At the heart of this story is an exploration of fathers and sons, of loyalty and betrayal. And mostly, how we often intend harm to others because of wounds we carry in our souls, often without our knowing.</description>

  <description>When the simple, backward village of Wentwater begins disappearing one word at a time, no one can figure out how to stop it. Not the learned men living up in the Heights nor the superstitious leaders of the village. But those who had attended the baby naming ceremony seventeen years earlier remember the words of the marsh witch, and her pronouncement that the babe would one day cause the unraveling of Wentwater. In their fear, the villagers banish the parents and set their cottage on fire, and the babe was thought to have perished in the flames. But . . . did she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teralyn lives in the Heights and wants nothing more than to create beautiful music on her lap harp. When she comes down to the village for a festival, she falls in love with a villager named Fromer, much to the fury of Fromer’s brother, Justyn. Justyn’s jealousy moves him to make a deal with the witch, and when Wentwater vanishes due to a backfiring spell, it leaves Teralyn, the only person left in the kingdom, with a terrible choice. She must leave her life and forget Wentwater, or she can spend seven long years restoring everything back to the way it was, by spinning nettle into thread and stitching the world back . . . one word at a time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Unraveling of Wentwater &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;explores love, jealousy, mercy, and judgment. It spins a tale about the power and magic of words, and as the marsh witch, who keeps words in a jar, warns, “Be careful with your words, they have consequences!” Secrets and superstitions abound in the kingdom, but only a water creature who lives at the bottom of the lake and guards the sacred site knows the truth and can help Teralyn restore all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this fourth installment of The Gates of Heaven fantasy series, readers will learn of the fourth of seven sacred sites heaven set up on earth to prevent evil from gaining a stronghold over the hearts of men. Inspired by the traditional fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, readers will be taken on a journey that will leave them, in a word . . . speechless.</description>

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It is not the land that is dangerous, Callen. The danger lies in your heart. Others have lost their lives searching for the bridge. Are you certain you are prepared to pay that price?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Jadiel is twelve and things couldn’t get much worse—or could they?  Not long after her mother is killed in a tragic accident, her father, Ka’rel, marries a vile and abusive woman named Huldah, but Jadiel sees how he simmers under Huldah’s intoxicating enchantment. Jadiel’s wicked stepmother means to get rid of Jadiel, and sends her off with a threat and an impossible task: bring back the leaves from the Eternal Tree by the next full moon or her father will die. Heartsick and hopeless, Jadiel sets out alone and afraid.&lt;br&gt;     Callen, a woodworking apprentice for Jadiel’s uncle in Wolcreek Vale, discovers some weathered drawings of an exquisitely detailed bridge made entirely of wood and embellished with mysterious symbols that appear to be ancient script. Obsessed with finding this bridge, he sets off seeking clues to its possible existence, unknowingly beginning a perilous and mystifying undertaking. On his journey, he rescues Jadiel from brigands and learns their quests are linked—as the elusive bridge Callen seeks is crafted from the rare tree Jadiel must find. The trail of clues leads them to the forbidden Land of Darkness, where they must face the greatest dangers of all—what lies in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>A happily married man with three small children decides one day he no longer wants to live. He gives himself leukemia and nine months later is dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the conundrum Lisa Sitteroff is determined to solve regarding her dead father—the tale her mother, Ruth, told Lisa and her two brothers, Rafferty and Neal, throughout their childhood. But Lisa, now thirty and watching Raff suffer from the ravages of bipolar illness, believes if she can solve this puzzle, she might somehow save her brother. For Raff’s pain is intrinsically tied up with feelings of parental abandonment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as a noble goal for Lisa soon grows into a vicious family war, wreaking destruction on Lisa’s marriage. Lisa discovers details of her parents’ relationship that her mother has long hidden. Shocking clues appear as Lisa reads a letter her father, Nathan, wrote before he died, prompting her to visit Nathan’s former boss, Ed Hutchinson. From him, Lisa learns that her engineer father helped design a generator run by radioactive materials. Ed lets slip that Nathan participated in a dangerous secret experiment, a fact her mother discounts as Nathan’s cause of death. Accusations and excuses fly. Yet, how much of what Lisa uncovers is true? Is truth solely subjective? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lisa sifts through layers of lies as she journeys into her father’s story, seeking to understand this man she never knew. Meanwhile, her mother responds in fury and tries to destroy Lisa’s life, determined to keep Lisa from uncovering her dark secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conundrum explores the rocky landscape of betrayal and truth, asking whether a search for truth is worth the price, and showing how separating from toxic family members might sometimes be the only recourse for survival. Lisa pays a high price for truth, but in the end finds it worthwhile.</description>

  <description>An ancient curse plagues the kingdom of Sherbourne, and unless it is stopped, all will fall to ruin. The King, obsessed with greed, cannot see the danger. But his teenage twin children, Aletha and Adin, know they must act. A hermit leads Adin to a magical map that will send him back in time to discover the origin of the curse. Once back, Adin must find the Keeper, who protects the Gate of Heaven, but all he has is a symbol as a clue to guide him. Unbeknown to Adin, Aletha follows her brother, but they both arrive in Sherbourne’s past at the precipice of a great war, and there is little time to discover how to counteract the curse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One unexpected disaster after another forces the twins to make difficult choices. Adin’s only hope to correct the past is to return to the future to manipulate events so his quest can succeed. Through his trials and failures, Adin learns that nothing can stop heaven from accomplishing its goal, and that all events work for the good of those who trust heaven. An epic fairy tale with surprising twists, embracing the enduring power of love and faith.</description>

  <description>Lila Carmichael, outrageous, bawdy comedienne, is a rich and powerful woman in television. But, it's not enough she has everything she desires; for fifteen years she has been obsessively orchestrating payback to five unsuspecting, former schoolmates—“friends” who played a nasty trick on her, and now it’s her turn for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the flattering auspices of a cozy college reunion, these unsuspecting classmates are invited to Lila’s private island for a weekend from hell where Lila forces them to play a vicious parlor game—a psychological “Ten Little Indians,” where one by one Lila’s guests are figuratively killed-off. Yet, revenge turns bittersweet when the weekend is over and one guest is dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A psychological spinoff of Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians" that Publisher's Weekly calls "A page-turning thrill ride that will have readers holding their breaths the whole way through."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Such wonderful children. Such a beautiful mother. Such a lovely house. Such endless terror!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn't that she didn't love her children. She did. But there was a fortune at stake--a fortune that would assure their later happiness if she could keep the children a secret from her dying father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she and her mother hid her darlings away in an unused attic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just for a little while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the brutal days swelled into agonizing years. Now Cathy, Chris, and the twins wait in their cramped and helpless world, stirred by adult dreams, adult desires, served a meager sustenance by an angry, superstitious grandmother who knows that the Devil works in dark and devious ways. Sometimes he sends children to do his work--children who--one by one--must be destroyed....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     'Way upstairs there are&lt;br&gt;       four secrets hidden.&lt;br&gt;         Blond, beautiful, innocent&lt;br&gt;           struggling to stay alive....</description>

  <description>Cindy Layton and Jay DeMatteo are back again! The Sugar Ticket chronicles their marital journey as the two twice-divorced adults learn to embrace the sweetness of their present. When the inevitable complications arise, will the DeMatteo's gently overcome their obstacles by alleviating the sour taste of the past through the light-hearted humor you enjoyed in Dinosaurs and Cherry Stems, or will they sweep their issues under the proverbial taboo-topic carpet? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out how these two mid-life adolescents meet their daily tribulations head on, as they conquer their fears, secrets revealed, and the most fundamental challenge of all - remaining in love forever.</description>

  <description>Twice divorced, cynical Cindy Layton feels like a relic with prehistoric baggage, and doubts she can muster the courage to establish a new relationship, even if it's on her own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her journey out of the Stone Age hits freaky, hilarious turbulence when she joins an Internet dating service. The scammers and weirdoes she meets in cyberspace make Cindy want to crawl back into her cave, until she receives an accidental email from Jay DeMatteo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jay has the dating blues, too, but after meeting Cindy, reconsiders his options. Now it's up to him to convince her it's never too late to pursue a meaningful relationship, even when a couple is struggling with midlife adolescence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apollo 13&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Cast Away&lt;/em&gt; in this grippingly detailed, brilliantly ingenious man-vs-nature survival thriller, set on the surface of Mars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six days ago, astronaut Mark Watney became one of the first men to walk on the surface of Mars. Now, he's sure he'll be the first man to die there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It started with the dust storm that holed his suit and nearly killed him, and that forced his crew to leave him behind, sure he was already dead. Now he's stranded millions of miles from the nearest human being, with no way to even signal Earth that he's alive--and even if he could get word out, his food would be gone years before a rescue mission could arrive. Chances are, though, he won't have time to starve to death. The damaged machinery, unforgiving environment, or plain-old "human error" are much more likely to get him first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Mark isn't ready to give up yet. Drawing on his ingenuity, his engineering skills--and a relentless, dogged refusal to quit--he steadfastly confronts one seemingly insurmountable obstacle after the next. But will his resourcefulness be enough to overcome the impossible odds against him?</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of &lt;em&gt;I Am the Messenger,&lt;/em&gt; has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>Caledonia has been kept a secret her entire life, raised in isolation by two very troubled people. Despite her parents' disturbing fits, Cal is perfectly content to live as one with the nature that surrounds her, finding adventure inside the pages of her beloved books.  When an awful tragedy tears her away from her remote cabin in the woods, nothing she’s ever read has prepared her for a world that she knows very little about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Girls and motorcycles are what bad-boy Cal’s life is all about. Brought up in a raucous party house by his biker brother, he’s free to do as he pleases, going through the motions on his final days of high school. Aimless, Cal stopped thinking about his future a long time ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attacked by a gang of thugs while running an errand for his brother, Cal is in serious trouble until a fierce girl appears out of nowhere to intervene. She chases off three grown men, sparing Cal a brutal beating before disappearing into the night like a spirit. He can’t stop thinking about his mysterious rescuer, and when she turns out to be the weird new girl at school who goes out of her way to avoid him, he can’t contain his curiosity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s never met anyone like her before, and the more he learns about the unusual girl with an unusual talent, the more he wants to know. Cal can’t help falling for Cal, but can he keep her from falling victim to a dangerous enemy from her parents' tragic past?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"...I was hooked from the first page, and felt downright resentful of dinner for making me put the book down." —Tempting Persephone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Marketing manager Katherine "Kitty" Katt had just finished a day on jury duty. When she stepped out of the Pueblo Caliente courthouse, all she was thinking about was the work she had to get caught up on. Then her attention was caught by a fight between a couple that looked like it was about to turn ugly. But ugly didn't even begin to cover it when the "man" suddenly transformed into a huge, winged monster right out of a grade Z science fiction movie and went on a deadly killing spree. In hindsight, Kitty realized she probably should have panicked and run screaming the way everyone around her was doing. Instead she sprinted into action to take down the alien.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the middle of all the screeching and the ensuing chaos, a hunk in an Armani suit suddenly appeared beside her, introduced himself as Jeff Martini with "the agency," and then insisted on leading her to a nearby limo to talk to his "boss." And that was how Kitty's new life among the aliens began...&lt;em&gt;Touched by an Alien&lt;/em&gt; is the thrilling first installment of the &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; novels.&lt;br&gt;  </description>

  <description>Is Ahmose's divine gift a blessing or a curse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second daughter of the Pharaoh, Ahmose has always dreamed of a quiet life as a priestess, serving Egypt's gods, ministering to the people of the Two Lands.  But when the Pharaoh dies without an heir, she is given instead as Great Royal Wife to the new king – a soldier of common birth.  For Ahmose is god-chosen, gifted with the ability to read dreams, and it is her connection to the gods which ensures the new Pharaoh his right to rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahmose's elder sister Mutnofret has been raised to expect the privileged station of Great Royal Wife; her rage at being displaced cannot be soothed.  As Ahmose fights the currents of Egypt's politics and Mutnofret's vengeful anger, her youth and inexperience carry her beyond her depth and into the realm of sacrilege.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To right her wrongs and save Egypt from the gods' wrath, Ahmose must face her most visceral fear: bearing an heir.  But the gods of Egypt are exacting, and even her sacrifice may not be enough to restore the Two Lands to safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sekhmet Bed&lt;/em&gt; is the first volume of L. M. Ironside's series The She-King, a family saga of the Thutmosides, one of ancient Egypt's most fascinating royal families.</description>

  <description>Minerva True is a River Dweller and mystic who lives deep in the forested hills of a river valley on the fringes of the world. She is the only person who sees the ancient danger that resides on a nearby chapel grounds. Most pay little heed to her warnings, and in the end only a small band of friends stand beside her. A tale of love and duty ensues, challenging the destinies of Minerva, the young hero Leith, his lover Aubrey, and the mute boy, Deverell. Leith’s half-crazed mother Calpurnia has her own aspirations, however, that prove detrimental not only to Minerva, but to everyone she comes in contact with.</description>

  <description>It's not always easy being a female warrior with a nickname like Annwyl the Bloody. Men tend to either cower in fear - a lot - or else salute. It's true that Annwyl has a knack for decapitating legions of her ruthless brother's soldiers without pausing for breath. But just once it would be nice to be able to really talk to a man, the way, she can talk to Fearghus the Destroyer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad that Fearghus is a dragon, of the large, scaly and deadly type. With him, Annwyl feels safe - a far cry from the feelings aroused by the hard-bodied, arrogant knight Fearghus has arranged to help train her for battle. With her days spent fighting a man who fill her with fierce, heady desire, and her nights spent in the company of a magical creature who could smite a village just by exhaling, Annwyl is sure life couldn't get any stranger. She's wrong...</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;When I was a little girl, Daddy told me never to fear the dark. “We exist because of the darkness,” he told me. “All of you are daughters of darkness.”Beloved bestselling author V.C. Andrews’s passion for vampires comes to spellbinding life in a long-awaited novel of dark desires as all-consuming—and forbidden—as in &lt;em&gt;Flowers in the Attic&lt;/em&gt;. One night, with the sound of a young man’s scream, high school senior Lorelei discovers that her stern but loving father, who adopted Lorelei and her sisters as infants, is no ordinary man. He has raised his beautiful girls for one purpose: to lure young men into their world of shadows. Like her sisters, Lorelei has been trained in the art of seduction and warned never to fall in love. But when she meets a handsome and charming classmate, she boldly defies her family and follows her heart—even &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;love is a poison. . . .&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerously enticing and deliriously intoxicating, V.C. Andrews’s &lt;/em&gt;Daughter of Darkness &lt;em&gt;will leave readers thirsting for more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, fairies were the stuff of bedtime stories and sweet dreams. Then came the mutations, and the dreams became nightmares. Mosquito-size fairies now indulge their taste for human blood—and for most humans, a fairy bite means insanity or death. Luckily, Annabelle Lee isn’t most humans. The hard-drinking, smart-mouthed, bicycle-riding redhead is immune to fairy venom, and able to do the dirty work most humans can’t. Including helping law enforcement— and Cane Cooper, the bayou’s sexiest detective—collect evidence when a body is discovered outside the fairy-proof barricades of her Louisiana town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Annabelle isn’t equipped to deal with the murder of a sixyear- old girl or a former lover-turned-FBI snob taking an interest in the case. Suddenly her already bumpy relationship with Cane turns even rockier, and even the most trust-worthy friends become suspects. Annabelle’s life is imploding: between relationship drama, a heartbreaking murder investigation, Breeze-crazed drug runners, and a few too many rum and Cokes, Annabelle is a woman on the run—from her past, toward her future, and into the arms of a darkness waiting just for her. . . .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Small towns are nothing if not friendly. Friendship, Wisconsin (population: &lt;s&gt;689&lt;/s&gt; 688) is no different. Around here, everyone wears a smile. And no one ever locks their doors. Until, that is, high school sweetheart Ruth Fried is found murdered. Strung up like a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Friendship’s police are more adept at looking for lost pets than catching killers. So Ruth’s best friend, Kippy Bushman, armed with only her tenacious Midwestern spirit and Ruth’s secret diary (which Ruth’s mother had asked her to read in order to redact any, you know, sex parts), sets out to find the murderer. But in a quiet town like Friendship—where no one is a suspect—anyone could be the killer.</description>

  <description>**Contains graphic content involving the sensitive topic of rape and its aftermath. Not intended for teens under 18.**&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sometimes bad things happen to beautiful people.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When socialite party girl Mia Abbott-Renou wakes up in a garden she has little recall of the previous night -- except that she is naked...hurt...terrified. Not only has she been raped, but she knows one of her assailants: the son of a wealthy politician who happens to be her own father’s political ally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mia wants and needs justice. Except this privileged boy has an alibi and her father forbids her from going to the police. It’s a critical election year, one that his party might lose if his image as a doting father is soured due to Mia being labeled a lush or worse, promiscuous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devastated at not having the support of her family, Mia finds herself in a tug-of-war with her conscience over what to do, especially since she can’t remember exactly what happened that night. Worse, the men who attacked her have hurt several other girls, and Mia may be the key to stopping them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mia tries to forget, until the unthinkable happens, and she’s left reeling once again until she realizes that her strength will bring healing and unlocking her memories will bring justice.</description>

Suddenly she is a Sassenach—an "outlander"—in a Scotland torn by war and raiding border clans in the year of our Lord...1743.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire's destiny in soon inextricably intertwined with Clan MacKenzie and the forbidden Castle Leoch. She is catapulted without warning into the intrigues of lairds and spies that may threaten her life ...and shatter her heart.  For here, James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, shows her a passion so fierce and a love so absolute that Claire becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire...and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This eBook includes the full text of the novel plus the following additional content:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;• An excerpt from Diana Gabaldon’s &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5293561.Dragonfly_in_Amber" title="Dragonfly in Amber"&gt;Dragonfly in Amber&lt;/a&gt;, the second novel in the &lt;em&gt;Outlander&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;br&gt;• An interview with Diana Gabaldon&lt;br&gt;• An &lt;em&gt;Outlander&lt;/em&gt; reader’s guide</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Adam Christopher’s dazzling first novel, &lt;em&gt;Empire State,&lt;/em&gt; was named the Best Book of 2012 by&lt;em&gt; SciFi Now&lt;/em&gt; magazine. Now he explores new dimensions of time and space in &lt;em&gt;The Burning Dark.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in the day, Captain Abraham Idaho Cleveland had led the Fleet into battle against an implacable machine intelligence capable of devouring entire worlds. But after saving a planet, and getting a bum robot knee in the process, he finds himself relegated to one of the most remote backwaters in Fleetspace to oversee the decommissioning of a semi-deserted space station well past its use-by date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all is not well aboard the U-Star &lt;em&gt;Coast City.&lt;/em&gt; The station’s reclusive Commandant is nowhere to be seen, leaving Cleveland to deal with a hostile crew on his own. Persistent malfunctions plague the station’s systems while interference from a toxic purple star makes even ordinary communications problematic. Alien shadows and whispers seem to haunt the lonely corridors and airlocks, fraying the nerves of everyone aboard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isolated and friendless, Cleveland reaches out to the universe via an old-fashioned space radio, only to tune in to a strange, enigmatic signal: a woman’s voice that seems to echo across a thousand light-years of space. But is the transmission just a random bit of static from the past—or a warning of an undying menace beyond mortal comprehension?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the darkest places, even love is deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Juliet Moreau has built a life for herself in London—working as a maid, attending church on Sundays, and trying not to think about the scandal that ruined her life. After all, no one ever proved the rumors about her father's gruesome experiments. But when she learns he is alive and continuing his work on a remote tropical island, she is determined to find out if the accusations are true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accompanied by her father's handsome young assistant, Montgomery, and an enigmatic castaway, Edward—both of whom she is deeply drawn to—Juliet travels to the island, only to discover the depths of her father's madness: He has experimented on animals so that they resemble, speak, and behave as humans. And worse, one of the creatures has turned violent and is killing the island's inhabitants. Torn between horror and scientific curiosity, Juliet knows she must end her father's dangerous experiments and escape her jungle prison before it's too late. Yet as the island falls into chaos, she discovers the extent of her father's genius—and madness—in her own blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by H. G. Wells's classic The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Madman's Daughter is a dark and breathless Gothic thriller about the secrets we'll do anything to know and the truths we'll go to any lengths to protect.</description>

  <description>This e-book only Booster Pack is designed for readers who have read the first edition of "The Girl Who Was on Fire." &lt;br&gt;The Booster Pack includes ONLY the three brand new essays included in "The Girl Who Was on Fire - Movie Edition," plus access to 10,000 words of extra, e-book only content: the contributors' thoughts on the "Hunger Games" film. &lt;br&gt;The first edition of "The Girl Who Was on Fire" offered even more to think about for readers already engrossed by the world of the Hunger Games. From the trilogy's darker themes of violence and social control to reality television, fashion and weaponry, the collection's exploration of the Hunger Games by other YA writers revealed exactly how rich, and how perilous, protagonist Katniss' world really is. &lt;br&gt;These three new essays discuss game theory in the Hunger Games, mixed opinions about "Mockingjay," and why we shouldn't forget about Gale, just because Katniss chose Peeta. &lt;br&gt;This e-book also gives you access to &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17700969-the-girl-who-was-on-fire---movie-edition-extra-movie-content"&gt;special content&lt;/a&gt; from our writers right after the release of "The Hunger Games" on the big screen: their thoughts on the film.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Kai and Ginny grew up together–best friends since they could toddle around their building’s rooftop rose garden. Now they’re seventeen, and their relationship has developed into something sweeter, complete with stolen kisses and plans to someday run away together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one night, Kai disappears with a mysterious stranger named Mora–a beautiful girl with a dark past and a heart of ice. Refusing to be cast aside, Ginny goes after them and is thrust into a world she never imagined, one filled with monsters and thieves and the idea that love is not enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Ginny and Kai survive the journey, will she still be the girl he loved–and moreover, will she still be the girl who loved him?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A novel about love, loss, and sex -- but not necessarily in that order.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; Before her mother died, Shelby promised three things: to listen to her father, to love as much as possible, and to live without restraint. Those Promises become harder to keep when Shelby's father joins the planning committee for the Princess Ball, an annual dance that ends with a ceremonial vow to live pure lives -- in other words, no "bad behavior," no breaking the rules, and definitely no sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn between Promises One and Three, Shelby makes a decision -- to exploit a loophole and lose her virginity before taking the vow. But somewhere between failed hookup attempts and helping her dad plan the ball, Shelby starts to understand what her mother really meant, what her father really needs, and who really has the right to her purity.</description>

  <description>Celia Reynolds is the youngest in a set of triplets and the one with the least valuable power. Anne can see the future, and Jane can see the present, but all Celia can see is the past. And the past seems so insignificant -- until Celia meets Lo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lo doesn't know who she is. Or who she was. Once a human, she is now almost entirely a creature of the sea -- a nymph, an ocean girl, a mermaid -- all terms too pretty for the soulless monster she knows she's becoming. Lo clings to shreds of her former self, fighting to remember her past, even as she's tempted to embrace her dark immortality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a handsome boy named Jude falls off a pier and into the ocean, Celia and Lo work together to rescue him from the waves. The two form a friendship, but soon they find themselves competing for Jude's affection. Lo wants more than that, though. According to the ocean girls, there's only one way for Lo to earn back her humanity. She must persuade a mortal to love her . . . and steal his soul.</description>

  <description>As a child, Gretchen's twin sister was taken by a witch in the woods. Ever since, Gretchen and her brother, Ansel, have felt the long branches of the witch's forest threatening to make them disappear, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later, when their stepmother casts Gretchen and Ansel out, they find themselves in sleepy Live Oak, South Carolina. They're invited to stay with Sophia Kelly, a beautiful candy maker who molds sugary magic: coveted treats that create confidence, bravery, and passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life seems idyllic and Gretchen and Ansel gradually forget their haunted past -- until Gretchen meets handsome local outcast Samuel. He tells her the witch isn't gone -- it's lurking in the forest, preying on girls every year after Live Oak's infamous chocolate festival, and looking to make Gretchen its next victim. Gretchen is determined to stop running and start fighting back. Yet the further she investigates the mystery of what the witch is and how it chooses its victims, the more she wonders who the real monster is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gretchen is certain of only one thing: a monster is coming, and it will never go away hungry.</description>

  <description>Ever since Viola's boyfriend broke up with her, she has spent her days silently wishing—to have someone love her again and, more importantly, to belong again—until one day she inadvertently summons a young genie out of his world and into her own. He will remain until she makes three wishes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jinn is anxious to return home, but Viola is terrified of wishing, afraid she will not wish for the right thing, the thing that will make her truly happy. As the two spend time together, the lines between master and servant begin to blur, and soon Jinn can't deny that he's falling for Viola. But it's only after Viola makes her first wish that she realizes she's in love with Jinn as well . . . and that if she wishes twice more, he will disappear from her life—and her world—forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson Pearce spins a magical tale about star-crossed lovers, what it means to belong . . . and how important it is to be careful what you wish for.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Praised by writers from Stephen King to Stephenie Meyer, Suzanne Collins’ New York Times bestselling Hunger Games trilogy is dark, captivating, and deeply thought-provoking. Part straight-up survivalist adventure, part rich allegory, and part political thriller, the series has become a new YA favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Girl Who Was On Fire offers even more to think about for teen readers already engrossed by the Hunger Games. From the trilogy's darker themes of violence and social control to reality television, fashion, and weaponry, the collection's exploration of the Hunger Games by other YA writers reveals exactly how rich, and how perilous, protagonist Katniss’ world really is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Girl Who Was On Fire covers all three books in the Hunger Games trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Scarlett March lives to hunt the Fenris--the werewolves that took her eye when she was defending her sister Rosie from a brutal attack. Armed with a razor-sharp hatchet and blood-red cloak, Scarlett is an expert at luring and slaying the wolves. She's determined to protect other young girls from a grisly death, and her raging heart will not rest until every single wolf is dead. &lt;p&gt;Rosie March once felt her bond with her sister was unbreakable. Owing Scarlett her life, Rosie hunts ferociously alongside her. But even as more girls' bodies pile up in the city and the Fenris seem to be gaining power, Rosie dreams of a life beyond the wolves. She finds herself drawn to Silas, a young woodsman who is deadly with an ax and Scarlett's only friend--but does loving him mean betraying her sister and all that they've worked for?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>My name is Amelia Gray. I’m a cemetery restorer who sees ghosts. In order to protect myself from the parasitic nature of the dead, I’ve always held fast to the rules passed down from my father. But now a haunted police detective has entered my world and everything is changing, including the rules that have always kept me safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It started with the discovery of a young woman’s brutalized body in an old Charleston graveyard I’ve been hired to restore. The clues to the killer—and to his other victims— lie in the headstone symbolism that only I can interpret. Devlin needs my help, but his ghosts shadow his every move, feeding off his warmth, sustaining their presence with his energy. To warn him would be to invite them into my life. I’ve vowed to keep my distance, but the pull of his magnetism grows ever stronger even as the symbols lead me closer to the killer and to the gossamer veil that separates this world from the next.</description>

  <description>The business of love is dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Jennifer Kent, a recent MBA graduate who has been searching for work in Manhattan for four long months, time and money are running out. If she doesn't find work soon, she'll need to return to her native Maine, where the job situation is even more bleak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And where her abusive parents lie in wait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when an unorthodox arrangement is proposed, Jennifer decides to take it. She agrees to be the "girlfriend" of Alexander Wenn, the reluctant, billionaire CEO of Wenn Enterprises, who is so devastatingly good looking, he needs a beautiful woman like Jennifer on his arm to "keep the wolves at bay." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this case, the wolves are other women, all of whom vie for his attention so aggressively, they keep him from focusing on business at the exclusive events he must attend. It's there that deals are cut. What they want is his money and his power. Damaged by a past event, the only thing Alex wants to do is focus on work. And to forget the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can Jennifer deny their white-hot chemistry? As she's swept into this glittering otherworld of society and big business, she finds herself struggling to keep from falling for Alex, an almost impossible feat she nevertheless must meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armed with her MBA, Jennifer Kent knows about business. But what she doesn't know is what could destroy her--the business of protecting her own heart. And maybe her own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This story unfolds over multiple volumes approximately 50,000 words each.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Annihilate Me Vols. 1-3 are on sale now.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>An epic thriller of secrets, history and murder that will challenge how we think about who we are, and who we were.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE REINCARNATIONIST is equal parts modern-day thriller, historical fiction and love story. With one foot in present-day Rome and New York and another in Rome some 1,600 years ago, my story is about two worlds consumed by the fires of intrigue and passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photojournalist Josh Ryder survives a terrorist's bomb, only to be haunted by near hallucinatory memories of a past life in Rome as a pagan priest whose dangerous congress with Sabina, one of the Vestal Virgins, poses a transgression so serious the lovers will face a certain death if exposed. Scents of jasmine and sandalwood and images of furtive liaisons and violence descend on Josh at will, pulling him to an ancient yet strangely familiar Roman burial chamber harboring the remains of a woman clutching a wooden box.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A trail of present-day murders takes us deeper into a labyrinth at whose heart lies the enigma of a collection of ancient gems or memory stones whose origins trace back to both ancient Egypt and India. The stones' promise to "assist the wearer in reaching his next incarnation" sets the ancient and modern worlds on a collision course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The questions of who we are cannot be asked without first asking who we were. And I've tried to answer that using my own research into reincarnation theory - as well as the tenets and writings of those who have studied and believed in reincarnation over thousands of years.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A sweeping and suspenseful tale of secrets, intrigue, and lovers separated by time, all connected through the mystical qualities of a perfume created in the days of Cleopatra—and lost for 2,000 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jac L’Etoile has always been haunted by the past, her memories infused with the exotic scents that she grew up surrounded by as the heir to a storied French perfume company. In order to flee the pain of those remembrances—and of her mother’s suicide—she moves to America, leaving the company in the hands of her brother Robbie. But when Robbie hints at an earth-shattering discovery in the family archives and then suddenly goes missing—leaving a dead body in his wake—Jac is plunged into a world she thought she’d left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in Paris to investigate her brother’s disappearance, Jac discovers a secret the House of L’Etoile has been hiding since 1799: a scent that unlocks the mysteries of reincarnation. The Book of Lost Fragrances fuses history, passion, and suspense, moving from Cleopatra’s Egypt and the terrors of revolutionary France to Tibet’s battle with China and the glamour of modern-day Paris. Jac’s quest for the ancient perfume someone is willing to kill for becomes the key to understanding her own troubled past.</description>

From high-profile clients with twisted obsessions to courageous survivors, the Butterfield Institute is the sanctuary to heal battered souls. Morgan Snow's newest patient is a powerful, influential man -- secretly addicted to watching Internet Web cam pornography. He's not alone in his desires. She's also working with a group of high school teenagers equally and dangerously obsessed with these real-time fantasies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fantasies that are all too accessible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the women start dying online, right in front of their eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it's all about murder.</description>

  <description>In Session, from international best seller M.J. Rose, features the return of Dr. Morgan Snow, in a brand-new story collection!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a therapist specializing in sexual issues, psychiatrist Dr. Morgan Snow isn't easily shocked or shaken, as readers and listeners of the popular "Butterfield Institute" novels know. There are times, however, when the need for her services leads her out of the office... and into unfamiliar worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these stories, the therapist matches her wits - and her training - against three men of mystery: Jack Reacher, John Rain, and Cotton Malone. These characters are, of course, familiar to listeners as the creations, respectively, of New York Times best-selling authors Lee Child, Barry Eisler, and Steve Berry. All three swore that their characters would never agree to therapy - unless Rose found a way to get them there. And she did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Extenuating Circumstances" with Steve Berry's Cotton Malone, a woman seeks help for her lover, and sends Dr. Snow overseas on a most unusual house call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Decisions, Decisions", Barry Eisler's John Rain forces Dr. Snow out of her own comfort zone, and into the world of a former patient's worst nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in "Knowing You're Alive", with Lee Child's Jack Reacher, there are revelations for both the injured Dr. Snow and her unexpected savior/patient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note that this book uses the actual narrators from each character's respective series (Phil Gigante/Natalie Ross: Dr. Morgan Snow; Scott Brick: Cotton Malone; Barry Eisler: John Rain; Dick Hill Jack Reacher).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the proceeds of the audiobook and a share of the proceeds of the ebook will be donated to David Baldacci's Wish You Well Foundation, supporting family literacy. (&lt;a href="http://wishyouwellfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;wishyouwellfoundation.org/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These characters are the creations, respectively, of New York Times best-selling authors Lee Child, Barry Eisler, and Steve Berry, and are used with their full knowledge and participation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONUS AUDIO: Audible interviews author M.J. Rose.</description>

  <description>Hot on the trail of her much talked-about debut, &lt;em&gt;Lip Service,&lt;/em&gt; M.J. Rose once again explores the dark corners of the human psyche in a riveting and erotic tale of love, lust...and betrayal. &lt;br&gt; Although everyone thinks she's being paranoid, psychotherapist Jordan Sloan knows better. Haunted by the long-ago murder of her father, she learns that his killer has been paroled and she instantly fears his revenge. Only she knows the dark secret of her relationship with Mallory -- and the depth of her deception in providing the testimony that put him away. She sees him in shadows, in mirrors, in photographs her teenage daughter takes in the park.... &lt;br&gt; Still suffering the bruises of her husband's betrayal, Jordan grapples with ambiguous emotions even as she is drawn again to her estranged spouse. Clinging desperately to the hard-earned stability of her life, she maneuvers through the meshwork of love's fragile bonds, layers of longing, and the chaos that is human relationships. All the while, a mysterious new patient seems intent on contributing to Jordan's unraveling. For as she struggles to prove that her fear of Mallory is justified, she also wrestles with how it might feel to finally forgive Robert's infidelity. &lt;br&gt; M.J. Rose has crafted a rare and evocative new novel of spellbinding energy, as a woman come to terms with her own life -- assuming she will continue to enjoy the luxury of living it.</description>

  <description>In such erotic thrillers as "In Fidelity" and "Lip Service," acclaimed author M. J. Rose took readers to the darkest edges of desire. Now, in her most riveting novel yet, she leads us across the fine line separating passion and obsession, mercy and murder. &lt;br&gt;In a New York courtroom, a woman stands accused of a controversial crime. Genny Haviland, thirty-eight, is said to have drugged and suffocated legendary painter George Gabriel. For two decades the tempestuous Gabriel has challenged audiences with his wild work. And in the end, the prosecution claims, he alienated the woman he first seduced, then enslaved--enough to cause his own death at her hands. &lt;br&gt;Yet in Genny's mind there rests another story, one that started twenty years before . . . one in which a college girl on summer break met an older, attractive artist--and began a forbidden affair she would never forget, a shadowy, sensual union in which she was more helpless and more powerful than she would ever imagine. Then the discovery of a shocking secret blew it all apart: Genny's father was Jonathan Haviland, the renowned gallery owner who could make or break Gabriel's career. &lt;br&gt;Now Genny contends she was only easing her old lover to a painless death, allowing him to escape the awful illness that was slowly eroding his sanity and self. But is that the whole truth? Or was Gabriel indeed killed--but for far more sordid reasons, from a motive driven by scandal and the threat of financial ruin? How much would Genny do for the man she professed to love, or for the father who has always loomed darkly in the background of her life? &lt;br&gt;Peopled with complex and fascinating characters, and capturing the essence of two different anddecadent decades, here is the most impressive achievement of an up-and-coming author. In this irresistible novel, M. J. Rose creates a world where love doesn't last and fame is fleeting . . . but desire never ends. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>A lush and imaginative novel that crisscrosses time as a perfumer and a mythologist search for the fine line between potion and poison, poison and passion…and past and present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Florence, Italy—1533: An orphan named René le Florentin is plucked from poverty to become Catherine de Medici’s perfumer. Traveling with the young duchessina from Italy to France, René brings with him a cache of secret documents from the monastery where he was trained: recipes for exotic fragrances and potent medicines—and a formula for an alchemic process said to have the potential to reanimate the dead. In France, René becomes not only the greatest perfumer in the country but the most dangerous, creating deadly poisons for his Queen to use against her rivals. But while mixing herbs and essences under the light of flickering candles, Rene doesn’t begin to imagine the tragic and personal consequences for which his lethal potions will be responsible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paris, France—The Present: A renowned mythologist, Jac L’Etoile, is trying to recover from personal heartache by throwing herself into her work, learns of the 16th century perfumer who may have been working on an elixir that would unlock the secret to immortality. She becomes obsessed with René le Florentin’s work—particularly when she discovers the dying breathes he had collected during his lifetime. Jac’s efforts put her in the path of her estranged lover, Griffin North, a linguist who has already begun translating René le Florentin’s mysterious formula. Together they confront an eccentric heiress in possession of a world-class art collection. A woman who has her own dark purpose for the elixir… a purpose for which she believes the ends will justify her deadly means. This mesmerizing gothic tale of passion and obsession crisscrosses time, zigzagging from the violent days of Catherine de Medici’s court to twenty-first century France. Fiery and lush, set against deep, wild forests and dimly lit chateaus, The Collector of Dying Breaths illuminates the true path to immortality: the legacies we leave behind.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;From a seductive storyteller who dares to plumb the dark, passionate depths of the heart and soul comes an absorbing erotic thriller that is also a gripping tale of psychological suspense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Grief-stricken Justine Pagett fled to Paris after her mother’s death, but scandal forced her back to the States to redeem her tarnished reputation as a journalist. Commissioned to write a piece on the eccentric classical composer Sophie DeLyon, Justine travels to Euphonia, the exclusive institution DeLyon created to nurture America’s most gifted music prodigies. Once there, she senses that a malevolent presence is composing a deadly work. When Sophie suddenly disappears, Justine’s assignment to mine the story behind the legend becomes an even greater challenge. Wrestling with her own demons while searching for the truth, Justine is clear about one thing: Someone is orchestrating a deadly deceit . . . from which no one will emerge unscathed.</description>

  <description>So many secrets for such a small island. From the moment Anne Merchant arrives at Cania Christy, a boarding school for the world’s wealthiest teens, the hushed truths of this strange, unfamiliar land begin calling to her—sometimes as lulling drumbeats in the night, sometimes as piercing shrieks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One by one, unanswered questions rise. No one will tell her why a line is painted across the island or why she is forbidden to cross it. Her every move—even her performance at the school dance—is graded as part of a competition to become valedictorian, a title that brings rewards no one will talk about. And Anne discovers that the parents of her peers surrender million-dollar possessions to enroll their kids in Cania Christy, leaving her to wonder what her lowly funeral director father could have paid to get her in… and why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a beautiful senior struggles to help Anne make sense of this cloak-and-dagger world without breaking the rules that bind him, she must summon the courage to face the impossible truth—and change it—before she and everyone she loves is destroyed by it.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winning what you want may cost you everything you love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a general’s daughter in a vast empire that revels in war and enslaves those it conquers, seventeen-year-old Kestrel has two choices: she can join the military or get married. But Kestrel has other intentions. One day, she is startled to find a kindred spirit in a young slave up for auction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arin’s eyes seem to defy everything and everyone. Following her instinct, Kestrel buys him—with unexpected consequences. It’s not long before she has to hide her growing love for Arin. But he, too, has a secret, and Kestrel quickly learns that the price she paid for a fellow human is much higher than she ever could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a richly imagined new world, &lt;em&gt;The Winner’s Curse&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Rutkoski is a story of deadly games where everything is at stake, and the gamble is whether you will keep your head or lose your heart.</description>

  <description>Four young ladies enter London society with one common goal: they must use their feminine wit and wiles to find a husband. So a daring husband-hunting scheme is born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annabelle Peyton, determined to save her family from disaster, decides to use her beauty and wit to tempt a suitable nobleman into making an offer of marriage. But Annabelle's most intriguing--and persistent--admirer, wealthy, powerful Simon Hunt, has made it clear that while he will introduce her to irresistible pleasure he will not offer marriage. Annabelle is determined to resist his unthinkable proposition . . . but it is impossible in the face of such skillful seduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her friends, looking to help, conspire to entice a more suitable gentleman to offer for Annabelle, for only then will she be safe from Simon--and her own longings. But on one summer night, Annabelle succumbs to Simon's passionate embrace and tempting kisses . . . and she discovers that love is the most dangerous game of all.</description>

  <description>Orphan Meg Fellowes makes her living picking pockets—until she steals from the wrong nobleman. Instead of rotting in prison like she expected, she’s whisked away to the court of Queen Elizabeth and pressed into royal service, where she joins four other remarkable girls in the Maids of Honor, the Queen’s secret society of protectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meg’s natural abilities as a spy prove useful in this time of unrest. The Spanish Court is visiting, and with them come devious plots and hidden political motives. As threats to the kingdom begin to mount, Meg can’t deny her growing attraction to one of the dashing Spanish courtiers. But it’s hard to trust her heart in a place where royal formalities and masked balls hide the truth: Not everyone is who they appear to be. With danger lurking around every corner, can she stay alive—and protect the crown?</description>

  <description>The year is 1876, and there’s something strange and deadly loose in Philadelphia…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor Fitt has a lot to worry about. Her brother has gone missing, her family has fallen on hard times, and her mother is determined to marry her off to any rich young man who walks by. But this is nothing compared to what she’s just read in the newspaper—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dead are rising in Philadelphia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, in a frightening attack, a zombie delivers a letter to Eleanor…from her brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whoever is controlling the Dead army has taken her brother as well. If Eleanor is going to find him, she’ll have to venture into the lab of the notorious Spirit-Hunters, who protect the city from supernatural forces. But as Eleanor spends more time with the Spirit-Hunters, including their maddeningly stubborn yet handsome inventor, Daniel, the situation becomes dire. And now, not only is her reputation on the line, but her very life may hang in the balance.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winning what you want may cost you everything you love&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a general’s daughter in a vast empire that revels in war and enslaves those it conquers, seventeen-year-old Kestrel has two choices: she can join the military or get married. But Kestrel has other intentions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, she is startled to find a kindred spirit in a young slave up for auction. Arin’s eyes seem to defy everything and everyone. Following her instinct, Kestrel buys him—with unexpected consequences. It’s not long before she has to hide her growing love for Arin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he, too, has a secret, and Kestrel quickly learns that the price she paid for a fellow human is much higher than she ever could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a richly imagined new world, &lt;em&gt;The Winner’s Curse&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Rutkoski is a story of deadly games where everything is at stake, and the gamble is whether you will keep your head or lose your heart.</description>

  <description>Dancing with someone is an act of trust. Elegant and intimate; you're close enough to kiss, close enough to feel your partner's heartbeat. But for Vanessa, dance is deadly – and she must be very careful who she trusts . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vanessa Adler attends an elite ballet school – the same one her older sister, Margaret, attended before she disappeared. Vanessa feels she can never live up to her sister's shining reputation. But Vanessa, with her glorious red hair and fair skin, has a kind of power when she dances – she loses herself in the music, breathes different air, and the world around her turns to flames . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon she attracts the attention of three men: gorgeous Zep, mysterious Justin, and the great, enigmatic choreographer Josef Zhalkovsky. When Josef asks Vanessa to dance the lead in the Firebird, she has little idea of the danger that lies ahead – and the burning forces about to be unleashed . . .</description>

  <description>Steering clear of relationships has never been difficult for demolitions expert Cole Bowen, but now, with his brother's engagement sending the female population into full-blown hysterics and the town of Alden's month-long festivities helping along, he finds himself in hell. When he discovers Alden's new resident and the object of all his wet dreams, Christine Sheridan, has sworn off relationships and is going to hire a gigolo to get professionally laid, he decides to kill two birds with one stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christy is so not drinking again. Thanks to José Cuervo she has her friends signing her up for stud conventions and Cole frigging Bowen offering sex in exchange of fake dates, which is so out of the question it isn't even funny. She knows the domineering man will push her boundaries, and after battling all her life with self-esteem issues, she isn't ready for that. Too bad he won't take no for an answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole is determined to strip away all of her defenses but refuses to lower his ever-present walls, so when Christy realizes she wants more, she's left with only two options; walk away or crack his shield and risk her heart in the process.</description>

  <description>A dark rendition of the classic fairy tale Beauty and the Beast!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She bears no name. Her silvery appearance is freakish to the numerous inhabitants of Sago, the cosmopolitan capital of Pevorocco in a fantasy realm. With her mother vanishing at the instance of her birth, she is sent to live with the cruel, rich Ma Dane, where she is punished daily for something, though she knows not what. Tauntingly named Beauty, she flees Sago in a violent uprising that sets out to massacre all Magics and journeys to the furthest point of the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Beauty cannot hide in the grassy Hillands forever. Before long, the State officials find her and threaten to take her back to war-torn Sago where death surely awaits. In a midnight blizzard she escapes them, running into a deep, enchanted forest to a great and terrible beast who will bargain for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can Beauty accept Beast? Eternity is a long time.</description>

  <description>New Orleans, 1919. As a dark serial killer – The Axeman – stalks the city, three individuals set out to unmask him…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though every citizen of the ‘Big Easy’ thinks they know who could be behind the terrifying murders, Detective Lieutenant Michael Talbot, heading up the official investigation, is struggling to find leads. But Michael has a grave secret – and if he doesn’t find himself on the right track fast – it could be exposed…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former detective Luca d’Andrea has spent the last six years in Angola state penitentiary, after Michael, his protégée, blew the whistle on his corrupt behaviour. Now a newly freed man, Luca finds himself working with the mafia, whose need to solve the mystery of the Axeman is every bit as urgent as the authorities’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Ida is a secretary at the Pinkerton Detective Agency.Obsessed with Sherlock Holmes and dreaming of a better life, Ida stumbles across a clue which lures her and her trumpet-playing friend, Lewis ‘Louis’ Armstrong, to the case and into terrible danger…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Michael, Luca and Ida each draw closer to discovering the killer’s identity, the Axeman himself will issue a challenge to the people of New Orleans: play jazz or risk becoming the next victim. And as the case builds to its crescendo, the sky will darken and a great storm will loom over the city…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived–and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who’ve long forgotten her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for details–proof they hope may free Ben–Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club… and maybe she’ll admit her testimony wasn’t so solid after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby’s doomed family members–including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started–on the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>For those who have loved &lt;em&gt;Seraphina&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Graceling&lt;/em&gt; comes another truly fabulous fantasy...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five centuries, a witch’s curse has bound the trolls to their city beneath the ruins of Forsaken Mountain. Time enough for their dark and nefarious magic to fade from human memory and into myth. But a prophesy has been spoken of a union with the power to set the trolls free, and when Cécile de Troyes is kidnapped and taken beneath the mountain, she learns there is far more to the myth of the trolls than she could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cécile has only one thing on her mind after she is brought to Trollus: escape. Only the trolls are clever, fast, and inhumanly strong. She will have to bide her time, wait for the perfect opportunity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But something unexpected happens while she’s waiting – she begins to fall for the enigmatic troll prince to whom she has been bonded and married. She begins to make friends. And she begins to see that she may be the only hope for the half-bloods – part troll, part human creatures who are slaves to the full-blooded trolls. There is a rebellion brewing. And her prince, Tristan, the future king, is its secret leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Cécile becomes involved in the intricate political games of Trollus, she becomes more than a farmer’s daughter. She becomes a princess, the hope of a people, and a witch with magic powerful enough to change Trollus forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Inner beauty wants out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When eighteen-year-old Becky Randle’s mother dies, she’s summoned from her Missouri trailer park to meet Tom Kelly, the world’s top designer. He makes her an impossible offer: He’ll create three dresses to transform Becky from a nothing special girl into the most beautiful woman who ever lived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becky thinks Tom is a lunatic, or that he’s producing a hidden camera show called World’s Most Gullible Poor People. But she accepts, and she’s remade as Rebecca. When Becky looks in the mirror, she sees herself – an awkward mess of split ends and cankles. But when anyone else looks at Becky, they see pure five-alarm hotness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Rebecca is on the cover of Vogue, the new Hollywood darling, and dating celebrities. Then Becky meets Prince Gregory, heir to the British throne, and everything starts to crumble. Because Rebecca aside, Becky loves him. But to love her back, Gregory would have to look past the blinding Rebecca to see the real girl inside. And Becky knows there’s not enough magic in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A screamingly defiant, hugely naughty, and impossibly fun free fall past the cat walks, the red carpets, and even the halls of Buckingham Palace, &lt;em&gt;Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt; does the impossible: It makes you see yourself clearly for the first time.</description>

  <description>The future world has been divided into sectors--each the same as the other. Surrounded by thick steel fences, there is no way in and no way out. Yet a cyborg army penetrates each sector, picking off its citizens one by one, until no one is left. Behind the sectors' thick walls, the citizens wait to die. Few will be chosen to survive what's coming; the rest will be left behind to suffer. A new world has been created, and its rulers are incredibly selective on who will become a citizen. They want only those with important roles in society to help create a more perfect future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Sia lives in one of the sectors as part of a family that is far too ordinary to be picked to live. According to the digital clock that towers high above her sector, she has only fifteen days to live. Sia has seen the reports and knows a horrific death is in store for her, but she is determined to make the most of her final days. Sia refuses to mourn her short life, instead promising herself that she'll stay strong, despite being suffocated by her depressed mother and her frightened best friend. Just when Sia feels more alone than ever, she meets Mace, a mysterious boy. There is something that draws Sia to him, despite his dangerousness, and together, they join a group of rebels and embark on an epic journey to destroy the new world and its machines, and to put an end to the slaughter of innocent people.</description>

  <description>Victor Cale never imagined that his sweet, shy bride, Isabella, would use her talents for creating exquisite imitation jewels criminally. But there's no denying that her handiwork was used in the theft of the Dutch royal diamonds-- right after Isa disappeared into the night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, Victor is sent to Edinburgh to investigate a wealthy baron's mysterious bride-to-be... who turns out to be Isa, masquerading as an alluring widow. No longer the meek girl he once knew, Isa boldly asserts that it was Victor who abandoned &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, after &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; helped steal the royal diamonds!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piecing together the truth of the past reawakens their volatile passions, which burns hotter than ever. But with a decade of secrets between them, Victor and Isa must trust each other to bring the real thieves to justice-- without getting burned themselves.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>No longer available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bury your face in the red sand, your eyes in the clear sky. The American Southwest shines with sunlight, clean air, and free range. Bone Pile, the mutated twin to Riley Hill’s Burn Pile, digs us out of the darkness to the light of day, where nothing can go wrong. Unless you’re down wind. These tales of terror, dark humor, and horror uncover what lurks in the open, in broad daylight. They Come to See Graves. Desert towns sometimes employ artificial means to survive. More in Bisby . Deserts have a way of stripping bare the reality of how close we are to help when we need it. Survivor. The desert offers a home to those who choose to live alone. Picacho Peak. Simple words and actions stir hidden forces. Dust to Dust. No matter who you are, the desert has a way of bringing you home. To justice.</description>

  <description>Twelve dark, intertwined stories embrace the dark side of common people, bound together on an island in Washington by weird circumstances, an immortal dog, a long trailer, and the omnipresent burn pile. Your neighbors have a dark side. Do you smell what's smoldering in the burn pile?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Evening After" sets the stage as Jim awakens on a beach holding the remnants of his dog's leash. The dog has vanished and, apparently, so have portions of the man's mind. It doesn't take long for him to notice something is wrong with his sense of place and very wrong in the field near the long trailer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Burning" embraces love. Love of nature. Love of memories. And love of who Grace believes she is. But can Grace find it in her heart to save the feral boy who is out to destroy the world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Milepost 4" peeks into the mind of a raptor, or is it the mind of the woman watching him? Is he dead or alive? And what is that strange thing in the field under his flight pattern?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Dark Smoke Things" reveals the light in the center of a young woman's joy. Is it the light of God or the light of fire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Mono-track" sticks us in the tunnel vision of a man focused on finding the truth of strange happenings on the island. Can he open up enough to see what is in front of him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Truth About Halloween" is told by a granny to her rowdy grandson who is too busy plotting pranks to pay heed. But Gran may have a few tricks up her own sleeve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Brutus" is an immortal dog that only wants to go home to his master. He can make it, if he completes a task and outwits the people on the island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sweet Well Water" holds a delicious surprise for those who partake of it. Is the smoking man who concocts it a chemist, or something else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Morning Before" trips us through a time loop, back to "The Evening After." What's with all this lost time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Smoking Man" patiently waits for the call that will free him from his prison on the island. Guilty of causing the death of his friends at the hands of secret American forces, his banishment to the island is coming to an end, and signifies the end of life as they know it to some of those around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Secret Life of Taylor" must remain a secret, since it revolves around knowledge learned while dead. Only Taylor, a brain-damaged man, knows the truth of what he has been shown about heaven and hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Meant to Be" teaches us the truth about holding on, letting go, and fills us in on the real secret of the island. How many will be left to tell the tale? How many will remember?</description>

  <description>No longer available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone is stealing souls, and Cay's is next. Where Cayenne Jensen grew up, Warrior Rock Lighthouse stands sentinel above waters split by Sauvie Island, Washington and Oregon states, and the good and evil intentions of a serial killer. Four-year-old Cay is found adrift in a storm-tossed boat on the Columbia River. She believes the lighthouse shadows have forever hidden the reason she was abandoned, and her mother's fate. Now, as an adult, she is drowning in the dark and frigid currents of losing her husband, her home, and being suspected of murder. The secrets of her past, and how they tie to her present, remain hidden—until an innocent encounter makes her the target of a twisted mind. To survive, Cay must cut open memories, face her fears, and follow a trail of raw bones into the killer's lair. Split River carries the reader through an idyllic world of lush vegetation, wildlife, and island people, as a young woman struggles to channel her fractured life streams and wash clear the mystery of Warrior Rock.</description>

  <description>In 2005, Anne Rice startled her readers with her novel &lt;em&gt;Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt&lt;/em&gt;, and by revealing that, after years as an atheist, she had returned to her Catholic faith.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana&lt;/em&gt; followed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now, in her powerful and haunting memoir, Rice tells the story of the spiritual transformation that produced a complete change in her literary goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She begins with her girlhood in New Orleans as the devout child in a deeply religious Irish Catholic family. She describes how, as she grew up, she lost her belief in God, but not her desire for a meaningful life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She writes about her years in radical Berkeley, where her career as a novelist began with the publication of &lt;em&gt;Interview with the Vampire&lt;/em&gt;, soon to be followed by more novels about otherworldly beings, about the realms of good and evil, love and alienation, pageantry and ritual, each reflecting aspects of her often agonizing moral quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She writes about loss and tragedy (her mother’s drinking; the death of her daughter and, later, her beloved husband, Stan Rice); about new joys; about the birth of her son, Christopher; about the family’s return in 1988 to the city of New Orleans, the city that inspired so much of her work. She tells how after an adult lifetime of questioning, she experienced the intense conversion and consecration to Christ that lie behind her most recent novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For her readers old and new, this book explores her continuing interior pilgrimage.</description>

  <description>"Vook presents a powerful story by the undisputed Queen of Vampire Literature, Anne Rice. The Master of Rampling Gate is a chilling tale of vampiric seduction enhanced by seductive videos about vampires, the black plague, the gothic style, and Anne Rice herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the gasslit streets of 1888 London and the wild moors of the countryside beyond, The Master of Rampling Gate tells the story of Julie, a young woman who becomes obsessed with the house her father swore her and her brother to tear down upon his death. Julie can't imagine what lies in wait at Rampling Gate, a spirit that haunted her father for years and now yearns for her flesh. The Master of Rampling Gate is a sublime love story in which Julie struggles to choose between the world of reason and rationality and the dark promises of a creature she is almost helpless to resist.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience this rare Anne Rice short story as a Vook. Read AND watch the heart pounding tale as you take a journey back in time to the late 1800s, a world of endless nights, secret passions and the promise of dark and nameless pleasures .

  <description>For fans of Tina Fey and David Sedaris-Internet star Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess, makes her literary debut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. That dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father (a professional taxidermist who created dead-animal hand puppets) and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humor in the strange shame spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawson's long-suffering husband and sweet daughter are the perfect comedic foils to her absurdities, and help her to uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments-the ones we want to pretend never happened-are the very same moments that make us the people we are today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's Pretend This Never Happened is a poignantly disturbing, yet darkly hysterical tome for every intellectual misfit who thought they were the only ones to think the things that Lawson dares to say out loud. Like laughing at a funeral, this book is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started.</description>

  <description>Natividad is Pure, one of the rare girls born able to wield magic. Pure magic can protect humans against the supernatural evils they only half-acknowledge – the blood kin or the black dogs. In rare cases – like for Natividad’s father and older brother – Pure magic can help black dogs find the strength to control their dark powers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before Natividad’s mother can finish teaching her magic their enemies find them. Their entire village in the remote hills of Mexico is slaughtered by black dogs. Their parents die protecting them. Natividad and her brothers must flee across a strange country to the only possible shelter: the infamous black dogs of Dimilioc, who have sworn to protect the Pure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the snowy forests of Vermont they are discovered by Ezekiel Korte, despite his youth the strongest black dog at Dimilioc and the appointed pack executioner. Intrigued by Natividad he takes them to Dimilioc instead of killing them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now they must pass the tests of the Dimilioc Master. Alejandro must prove he can learn loyalty and control even without his sister’s Pure magic. Natividad’s twin Miguel must prove that an ordinary human can be more than a burden to be protected. And even at Dimilioc a Pure girl like Natividad cannot remain unclaimed to cause fighting and distraction. If she is to stay she must choose a black dog mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, first, they must all survive the looming battle.</description>

  <description>Fight for your dreams. Fight for your life. Fight for love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nerdy girl Autumn Blakewood is the prime example of a goody two-shoes. She studies every night, is never late for class, and always follows the rules. She has never felt the need to step out of her comfort zone. That is, until she meets Hunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter Bane is a cocky, confident bad-boy, who's nothing but trouble. He’s a dangerous distraction to everyone around him. Sexy and strong, Hunter enjoys the swooning effect he has on women. Especially those who aren't used to attention, like Autumn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Autumn finds it hard not to give into Hunter’s advances, even though it all seems like a game to him. Trying to understand him is impossible, because he shrouds himself in mystery. &lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that Hunter has more baggage than anyone should have to carry. When she discovers he's in an illegal frat club to save the one person that matters to him, Autumn realizes this could mean the end of her undeniable connection to him. Even their lives are at risk.&lt;br&gt;But it's too late to turn back now...</description>

  <description>Jason seems destined to screw things up. After capping off a burglary and a bar fight with a car wreck, he quickly finds himself on the wrong side of the law. And since his father's the governor, that means his punishment is about as public as it gets. Jason's thrown into the first Scared Straight program Florida has ever run in their updated, state-of-the-art Blackenbush Penitentiary. Along with a documentary crew led by Sasha, a young woman in way over her head, and a handful of other kids a year and a strike away from jail, Jason comes face to face with his inevitable future on the other side of a heavily guarded prison wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that's just the beginning. The tour has barely begun when one of the inmates makes a move. Before long the entire penitentiary is under siege, surrounded by the feds and overrun with prisoners let loose from their cells. Jason slips away with Sasha in the chaos, but they won't be able to escape without help. And the only thing worse than being stuck in prison, is being stuck in a prison run by the inmates.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 147764671X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the primary book for this story.  If you're interested in Large Print or the Kindle editions, look up &lt;em&gt;A Price for Love&lt;/em&gt;.  It's the same story.  Anyone who has marked a "flower" cover as to-read, read, or reviewed is a fake or "sock puppet" entry, because those editions no longer exist and, therefore, are no longer available for purchase or loan, and haven't been for quite some time..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful suspense-filled romance; what discovery doesn't separate a broken promise could shatter.&lt;br&gt;Ariel was a victim at seventeen. She's now an unsung hero hidden for her protection. No one knows where she is or her real identity except her advocate. But strange events begin to occur around her home. It affects her sense of invisibility. As a writer in her early twenties living in a country cottage, Ariel devises an experiment to boost her writing and ease her perilously low funds. It's risky, but everything in Ariel's life is risky. Ariel's encounters bring back memories of how her ordeal began, as she learns to deal with the demons within. Her first real love is Jerry, the eighteen year old who cuts her grass and keeps back the "jungle" on her small acreage. Stuck at seventeen emotionally Ariel experiences the pleasant side of her previous horrors, and begins to trust love again. A puppy leads trouble into her life, bringing Danny, a local deputy, to her door. Drawn to her he appoints himself guardian, soon learning there's more to her than imagined. But Danny harbors regret. His hard lesson brings out his true strength when he learns of Ariel's plight, her risky trysts and her love for another. He must let her go to keep her safe, allowing her to heal herself in her own way, always there to look out for her…always loving her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CONTAINS SUGGESTIVE ADULT SITUATIONS</description>

  <description>A literary work squeezed into a genre - contemporary, social science fiction/fantasy with vanished horses, Aurora Borealis over Texas, a mysterious mountain appearing in the forest of tall pines.  Elle and her circle have a lot to figure out. The series continues as the mysteries mount with each clue that sends Elle and her companions on repeated adventures. Their searches reveal the source of the horse calls and a connection is made too ancient to understand. Jamie disappears along with their mysterious mountain. A search takes them to the Black Hills after Elle's reaction witnessing her deepest dread. Tommy leads his rescuers into the hills to find a place familiar from their experience and his dreams. He hopes his cousin is there and not lost forever in a Time Loop. Elle experiences her most revealing dream-vision. It takes her to Tommy at the moment of his greatest peril. She saves him from within her vision as something reaches out to touch his heart.</description>

  <description>Two stories: Both set in 1941-45.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IN BLOOD THERE IS NO HONOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A southern family struggles through the consequences of a chance occurrence, a crime unplanned. We are privy to their sorrows begun with the opportunistic kidnapping of beautiful fourteen year old Tessa, granddaughter in the three generation household. The staunch and respected family's roots in Louisiana started before the Civil War, but even in good families a bad apple can begin an avalanche of troubles. The tragedies test each until they're near breaking, many blaming themselves. The brutal actions of a disturbed cousin inflame family members. One is unable to let go of his desire for vengeance when the judge sentences the guilty to military service. He joins up to follow. Both are stationed in Okinawa and experience one of the worst battles of WWII where he seeks blood for blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IF I COULD ONLY SPARKLE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rendered unconscious for a long period Tessa awoke without awareness of her circumstances. Taken to her mother's country home her awareness returns with a booming lightning strike to a nearby tree sparking a wish. After four years shrouded in darkness following her brutal attack she slowly recovers her memory of the events. She copes with her own changes, lost years and family loses while discovering her inner strengths.</description>

  <description>A literary work with contemporary, social science/fiction overtones. This epic tale of an apocalyptic possibility is told through the experiences of a young woman and those in her immediate circle. They face a worldwide crisis that should have never occurred. It thrusts Elle back to the stress-filled mental state of a previous like-experience. She's barely healed and so grateful her giant black gelding isn't counted among the missing. She’s determined to understand how and why the world's equine species could vanish en masse in the blink of an eye. Knowing is the only thing she believes will save her from repeating her previous breakdown, to be forced to receive more of the horrific treatment which closed the inner doors of her memory. Many events and people are now forgotten to her. One is the love she was discovering with Tommy. By chance they cross paths stirring her memories of a recent past as he realizes Elle’s commitment didn’t lose her permanently for him after all. Together they re-discover their path to find a new territory on this world where the horses run. Elle’s journey begins as her past soon catches up in many unexpected ways. Dream-visions reveal a forgotten Native American connection as more people begin hearing the thunder of running horses and the lone whinny calling their name. Many Lakhóta visionaries from a past age guide Elle and Tommy along with others drawn to join their quest. They discover clues to a scientific phenomenon hidden on the Earth. They can't accept the horses may never return unless they realize their horses knew what they do not--a change will effect Mother Earth and all living upon her. Will it be an awakening or a catastrophe, or both?</description>

  <description>Recovering from a tragic accident I found recalling my past was my answer. When I was ten it was a magical time when I was given a chance by my grannie to have one wish come true...for a little while. I found Evernow, a realm between time and no time where only those who die with a pure heart can go. I was invited. There I discovered my true heritage, the power in a silver necklace, why there is no magic in our world and how evil can come to even the perfect places, but still be defeated with the help of a child. But we have to grow up, even if the perfect life we experienced has to be left behind. Let me tell you of my adventure during the summer when I was ten and you, too, might become a believer in magic once again. My only wish is to return and remain forever. Madison's memory reveals a fantastic world she entered to rescue her Grampy and return a necklace to the rightful owner. But ill intent found this sanctuary created for all magical creatures. Its good light can burn evil, so protection is conjured from the lost essence of the purest of creatures - unicorns. And an elf prince is held captive as ransom for the object of real power the realm was illegally entered to recover. Only the child can enter the lair to free the prince, but she has a lot of help and protection, and it is they who are in most danger. Quote from book: I kept going back for a long time, every chance I could during our stays with Grannie. I was sure it was a special place for something special to visit for me to see. And, finally something did.</description>

It's years into our future and the world has changed drastically from what is now known, but life is surviving. On Shy's tenth birthday she and her friends, Jazz and Ozzie, find something that turns out to be extraordinary in &lt;em&gt;A Tree on My House.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just before her eleventh birthday she tells a tale of how part of the dome fell one day in &lt;em&gt;The Day the Sky Fell.&lt;/em&gt; It shows how important their dome is to keep them safe and how Jasmine's home was destroyed by a single cable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Honeycomb Sky&lt;/em&gt; tells more of what their life is like under the dome, beginning Shy's five-year journal received on her twelfth birthday. Shy learns about the Before Times (our time)from her grandfather. She loves his stories and hopes to see the rest of the changed world when she grows up. She relates their experience in these stories the children write with hopes of sending her journal back to the past someday so the future of the world will be known.

  <description>This exciting anthology contains stories from twenty-five women from different parts of the world. Their ages differ, as do their backgrounds and locations, but one thing they all have in common is a spirit of independence and a determination to not only succeed, but prevail. Whether their struggles are to maintain balance between motherhood and career, escape from an abusive relationship, or to step out in faith and pursue a dream, all of these women have forged their own path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As women, one of our most powerful "gifts" is the ability to encourage one another. This book is an effort to encourage women across the world. These twenty-five women share stories that will make you laugh, inspire you, and maybe even make you cry. Their hope is that these stories will inspire YOUR independent spirit and allow you to live the life you were meant to live. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, each woman has included a “sneak peek” into one of her own novels.</description>

  <description>Comedy with a conscience: The uber-rich editor of Home decorating magazine loses everything, including her Ponzi-schemer husband, when their luxury wine-country home mysteriously goes up in flames. But that's just the beginning of Doria's problems. &lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Homeless, destitute, presumed dead and branded a criminal, the once-proud Doria has a crash course in how the other half lives.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, reluctant sleuth Camilla Randall is facing homelessness and destitution too, as Doria's husband's schemes unravel and take down innocent bystanders along the way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mysterious Mr X. turns up at Camilla's bookstore expressing concern for the local homeless, Camilla is smitten. By now one might think once smitten, twice shy, but for Camilla, the search for love is a constant triumph of hope over experience.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;As ever, Anne R. Allen weaves a unique blend of crazy characters [Mistress Nightshade, anybody?], crazy situations [would you believe a Colombian drugs cartel?] and laugh-out-loud one-liners that all somehow come together and make perfect sense at the end.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Oh, and did we mention the Wizard of Oz? &lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;No Place Like Home is the fourth of the Camilla Randall Mysteries, but can be read as a stand-alone novel.&lt;br&gt;.</description>

  <description>Sherwood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name immediately conjures up images of Richard Greene, Michael Praed and Russel Crowe. Or maybe that sly fox in the Disney version.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only, in Anne R. Allen's latest rom-com mystery the fox is a coyote and there's no Robin Hood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her usual inimitable fashion Allen peels back the layers, one hilarious subplot after another, until you just never know what's real and what's not. Rather like the Robin Hood legend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Manners Doctor, Camilla Randall, flies into Robin Hood airport with a suitcase in one hand and a book contract in the other she thinks she's leaving all her problems behind and is about to start a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you look very carefully you may just spot the Sheriff of Nottingham, Maid Marian and even Little John hidden away. But as for Robin Hood himself... You'll just have to read it and find out.</description>

  <description>Over the past year, one thing we've come to appreciate on The Literary Lab blog is the value of artistic freedom. To celebrate this freedom, we put together a collection of stories that were accepted before they were actually written. Our fellow writers gained entry into the anthology by impressing us with past work or proposals. From those early applications, we selected twenty-five of our favorite writers and told them simply that they had ten pages with which they could do whatever they want. We received poetry, artwork, and some amazing short stories that are both traditional and experimental.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writers challenged themselves and only themselves to see what they could truly create when they weren't worried about rejection. In Notes From Underground readers will find a range of emotions and personalities that is as broad as the range of writers that frequent our great online community.

  <description>This novel offers a possible solution to a real unsolved Hollywood mystery—the death in 1973 of David Whiting during the filming of the Burt Reynolds’ movie, "The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing". Whiting was found dead in the motel room of the actress Sarah Miles. It destroyed Sarah Miles' career and her marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Nicky Conway meets Fitzgerald-quoting Alistair at a Princeton mixer in 1969, she falls for his retro, Jazz-Age charm. But she discovers he’s a con man obsessed with his own “Daisy”—British actress Delia Kent. After Alistair manipulates Nicky into nannying for Delia’s daughter on the set of aHollywood film, Delia finds Alistair dead in her motel room. Local police can’t decide if it’s accident, suicide—or murder, in which case, Nicky is the prime suspect.</description>

  <description>The Camilla Randall Mysteries…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this is your first time with author Anne R. Allen then there can be no better way to hit the ground running than with this delightful Camilla box-set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Best Revenge is actually a prequel to the highly acclaimed Ghostwriters In The Sky, and takes us back to Camilla Randall’s early years, when she first met Plantagenet Smith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghostwriters In The Sky fasts forward to a more mature Camilla Randall, hoping to have an easy ride at a writers’ conference in California. Needless to say fate has other ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Sherwood Ltd. Anne R. Allen conveys Camilla to the merry England of Robin Hood legend, where of course Camilla once again ends up in the most improbable, but always believable, circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, these three novels make up the Camilla Randall Mysteries. So far. But Anne will be bringing us more Camilla in the future, fear not.</description>

  <description>Two sisters: one white, one black. Two world views: one liberal, one conservative. But these two women have one goal in common—one they share with most women in modern society: the urge to diminish themselves by dieting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Food of Love is a historical comedy-mystery-romance of the 1990s that carries a powerful message. It offers some of life’s darker truths—told with a punchline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Once I sat down to read this book, I could not get up until I’d finished it. This hilarious page-turner packs a profound satirical bite. It’s a Hollywood romp that provides romance, mystery, and an honest confrontation with the human condition. Food of Love is a funny and powerfully healing book.” —Lucia Capacchione, PhD, bestselling self-help author, Recovery of Your Inner Child &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Gripping...a perfect beach read...full of hope and fun... designed to keep you turning the pages.” —Gainsborough Standard &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Allen’s snarky humor shines on every page. Her pokes at Hollywood’s rich and famous made me laugh out loud, especially when Elvis leaves the building”—Anne Gallagher, author of A Wife for Winsbarren and The Lady’s Fate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Pack this one to add punch to your holiday reading.” —South Yorkshire Times“</description>

  <description>In this prequel to Anne R. Allen's Camilla Randall mysteries, a young debutante loses everything: fortune, love, and eventually even her freedom when a TV star's murder is mistakenly laid at her feet. Through it all, Camilla perserveres, however, and comes to learn that she is made of sterner stuff than anyone might have imagined, herself included. In typical Anne R. Allen fashion, the plot twists and turns from one breathless misadventure to another, leading to a finish sure to catch the reader by surprise.</description>

('Rapunzel' will be released early 2012)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saffina says:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're like us, you'll have found that since you got your e-reader you've been reading far more than you used to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while it's great to snuggle up in a cozy chair for a few hours and read a great book in one sitting like in the good old days, (when a book was made of paper and ink - anyone out there old enough to remember?) with an e-reader in your pocket, briefcase or handbag you can now read anywhere, whenever you have fifteen minutes spare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course unless you're gifted in some way you can't read a full length book in fifteen minutes, or in your lunch session, or your coffee break, or waiting at the dentist's, or for the kids to come out of school. But you can read a short story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are a lot of short-story anthologies out there with different themes and genres, and if you want all sci-fi, or all romance, or all zombies then there's plenty to choose from. But when we looked around for a variety pack - a pot-pourri of mixed genre short stories so as readers we could dip into what we fancied and try something new as well - we found a gap in the market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we got together with some of the finest new and previously published short-story authors and collated the 'Saffina Desforges Presents...' collection of varied genre and varied length short stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hope you enjoy reading them as much as we enjoyed putting this collection together.&lt;br&gt;Look out for volumes 2 &amp;amp; 3 coming soon to a Kindle near you!</description>

  <description>A comedy that pokes fun at the myth of a Golden Age: nostalgia is overrated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone has shot aging bad-girl rocker Morgan Le Fay and threatens to finish the job. Is it fans of her legendary dead rock-god husband, Merlin? Or is the secret buried in her childhood hometown of Avalon, Maine? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan's childhood best friend Dodie, the no-nonsense owner of a dilapidated diner, may be the only one who knows the dark secret that can save Morgan's life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And both women may find that love really is better the second time around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny women's fiction for the Woodstock Generation.</description>

  <description>Anya Gage has learned that to get anything good in life, you have to work for it. She has no expectations, no dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she finds herself at a party where she doesn’t want to be and she meets Knight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight Sebring knows who he is, what he wants and what he likes. And he gets it. But he never expected something as sweet as Anya Gage to wander into his bedroom during a party he did not expect to be having to borrow his phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight tries to leave Anya to the life she deserves of white picket fences and a man who watches football on Sundays – good, normal and clean. But when Anya comes to his nightclub and finds herself in a situation, he knows someone has to look after her, he can’t fight it anymore and he decides that man will be him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight teaches Anya that, just as with the bad, in life you should also expect the good. And he teaches her this by giving it to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Knight has a dark past and just as he desires Anya for exactly who she is, he fears when she finds out exactly the man he has become and always intends to be, she’ll leave him for good, normal and clean.</description>

  <description>Eddie Fisher is standing at a crossroad...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living most of his life as a career con artist; Eddie is a conditioned sociopath who has never cared about anyone that he hasn’t benefited from. His outlook begins to change when he meets Clair; a single mother and school teacher—his all-around polar opposite.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as he decides to turn over a new leaf, Clair’s son falls terminally ill. Without the means to cover the medical expenses, Eddie is forced to team up with his old partner for one last scam—a double-deal that goes wrong, spawning a maelstrom of bullets and bloodshed.</description>

  <description>Michael Carson is an Afghan war veteran who is just trying to find normalcy in his life. Teetering on the brink of a nervous breakdown; a sudden push comes along which submerges him into a world where violent episodes equal heroics. Becoming a vigilante, he stalks the streets of Miami disposing of what he deems as human trash. The deeper he sinks into his twisted psychosis, the more he starts to believe that he is in fact a superhero. When he meets Grace, she quickly becomes the love of his life, forcing Michael to walk a tightrope. He finds himself struggling between his vengeful persona and his need to leave behind the personal war that he has waged. Driven by his madness, he is consumed in a situation that is beyond his control. Before he knows it, Michael is sucked into an undertow of corruption with no means of escape.</description>

  <description>In 1996 the Willis' and their friends were harvesting the good life. Secluded in the mountains of Northern California, they lived like simple farmers and ignored the rat race. They existed like many in working hard and paying their taxes. Unlike the majority, they were making their livelihood growing medicinal marijuana. In the blink of an eye, their harmony becomes shattered when Thomas Willis mistakenly shoots a federal agent. Barricading themselves in their home out of fear, the events quickly spiral out of control into a grueling thirteen day standoff. Armed with simple rifles and homemade weapons, they bide their time in a house with no electricity. Tormented by their would-be captors outside, Thomas decides to keep a journal, and page by page he documents the daily struggle of being imprisoned in his own home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the farming colony faces an uncertain fate, Thomas comes to the conclusion that he must get his son to safety before it is too late.</description>

  <description>Alternate/New Cover Edition for ISBN# 9781484086346&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa Costa has a life-altering secret…only she doesn’t know it yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confined by law to the kingdom of Alvair until the age of eighteen, Alexa has lived a sheltered existence under the watchful eye of her sword-wielding guardian, Ivy. Her love interest, Caleb Whitman, is exactly the opposite. A merchant sailor and seeker of rare artifacts, Caleb has lived a life of adventure in nearby San Lucero, the long-time rival of Alvair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her eighteenth birthday, Alexa’s quiet existence becomes tumultuous, and she realizes she does not need to seek to find adventure. Myths become real, legend becomes fact, and Alexa discovers that she possesses rare abilities which make her a target for both sides in a centuries-old struggle for power. She must use every resource available to her—including her talents with the supernatural Amulets—to help her friends, rekindle her romance with Caleb, and save her island home from destruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author's Note: This book has been attacked.

  <description>Humor/Chick Lit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ever have one of those days where nothing seems to go right?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, every day is like that for Jessalyn Bell. Falling victim to a streak of extremely bad luck, Jessalyn can rarely go a day without encountering a disastrous occurrence. Her parents’ divorce, her inability to meet quota at her sales job, and the incident in which she’s mistakenly arrested are just the beginning. There’s also the fact that every single date with her boyfriend Kyle goes wrong.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unpleasant surprises wait around every corner, but through her various misadventures Jessalyn comes to realize that every cloud has a silver lining, that friendships can develop in the most unlikely places, and that love and romance are every bit as spontaneous and unpredictable as a bout of bad luck.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note:  Alternate/new cover edition for ISBN# 9781484178218.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Young Adult/Fantasy/Adventure]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgotten Memories. Dark Enchantments.&lt;br&gt;And a Long-Lost Source of Unimaginable Power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping her end of a desperate bargain to save her island home from destruction, Alexa Costa finds herself in the unlikely employ of Queen Jada. Bound by a powerful spell, she swears allegiance to the kingdom of Alvair and remembers nothing of her romance with Caleb. Now she must adjust to life within the castle, where her personal opinion means nothing, her skills are constantly put to the test, and her private thoughts are public knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rumors abound and secrecy reigns in Queen Jada’s inner circle, the members of which include the mysterious Prince Dante, the self-obsessed Princess Tiana, and the valiant Captain Whitman of the Alvairan Army. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again forced to make impossible decisions because of her rare abilities, Alexa must overcome the darkness within the castle by first overcoming the darkness within herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN13 9781301990498.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn the story before the story...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before Alexa met Caleb, before she learned about her powers, and before a supernatural storm threatened to destroy all that she held dear, she was just a typical teenage girl trapped in the heavily fortified kingdom of Alvair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prequel to Amulet of Elusion, Before the Storm features over 14,000 words of never-before-read content, highlighting Alexa’s journey to Alvair as a child, Caleb’s first delivery to his prestigious client in “the forbidden kingdom,” the moment when Alexa and Caleb first meet, and Caleb’s run-in with a would-be thief named Sam Silva.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Release date TBA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please ignore the low rating on this book. It has not yet been released and is, in fact, still being written. Thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An All-Powerful Tyrant. A Perilous Journey. One Chance to Save a World in Turmoil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A WAR IS RAGING, and Alvair’s tyrannical regime is more of a threat than ever. In an effort to gain the assistance of the powerful and elusive Council of the Triad, Alexa travels to the picturesque city of her troubled youth, Sierra Blanca. Shadows of her past lurk around every corner, reminding her of the family she lost and the family she has yet to lose. Her only hope is to find the most powerful Amulet in existence―the Amulet of Destiny―before her enemies do. But when Alexa receives unexpected and shocking news, the expedition is put on hold. A challenge greater than any she has ever known arises, and her marriage is in peril as she and Caleb face their biggest obstacle yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the epic final installment of &lt;em&gt;The Lost Amulet Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;, Alexa is the last hope for freedom in a world consumed by greed. Accepting her destiny is difficult, and she alone can determine whether it is a blessing...or a curse.</description>

  <description>My next book (codenamed NACR2—because I’M CREATIVE) is a New Adult contemporary romance/suspense novel. Our main character, Laney, has a secret she’s been keeping from everyone—one that drives her to do things she never thought she’d be capable of. Things like causing pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And ending it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Laney’s freshman year of college, she meets two people who change her life forever: Armin, a boy who becomes the light in her darkness (not a sexual euphemism, swear)—and Blythe, a girl with her own secrets, who is willing to cross any line for those she loves. The three of them become inseparable…until a crime one of them has committed threatens to tear their trio apart.</description>

  <description>What if all the legends you’ve learned were wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brutally attacked by one god and unfairly cursed by another she faithfully served, Medusa has spent the last two thousand years living out her punishment on an enchanted isle in the Aegean Sea. A far cry from the monster legends depict, she’s spent her time educating herself, gardening, and desperately trying to frighten away adventure seekers who occasionally end up, much to her dismay, as statues when they manage to catch her off guard.  As time marches on without her, Medusa wishes for nothing more than to be given a second chance at a life stolen away at far too young an age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then comes a day when Hermes, one of the few friends she still has and the only deity she trusts, petitions the rest of the gods and goddesses to reverse the curse. Thus begins a journey toward healing and redemption, of reclaiming a life after tragedy, and of just how powerful friendship and love can be—because sometimes, you have to sink in the deep end of the sea before you can rise back up again.</description>

  <description>***A Standalone Horror Romance***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note about this book: Donners of the Dead is set in 1851 – couples were often thrust into marriage together with short courtships, racism was widespread and not overly frowned upon, and women had little to no rights. What wouldn't fly in today's day and age was unfortunately the norm back then - it is worth keeping that in mind when reading this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jake McGraw was unlike anyone I’d ever known. He was brash, rude, unapologetic and arrogant; chauvinistic, close-minded, and terribly stubborn. He was built like a tree, tall with a hard chest and wide shoulders and hands that looked like they could wrestle a bear. He was a cigar-chomping, scruffy-faced, beast of a man. I was pretty sure I hated him. And I know he hated me. But among the flesh-eating monsters in these snow-capped mountains, he was the only thing keeping me alive &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1851 and pioneers in search of California gold are still afraid to travel on the same route as the tragic Donner party did years before. When the last wagon train to go into the Sierra Nevada mountains fails to arrive at their destination, Eve Smith, an 18-year old half-native girl with immense tracking skills is brought along with the search party, headed by an enigmatic former Texas Ranger, Jake McGraw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they find deep in the dangerous snow-covered terrain is a terrifying consequence of cannibalism, giving new meaning to the term “monster.” While the search party is slowly picked off, one by one, Eve must learn to trust Jake, who harbors more than a few secrets of his own, in order to survive and prevent the monstrosities from reaching civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is NOT New Adult***</description>

  <description>The Witch Hunters have come for Brusenna, for she is the last. All the others have been captured by the Dark Witch. And without their magical songs to control nature, the world is dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though young and untrained, Brusenna must succeed where every other Witch has failed. Find the Dark Witch. Fight her. Defeat her. If Brusenna fails, there will be nothing left to save—for the Witches, for mankind, or for the young Guardian who has committed his life to protecting hers.</description>

  <description>Six months ago, I was happy. I was simply Naomi Carradine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One month ago, I was admitted into a psych ward. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Lachlan visited me. Kissed me. And told me that I’m starting to lose my mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hours later, Max haunted my thoughts, reminding me I’m not crazy and that he needs my help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few minutes ago, I drifted further from reality, trying to unravel the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now...everyone thinks I’m insane. But, I know he's real, and I know he needs me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you believe me?</description>

  <description>Are you straight? Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt;? What would you do if you were down-and-out and desperate? What would you do—how far would you go—for FAME? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out just how far, and just how low, Johnny Gellis is willing to go in SUICIDE RIDE: THE PLATINUM MAN. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hitch your lift with this man &lt;br&gt;You'll have your blood on your hand …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AN OLDER MAN WITH NO FUTURE, AND NOTHING TO LIVE FOR … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman Dimond is the Silver Man, an over-the-hill LA-based rock 'n roll record producer who has seen better days. A set-for-life bisexual with a hard spot for younger men, he squanders his nights hustling cash-strapped gay-for-pay desperadoes who swagger into his den on the Sunset Strip, looking for one-off love in all the right places. Lonely and at loose ends, he longs for a worthy dance partner, but despairs of finding him … Until one night, when he least expects it, in waltzes … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A YOUNGER MAN WITH A PAST, AND A DEATH WISH … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnny Gellis is the Platinum Man, a beautiful straight wreck who needs fixing—and who wants exactly what Norman Dimond has to give: a platform, a stage. But does he want it badly enough? Desperate to outrun his demons, he's driving himself crazy, and is heading straight for the edge. Can Norman save him, before it's too late? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TWO LIVES ABOUT TO COLLIDE IN A SUICIDE RIDE … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Norman meets Johnny, their heavy-metal fenders bend, sending the male-on-male sparks flying. Johnny's number-one-with-a-bullet hit "Suicide Ride" blows Norman's mind, while his number-99-with-an-anchor tattoo pricks up more than just his ears. And though this hell-bent, cliff-hanging headbanger is the man-boy of his dreams, keeping him on course turns out to be a waking nightmare. Can Norman do it? Can he put him on top while stopping him from breaking down and destroying them both? The deeper Dimond digs, the darker it gets; and as the secrets and suspense multiply, so, too, do the lies. Johnny is hiding something, that much Norman is sure of; and what's worse, he begins to feel the tug of even darker and ever more violent undertows—sinister, malevolent drags that Gellis himself cannot spin-rinse away.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;When a devilish lord and a bluestocking set off on the road to ruin...time is not on their side.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Minerva Highwood, one of Spindle Cove's confirmed spinsters, needs to be in Scotland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Sandhurst, Lord Payne, a rake of the first order, needs to be...anywhere but Spindle Cove.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These unlikely partners have one week to&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;•  fake an elopement&lt;br&gt;•  convince family and friends they're in "love"&lt;br&gt;•  outrun armed robbers&lt;br&gt;•  survive their worst nightmares&lt;br&gt;•  travel four hundred miles without killing each other&lt;/blockquote&gt;All while sharing a very small carriage by day and an even smaller bed by night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they don't have time for is their growing attraction. Much less wild passion. And heaven forbid they spend precious hours baring their hearts and souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly one week seems like exactly enough time to find a world of trouble. And maybe...just maybe...love.</description>

  <description>Tristan Moreau loves his job as chief administrative officer and personal assistant to Webber Kincaid, President, Chairman, and CEO of Kincaid International. It would be the perfect job… if only he hadn’t fallen in love with his boss as well as the work. After two years, he’s still doing everything in his power to keep his feelings hidden—mostly because he wants to protect the reputation of his famous boss but also because he wants to keep his job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Webber Kincaid has stayed in the closet, using his best friend and confidante as his beard. Everything in his life was working out just fine until he met Tristan Moreau. Within months, Tristan stole his heart and became his lifeline. But Webber knows the rules of the workplace better than anyone, so he’s kept his distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But two years is too long to wonder “what if?”—especially when business takes them to a private Caribbean island. When Tristan and Webber succumb to the tropical heat, their professionalism starts to backslide. It’s a seemingly impossible relationship, making a go at it under the paparazzi’s microscope. It may be the best—or the worst—business decision they ever made.</description>

  <description>Devastated after losing his partner of fifteen years to cancer, Dr. Bradford Mitchell tries to escape the emptiness and loss by leaving his life in Seattle behind. Traveling to the Alaskan mountains where he and Jeff often vacationed, Brad reconnects with Mac Cleary, the ruggedly handsome and very straight floatplane pilot who had flown them to Hyline Lake many times in the past. Brad and Mac form an unlikely friendship and buy an old log cabin together, and as he and Mac begin to bring the old cabin back to life, Mac watches Brad come back to life as well, stirring emotions in him he’s never felt for a man before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fear, confusion, and a near tragedy threaten to force the two men apart, they’ll face some tough questions. Can Brad let go of Jeff and the guilt he feels about beginning to care for another man? And can Mac deal with his fears of being gay and accept the fact that he is in love with Brad? It will be a struggle for both men to keep their heads and hearts intact while exploring what life has to offer.</description>

  <description>La víspera de su boda, Zander Walsh, sus padres y su prometido son disparados cuando interrumpen un misterioso robo al volver a casa. Después de tres semanas en coma, Zander se despierta y descubre que es el único superviviente. Su vida perfecta se hace añicos en un instante. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;El atractivo agente del FBI, Jake Elliot, está investigando el caso y no tardará en detener al asesino que, sin embargo, escapa fácilmente. Tras seis meses de investigación, Zander y Jake descubren que están siendo saboteados por el propio FBI…, y que la amistad que han forjado está empezando a convertirse en algo más fuerte. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pero cuando se embarcan en un viaje para detener al asesino por segunda vez, descubrirán que aquella noche terrible escondía mucho más que un intento fallido de robo. ¿Es posible que los grandes negocios y el mundo de la política sean capaces de encubrir la verdad, o tal vez los intentos de Zander y Jake por resolver el misterio marcarán el final de su nuevo amor y de sus vidas?</description>

  <description>Thompson and Caroline Gray were living their dream until Caroline's untimely death just two years after they’d bought the Thundercloud Marina. When Caroline died, she left Thompson alone and emotionally disconnected—until Thompson’s longtime friend and towboat owner Hank Charming tows Garner Holt, a recently retired psychiatrist, and his boat into the marina for repair. Thompson and Hank are both drawn to the sailboat captain, but for very different reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since high school, Hank has secretly carried a torch for Thompson, even though Thompson remained committed to Caroline, even after her death. Hank is totally caught off guard when his initial attraction to Garner makes him realize this stranger might be the one to help him move on with his life. Thompson establishes a platonic friendship with Garner and starts to see the psychiatrist as his only lifeline to sanity. Life improves until Thompson sees Hank and Garner together, and old feelings Thompson thought were long buried begin to resurface. Garner quickly identifies the unresolved feelings between Hank and Thompson and decides to tap his professional skills and work behind the scenes to help Thompson and Hank see what has been right in front of them all along.</description>

  <description>Sequel to An Unconventional Courtship &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kincaid International Corporation’s CEO, Webber Kincaid, and his executive assistant, Tristan Moreau, have just returned from a Caribbean business trip gone horribly right. After years of hiding their love for each other, they finally came clean—and discovered KIC’s chief financial officer has been up to some shady business transactions. Now that they’re back, Tristan and Webber must expose the CFO’s indiscretions—and save Webber’s reputation, since he’s ultimately responsible for his CFO’s actions. With Tristan by his side, Webber faces KIC’s board of directors and a looming investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Justice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all the uncertainty surrounding them, Webber and Tristan rely on the strength of their connection. Together, they plan an intimate wedding on the island of Martha’s Vineyard. But despite their love for one another, Webber and Tristan quickly realize they have some hurdles to cross before they can start their unexpected new life.</description>

  <description>When hunky aspiring country singer Billy Eagan heads to Nashville in search of his big break, a relationship and love are the furthest things from his mind. Taking a foreman's job at the Lazy H ranch and not knowing how he will be accepted, Billy decides to fly under the radar and stay as closeted as he can without denying who he really is. It's immediately confirmed that he made the right decision when he discovers that homophobia is still alive and well in Tennessee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Billy gets his break and meets gorgeous record label executive Ian Dillon. Their worlds collide both professionally and personally, and Billy falls hard. But Ian is still haunted by the mysterious betrayal of his one and only lover, and knowing Billy possesses the power to emotionally destroy him, Ian decides to cut his losses and simply walk away. Determined not to give up on the man he loves, Billy secretly starts to unravel the past and quickly finds that it's not what it appears. Can Billy rescue Ian’s heart, or will bigotry and hatred win over love?</description>

  <description>Years ago, Wes Stanhope fled his hometown of Charleston to escape the constraints of society and his controlling father, Colonel Robert Lee Stanhope IV. After completing medical school and building a successful practice in pediatric oncology in Seattle, Wes is called home for his mother’s funeral and presented with an opportunity to build and run a children’s hospital—his mother’s legacy—a choice he ultimately makes despite his misgivings about his father’s role as chairman of the hospital’s board of directors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Wes begins to build his team, he is introduced to a young, handsome black  architect named Tyler Williams. Sparks begin to fly between the two men, and although Wes doesn’t identify as gay, denying his attraction to Ty becomes impossible. But Ty won’t be a dirty secret: if Wes wants to build a relationship, he’ll have to come out, brave his father’s racism and homophobia, and risk his chance to continue as the hospital’s CEO and realize his mother’s dream.</description>

  <description>Hunky Alaskan dive master and charter boat captain Jackson Cameron is absolutely sure he’s straight until openly gay treasure hunter Dax Powers calls him and offers him the adventure of a lifetime: Dax and his sister Donatella have found the Anna Wyoming, a ship that went down during the 1889 gold rush on return from Skagway Island—very possibly carrying a fortune in gold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But real treasure is never free, and this one comes with some heavily armed strings attached. Jack and Dax struggle to keep their small crew safe from a powerful threat while they fight against the attraction they feel for each other. Between the danger of the hunt, the risks in the dive, and the thrill of being lost in passion, Dax and Jack are going to have a hard time holding on to their treasure... and to each other!</description>

  <description>The night before his wedding, Zander Walsh, his parents, and his husband-to-be are all shot when they return home and interrupt a mysterious robbery in progress. After three weeks in a coma, Zander wakes up to find out he is the only survivor, and his perfect life falls apart in an instant. &lt;br&gt; Hunky FBI Agent Jake Elliot is investigating the case, and he eventually apprehends the killer-who soon escapes. Following six months of searching, Zander and Jake realize they're being stonewalled by the FBI... and that they have slowly formed an unbreakable bond that is beginning to turn into much more. &lt;br&gt; Once they embark on a journey to apprehend the killer for the second time, they'll discover that one terrible night was much more than just an interrupted robbery. Can big business and politics cover up the truth, or will Zander and Jake's quest to unravel the mystery be the end of their newfound love and their lives?</description>

  <description>Mirabelle's past is shrouded in secrecy, from her parents' tragic deaths to her guardians' half-truths about why she can't return to her birthplace, Beau Rivage. Desperate to see the town, Mira runs away a week before her sixteenth birthday—and discovers a world she never could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Beau Rivage, nothing is what it seems—the strangely pale girl with a morbid interest in apples, the obnoxious playboy who's a beast to everyone he meets, and the chivalrous guy who has a thing for damsels in distress. Here, fairy tales come to life, curses are awakened, and ancient stories are played out again and again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fairy tales aren't pretty things, and they don't always end in happily ever after. Mira has a role to play, a fairy tale destiny to embrace or resist. As she struggles to take control of her fate, Mira is drawn into the lives of two brothers with fairy tale curses of their own . . . brothers who share a dark secret. And she'll find that love, just like fairy tales, can have sharp edges and hidden thorns.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Lynn Shepherd’s first acclaimed novel of historical suspense, &lt;em&gt;Murder at Mansfield Park, &lt;/em&gt;brilliantly reimagined the time of Jane Austen. Now, in this spellbinding new triumph, she introduces an unforgettable duo of detectives into the gaslit world of Dickens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;London, 1850. Charles Maddox had been an up-and-coming officer for the Metropolitan police until a charge of insubordination abruptly ended his career. Now he works alone, struggling to eke out a living by tracking down criminals. Whenever he needs it, he has the help of his great-uncle Maddox, a legendary “thief taker,” a detective as brilliant and intuitive as they come.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On Charles’s latest case, he’ll need all the assistance he can get.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;To his shock, Charles has been approached by Edward Tulkinghorn, the shadowy and feared attorney, who offers him a handsome price to do some sleuthing for a client. Powerful financier Sir Julius Cremorne has been receiving threatening letters, and Tulkinghorn wants Charles to—discreetly—find and stop whoever is responsible.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;But what starts as a simple, open-and-shut case swiftly escalates into something bigger and much darker. As he cascades toward a collision with an unspeakable truth, Charles can only be aided so far by Maddox. The old man shows signs of forgetfulness and anger, symptoms of an age-related ailment that has yet to be named.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intricately plotted and intellectually ambitious, &lt;em&gt;The Solitary House&lt;/em&gt; is an ingenious novel that does more than spin an enthralling tale: it plumbs the mysteries of the human mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The Solitary House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “A Victorian tour de force . . . a must-read.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; (starred review) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Dickens fans will rejoice. . . . [Lynn] Shepherd leaves the reader spellbound.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “The star of Lynn Shepherd’s intriguing mystery novel is mid-century Victorian London. . . . Her suspenseful story and winning prose ably serve her literary conceit.”&lt;strong&gt;—Associated Press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Intellectually enthralling, with dark twists at every turn . . . a haunting novel that will have you guessing until the last pages.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—Historical Novels Review&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Lynn Shepherd has a knack for setting literary murder puzzles. . . . This literary magpie-ism is a treat for book lovers, a little nudge-and-a-wink here and there which delights fans of these other works without alienating those who haven’t read them yet. . . . An intelligent, gripping and beautifully written novel.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—The Scotsman&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “The reader is plunged into a complex but comprehensible labyrinth of deception.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>"Nobody, I believe, has ever found it possible to like the heroine of &lt;em&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/em&gt;." --Lionel Trilling&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this ingenious new twist on &lt;em&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/em&gt;, the famously meek Fanny Price--whom Jane Austen's own mother called "insipid"--has been utterly transformed; she is now a rich heiress who is spoiled, condescending, and generally hated throughout the county. Mary Crawford, on the other hand, is now as good as Fanny is bad, and suffers great indignities at the hands of her vindictive neighbor. It's only after Fanny is murdered on the grounds of Mansfield Park that Mary comes into her own, teaming-up with a thief-taker from London to solve the crime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring genuine Austen characters--the same characters, and the same episodes, but each with a new twist--MURDER AT MANSFIELD PARK is a brilliantly entertaining novel that offers Jane Austen fans an engaging new heroine and story to read again and again.</description>

  <description>A mystery that explores the dark lives and unexplained secrets of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and his wife Mary, author of Frankenstein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the dying days of 1850 the young detective Charles Maddox takes on a new case. His client? The only surviving son of the long-dead poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, and his wife Mary, author of Frankenstein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles soon finds himself being drawn into the bitter battle being waged over the poet’s literary legacy, but then he makes a chance discovery that raises new doubts about the death of Shelley’s first wife, Harriet, and he starts to question whether she did indeed kill herself, or whether what really happened was far more sinister than suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he’s drawn deeper into the tangled web of the past, Charles discovers darker and more disturbing secrets, until he comes face to face with the terrible possibility that his own great-uncle is implicated in a conspiracy to conceal the truth that stretches back more than thirty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story of the Shelleys is one of love and death, of loss and betrayal. In this follow-up to the acclaimed Tom-All-Alone’s, Lynn Shepherd offers her own fictional version of that story, which suggests new and shocking answers to mysteries that still persist to this day, and have never yet been fully explained.</description>

  <description>In a dazzling mystery inspired by Bram Stoker's much-beloved Dracula, the critically acclaimed author of The Solitary House and A Fatal Likeness, Lynn Shepherd-and her brilliant Victorian detective Charles Maddox-return in their biggest, most challenging literary suspense novel yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clever, eerie and compelling by turns, The Pierced Heart finds detective Charles Maddox traveling to the remote castle of the enigmatic Baron Von Reisenberg, a pioneering scientist with a terrible secret. Meanwhile, London is in the throes of a series of brutal murders, executed by a mysterious killer known only as "The Vampire." What is the connection between the Baron and the murders? And what does the journal of a young theater assistant named Lucy have to do with it all? Maddox must find out. Drawing inspiration from both Dracula and from the strange life of a mysterious and long-forgotten real-life scientist, The Pierced Heart dramatizes a fatal clash between science and superstition, at a time of profound change and dangerous transition, and once again spins a gorgeously atmospheric literary suspense story from one of the world's most beloved novels.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;One of the first great British novels, Samuel Richardson’s classic tale became a legend to his own age and remains so today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Defying her parents’ desire for her to marry a loathsome man for his wealth, the virtuous Clarissa escapes into the dangerous arms of the charming rogue Lovelace, whose intentions are much less than honorable. This thought-provoking work, written entirely in intimate letters, exposes the delicacy and complexity of affairs of the human heart. The fatal attraction between villain and victim builds and unfolds into a relationship that haunts the imagination as fully as that of Romeo and Juliet or Tristan and Isolde.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Abridged and with an Introduction by Sheila Ortiz-Taylor and a New Afterword by Lynn Shepherd&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1943, Primo Levi, a twenty-five-year-old chemist and "Italian citizen of Jewish race," was arrested by Italian fascists and deported from his native Turin to Auschwitz. Survival in Auschwitz is Levi's classic account of his ten months in the German death camp, a harrowing story of systematic cruelty and miraculous endurance. Remarkable for its simplicity, restraint, compassion, and even wit, Survival in Auschwitz remains a lasting testament to the indestructibility of the human spirit.</description>

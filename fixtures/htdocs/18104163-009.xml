  <description>You met Rex Braden in Lovers at Heart, Book One of the The Bradens (Love in Bloom Series). Jade Johnson is about to turn his comfortable rancher's life upside down. Don't miss this powerful love story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DESTINED FOR LOVE is a hot contemporary romance with alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're flawed, funny, passionate, and very relatable for readers who enjoy adult romance, contemporary romance, and women's fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rex Braden is wealthy, hard working, and fiercely loyal. Sweat at his brow, he works the family ranch by day, then kicks back at night with part time lovers who require nothing more than his physical presence a few times each week. But that was before. Before Jade Johnson, the daughter of the man his father has been feuding with for over forty years, moves back into town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ditching a horrific relationship—and her veterinary practice in the process—Jade Johnson returns to the safety of her small hometown and finally finds her footing. That is...until her horse is injured and Rex Braden comes to her rescue. The last thing she needs is a bull-headed, too-handsome-for-his-own-good Braden complicating her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the angry family history, sparks fly between Rex and Jade, and attitudes follow. Fifteen years of stifled, forbidden love stirs a surge of passion too strong for either to deny—and the rebel in each of them rears its powerful head. Loyalties are tested, and relationships are strained. Rex and Jade are about to find out if true love really can conquer all.(</description>

  <description>You met Josh and Riley in Destined for Love (The Bradens, Book Two). Follow these two young lovers to New York and see what fate has in store for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FRIENDSHIP ON FIRE is a steamy contemporary romance with alpha male heroes and sexy, empowered women. They're flawed, funny, passionate, and very relatable for readers who enjoy adult romance, contemporary romance, and women's fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Small-town overachiever Riley Banks has finally scored her big break—working in Manhattan as a fashion design assistant for her childhood crush, Josh Braden. She enters her new job hoping to make a name for herself and—just maybe—explore the romance that slipped through her fingers way back when.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh Braden has models at his beck and call, a staff that never says never, and an elegant clothing line for the holiday season. When he hires Riley Banks he expects her to learn the business from the ground up. But the girl next door turns out to be much more than he remembered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh and Riley’s friendship heats up. Every steamy kiss, and every erotic caress stirs a love they cannot deny. But when Riley designs a wedding gown that would cause even the most jaded fashion editors to swoon, Riley's mentor accuses her of stealing the design.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing indisputable proof and the mistrust of her lover, Riley is not sure she can take the heat of life in the fast lane of the fashion industry—and Josh is forced to choose between the woman he loves and the career he adores.</description>

  <description>You loved Danica and Kaylie in SISTERS IN LOVE, find out what happens next with &lt;br&gt;SISTERS IN BLOOM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylie Snow has always been the fun, flirty, pretty sister. Now, her burgeoning baby bump, hormone infused emotions, and faltering singing career are sending her into an unexpected identity crisis. Watching her older sister Danica glide through a major career change and a new relationship with the grace of a ballerina, Kaylie’s insecurities rise to the forefront—and her relationship, with fiancé Chaz Crew, is caught in the crossfire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chaz Crew has everything he’s ever wanted: a lovely fiancé, a baby on the way, and soon, the film festival he owns will host its biggest event ever. When he’s called away to woo the festival’s largest sponsor—and the lover he’s never admitted to having—secrets from his past turn his new life upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her baby shower around the corner, and her fiancé’s big event looming, the pressure is on for Kaylie to pull herself together—and for Chaz to right his wrongs. In a few short weeks, the couple who had it all figured out will learn things about life and love that may change their minds—and their hearts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SISTERS IN BLOOM is a testament to the bond of sisters, the strength of women, and the pains and delights that accompany motherhood. A book for every mother, sister, and daughter, SISTERS IN BLOOM will resonate with readers who love to explore family dramas.</description>

  <description>You fell in love with Lacy Snow in Sisters in White (Snow Sisters, Book Three). Follow her on her path to her forever love in Sea of Love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lacy Snow hadn’t been looking for love when she met strikingly handsome and seductive Dane Braden. But how could she ignore the six-foot-three darkly handsome God who tagged and researched sharks for a living—and made every nerve in her body tangle into an overly sensitive knot? Even her fear of sharks could not suppress their intense attraction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the founder of the Brave Foundation Dane Braden travels from port-to-port educating and advocating on behalf of the mammals he adores—and spends his nights finding solace in the arms of strangers. The last thing Dane was looking for when he met Lacy Snow was a relationship, and the last thing he expected was to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen months—and hundreds of flirty emails, steamy phone calls, and sensual video chats later—they reunite, and the two take passion to a whole new level. But when Lacy’s phobia meets Dane’s past love life, and an unexpected tragedy strikes, their steamy romance is upended. Dane and Lacy are forced to face their deepest fears head-on and try and navigate their own sea of love.</description>

  <description>After having her heart broken by a country music star, Savannah Braden has sworn off men. She takes a break from her fast-paced Manhattan lifestyle for a weekend at a survivor camp to rebuild her confidence and readjust her priorities. But when she meets the handsome guide, Jack Remington, she’s drawn to everything about him—from his powerful physique to his brooding stare—despite the big chip on his shoulder. Powerless to ignore the heated glances and mounting sexual tension, Savannah begins to reassess her hasty decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After losing his wife in a tragic accident, Jack Remington found solace in the mountains of Canada. This solitary existence allows him to wallow in his guilt and punish himself for having made a decision that he believes cost his wife her life. He never expected to want to return to the life he once knew—but then again, he never expected to meet gorgeous, stubborn, and competitive Savannah Braden. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One passionate kiss is all it takes to crack the walls the two have built to protect themselves, and allow love to slip in. While Jack fights his way through his guilt, and struggles to get back into the lives of those he left behind, Savannah is there to help him heal, and together they nurture hope that they’ve finally found their forever loves.</description>

  <description>Danica and Kaylie Snow are about to celebrate the biggest day of their lives—their double wedding—on an island in the Bahamas. But no wedding is complete without a little family drama. The two sisters aren’t ready to face the father they haven’t seen since he divorced their mother and moved away to marry his mistress, and live with Lacy, the half sister they’ve never met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Danica has exchanged letters and phone calls with Lacy, Kaylie has fervently tried to pretend she doesn’t exist. Lacy is sweet, fun, and nearly a mirror image of Kaylie. To make matters worse, not only is Lacy looking forward to meeting her sisters, but she idolizes them, too. As the countdown to the wedding date ticks on, their parents are playing a devious game of revenge, and there’s a storm brewing over the island, threatening to cancel their perfect wedding. The sisters are about to find out if the bond of sisterhood really trumps all.</description>

  <description>Brianna Heart has a six-year old daughter and a twelve-year plan to keep her life as simple as possible until Layla turns eighteen. That means swearing off relationships and the drama that goes along with them, working two jobs, and being the best damn mother she can be. The last thing Capital Series Grand Prix racer Hugh Braden wants after dating media-hungry leggy models and money-hungry fan girls is a blind date. But how could he turn down a favor to one of his best friends? Hugh expected the date to go poorly, but he didn’t expect to be intensely attracted to the beautiful brown-eyed bartender who completely blows him off—and steals his every thought thereafter. When Brianna’s perfectly orchestrated life turns upside down, Hugh is there to help, softening the turmoil, and maybe even rescuing her heart from the lonely place where it has been hiding. Can a man who doesn’t believe in fate and a woman who doesn’t believe in true love find happiness in each other’s arms forever?</description>

  <description>Ellie Parker is a master at building walls around her heart. In the twenty-five years she’s been alive, Dex Remington has been the only person who has always believed in her and been there for her. But four years earlier she came to Dex seeking comfort, and then disappeared like a thief in the night, leaving him a broken man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dex Remington is one of the top PC game developers in the U.S. He’s handsome, smart, and numb. So damn numb that he’s not sure he’ll ever find a reason to feel again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance encounter sparks intense desires in Ellie and Dex. Desires that make her want to run—and make him want to feel. A combination of lust and fear leads these young lovers down a dangerous path. Is it possible to cross a burned bridge or are they destined to be apart forever?</description>

  <description>Kara Knight can't wait to leave her hometown for the promise of nursing school and a fresh start on her future--leaving behind an over protective mother, a broken heart and painful memories. However, twenty-five miles away, the brother she doesn't know is determined to be reunited with the sister he cannot forget. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kara is abducted and thrown into her obsessive captor's delusional world. As the past she thought she knew unravels around her, Kara struggles to make sense of the memories that come creeping back, threatening her sanity and her safety. Meanwhile, Kara's mother races against time to save the daughter she fears she will lose when a long-held secret is revealed. The hours tick away as Roland plays out his plan--to take Kara with him into death at the exact moment of their birth, never to be separated again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRACES OF KARA is an action packed, pulse pounding psychological thriller/suspense novel that features a determined killer who slowly loses his grip on reality as his carefully detailed plan starts to fall apart and a heroine determined to move forward with her life who now must reconcile everything she believed to be true about her family with the reality of their tragic past.</description>

  <description>On the surface Junie Olson’s life looks idyllic, from her handsome husband and beautiful daughter to her successful business, the bakery she always dreamed of opening. But in the past few months her world has slowly unraveled.  Her precocious child is withdrawing, showing unexplainable signs of emotional regression, a condition that frays the bonds of Junie’s once impenetrable marriage.  When her father dies suddenly of a heart attack, Junie packs up her daughter and goes home to help her mother.  Her homecoming stirs up memories of the nightmare she thought she had put behind her, the disappearance of her childhood friend, Ellen.  Haunted by recurring memories of what happened on that fateful day, Junie must gather the courage to revisit her past and untangle the secrets surrounding her missing friend, and the trauma that has caused her little girl to climb back into herself. As the pieces come together on the event that shook her small town, and at the risk of losing everyone she loves, Junie will question everything she thought she could rely on and everyone she thought she knew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHERE PETALS FALL is a gripping and emotional novel with an undercurrent of suspense, featuring a determined mother whose world slowly comes apart around her.  Where Petals Fall will appeal to fans of Lisa Scottoline's Save Me or Jodi Picoult's Salem Falls, who love an emotional and gripping read. They will root for Junie as they follow her transition into an indomitable heroine who must reconcile what she discovers about her husband and family’s tragic past, and find a way to put the pieces of her family back together and carry on.</description>

  <description>What if all the legends you’ve learned were wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brutally attacked by one god and unfairly cursed by another she faithfully served, Medusa has spent the last two thousand years living out her punishment on an enchanted isle in the Aegean Sea. A far cry from the monster legends depict, she’s spent her time educating herself, gardening, and desperately trying to frighten away adventure seekers who occasionally end up, much to her dismay, as statues when they manage to catch her off guard. As time marches on without her, Medusa wishes for nothing more than to be given a second chance at a life stolen away at far too young an age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then comes a day when Hermes, one of the few friends she still has and the only deity she trusts, petitions the rest of the gods and goddesses to reverse the curse. Thus begins a journey toward healing and redemption, of reclaiming a life after tragedy, and of just how powerful friendship and love can be—because sometimes, you have to sink in the deep end of the sea before you can rise back up again.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;You, dear reader, continue at your own risk. It is not for the faint of heart—no more so than the study of dragons itself. But such study offers rewards beyond compare: to stand in a dragon’s presence, even for the briefest of moments—even at the risk of one’s life—is a delight that, once experienced, can never be forgotten. . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the world, from Scirland to the farthest reaches of Eriga, know Isabella, Lady Trent, to be the world’s preeminent dragon naturalist. She is the remarkable woman who brought the study of dragons out of the misty shadows of myth and misunderstanding into the clear light of modern science. But before she became the illustrious figure we know today, there was a bookish young woman whose passion for learning, natural history, and, yes, dragons defied the stifling conventions of her day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here at last, in her own words, is the true story of a pioneering spirit who risked her reputation, her prospects, and her fragile flesh and bone to satisfy her scientific curiosity; of how she sought true love and happiness despite her lamentable eccentricities; and of her thrilling expedition to the perilous mountains of Vystrana, where she made the first of many historic discoveries that would change the world forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marie Brennan introduces an enchanting new world in A Natural History of Dragons.</description>

  <description>A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of very curious photographs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow—impossible though it seems—they may still be alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.</description>

  <description>VENGEANCE WILL BE HERS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allison Sekemoto once struggled with the question: human or monster? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the death of her love, Zeke, she has her answer.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MONSTER &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allie will embrace her cold vampire side to hunt down and end Sarren, the psychopathic vampire who murdered Zeke. But the trail is bloody and long, and Sarren has left many surprises for Allie and her companions—her creator, Kanin, and her blood brother, Jackal. The trail is leading straight to the one place they must protect at any cost—the last vampire-free zone on Earth, Eden. And Sarren has one final, brutal shock in store for Allie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a ruined world where no life is sacred and former allies can turn on you in one heartbeat, Allie will face her darkest days. And if she succeeds, triumph is short-lived in the face of surviving forever alone.</description>

  <description>Josephine Hemlock has spent the last 10 years hiding from the Curse that killed her mother. But when a mysterious man arrives at her ivy-covered, magic-fortified home, it’s clear her mother’s killer has finally come to destroy the rest of the Hemlock bloodline. Before Jo can even think about fighting back, she must figure out who she’s fighting in the first place. The more truth Jo uncovers, the deeper she falls into witchcraft darker than she ever imagined. Trapped and running out of time, she begins to wonder if the very Curse that killed her mother is the only way to save everyone she loves.</description>

  <description>Having left the Army and safely transferred from Architecture into Construction Management, Tom thinks he can relax from ideologically charged individuals trying to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately his conservative views just keep getting up people's noses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time it's the feminists at university who have devised a plot to put Tom back in his place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, even they couldn't have predicted that it would result in Tom fighting African warlords to save his true love's life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tom is going to have to battle through feminists, warlords and Africa's fiercest animals to get his girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But at least you are allowed to shoot the warlords.&lt;br&gt;And the lions.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What happens when you tell a wounded war veteran that the freedom and values he fought for are 'unsustainable'? Well, the environmentalists are about to find out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After being wounded in Iraq, Lt. Tom Grafton reluctantly accepts his medical discharge from the Australian Army. He returns to civilian life broken and without purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He finally starts getting his life back together as he develops a passion for three things: a smart and sassy doctor, beautiful traditional architecture, and the serenity and skill of deer hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what will Tom do when each of these is threatened?</description>

  <description>From NEW YORK TIMES bestselling authors Holly Black and Cassandra Clare comes a riveting new series that defies what you think you know about the world of magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From two bestselling superstars, a dazzling and magical middle-grade collaboration centering on the students of the Magisterium, an academy for those with a propensity toward magic. In this first book, a new student comes to the Magisterium against his will -- is it because he is destined to be a powerful magician, or is the truth more twisted than that? It's a journey that will thrill you, surprise you, and make you wonder about the clear-cut distinction usually made between good and evil.</description>

  <description>"Then she opened her mouth to scream--and recognised me. It was what I'd been waiting for. She froze. She looked into my eyes. She said, "It's you."&lt;br&gt;"&lt;br&gt;Meet Jake. A bit on the elderly side (he turns 201 in March), but you'd never suspect it. Nonstop sex and exercise will do that for you--and a diet with lots of animal protein. Jake is a werewolf, and after the unfortunate and violent death of his one contemporary, he is now the last of his species. Although he is physically healthy, Jake is deeply distraught and lonely. &lt;br&gt;Jake's depression has carried him to the point where he is actually contemplating suicide--even if it means terminating a legend thousands of years old. It would seem to be easy enough for him to end everything. But for very different reasons there are two dangerous groups pursuing him who will stop at nothing to keep him alive. &lt;br&gt;Here is a powerful, definitive new version of the werewolf legend--mesmerising and incredibly sexy. In Jake, Glen Duncan has given us a werewolf for the twenty-first century--a man whose deeds can only be described as monstrous but who is in some magical way deeply human. &lt;br&gt;One of the most original, audacious, and terrifying novels in years.</description>

  <description>Game of Thrones meets the Grimm's fairy tales in this twisted, fast-paced romantic fantasy-adventure about Sleeping Beauty's daughter, a warrior princess who must fight to reclaim her throne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though she looks like a mere mortal, Princess Aurora is a fairy blessed with enhanced strength, bravery, and mercy yet cursed to destroy the free will of any male who kisses her. Disguised as a boy, she enlists the help of the handsome but also cursed Prince Niklaas to fight legions of evil and free her brother from the ogre queen who stole Aurora's throne ten years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Aurora triumph over evil and reach her brother before it's too late? Can Aurora and Niklaas break the curses that will otherwise forever keep them from finding their one true love?</description>

  <description>Princess Snow is missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her home planet is filled with violence and corruption at the hands of King Matthias and his wife as they attempt to punish her captors. The king will stop at nothing to get his beloved daughter back—but that’s assuming she wants to return at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essie has grown used to being cold. Temperatures on the planet Thanda are always sub-zero, and she fills her days with coding and repairs for the seven loyal drones that run the local mines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious young man named Dane crash-lands near her home, Essie agrees to help the pilot repair his ship. But soon she realizes that Dane’s arrival was far from accidental, and she’s pulled into the heart of a war she’s risked everything to avoid. With the galaxy’s future—and her own—in jeopardy, Essie must choose who to trust in a fiery fight for survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;WICKED above her hipbone, GIRL across her heart&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words are like a road map to reporter Camille Preaker’s troubled past. Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, Camille’s first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;NASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her family’s Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;HARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its taut, crafted writing, &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/em&gt; is addictive, haunting, and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>Having earned a prestigious position, Matt Logan began his career working for the government. It was a welcome change from the life he had grown accustomed to in college-although Matt didn't know at the time that it would come to him with a cost. He carries in his mind a secret he must either learn how to live with or divulge. In the background are the remnants of the American antiquity that lead to a government and political downfall and challenge the ethics of an honest man. Today, with the biggest bust of criminal and corrupt politicians in history, written against the sweeping backdrop of historical and political events, there is an urgent and opportune relevance. In Dr. Cristina Guarneri's See No Evil, follow Matt's life in time from present day to the year 2029 as it unveils the mystery, the events, and the path of his future.</description>

  <description>Beyond the mirrored windows of the citys high-rise buildings; the landscape of a metropolis that holds itself to the outskirts of the Hudson River, leaves a city that set the standard for corruption and overshadowed itself by the darkness of political deception. Behind the thriving neighborhoods of cultural scenery, the sixth borough had become a blanket that was once woven with the challenges of deceit versus ethics. No one knows what tomorrow will bring, but for integrity to prevail, an awakening would need to be brought to the city streets that were once plagued by the mysteries of Wall Street West.</description>

  <description>For centuries the people had lost their will to be represented by lawmakers. Politics was seen as an unfair game. Continuing to watch with disappointment in the nation's leadership, it was America that continued to take a turn for the worse; with high unemployment rates, homes being foreclosed, terrorism, and a lack of accountability by public officials. It was clear that the House of Representatives would not be able to get the support needed to turn the nation around for the better. It would take commitment to change. Maybe it was the cold midnight air, or the idea of one day returning to his roots-his love affair with government weighed heavy on the mind of one-time elected official Matt Logan. Having to make a choice, he would never be able to tell his most trusted confidants his decision. Miles away, in a crowded courtroom, a jury returned a stunning verdict against some of the finest aristocrats in history. No one ever imagined that the most well-known cities were holding a secret. It took power to run a city. It took certainty to unveil the most sophisticated crimes being watched by the world. What was safe anymore in politics? Top law enforcement agencies would love to know. But only Matt knew their deceit. On paper, a politician's situation looked good, but in the end only an Inceptor knows the true covenant that awaits him...</description>

  <description>Listening to the rain, Kimberly stared out into the dark, gray sky. She felt blessed to have had the months without speaking to Michael weekly. It was hard to imagine how it would be forced away. A choice, a decision...it wasn't fully his; rather, it was the choice to live far away. It felt like it was a premature ending that hadn't been given the chance to grow. Kimberly couldn't imagine that after years of holding onto her secret desire for Michael's love and friendship that he would now be gone. The days and nights felt long. Days ran into each other, as she lost track of time. Kimberly believed in the power of prayer, as she tirelessly cried with no chance in sight of it stopping. Kimberly cried so much that day that every ounce of strength that she had left in her put her to sleep. Her body couldn't take it anymore. In her sleep she was revealed her future.</description>

  <description>Recognizing how politics would come to those involved with a cost; the events and roles that would shape him into becoming an authentic leader. Looking into time was all that Mat Logan could do to understand his future. The American people were waiting to be inspired rather than being disappointed time and time again by politicians; instead they watched the unfolding of history repeat itself. They became witnesses of his life. For without his dreams we would never live through the memoire of a prodigious soul. Prodigious Soul, the sequel to Sovereign Journey, was written about the true-life characteristics of a person from New Providence, NJ. With having spent his years working in the areas of politics and government affairs as a talented paralegal, chief of staff, and regional campaign manager.</description>

  <description>Matt Logan was fresh out of college when he began his career working for the government. It was a welcome change from the life that he had grown accustomed to since his freshman year of college. Having earned a prestigious position, Matt didn't know that it would come to him with a cost. He carried in his mind a number of secrets and strategies over the years, with his biggest secret still being held today. It was a 5am and the city had overslept today, but it was necessary. For without this long sleep you could never learn the true reason behind being here. Could the events have been made up? Or are they part of a sovereign journey.</description>

  <description>No one goes through life saying I hope that I will be alone and unhappy forever, but at the same time taking that risk to be in love is difficult. That was the belief of the very person Sara Thomas. Sara had spent her whole life hiding from the very person that would inevitably change her. Although Sara was determined to see Michael again, what mattered most was asking for his forgiveness, more importantly, his willingness to stay forever.</description>

  <description>Lewis Oaken understood what it meant to be untouchable and unstoppable. He was all of these things and more. A young man who was known for starting trouble, it is Lewis's life journey that brings him to lead by example. Resplendent: The Invincible Series is a partially-based true story based on the philosophy and phenomenon of a real person from Pequannock, New Jersey. A talented wrestler from Pequannock Township High School, he went on to receive a wrestling scholarship and graduated from Sacred Heart University in Connecticut. Although the details and events of this book are fictional, the inspiration and characteristics of this true life person are anything but imaginary. Resplendent: The Invincible Series explores the belief that we cannot be touched by anyone and that we are able to be free from anything and everything. It also explores what it means to be a survivor and what it really means to be resplendent, invincible.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It is a time of celebration in the Pingkang Li, where imperial scholars and bureaucrats mingle with beautiful courtesans. At the center is the Lotus Palace, home of the most exquisite courtesans in China...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maidservant Yue-ying is not one of those beauties. Street-smart and practical, she's content to live in the shadow of her infamous mistress—until she meets the aristocratic playboy Bai Huang. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bai Huang lives in a privileged world Yue-ying can barely imagine, yet alone share, but as they are thrown together in an attempt to solve a deadly mystery, they both start to dream of a different life. Yet Bai Huang's position means that all she could ever be to him is his concubine—will she sacrifice her pride to follow her heart?</description>

  <description>And then came war . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Today." Sera James spends most of her time arranging auctions for the art world's elite clientele. When her search to uncover an original portrait of an unknown Holocaust victim leads her to William Hanover III, they learn that this painting is much more than it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Vienna, 1942." Adele Von Bron has always known what was expected of her. As a prodigy of Vienna's vast musical heritage, this concert violinist intends to carry on her family's tradition and play with the Vienna Philharmonic. But when the Nazis learn that she helped smuggle Jews out of the city, Adele is taken from her promising future and thrust into the horrifying world of Auschwitz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The veil of innocence is lifted to expose a shuddering presence of evil, and Adele realizes that her God-given gift is her only advantage; she must play. Becoming a member of the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz, she fights for survival. Adele's barbed-wire walls begin to kill her hope as the months drag into nearly two years in the camp. With surprising courage against the backdrop of murder and despair, Adele finally confronts a question that has been tugging at her heart: Even in the midst of evil, can she find hope in worshipping God with her gift?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sera and William learn more about the subject of the mysterious portrait--Adele--they are reminded that whatever horrors one might face, God's faithfulness never falters.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Orphaned at an early age, Philip Ashley is raised by his benevolent older cousin, Ambrose. Resolutely single, Ambrose delights in Philip as his heir, a man who will love his grand home as much as he does himself. But the cosy world the two construct is shattered when Ambrose sets off on a trip to Florence. There he falls in love and marries - and there he dies suddenly. Jealous of his marriage, racked by suspicion at the hints in Ambrose's letters, and grief-stricken by his death, Philip prepares to meet his cousin's widow with hatred in his heart. Despite himself, Philip is drawn to this beautiful, sophisticated, mysterious Rachel like a moth to the flame. And yet . . . might she have had a hand in Ambrose's death?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>"Anyone starting this book under the impression that he may sleepily relax is in for a shock...continually provokes both pity and terror." --&lt;em&gt;The Observer&lt;/em&gt; (UK) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A classic of alienation and horror, &lt;em&gt;The Birds&lt;/em&gt; was immortalised by Hitchcock in his celebrated film. The five other chilling stories in this collection echo a sense of dislocation and mock man's dominance over the natural world. The mountain paradise of 'Monte Verità' promises immortality, but at a terrible price; a neglected wife haunts her husband in the form of an apple tree; a professional photographer steps out from behind the camera and into his subject's life; a date with a cinema usherette leads to a walk in the cemetery; and a jealous father finds a remedy when three's a crowd . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bones&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Fringe&lt;/em&gt; in a big, dark, scary, brilliantly-plotted urban thriller that will leave you guessing until the very end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly Boswell knows how to keep secrets. Living in a DC trailer park, she knows better than to share anything that would make her a target with her classmates. Like her mother's job as an exotic dancer, her obsession with the personal ads, and especially the emotions she can taste when she brushes against someone's skin. But when a serial killer goes on a killing spree and starts attacking students, leaving cryptic ads in the newspaper that only Nearly can decipher, she confides in the one person she shouldn't trust: the new guy at school—a reformed bad boy working undercover for the police, doing surveillance. . . on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly might be the one person who can put all the clues together, and if she doesn't figure it all out soon—she'll be next.</description>

  <description>Katherine, the Duchess of Hampshire, has spent the past three years living a lie. Her marriage is one of convenience, and thanks to her husband John’s highly political nature and stuffy public persona, she’s smothered the fire that once burned within her. Thankfully, he’s a different man behind closed doors, and the more time she spends around him and his lover, an artist by the name of Henry Fletcher, the more she begins to wish for something she thinks can never be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes between the three of them after an otherwise uneventful evening. Words once left unsaid are spoken, repressed feelings can no longer be contained, and with just a few fevered whispers, their future’s are forever altered. But there is a darkness drawing closer to them, and just when they think they have a chance at true happiness, it’s snatched from their fingers by an unseen enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone knows their secret, and is not afraid to use it against them to get what they want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a desperate bid to avoid a scandal, the duke summons an old friend to aid them, a man with a shadowy past and secrets of his own. The more they discover about their blackmailer, the more they realize they may be facing a greater force than they could have imagined, and soon, everyone is a suspect, even the very man they thought was helping them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Warning: This book contains explicitly sexual scenes, including M/F, M/M, and M/F/M scenarios. Reader discretion is advised*&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; **New improved version available in paperback** &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When young, talented medical student Jazz decides to make a case study of Adam Attenborough for her school research project, she has no idea what she’s getting into. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam is handsome, mysterious, and utterly miserable, trapped in the labyrinth of his debilitating mental disorder. After a terrible accident leaving him crippled by short term memory loss, his life becomes a puzzle with pieces that don’t fit together. Fascinated by Adam’s story and his inventive coping strategy of taking photos and leaving himself notes to help remember faces - and discern friend from foe - Adam quickly becomes more than just a case study to Jazz. Turning the pages of his journal, she realizes that Adam’s old girlfriend is the magnificent and beautiful TV star Sophie Steele, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Engrossed in the love story that unfolds in the pages of Adam’s journal as well as newspaper clippings she uncovers at her local library, Jazz quickly becomes intrigued by the man himself, and is driven to discover the truth of what happened to Sophie Steele, once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ** CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE AND VIOLENT SCENES. RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 15+ ** &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Noah and Ronan are half brothers. They co-own a stud farm in South Africa. The brothers couldn't be more different; Noah is shrewd and volatile whereas the laid-back Ronan is in the grip of alcoholism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owning a farm isn't the only thing that ties the brothers together; there are also women in their lives: Noah's long-term girlfriend Chantelle, who is an American ramp model, and Alice, Noah's personal secretary, who is in love with her boss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But true love doesn't always run smoothly, and both Chantelle and Alice become involved with the wayward brother Ronan. When emotions run high, violence often plays a role. Now, there is a murder, and a contract killer is on the loose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who is next on the target list? And can sharp-tongued Detective Harry Rodgers, with the help of his quirky assistant Mini, solve the crime before another murder takes place?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ** CONTAINS SOME STRONG LANGUAGE, VIOLENT SCENES AND MILD SEXUAL CONTENT. RECOMMENDED FOR AGES 16/17+ ** &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Reviewers continue to rave about &lt;em&gt;And the Bride Wore White: Seven Secrets To Purity&lt;/em&gt;. But the greatest proof of it's effect is in the lives of tens of thousands of young women who've embraced the book's message. Each chapter of &lt;em&gt;And the Bride Wore White&lt;/em&gt; begins with a narrative of Dannah Gresh's young love life, taken from her own teenage journals. She transparently shares her struggles and successes, her moments of pain followed by healing and the moments of triumph. This story-line grips the young reader while they learn statistically proven risk-reduction factors. The end result are usable "how-to-say-no" skills that can reduce the risk of a young woman's heart being broken by sexual sin. In this update, Dannah and her friends share open letters of encouragement to young women, one for those who chose life and another to those who chose abortion, a letter to teen girls addicted to pornography and another to girls who have experienced sexual abuse, and many more specific to a young woman's unique circumstances. &lt;strong&gt;Over 250,000 copies sold!&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>When reclusive novelist Senna Richards wakes up on her thirty-third birthday, everything has changed. Caged behind an electrical fence, locked in a house in the middle of the snow, Senna is left to decode the clues to find out why she was taken. If she wants her freedom, she has to take a close look at her past. But, her past has a heartbeat…and her kidnapper is nowhere to be found. With her survival hanging by a thread, Senna soon realizes this is a game. A dangerous one. Only the truth can set her free.</description>

  <description>A classic work of science fiction by renowned Polish novelist and satirist Stanislaw Lem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kris Kelvin arrives at the planet Solaris to study the ocean that covers its surface, he finds a painful, hitherto unconscious memory embodied in the living physical likeness of a long-dead lover. Others examining the planet, Kelvin learns, are plagued with their own repressed and newly corporeal memories. The Solaris ocean may be a massive brain that creates these incarnate memories, though its purpose in doing so is unknown, forcing the scientists to shift the focus of their quest and wonder if they can truly understand the universe without first understanding what lies within their hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Translated by Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox.</description>

It is a dramatic finish to an epic story of action, adventure, betrayal, forgiveness and love</description>

  <description>What if Darth Vader took an active role in raising his son? What if "Luke, I am your father" was just a stern admonishment from an annoyed dad? In this hilarious and sweet comic reimagining, Darth Vader is a dad like any other except with all the baggage of being the Dark Lord of the Sith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celebrated artist Jeffrey Brown's delightful illustrations give classic &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; moments a fresh twist, presenting the trials and joys of parenting through the lens of a galaxy far, far away. Life lessons include lightsaber batting practice, using the Force to raid the cookie jar, Take Your Child to Work Day on the Death Star ("Er, he looks just like you, Lord Vader!"), and the special bond shared between any father and son.</description>

  <description>What is an eighteen year old newly wed doing traveling on a massive merchant ship anyways? Hadn’t she gone to Greece on tour in a ballet as a dancer? These are questions, Katy asks herself while traveling the high seas with Don her chief officer. However, little do they know a smuggling ring is also on board for this ride, on a blue diamond exchange and when explosions and threats to sink the ship also happen, they must try to save themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting to know the smugglers, the Arabic and Pakistani deck hands and Don, the Greek Seaman is an exciting sea adventure with enough suspense and romance that will make you laugh and cry. It will take you on a voyage to experience the magnificent soothing wonders and beautiful scenery at sea, dolpins, flying fishes and takes you through storms and hurricanes where Katy finds herself navigating through it with a seasick crew. From Piraeus, Greece, your visit the ports of Lebanon and Libya and enjoy the exotic magic of the bazaar. The love between Don and Katy, in their ordeal at sea makes this a memorable story.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Their love was meant to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Megan Rosenberg moves to Ireland, everything in her life seems to fall into place. After growing up in America, she's surprised to find herself feeling at home in her new school. She connects with a group of friends, and she is instantly drawn to darkly handsome Adam DeRÍs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Megan is about to discover that her feelings for Adam are tied to a fate that was sealed long ago—and that the passion and power that brought them together could be their ultimate destruction.</description>

  <description>Their love could destroy them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the ages, Marked Ones have harnessed the powers of the four elements: Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. Much about the elements is shrouded in mystery, but one thing is certain: A relationship between two Marked Ones has the potential to cause widespread devastation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Megan and Adam—Air and Water—are determined to defy the risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the power that swirls inside Megan is growing in twisted ways. And the closer she is to Adam, the closer Megan comes to unleashing a dark force that could spell destruction for the entire Marked line.</description>

  <description>In this anthology, 20 authors explore the dark and hidden meanings behind some of the most beloved Mother Goose nursery rhymes through short story retellings. The dark twists on classic tales range from exploring whether Jack truly fell or if Jill pushed him instead to why Humpty Dumpty, fragile and alone, sat atop so high of a wall. The authors include Nina Berry, Sarwat Chadda, Leigh Fallon, Gretchen McNeil, and Suzanne Young.</description>

  <description>New York City. With a population of almost nineteen million people, it's easy to remain anonymous even if you're a serial killer, torturing and murdering beautiful young women. The killer has another victim right now, locked in a basement somewhere in the city. For NYPD detectives Turner and Marcinko, it's their job to sift through those nineteen million and narrow their list to the one before it's too late. And they're sure they have the right man in their sights. Fusing alternating viewpoints with devastating precision, Leather's top-notch thriller dives deep into the mind of a demented killer as tension mounts immeasurably. Turner and Marcinko's prime suspect is screenwriter wannabe Marvin Waller. He is becoming increasingly frustrated by his lack of success and the cops think he might be channeling his anger into murder ? yet he doesn't seem to be at all concerned that they are hot on his trail. As Turner and Marcinko close in on Waller they have to wonder: is he the killer? And if he isn't ? who is? Only time will tell ? and time is one thing they do not have. An unrelenting vice-grip of suspense and fear, The Basement is the ultimate shocker with a shattering climax that will leave you battered, bruised, and broken.</description>

His orders are to infiltrate the tight-knit team, gain their confidence, and ultimately betray them.

As Shepherd finds himself on the firing line, he has to decide exactly where his loyalties lie.</description>

  <description>The second in the exhilarating new series by Stephen Leather that began with NIGHTFALL: of-the-minute thrillers with a supernatural twist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Nightingale found it hard enough to save lives when he was a cop. Now he needs to save a soul - his sister's. But to save her he has to find her and they've been separated since birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When everyone Jack talks to about his sister dies horribly, he realises that someone, or something, is determined to keep them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If he's going to save his sister, he's going to have to do what he does best - negotiate. But any negotiation with the forces of darkness comes at a terrible price. And first Jack must ask himself the question: is every soul worth saving?</description>

  <description>"&lt;em&gt;While investigating a crew of people-traffickers…Dan Shepherd discovers a cross-Channel currency-smuggling operation. Posing as a low-level criminal, Shepherd infiltrates the gang, befriending its London soldiers and establishing contact with the Albanian gangster who masterminds the business from his swank Paris flat. As Shepherd soon discovers, currency-smuggling isn't the only business these guys dabble in. With the help of a government contact, they've been churning out fake British passports, a scam that eventually finds Shepherd surrounded by Semtex and racing to foil a terrorist plot…The story builds to a boil as Shepherd, piecing together the terrorists' plans as he goes, lands aboard a Paris-bound Eurostar train with four suicide bombers as his fellow passengers. It's a grand finale that'll have readers on edge. Nicely, and seemingly effortlessly, done&lt;/em&gt;."  —Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)</description>

  <description>Dan Shepherd is used to putting his life on the line. It goes with the territory when you're an undercover cop. Now working for Britain's top anti-organized crime agency, Shepherd is pitting his wits against the toughest criminals in the country. But when the man who once saved his life is kidnapped in the badlands of Iraq, thrown into a basement, and threatened with execution, Shepherd has to decide whether his loyalties lie with his country, his career, or his friend. Shepherd and his former SAS colleagues realize that the hostage has been abandoned by the British government and that, officially, nothing is being done to rescue him. And with the execution only days away, Shepherd knows that the only way to save his friend's life is to put himself on the firing line in the most dangerous city in the world—Baghdad.</description>

  <description>There's a full moon over Los Angeles, and for police psychologist Jamie Beaverbook that can only mean one thing: the crazies will be out in force. But when he is called into the station for a consult in the middle of the night, even the jaded Beaverbrook can't believe his ears. The innocent-looking girl in the interview room doesn?t look a day over fifteen, yet the cops say Terry Ferriman was discovered in an alley off of Sunset Boulevard, her mouth smeared with blood as she crouched over the body of a man whose throat was torn out. A basic psych evaluation convinces Beaverbrook of Terry's sanity and yet he can't ignore the evidence that seems to point in one extraordinary direction. He tells himself he doesn?t believe in vampires, but after some digging, the good doctor begins to realize that the shadows of L.A. conceal a world where girls like Terry never age and where blood is more valuable than gold. Sharp, witty, and deliciously sinister, Once Bitten is a satisfying paranormal thriller from bestselling British author Stephen Leather.</description>

  <description>Dan Shepherd is used to putting his life on the line. Working for an elite undercover squad, he’s lied, cheated, and conned in order to bring Britain’s most wanted criminals to justice. But when a powerful drug lord starts to kill off witnesses to his crimes, Shepherd has no choice but to go undercover in a high-security prison—a world where one wrong move will mean certain death. As Shepherd gambles everything to move in on his quarry, he soon realizes that the man he’s hunting is far more dangerous than the police realize—and that he’s capable of striking outside the prison walls and hitting Shepherd where it hurts most.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"This book rocks! Scandalously delicious in the same vein as &lt;em&gt;Pretty Little Liars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Revenge&lt;/em&gt;, with a wickedly clever plot that kept me guessing right up until the end." -- Gemma Halliday, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of&lt;em&gt; Honeymoon in High Heels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne Dowling practically runs her exclusive academy on New York’s Upper East Side—that is, until she accidentally burns part of it down and gets sent to a prestigious boarding school outside of Boston. Determined to make it back to New York, Anne could care less about making friends at the preppy Wheatley School. That is, until her roommate, Isabella’s body is found in the woods behind the school. When everyone else is oddly silent, Anne becomes determined to uncover the truth no matter how many rules she has to break to do it. With the help of Isabella’s twin brother Anthony, and a cute classmate named Brent, Anne discovers that Isabella wasn’t quite the innocent nerdy girl she pretended to be. But someone will do anything to stop Anne’s snooping in this fast-paced, unputdownable read—even if it means framing her for Isabella’s murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kara Taylor's breathtaking debut reads like &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl &lt;/em&gt;crossed with &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in an enveloping start to the Prep School Confidential series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A whirlwind of secrets, lies, and scandals. I whipped through the pages, frantic to discover the killer." –Jill Hathaway, author of &lt;em&gt;Slide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fast-paced, suspenseful and scarily believable. It will keep you guessing as you race to the end!" -- Daisy Whitney, author of &lt;em&gt;The Mockingbirds&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;When You Were Here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Disaster&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Walking Disaster&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon continues in the first heart-pounding new adult romance in The Maddox Brothers series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiercely independent Camille "Cami" Camlin gladly moved on from her childhood before it was over. She has held down a job since before she could drive, and moved into her own apartment after her freshman year of college. Now tending bar at The Red Door, Cami doesn’t have time for much else besides work and classes, until a trip to see her boyfriend is cancelled, leaving her with a first weekend off in almost a year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trenton Maddox was the king of Eastern State University, dating co-eds before he even graduated high school. His friends wanted to be him, and women wanted to tame him, but after a tragic accident turned his world upside down, Trenton leaves campus to come to grips with the crushing guilt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen months later, Trenton is living at home with his widower father, and works full-time at a local tattoo parlor to help with the bills. Just when he thinks his life is returning to normal, he notices Cami sitting alone at a table at The Red. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the baby sister of four rowdy brothers, Cami believes she’ll have no problem keeping her new friendship with Trenton Maddox strictly platonic. But when a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever—even if she is the only reason their already broken family could fall apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first installment of the Maddox Brothers books, readers can experience the rush of reading &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Disaster&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, all over again.</description>

  <description>It’s Travis and Abby’s first Valentine’s Day as a married couple, from Abby’s perspective. This is not a snippet from Walking Disaster, or even a deleted scene from Beautiful Disaster. It’s something completely new.</description>

  <description>When the Royal Wizard of Westland poisons the king so that his puppet prince can take the throne and start a continental war, a young squire is forced to run for his life carrying the powerful sword that his dying monarch burdened him with from the death bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two brothers find a magic ring and start on paths to becoming the most powerful sort of enemies, while an evil young sorceress unwillingly falls in love with one of them when he agrees to help her steal a dragon's egg for her father. Her father just happens to be the Royal Wizard, and despite his daughter's feelings, he would love nothing more than to sacrifice the boy! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of these characters, along with the Wolf King of Wildermont, the Lion Lord of Westland, and a magical hawk named Talon, are on a collision course toward Willa the Witch Queen's palace in the distant kingdom of Highwander. There the very bedrock is formed of the powerful magical substance called Wardstone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are the heroes? And will they get there before the Royal Wizard and his evil hordes do? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever happens, the journey will be spectacular, and the confrontation will be cataclysmic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you took every major epic fantasy that has ever been written and twisted them all into one fantastic tale of magic, sword play and just plain old fantasy fun, you might get the first half of this monster of a read. The last half is a climax so thrilling that words can't even describe it. This is what fantasy fans have been waiting for...</description>

  <description>Two young men, on the cusp of adulthood go on a hunt they want to remember forever.  When they cross a ridge and leave the protected boundries of their kingdom, they find themselves a cavern to explore.  Inside the cavern they find exactly what they were seeking.....    &lt;br&gt;Lurking inside this hole in the earth is something they will never forget....  If they can live to remember!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;** A Note - Though March is the "First Dragoneer," he does not enter the Dragoneer Saga in Book One - The Royal Dragoneers. He arrives though, in the early chapters of the Dragon Saga Book II - Cold Hearted Son of a Witch, and remains in the series from that point.</description>

  <description>Hold on to your dragon! You’re about to journey through a brave new world of hearty survivors straight into a dragon riding, troll fighting adventure for the ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After struggling for more than two centuries to tame the inhospitable, dragon infested Islands where they washed up, the descendants of the survivors of a lost passenger ship are now striving to tame the Mainland they have found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Goblin King, an Ivory antlered demon called Gravelbone, has a different plan for the men who are invading his territory. He and his Nightshade are rallying the trolls to defend their lands.&lt;br&gt;With the help of the dragons, goblins, and orcs they plan on rendering the wall the humans have built useless, so that they can drive man back to the islands from where they came.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When stubborn King Blanchard finally accepts that the kingdom really is under attack it may be too late, and the only ones who can save the people on the Mainland have been locked away in the dungeon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join some brave young men and their mentor, a grizzled old King’s Ranger, and a particularly clever young magic wielding woman, as they traverse the wild frontier, and sail to King’s Island to warn the King of the warring trolls. Then hold on for your life as you tear through the pages, because the pure blooded dragons they have befriended have another plan all together.</description>

  <description>The Wizard and the Warlord is the gripping conclusion to the epic trilogy that M. R. Mathias wrote in a Texas prison. This compelling volume brings the elves, dwarves, giants, and the dragons into the story again as our heroes, led by High King Mikahl and the great wizard Hyden Hawk, are forced to fight for the fate of the Kingdoms. This time, they do so against the terrible creature that Gerard Skyler has become, and the legions of demon-beasts at his command. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From M.R. Mathias, &lt;br&gt;This is the CONCLUSION to The Wardstone Trilogy. It has taken me several years and a lot of sleepless nights to complete this grand work. When I decided to become a writer I gave it my all, from the moment I put the inkpen to paper in prison, to the new epic I am halfway through writing now. I hope you like reading Wardstone as much as I enjoyed writing it and bringing it to fruition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may see some of these characters and locals again, but the story of Claret and mighty Ironspike comes to its magnificent end here.</description>

  <description>What happens when a newly divorced mother, her eleven year old son, and their overprotective Rottweiler move into a house that is haunted by the victims of a long ago grisly murder? Can young Michael fight through the madness and terror to figure out what happened so long ago? If he does, maybe the tormented souls can be put to rest. If he fails, he just might become one of them. With only the help of his babysitter, a burned out house painter, and his dog Lucy Fur, Michael is about to try. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is, not everyone is who they seem, even the dead.</description>

  <description>A half-Zythian bard is in chains for getting too well aquainted with the Duke of Highlake's wife. And thats just the begining.....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Legend of Vanx Malic is a continuing “serial” type of fantasy affair. After I finished writing The Wardstone Trilogy, I still had several months to go before I would be released from prison. I did not want to lapse in my religious routine of penning three thousand words a day, so I didn’t. Book One – Through the Wildwood, is a fun and intense book that introduces a few of the series main characters. I have over a thousand pages worth of Vanx Malic and his curious group of companions sitting here in longhand. I will be publishing them in eBook format, about two hundred fifty pages at a time, over the next year and a half.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoy the journey, M. R. Mathias</description>

  <description>Imagine leaving all you know behind for good to head for a land so far away and different that it is beyond your wildest dreams? That is what the Hebert family did. In fact, they had a very profitable business in running an apothecary in downtown Paris and all was perfect. That is for anyone else, but them. Yet their dreams pushed and drove them to run for the unfathomable new world so far across the ocean. In those days, Canada was a vast wilderness filled with mystery and promise .Untouched and raw. Anything could happen. Louis Hebert went ahead to the new world to see what it was all about and in hopes of bringing his family there to settle. His wife Marie, however, was not to be undone for though she was safe in Paris in the beginning of it all; she was acquiring skills of her own to survive and prepare for making their dreams a reality. She learned the skills necessary to survive in the rough and open terrain of New France with no possibility of help. Marie was raised as the daughter of a wealthy merchant and her husband was a successful apothecary-would she learn those new skills required for a family to survive alone so far from any aid? Then, what about actually getting there? It was so far away and almost inaccessible. Follow Louis Hebert as he learned to navigate the politics of the era. France was more than eager to jump aboard to settle in the New World, yet they had plans of their own. They wanted all they could gain in profits from there and the fur trade was just showing its promise. King Henry IV was more than willing to have his people settle in the infinite terrain overseas, yet not too thrilled about funding them. He had his eye on the profit and thus the fur monopolies were started. Once they were underway, the wars began for full control over territory in the New World. Then there was the land battle...Enter Samuel Champlain, a young navigator and cartographer who inquisitively had his eyes on finding a route to the Orient where he could see in his dreams of wealth and riches - cities populated by the French along the way. Yet, the land drew him and roped him in. Trip after trip from France to Arcadie-the land he sought to claim for France, the land found his heart warming even more with each trip he made. Will he find his trade route? Well, history tells us that answer of course. In addition, there was Jean Poutrincourt, a nobleman from a daunting lineage. This was a man who saw hope and glory. He was the younger son and had luckily inherited his fair share of his family's estate, yet it was not enough. He wanted more. He saw in his dreams at night a huge Chateau on rolling hills and his descendants growing fat off the food of the land. He spent every penny he owned and from his wife's dowry in doing all he could with each cell of his aging body to make his dreams come true. With his wit and charm, it almost seemed possible, yet; again, there was the politics of the era. Road block after roadblock and with the will of all-somehow they managed to take that first terrifying step in a land so very far away from all they had even known. Such bravery and determination is noted well by the author in this epic tale of such remarkable and profound people.

  <description>Imagine your life's purpose predetermined before you were even born? Before Au Set was born her mother had planned all she was to be. As the first born of an ancient legacy in a land called Eshnunna her life was all designed theologically before she was even born as the oldest daughter of a Goddess Representative of the temple for Inanna named Ninnuit. She was born to a land older than Babylon and even older than Sumer. The first in line to an ancient destiny older than recorded history. However, the world had something different planned. As a tribe of men came down with a vengeance to destroy all of the Goddess cults and all those involved, Au Set and her family knew their numbers alone would not assure their survival. To keep their world and legacy alive her mother Ninnuit had to think fast to save them all. What she came up would not only save their family and their traditions but to line her family up in the creation of a culture that would shake the world-that of a land far to the south. A land of a long and endless river that provided life inside a vast desert. Au Set and her siblings were sent to create a new dynasty in hopes of preserving her family legacy. They went to a land called Kemet. And there, Au Set and her siblings would learn to fight to protect all they have ever known and cherished and to forge creatively something new and possibly more powerful than ever their heritage had ever been. Her siblings became as legendary as she in the pages of history for they created what we know of Egypt and its mystery of a culture that lasted almost untouched for over three thousand years. She and her twin sister Neb Het (Nepthys) each took half of the strange and raw land of Kemet to rule over with their brothers Set (Suti) and Au Sar (Osiris). They had to leave their impact over a dying ancient tradition that they arrived to while still very young and afraid from all they left behind. They saw a rough world of ritual and religious cannibalism and animal worship. Together they conquered the first and built on the second and made it their own as temple and tomb paintings had been found of such. Their brother Tehuti (Thoth) founded writing and Au Sar brought Kemet agriculture and many more things were brought to light to this land untouched that would last millenniums after. The children of a lost culture alone in a vast wilderness striving to survive and to start something the world would never forget-Egypt. Revised November 2012</description>

  <description>Sophia and her daughters make a bold move from the suburbs of Boston to the wilderness of Maine. They leave all they know behind on a quest for tranquility. The house they move into was built in 1787 and with a yard bigger than any neighborhood they have ever lived in prior. However, things begin to test their endurance with the history of the house coming alive before their very eyes. Odd things occur all around them and bring their reality to question. In living in an historical house, there is a lot to consider with all presented that goes way beyond the mere age of the structure. There are forces and a history that might just question all you are familiar with in bringing live before you a window into another realm. Things are not where placed before, voices of those long past beckon your notice, and even the thin veil up for so long, begins to weaken and introduce one to a realm not meant to collide with the current time. &lt;br&gt;Sophia and her children knew normal in all sense of the word, yet needed peace from all that surrounded them. Sophia worked hard to make her dream of being a writer tangible and in a way to better support her children. With their new house, they realized a life only read about with a huge antique house and endless acres to roam about and to have the farm they always cherished in their hearts. In leaving all familiar for a new life, it is a huge risk, but to have to deal with things beyond the normal comprehension, things tend to be a bit more challenging. Sophia struggles to give her children a life she never had, away from the chaos of an area spilling over from its abundant population. In their new home in Chester Village, they breathe in the fresh air of the country as never before thought possible. Yet, with all entailed and brought new to their lives a force perniciously creeps in to introduce itself to the young family, as they had never thought possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would this woman be allowed her dream, or would something maleficent take that away? Not all on the paranormal plane is sinister, for there are those forces who want resolution and for the wickedness to leave as those living on the adjacent material plane do. In being a writer, Sophia used her talents to research the history of the house in Chester Village to find the underlying cause of the odd occurrences that have broken free fomenting the once dormant diabolical entities that seek to stop all of her efforts. Yet, she knows that knowledge is paramount to solving any issue and what she learns about the history of her dream house is something that she is bound to use on her mission for tranquility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tale is about all Sophia is determined to gain for her children and the challenges along the way. It is one thing to have a quest to reach a goal, and quite the other, for a goal to be constantly blocked by forces beyond the tangible realm surrounding. She holds on dear to all she knows with all she has in assiduous fortitude to fight for the serenity she so desperately yearns for.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you who want to read a typical ghost story, there are tons out there. For those of you who want a ghost story vividly painted before you in classic format with prodigious detail, this is the tale for you. This is a story of a woman determined to conquer the maniacal forces that have entered her life material and paranormal. She moves to a land protected by the Abenaki tribe of long before the initial settlers ever stepped foot in the vast wilderness surrounding. This tale also brings to light; the tales of those who stayed behind long after their remains have turned to dust. Can two worlds reside in unison and peace? This is the question one must consider when delving into this eloquently rendered tale as it piques issues inherently bold and not often defined in this modern era.</description>

  <description>Cleopatra Selene was born to a world of plenty, where all of her wishes were granted. She was a princess of an ancient and powerful family of Egypt. Her own mother was a pharaoh, what else could a girl want more than that. Her whole life was planned out and sung to her by her own mother who cherished her in her loving embrace. Suddenly it was all ripped away, leaving Cleopatra Selene and her siblings stunned and frightened. Their mother was killed by the venomous Octavian; their father had fallen in honor on his own sword in battle, their older brothers rumored to have been killed as well. In shackles they were thrown aboard a ship headed straight to Rome into the house of their own father's other wife....His lesser, Roman wife named Octavia, who happened to also be the sister of their mother's killer! Their lives once happy and predetermined were now one huge nightmare and they were all helpless and now the property of Rome...Cleopatra Selene became one of Rome's valuable pawns in a marriage arranged by Octavian. She vowed that she was never be helpless again and fought her whole life to make sure she had some control in a world that listened only to Rome. She would learn how to be strong and how creatively to protect herself and her own children. Cleopatra Selene was only one of several children of the legendary Cleopatra VII and Mark Antonius of Rome. There was her twin brother, Alexander Helios-the sun and her younger siblings Arsinoe and Ptolemy. Ripped from each other and forced to make their own way in a land conquered by their enemy Octavian. The very same Octavian, who later became the first emperor of Rome later called Augustus, yet he was just a man and he had dreams. He had visions of Rome in stone and of a land of plenty stretching to the four corners of the known world. His sister, Octavia, he honored to care for the children of his now conquered enemy Cleopatra VII. Her duty was to prepare the conquered and terrified children and to make them a part of his Roman family to realize further his plans. Octavia’s daughters Antonia Minor and Major were not only hers but those of her marriage with her adulterous husband Marcus Antonius. Of them, Antonia Minor befriends Cleopatra Selene and together they form a bond that surpasses all of the boundaries of Rome. Then there is Juba II, a son of a conquered King of Numidia who was captured and raised in Rome since the age of three. In Rome, Juba II found a home and it suited him well. He fast became a scholar and clung to making discoveries and in chronicling it for the world to see of all he found in his journeys. He married Cleopatra Selene and together they brought Numidia to its former glory, until it was ripped away by rebels. Then, they pick up the pieces and move to Mauretania where they build again. For their children they would travel and endure anything and though they grew to love Rome, they were cautious and thus, they looked far away to the land of Gaul and the Keltoi to find a future and peace from the ever-grasping clutches of Rome that sought to swallow them whole. In this novel, the author cleverly blends the cultures of Egypt, Rome, Numidia, Mauretania, and the lands of the Celts to the north in incredible fact and fable. Incredibly well researched the author values the sources in which her history was found. She weighed it all and gleaned from it a fair and honorable depiction of Cleopatra VII and all she had done and accomplished, despite the garnishments of the men of Rome who only sought to dethrone any woman in power.</description>

  <description>A compilation of blogs written by historical fiction author Sharon Desruisseaux. Though her other novels might be more on the serious side, this book is filled with her whimsical adventures of moving from busy Southeastern Massachusetts to the wilderness of Maine with her daughters. There is some sad and heart wrenching blogs mixed in just for the variety that her life seems to be. The blogs are of how a suburban Mom learned how to be a farmer in the mountains and how she began to make her dream of becoming a novelist a reality. In this collection of blogs are her struggles, interpretations of the cultural differences she moved to and how she learned to overcome obstacles that seemed to have constantly been thrown in her path. You laugh; you cry and wonder why....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A very silly outlook on life in Maine from a Flatlander's perspective. Check out her author site at sharondnovels.com/ for more blogs and updated information on her writing. Or join on as a fan at her Goodreads site and definitely check out her farm site at mymainesheep.webs.com/ You can also find her on Twitter at smbrooksi and Facebook under sharondnovels.</description>

  <description>A collection of weird discussions that I have with my nine-year-old son, taken from my blog and centralized in one downloadable location to be easily used against him when he is a teenager. Conversation topics include: God and hoodies, whether or not I killed the Thanksgiving turkey, rooting through the neighbor's recycling bin and discovering a Victoria's Secret catalog, anthropomorphizing food items while I'm cooking, butlers, how to get girls, and the kid's obsession with hot tubs.</description>

  <description>Relatively Famous delivers Hollywood with heart. Meet Dani McKinley: A typical teen whose world is rocked when she finds out that her father is a famous Hollywood action star. Now meet Mark Ocean: A self-serving actor with a floundering career who sees that a daughter is just what he needs to reinvent himself as a family man and get back on track. When the two decide to spend the summer together, they must not only wrangle their own love lives, but try to figure out who they really are to themselves and to each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now armed with credit cards, club memberships, and a new wardrobe, Dani learns that what Mark has in wealth, he sorely lacks in parenting skills. Trying to show Mark that parenting is about more than loading her up with Prada bags and taking her to movie premieres is challenging enough, but she's also got her hands full with her new friends. Oh, and the boys... Dani meets Jason, a gorgeous young personal trainer who is easy on the eyes and wildly flirtatious. But is this smug hottie the one for her? Or will she ignore her friends eye-rolling and go for the goofy but sweet surfer? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While juggling her own complicated love life, Dani tries to set her father up with someone less likely to appear on a VH1 reality show, and someone more... well, normal. And age-appropriate. And dressed in anything but a thong bikini. But whether Mark is able to heal old wounds and move forward with anything more than a meaningless fling remains to be seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Dani fit in with this new, fast-moving California crowd without losing herself? With the world at her fingertips and hot boys now after her, staying grounded gets tough. And can Mark drop his egocentric approach to life and learn to appreciate how truly wonderful his daughter is? As driven as he is to get that A-list acting role, he's willing to do whatever it takes to get there, even if it means using his daughter. Or is he...? Mark and Dani's relationship hits a few highs, but the question becomes whether the lows are too much.</description>

  <description>Matt is a junior at MIT. He’s geeky, he's witty, he's brilliant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he’s also very, very stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful, cool, insightful Julie moves in with Matt’s family, why (oh why!) does he pretend to be his absent brother Finn for her alleged benefit? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems harmless enough until her short-term stay becomes permanent. And until it snowballs into heart-squeezing insanity. And until he falls in love with Julie, and Julie falls in love with Finn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But … Matt is the right one for her. If only he can make Julie see it. Without telling her the truth, without shattering them all. Particularly his fragile sister Celeste, who may need Julie the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You saw Matt through Julie’s eyes in FLAT-OUT LOVE. Now go deeper into Matt’s world in this FLAT-OUT MATT novella. Live his side of the story, break when his heart breaks, and fall for the unlikely hero all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take an emotional skydive for two prequel chapters and seven Flat-Out Love chapters retold from his perspective, and then land with a brand-new steamy finale chapter from Julie.</description>

  <description>He was tall, at least six feet, with dirty blond hair that hung over his eyes. His T-shirt read &lt;strong&gt;Nietzsche Is My Homeboy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, that was Matt.  Who Julie Seagle likes. A lot.  But there is also Finn.  Who she flat out loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicated? Awkward?  Completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But really, how was this freshly-minted Boston transplant and newbie college freshman supposed to know that she would end up living with the family of an old friend of her mother's? This was all supposed to be temporary.  Julie wasn't supposed to be important to the Watkins family, or to fall in love with one of the brothers.  Especially the one she's never quite met. But what does that really matter?  Finn &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt; her, like no one ever has before. They have &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here's the thing about love, in all its twisty, bumpy permutations—it always throws you a few curves.  And no one ever escapes unscathed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best-selling author Jessica Park mines the territory of love’s growing pains with wit, sharp insights, and a discernible heat and heartbeat. Her previous novels include Relatively Famous and she authored the e-shorts &lt;em&gt;What the Kid Says&lt;/em&gt; (Parts 1 and 2) and &lt;em&gt;Facebooking Rick Springfield&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Irrational Atheist&lt;/em&gt; is not a theological work nor is it a conventional religious defense of faith. It contains no arguments for the existence of God and the supernatural, nor is it concerned with evolution, creationism, the age of Earth, or intelligent design. This book contains no arguments from Scripture. In attacking the arguments, assertions, and conclusions of the New Atheists, Vox Day’s only weapons are the secular tools of reason, logic, and historically documented, independently verifiable fact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Irrational Atheist&lt;/em&gt; is not a book about God, but about those who seek to replace Him. In this devastating critique of the anti-theistic arguments of Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, and Michel Onfray, Day skillfully demonstrates to even the most skeptical reader that the New Atheists are no champions of Reason, but rather abandon Reason in their arguments against religion. Drawing upon history and philosophers from Socrates to Tupac Shakur, Vox Day combines intellectual precision with a mordant wit in presenting a powerful defense of religion’s rightful place in modern society that is as convincing as it is surprising.</description>

  <description>A Magic Broken is a tale of ruthlessness, courage and deceit. The novella tells the story of Captain Nicolas du Mere, an exile fleeing the death of his rebel lord; and Lodi, son of Dunmorin, a brave dwarf dedicated to rescuing his fellow dwarves from slavery. Their dangerous paths meet, but in a manner that is anything but predictable.</description>

  <description>In this sophisticated yet readable book, Vox Day - one of the few economics writers to predict the current worldwide financial crisis - explains why it is likely to continue. Day shows that the policies being pursued in Europe, Asia, and the United States are very similar to Japan's failed policies of the past twenty years and, therefore, doomed to similar results. According to Day, the economic theories behind those policies are flawed and account for why most economists were unable to anticipate the recession or see that their expectations of an imminent recovery are incorrect. Day applies a different theory, the one he used to predict the current crisis, to show that the world is in the early stages of a massive economic contraction. Then he turns to the six scenarios presently envisioned by the world's leading economists and assesses which is most likely to unfold. As the title suggests, Day concludes that the most probable scenario is a Great Depression 2.0 that will be larger in scale and scope than that of the 1930s."</description>

  <description>The Wardog's Coin consists of two stories set in the epic fantasy world of A Throne of Bones. The title story is about a human mercenary company which finds itself in the employ of an elf king. Outnumbered and under attack from an army of orcs and goblins, the Company discovers it is no longer fighting for pay, but for survival. The second story, Qalabi Dawn, features a young tribal chieftain, Shabaka No-Tail, who seeks to find a way to unite the fractious tribes of The People before the implacable legions of the Dead God invade the desert to carry out their crusade of total extermination.</description>

  <description>Do Elves Have Souls? In a medieval fantasy world in which the realm of man is dominated by a rich and powerful Church, the Most Sanctified Charity IV decides the time is ripe to make a conclusive inquiry into the matter. If, in his infallible wisdom, he determines that elves do have immortal souls, then the Church will be obliged to bring the Holy Word of the Immaculate to them. But if he decides they do not, there will be holy war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powerful factions line up on both sides of the debate. War-hungry magnates cast greedy eyes at the ancient wealth of the elven kingdoms and pray for a declaration that elves are little more than animals. And there are men who are willing to do more than merely pray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The delegation sent to the High King of the Elves is led by two great theologians, brilliant philosophers who champion opposite sides of the great debate. And in the Sanctiff s own stead, he sends the young nobleman, Marcus Valerius.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Valerius is a rising scholar in the Church, talented, fearless, and devout. But he is inexperienced in the ways of the world. Nothing in his life has prepared him for the beauty of the elves or the monumental betrayal into which he rides. Praise for "Summa Elvetica"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most fascinating fantasy worlds I ve ever visited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day has put forth a masterpiece with this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would not surprise me at all if this is one day regarded as a classic of the fantasy genre. Also Includes: A Magic Broken The Wardog s Coin Qalabi Dawn Master of Cats Birth of an Order The Hoblets of Wiccam Fensboro The Last Witchking Opera Vita Aeterna&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vox Day is a writer and game designer. His interests include economics, history, technology, and wargames. He has written nine books, including "A -Throne of Bones" and "The Return of the Great Depression, " and he speaks three languages. He is a non-denominational Christian and has been recognized as one of the Internet s most in-fluential libertarians.</description>

  <description>Julie Valentine’s soul searching turned out to be a bad case of the author blues. Having just broken up with her boyfriend, she goes to a casino in the hopes of relaxing and getting her mind straight, while rekindling her passion for books, but not even a nice glass of wine seems to work. Writing steamy romances requires more than just leisure time.&lt;br&gt;When she meets the billionaire Dominic Fury, a handsome blue-eyed kind ladies’ man, his charms win her over. Maybe spending a night with him will give her plenty of inspiration. It turns out Dominic has a seductive request for her, one she cannot refuse.</description>

  <description>Rook is chasing her dream—film school and a chance at a life beyond the one she ran from six months ago. But before she can become the girl she wants to be, she must deal with the girl she left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ronin is also chasing his dream—a family of his own and a life away from erotic modeling. And he too, has a past he’s trying to forget. A past that makes Rook question everything about their life together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lies, secrets, and shocking truths will rock the foundation Rook and Ronin have built. Can they put the past behind them and move forward together? Or is this just another too good to be true relationship that will crash and burn in the end?</description>

  <description>From the 2005 winner of the Governor-General's Award for Fiction and the former national film critic for CBC television comes a delightful and absorbing book about the agonies and joys of home-schooling a beloved son. Written in the spare elegant style he is known for, The Film Club is the true story about David Gilmour's decision to let his 15-year-old son drop out of high school on the condition that the boy agrees to watch three films a week with him. The book examines how those pivotal years changed both their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From French New Wave, Kurosawa, and New German cinema, to De Palma, film noir, Cronenberg and Billy Wilder, among many others from world cinema, we read about key moments in each film, as the author teaches his son about life and the vagaries of growing up through the power of the movies. Replete with page-turning descriptions of scenes and actors and directors, the narrative is framed with the tender story of his son's first bittersweet first loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a charming and poignant story about a very special time in a father and son's relationship. David Gilmour is a novelist who has earned critical praise from literary figures as diverse as William Burroughs and Northrop Frye, and from publications as different as the New York Times to People magazine. The author of six novels, he also hosted the award-winning Gilmour on the Arts. He lives in Toronto with his wife Tina Gladstone.</description>

  <description>This astonishing novel - unlike anything Gilmour has ever written before - begins with every parent's worst nightmare: the disappearance of a child. A father makes a casual error of judgement one evening and leaves his six-year-old son alone for fifteen minutes. When he returns the child is gone and three lives are changed forever. Has the boy been kidnapped? Spirited out of the country? Is he dead?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story that unfolds is told by the novel's narrator, a television host named Roman, who searches for his son through the city and through the underworld of dreams and tries to bring him back. Pursued by an unshakeable conviction that his son is speaking directly to him, Roman begins to enter a haunting relationship with the missing child and his own conscience. In the meantime, his behaviour becomes increasingly erratic and he is rejected by his grieving and angry wife, eventually fired from his job, and shadowed by a persistent policeman who thinks Roman is hiding the child. Written in the clear, elegant prose Gilmour is known for, "A Perfect Night to Go to China" is a completely absorbing and original work of fiction. It sets up a harrowing premise and doesn't let up until the last surprising page.</description>

  <description>Like a tourist visiting his own life, David Gilmour's narrator journeys in time to reexamine those critical moments that created him. He revisits the terrible hurt of a first love, the shock of a parent's suicide, the trauma of a best friend's bizarre dissembling, and the pain and humiliation of unrelenting jealousy, among other rites of passage. Set within an episodic narrative arc stories about the profound effect of Tolstoy, of the "Beatles," of the cult of celebrity, of the delusion of drugs, and of the literary life on the winding road of the narrator's progress. This compelling and deeply interesting picaresque novel is a creative tour de force from the hand of one of our master storytellers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Perfect Order of Things" breaks new fictional ground and is an astonishing story of a life lived fully and with breathtaking passion. David Gilmour is a novelist who has earned critical praise from literary figures as diverse as William Burroughs and Northrop Frye, and from publications as different as the "New York Times" to "People magazine."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author of six novels, he also hosted the award-winning Gilmour on the Arts. In 2005, his novel "A Perfect Night to Go to China" won the Governor General's Award for Fiction. His next book, "The Film Club," was a finalist for the 2008 Charles Taylor Prize. It became an international bestseller, and has sold over 200,000 copies in Germany and over 100,000 copies in Brazil. He lives in Toronto with his wife.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Lost Between Houses&lt;/em&gt; is about a turbulent year in the life of Simon Albright, a fifteen-year-old private school boy struggling to be his sophisticated mother's best friend, the rebel his girlfriend adores and the son his father respects. Which is a hard act to pull off when your mother is distracted, your girlfriend too beautiful and your father in and out of a mental institution. &lt;em&gt;Lost Between Houses&lt;/em&gt; unfolds with mingled sarcasm, grief and awe, and grips the reader until its startling climax.</description>

  <description>Bix has it all: a failed marriage, a faltering career as a speechwriter, a drinking problem (not to mention the pills) and a wayward eye for the women. The last thing he needs is trouble named Holly, which is, of course, exactly what he gets -- briefly. His only assets are his daughter Zoey and an excruciating (and excruciatingly funny) sense of who he is, which becomes his path to redemption from the erotic rollercoaster that is this impressive and un-put-downable novel.</description>

  <description>Over the course of one Saturday night, a man and his half-sister meet at her request to spend the evening preparing for her assisted death. They drink and reminisce fondly, sadly, amusingly about their lives and especially her children, both of whom have led dramatic and profoundly different lives. &lt;em&gt;Extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; is a gentle consideration of assisted suicide, but it is also a story about siblings—about how brothers and sisters turn out so differently; about how little, in fact, turns out the way we expect. In the end, this is a novel about the extraordinary business of being alive, and it may well be David Gilmour’s very best work of fiction to date.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Back On Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; is the savagely funny story of Eugene H., a failed, womanizing writer from Toronto. After a nasty flare-up with his ex-wife, he snatches their five-year-old daughter from school and flees to Jamaica. Over the next eighteen hours he embarks on a starlit walk down an endless sea-coast road, muddles over his life, fumes, plots, drinks over-proof, regrets, reminisces, encounters a young woman with grey eyes, a coffin maker, a black Napoleon on his motorcycle...and a host of other creatures from the Jamaican night. At the end of the road - where he's been heading all along - is the black, aquarium stillness of the Wharf Club, a bar that sits dead in the centre of the world.</description>

  <description>In his first two novels David Gilmour took a candid look at romantic and carnal love.  With this newest work he makes a surprising departure and turns his attention to a different kind of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He was a bad dog that needed killing."  That's how the grisly death of Pascal Charleville was described to police after a weekend visit at the country estate of Harrow Winncup took a nasty turn.  Few people were surprised: Harrow had been courting tragedy for years.  He was a bright, beautiful boy with a penchant for strong booze and drugs; he also had the unfortunate fate of being the only son to a very wicked mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also at the house that weekend was Christian Blackwood.  He and Harrow grew up together, went to Paris together, drank together, went out with girls together, and decided what to do with Pascal Charleville's body together.  &lt;em&gt;An Affair with the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately the story of their relationship--and its astonishing aftermath.  It is a story of how one friend turned the others tragedy into his advantage; it is a story of friendship, but it is also a story of revenge.</description>

  <description>Grace Doll had everything a girl could want: Fame. Fortune. Beauty. Everything except her freedom. So when a powerful movie producer forces an experimental treatment on Grace--one that's purported to make beauty immortal--she stages her own death to escape him. With the help of trusted friends, Grace slips into hiding. She's forever flawless. Forever young, and forever pursued by her past. But when a stranger arrives on her doorstep, holding the key to a life she thought she'd left behind, Grace must decide between the safety she's known...and embracing the role she was born to play.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;He's my teacher. I shouldn't be alone with him. But I can't help that he's irresistible.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I let the door silently close at my back. He stared at me, and a taut quiet stretched between us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I like hearing you play," I said, moving toward him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He turned, in sync with my slow approach. He looked up at me but didn't say anything. I rested my clammy hand on the cold, slick body of the baby grand. "May I?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The muscles in his throat shifted, then he swallowed. "Eden."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My knees weakened, like a soft tickling kiss had just been blown against the backs of them. "Is it okay?" I asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His gaze held mine like two hands joined. He understood what I was really asking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Let me stay," I said. "Please."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"You're going to get me in trouble," he said.</description>

  <description>He's a doctor, of course I trust him. Or at least I did, once. I haven't eaten since yesterday. He had scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast. The smell seeps at me from beneath the locked door. The gnawing in my stomach never goes away but it's not from lack of food. Up until yesterday, I've been able to eat. Until yesterday, I was able to do almost anything I wanted within the two thousand square feet of this place. Things are different now.</description>

  <description>Seeing good and evil spirits is a gift Zoe guards with her life.&lt;br&gt;Despite her guardian angel’s disappearance, Zoe forces herself to accept that she still has a purpose—but how does she carry the weight of her brother’s drug abuse, the hardship of living with an autistic sister, and a best friend who’s obsessed with a guy who only wants Zoe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s never felt more alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious spirit appears, Zoe thinks she has a new guardian angel. Instead, her brother’s addiction worsens, her parents are on the brink of separation, and her best friend tries to kill her. The spirit she thinks is her new guardian isn’t there to protect her: he’s out to destroy her family and seize Zoe’s soul. . . for Hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Matthias’ return mean that he is Zoe’s guardian angel again? Or is their love the reason the jaws of Hell now gape open?</description>

At least Matthias is her guardian angel again. But now Hell’s most ruthless leader will stop at nothing to have her soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Albert, Matthias’ father, is relentless in his hunger for Zoe. He wants to destroy Matthias and will use Zoe to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The battle between Heaven and Hell tests everything Zoe has. As she witnesses everyone important in her life suffering, she’s brought to the ultimate choice: will she sacrifice her soul to save the ones she loves?</description>

  <description>One girl. Two guys. Who says three's a crowd? When Mandy takes an unusual summer job-in construction-she has to prove she's just one of the guys. But she gets more than she bargains for being the only girl on the job. The mixture of hot guys, sunscreen, raw wood and testosterone proves to be an elixir she can't protect her heart from. Brooding Boston and flirty AJ find themselves looking at Mandy as more than just a girl who holds a hammer. Mandy soon finds herself not only lost in a whirlwind of a male-dominated world, but also the center of an inadvertently "constructed" love triangle. Mandy must choose between two guys who want her heart. But what's a girl to do when she wants them both?</description>

  <description>Cort, the high school senior jock seems to have it all -- except a summer job. When he lands one doing women's nails, his eyes are opened to the catty, back-stabbing world of females. Girls he thought he knew and trusted turn out to shock and use him. He gets to know Rachel, an elusive girl the others gossip about, a girl with secrets. From her he learns there is more to life than weekend partying and social status, and one of the secrets she shares with him will change his life forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I met someone who changed everything. Matthias. My autistic sister's guardian angel. Honest. Inspiring. Funny. Hot. And immortal. That was the problem. What could I do? I did what any other girl would do-I fell in love with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoe's sister darts in front of cars. Her brother's a pothead. Her parents are so overwhelmed; they don't see Zoe lost in her broken life. Zoe escapes the only way she knows how: partying. Matthias, a guardian sent from Heaven, watches over Zoe's autistic sister. After Zoe is convinced he's legit, angel and lost girl come together in a love that changes destiny. But Heaven on Earth can't last forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An innocent girl&lt;/strong&gt;1920. Seventeen-year-old Sophie is a scullery maid at a large country house, Belfield Hall, but what she truly desires is to dance on stage in London. &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caught up in a dangerous game&lt;/strong&gt;Glamorous Lady Beatrice offers her assistance, though not without an ulterior motive.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Blood Slave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captured, taken from her beloved family and woods, Aria’s biggest fear is not the imminent death facing her, but that she will be chosen as a blood slave for a member of the ruling vampire race. No matter what becomes of her though, Aria knows that she must keep her identity hidden from the monsters imprisoning her. She has already been branded a member of the rebellion, but the vampires do not know the true depth of her involvement with it, and they must never know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though hoping for death, Aria’s world is turned upside down when a vampire named Braith steps forward to claim her. He delays her execution, but Aria knows it’s only a matter of time before he drains her, and destroys her. Especially once she learns his true identity as a prince within the royal family; the same royal family that started the war that ultimately brought down humankind, reducing them to nothing more than servants and slaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aria is determined to hate the prince, determined not to give into him in anyway, but his strange kindness, and surprising gentleness astonish her. Torn between her loyalties to the rebellion, and her growing love for her greatest enemy, Aria struggles to decide between everything she has ever known, and a love she never dreamed of finding.</description>

  <description>Madman, tyrant, animal - history has given Adolf Hitler many names. In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter. The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna forced him into underpaid work as a labourer. During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery. After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party. In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous Munich "Beer-hall putsch" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested. During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf, the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign. In Mein Kampf, Hitler describes his strategy for rebuilding Germany and conquering Europe. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who destabilized world peace and pursued the genocide now known as the Holocaust. "... I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord"</description>

  <description>Two thousand years in the future, the Gods are believed dead, and the world has been submerged by the melted ice caps. The only humans known to have survived live a harsh, regimented life in an underwater colony. Illness and disease are things of the past, and the only worries of the citizens are to keep the colony alive. Sara Darnell wished her worries were so simple, but she is the only person in the entire colony that is sick. Her illness is killing her, and everyone seems to have given up hope. Until one day she meets a young man from outside the walls of her underwater prison. His name is Shen, and he claims to be the son of the Dragon God of Water. While she is frightened and disbelieving of his stories at first, soon she finds herself drawn to the stranger in a way she's never experienced. He makes her feel like she is all that matters in his world. What was once a simple life of survival and science erupts into a fantasy world where the Gods are still very much alive and everything Sara was raised to believe is nothing but a lie. Dealing with shunning, bullying and a horrible home life, the lonely girl has only desperate hope for living to adulthood and finding happiness. A happiness she thinks might be possible with Shen. He holds so much promise. So much love. But can their love beat her disease? Does he hold the key to her very life?</description>

  <description>Atlantis is besieged by violent storms, tremors, and a barbarian army. For sixteen-year-old Aerander, it’s a calamitous backdrop to his Panegyris, where boys are feted for their passage to manhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amid a secret web of romances among the celebrants, Aerander's cousin Dam goes missing with two boys. With the kingdom in crisis, no one suspects the High Priest Zazamoukh, though Aerander uncovers a conspiracy to barter boys for dark spiritual power. Aerander's proof— an underground vault that disappears in the morning—brings shame on his family and charges of lunacy. The only way for Aerander to regain his honor is to prove what really happened to the missing boys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tracking Dam leads Aerander on a terrifying and fantastical journey. He spots a star that hasn’t been seen for centuries. He uncovers a legend about an ancient race of men who hid below the earth. And traveling to an underground world, he learns about matters even more urgent than the missing boys. The world aboveground is changing, and he will have to clear a path for the kingdom’s survival. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Christopher Rice brilliantly conjures the shadowed terrors of the Louisiana bayou—where three friends confront a deadly, ancient evil rising to the surface—in this intense and atmospheric new supernatural thriller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been a decade since the Delongpre family vanished near Bayou Rabineaux, and still no one can explain the events of that dark and sweltering night. No one except Niquette Delongpre, the survivor who ran away from the mangled stretch of guardrail on Highway 22 where the impossible occurred…and kept on running. Who left behind her best friends, Ben and Anthem, to save them from her newfound capacity for destruction…and who alone knows the source of her very bizarre—and very deadly—abilities: an isolated strip of swampland called Elysium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An accomplished surgeon, Niquette’s father dreamed of transforming the dense acreage surrounded by murky waters into a palatial compound befitting the name his beloved wife gave to it, Elysium: “the final resting place for the heroic and virtuous.” Then, ten years ago, construction workers dug into a long-hidden well, one that snaked down into the deep, black waters of the Louisiana swamp and stirred something that had been there for centuries—a microscopic parasite that perverts the mind and corrupts the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niquette is living proof that things done can’t be undone. Nothing will put her family back together again. And nothing can save her. But as Niquette, Ben, and Anthem uncover the truth of a devastating parasite that has the potential to alter the future of humankind, Niquette grasps the most chilling truths of all: someone else has been infected too. And unlike her, this man is not content to live in the shadows. He is intent to use his newfound powers for one reason only: revenge.</description>

  <description>My heart stopped and suddenly it was hard to breathe. His voice always had that effect on me. It was like poison slowly running through my veins killing me bit by bit. Like a drug that I couldn't get enough of even though I was almost down to my last breath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jace took a step forward and grabbed my hand. He slowly trailed his fingers over my face and backed me into the wall. My heart stopped again if that was even possible. "You can't leave," he whispered. "I need you." His warm breath kissed my lips as he bit his bottom lip and placed both of his hands around my face. They were warm and soft to the touch. Too big for my fragile face, although I wanted to bury myself in them. "Breathe. There is no one here but the two of us. Breathe," he whispered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Avery Hale had spent her whole childhood abused by her drunken, hopped-up parents. Broken from a lifetime of hate and pain she grew up realizing that trust and love just didn't exist. Not in her world at least. After turning the age of eighteen, she packed up and moved far away determined to escape her hurtful past and start a new life. Once on her own she comes to the conclusion that the emptiness still exist. Doing what she had to to survive she found herself mixed up in exotic dancing and meaningless sexual relationships unable to feel anything, for anyone. She was sure that her life was worthless and there was nothing left for her. On the other hand, so she thought.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After meeting a beautiful stranger, jace, her life suddenly is turned upside down. Everything that she truly believed suddenly gets questioned and then she is left to figure out if there is really more to her than she could ever have imagined. Jace, having some secrets of his own puts the pain of his own past behind to do what he can to help Avery.Can the love of another broken person be enough to help Avery, or is she already too far gone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Avery's life is pulled in many directions as she tries to find herself, and not everyone and thing is what they seem to be in this story of love, trust and opening up. Finding herself and learning to love herself might just be the hardest thing she's ever had to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find this book on Amazon.com &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wake-Up-Call-Victoria-Ashley/dp/1490906134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1378062783&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=wake+up+call+victoria+ashley" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Wake-Up-Call-Vi...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;On stage he’s dynamite. Off stage he rocks her world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When red-hot, Goth-metal band, Black Halo, split live on stage, fate throws Daniella Fosbrook into the path of sexy vocalist Xane Geist. Initially, Xane’s only looking for a ride home, but Dani tempts him in a way a thousand other women haven’t. Determined to explore their heady chemistry and avoid hashing things out with the band, Xane whisks Dani off to Monaco for a steamy weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There, Dani tries her best to hang onto her heart and some clothing, while Xane soon loses both. However, Xane isn’t being entirely honest about the reason for the band’s demise. When the truth comes out, can Dani accept the facts, or will everything come undone.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Zara "Zip" McKee lives for three things: basketball, books, and bailing out of tiny Titusville, Illinois, where the junior high and high school are in the same building and everyone's known everyone else since birth. But when Kieran Lanier moves to town and passes out on her desk on his first day at school, Zip's life gets complicated in a way she never dreamed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kieran has narcolepsy, and although he sometimes struggles to stay awake, he has no trouble capturing Zip's heart and trusting her with his most guarded secret--he sees bits and pieces of the future in his dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just when Zip thinks that maybe she can handle having a boyfriend who sees things before they happen, her budding relationship with Kieran gets a jolt when Kieran's parents reveal that his sleeping disorder is not what it seems and may be putting them in harm's way. And when Zip begins to have unsettling dreams, she must decide if she can live with knowing the future in advance when she's afraid of what might happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Recommended for Young Adult readers 13 and up (mild cursing, some adult situations)</description>

  <description>For superstar Aisley Carter, performing for a stadium full of people is easy. Being a singer-songwriter is all she’s ever dreamed of, but when the pressures of Hollywood become too much, Aisley’s forced to go home and work out her issues. That—or lose the life she’s worked hard for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she left home two years earlier, she never planned on coming back. To her, the small town of Burden, Washington is nothing but a dead end. Now that she’s back, she has to face everything she left behind—including the only boy she’s ever loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easton Everson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;East is the boy she grew up with, her best friend, her first kiss, her first love. He was her everything until the day she left. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People say “home is where the heart is” and Aisley is about to find out just how easy it is to go home again.</description>

  <description>They are here. They ride. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Ares, and the fate of mankind rests on his powerful shoulders. If he falls to the forces of evil, the world falls too. As one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, he is far stronger than any mortal, but even he cannot fight his destiny forever. Not when his own brother plots against him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet there is one last hope. Gifted in a way other humans can't-or won't-understand, Cara Thornhart is the key to both this Horseman's safety and his doom. But involving Cara will prove treacherous, even beyond the maddening, dangerous desire that seizes them the moment they meet. For staving off eternal darkness could have a staggering cost: Cara's life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It all began with a ruined elixir and an accidental bolt of lightning…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iolanthe Seabourne is the greatest elemental mage of her generation—or so she's being told. The one prophesied for years to be the savior of The Realm. It is her duty and destiny to face and defeat the Bane, the greatest mage tyrant the world has ever known. A suicide task for anyone let alone a sixteen-year-old girl with no training, facing a prophecy that foretells a fiery clash to the death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prince Titus of Elberon has sworn to protect Iolanthe at all costs but he's also a powerful mage committed to obliterating the Bane to avenge the death of his family—even if he must sacrifice both Iolanthe and himself to achieve his goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Titus makes the terrifying mistake of falling in love with the girl who should have been only a means to an end. Now, with the servants of the Bane closing in, he must choose between his mission and her life.</description>

  <description>Life can go on after tragedy...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After surviving a traumatic attack as a teenager, as well as a disastrous first marriage, Lauren Taylor Grant is content with her life. So what if she gets lonely from time to time? With a healthy, beautiful daughter, and a successful coffee shop-cafe, the divorced single mother convinces herself she doesn't have time for love. When she gets her first glimpse at her parents' handsome new neighbor, though, she starts reconsidering her stance. Once Charlie Clark begins breaking through her defensive walls, Lauren finds him hard to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing stays hidden forever...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Lauren is learning to let go of the past and embrace the future, her personal demons rear their ugly heads in the guise of a vandal hell-bent on destroying Lauren's happiness. When another local businesswoman is brutally murdered, the investigation into the crime reveals an unexpected connection to Lauren's past. The message is clear--the past has come calling, and it's out for blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note for Readers: This book does deal with the issues of incest and sexual abuse, more with the effects on the victims than the abuse itself. Reader Discretion Advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Secrets in the Shadows" is the first book in the Shadows Collection, Romantic Suspense novels set in small-town Indiana. Other titles include "Under the Moon's Shadow," "Shadows from the Grave,""Hidden in the Shadows," and "In the Heart's Shadow."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"One evening, my father asked me if I would like to become a ghost bride..."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though ruled by British overlords, the Chinese of colonial Malaya still cling to ancient customs. And in the sleepy port town of Malacca, ghosts and superstitions abound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Li Lan, the daughter of a genteel but bankrupt family, has few prospects. But fate intervenes when she receives an unusual proposal from the wealthy and powerful Lim family. They want her to become a ghost bride for the family's only son, who recently died under mysterious circumstances. Rarely practiced, a traditional ghost marriage is used to placate a restless spirit. Such a union would guarantee Li Lan a home for the rest of her days, but at a terrible price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an ominous visit to the opulent Lim mansion, Li Lan finds herself haunted not only by her ghostly would-be suitor, but also by her desire for the Lim's handsome new heir, Tian Bai. Night after night, she is drawn into the shadowy parallel world of the Chinese afterlife, with its ghost cities, paper funeral offerings, vengeful spirits and monstrous bureaucracy—including the mysterious Er Lang, a charming but unpredictable guardian spirit. Li Lan must uncover the Lim family's darkest secrets—and the truth about her own family—before she is trapped in this ghostly world forever.</description>

  <description>For Prime-Werewolf Ember Stilwell, life has been far from normal. Decades ago, a vengeful Witch cursed her Pack, leaving the women of her line incapable of feeling love. When an organized group of immortal killers begin to stalk and capture wolves from her pack, she sets out on a path fraught with danger. Just when it seems the world as she knows it will be changed forever, she meets Collin, an Alpha Werewolf with a body built for sin. As her heart begins to heal, she comes to find that the demons of her past are not nearly as dangerous as the nightmares she will be forced to face in her future. Can finding her true love conquer all? Or will the ability to feel for the first time be overshadowed by losing everything else she holds dear?</description>

  <description>From the author of the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life — and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>Inside these pages lies unspeakable horror. Bloodsplattering, brain-impaling, flesh-devouring horror. You&amp;amp;#8217;ve probably read your fair share of zombie stories. But this time it&amp;amp;#8217;s different. No longer can you sit idle as a bunch of fools make all the wrong moves. All hell is about to break loose&amp;amp;#8212;and YOU have a say in humanity&amp;amp;#8217;s survival. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have choices to make. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moral dilemmas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strategic decisions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weapons. Vehicles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will you be a hero? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or will you cover your own ass at all costs? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you withstand the coming hours, days, weeks, and months? Or will you die amidst the chaos and violence of a zombie uprising? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, worst of all, will you become one of them?</description>

  <description>1987. There’s only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and that’s her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn’s company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June’s world is turned upside down. But Finn’s death brings a surprise acquaintance into June’s life—someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Finn’s funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finn’s apartment, and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June realizes she’s not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she needs the most.</description>

  <description>Emmett’s dream is always the same. Tingling with half-forgotten memories, he stands in an unknown room surrounded by mirrors, curio cabinets, and nesting dolls. A painting, Belshazzar’s Feast, hangs on the wall, its disembodied hand numbering the King’s final days. Then comes the stranger, the serpent-wielding young woman with the glittering amber eyes. Her words are always the same. Emmett will soon save her. Then the supposed hero awakens to his unremarkable life, awaiting the next night and the same maddeningly familiar dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old orphan Emmett Brennan remembers nothing of his past—not the boiler room in which his needle-ravaged mother gave birth to him, nor the Druids who tenderly delivered him. He can’t remember the cabal-summoned Revenant that clawed itself from shadow to hunt him, or why his mystical midwives hid him from the necromantic creature. Approaching adulthood, he is unaware of the dark forces that still search for him or the mysterious sentinels who secretly protect him, but on the eve of his eighteenth birthday that will change. The Revenants will find him. Only the young woman from his dreams can help him confront all he was once made to forget. Together, they will brave the nightmarish landscape Emmett’s waking world will soon become.</description>

  <description>(for Adults 18+)&lt;br&gt;An erotic circus conspiracy thriller from the mind of Shawn Pierson! (a.k.a. Snedwick P. Philebius) Some women go for tall men; others like muscles. Alice likes hers with facepaint and giant floppy shoes. When the circus comes to town, Alice is all set to satisfy her clown fetish, but this time she may have taken on more than she bargained for. The big top brings new men into her life, but she soon finds things spinning out of control, as she becomes caught up in a web of corporate politics and shadowy secret agency intrigues with global implications. Is she in too deep to recover her life? One clown holds the key that may save her or destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: this book is intended for adults over 18 years only, as it includes graphic descriptions of sexual activity between consenting adult characters.</description>

  <description>Doomed to - or blessed with - eternal life after drinking from a magic spring, the Tuck family wanders about trying to live as inconspicuously and comfortably as they can. When ten-year-old Winnie Foster stumbles on their secret, the Tucks take her home and explain why living forever at one age is less a blessing that it might seem. Complications arise when Winnie is followed by a stranger who wants to market the spring water for a fortune.</description>

  <description>Griffins are supposed to be extinct. So when Yukiko and her warrior father Masaru are sent to capture one for the Shogun, they fear that their lives are over. Everyone knows what happens to those who fail him, no matter how hopeless the task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the mission proves far less impossible, and far more deadly, than anyone expects – and soon Yukiko finds herself stranded: a young woman alone in her country's last wilderness, with only a furious, crippled griffin for company. But trapped together in the forest, Yukiko and Buruu soon discover a friendship that neither of them expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the country around them verges on the brink of collapse. A toxic fuel is slowly choking the land; the omnipotent, machine-powered Lotus Guild is publicly burning those they deem Impure; and the Shogun cares about nothing but his own dominion. Yukiko has always been uneasy in the shadow of power, when she learns the awful truth of what the Shogun has done, both to her country and to her own family she's determined to do something about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning to the city, Yukiko and Buruu plan to make the Shogun pay for his crimes – but what can one girl and a flightless griffin do against the might of an empire?</description>

  <description>‘If she’d waited less than two weeks, she’d be June who died in June. But I guess my sister didn’t consider that.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Scott’s older sister has always been the perfect one — so when June takes her own life a week before her high school graduation, sixteen-year-old Harper is devastated. Everyone’s sorry, but no one can explain why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her divorcing parents decide to split her sister’s ashes into his-and-her urns, Harper takes matters into her own hands. She’ll steal the ashes and drive cross-country with her best friend, Laney, to the one place June always dreamed of going — California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Jake Tolan. He’s a boy with a bad attitude, a classic-rock obsession and nothing in common with Harper’s sister. But Jake had a connection with June, and when he insists on joining them, Harper’s just desperate enough to let him. With his alternately charming and infuriating demeanour and his belief that music can see you through anything, he might be exactly what she needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except June wasn’t the only one hiding something. Jake’s keeping a secret that has the power to turn Harper’s life upside down — again.</description>

  <description>May Fredericks hates New York. Which is fair enough, since New York seems to hate her back. Just weeks after moving from Wisconsin to Manhattan, she receives the world's worst marriage proposal, stabs her boyfriend with a shrimp fork in a very public venue, and accidentally becomes notorious. And that’s before she gets mugged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At her wit's end, May washes up at a Packers bar in Greenwich Village, where she meets a surly, unhelpful guy who hates her shoes and calls her ex a douche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Ben. He used to be a chef. Now he's a rooftop beekeeper with anger management issues. She wouldn't even like him, but he reminds her of home … and he knows where to find all the best food in the Village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She makes him laugh. He buys her tacos and cowboy boots. The longer they’re stuck together, the better May and Ben get along … and the harder they fall. TRULY is a quirky, modern New York love story unlike any you've read before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*********&lt;br&gt;About the Serialization&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRULY, the first novel in Ruthie Knox’s forthcoming New York Series, will be serialized in its entirety on Wattpad. Look for chapters every Monday from September 3 through November 4! Once completed, the full Wattpad version of TRULY will be pulled, so be sure to read it while it's still available!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRULY will be published by Loveswept/Random House in Fall 2014. Two sequels — MADLY and COMPLETELY — will follow.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Before.&lt;/strong&gt; Miles "Pudge" Halter's whole existence has been one big nonevent, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave the "Great Perhaps"  (François Rabelais, poet) even more. He heads off to the sometimes crazy, possibly unstable, and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed-up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young, who is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing is ever the same.</description>

  <description>There has only been three people in Jaxxon Carter's life who truly mattered to her. Her mum, who committed suicide. Her sister, who she hasn’t seen since her teens. And Connor McKenzie, who disappeared from her life the same day he left their foster home. The hardest part of that was that he never completely left her life because she was forever seeing him on T.V. or in magazines as a Formula One Driver. But Jaxxon refuses to live a ‘woe is me’ life, even in spite of living alone in her one-roomed flat and being expected to survive on a ridiculously low income. Then one night she is offered a modelling job and before she knows it she has been catapulted to the peak of success, gaining fame, fortune and security. Oh and a stalker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor McKenzie is busy trying to shake off his crazy ex-girlfriend – another woman who thought she could get around his no marriage rule – when he sees Jaxxon on the cover of a magazine. Remembering how close they had once been, he’s shocked when she doesn’t respond to his attempts to contact her and then acts indifferently to him when they meet. But Connor can’t let it go. The only reason he had kept his hands off her ten years ago was that she had been younger than him. Now that they’re adults, he isn’t prepared to allow anything – not even Jaxxon – to stop him from having her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This novel contains a bitchy female who curses like a sailor, a persistent alpha male who doesn’t understand the word ‘no’, and explicit hot sex in some very public places.</description>

  <description>A New Adult Horror Novel&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the night of the accident, Cain Emmerick has felt different. Empty. What was important to him—family, friends, his job—doesn't matter anymore. His new life revolves around that Nothing inside of him and the extraordinary highs he gets from committing random acts of violence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Joey Morgan is blind, but that doesn't stop her from seeing. Something bad is about to happen. Something that could tear her world apart. For Joey, college life isn't quite turning out like she planned, because before good grades, fitting in, and love, comes survival.</description>

  <description>After surviving a deadly plague outbreak, sixteen-year-old Savannah thought she had lived through the very worst of human history. There was no way to know that the miracle vaccine would put everyone at risk for a fate worse than un-death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, two very different kinds of infected walk the Earth, intent on nothing but feeding and destroying what little remains of civilization. When the inoculated are bitten, infection means watching on in silent horror as self-control disappears and the idea of feasting on loved ones becomes increasingly hard to ignore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starving and forced to live inside of the abandoned high school, all Savannah wants is the chance to fight back. When a strange boy arrives with a plan to set everything right, she gets her chance. Meeting Cole changes everything. Mere survival will never be enough.</description>

  <description>A SHATTERED EMPIRE&lt;br&gt;The mad Shōgun Yoritomo has been assassinated by the Stormdancer Yukiko, and the threat of civil war looms over the Shima Imperium. The Lotus Guild conspires to renew the nation’s broken dynasty and crush the growing rebellion simultaneously – by endorsing a new Shōgun who desires nothing more than to see Yukiko dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A DARK LEGACY&lt;br&gt;Yukiko and the mighty thunder tiger Buruu have been cast in the role of heroes by the Kagé rebellion. But Yukiko herself is blinded by rage over her father’s death, and her ability to hear the thoughts of beasts is swelling beyond her power to control. Along with Buruu, Yukiko’s anchor is Kin, the rebel Guildsman who helped her escape from Yoritomo’s clutches. But Kin has his own secrets, and is haunted by visions of a future he’d rather die than see realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A GATHERING STORM&lt;br&gt;Kagé assassins lurk within the Shōgun’s palace, plotting to end the new dynasty before it begins. A waif from Kigen’s gutters begins a friendship that could undo the entire empire. A new enemy gathers its strength, readying to push the fracturing Shima imperium into a war it cannot hope to survive. And across raging oceans, amongst islands of black glass, Yukiko and Buruu will face foes no katana or talon can defeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ghosts of a blood-stained past.</description>

  <description>Written by Cassie Mae under the pen name Becca Ann&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s stupid to fall for your brother’s ex. It’s even worse to enlist another’s help to win the ex over. But Brody is desperate and Hayley, his partner in American Sign Language, is more than willing to lend him a few tips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s the school’s matchmaker,’ and with her bizarre and positive personality, Brody finds her easy to talk to, even about the most awkward situations. Hayley’s tips seem to be working, but as Brody learns more about his matchmaker, he starts finding reasons to spend time with her, and not the girl he thought he was in love with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Hayley isn’t ready to fall for anyone. Labeled the “Funny Fat Friend” within her group, her self image makes it impossible for Brody to share his feelings without Hayley shrugging it off as a joke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Convincing her Brody can, and did, fall for the “Funny Fat Friend” turns out to be harder than simply falling in love.</description>

  <description>DOON…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veronica doesn't think she's going crazy. But why can't anyone else see the mysterious blond boy who keeps popping up wherever she goes? When her best friend, Mackenna, invites her to spend the summer in Scotland, Veronica jumps at the opportunity to leave her complicated life behind for a few months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Scottish countryside holds other plans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only has the imaginary kilted boy followed her to Alloway, she and Mackenna uncover a strange set of rings and a very unnerving letter from Mackenna's great aunt—and when the girls test the instructions Aunt Gracie left behind, they find themselves transported to a land that defies explanation. Doon seems like a real-life fairy tale, complete with one prince who has eyes for Mackenna and another who looks suspiciously like the boy from Veronica's daydreams. But Doon has a dark underbelly as well. The two girls could have everything they've longed for...or they could end up breaking an enchantment and find themselves trapped in a world that has become a nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DOON is loosely based on the premise of the musical Brigadoon, with permission from the ALan Jay Lerner Estate and the Frederick Loewe Foundation. Follow the journey at &lt;a href="http://www.DoonSeries.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.DoonSeries.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                                              ~Destiny awaits!</description>

  <description>"I don't do patrols, I don't go hunting, I just stick close to you. You live your life. I'll keep you safe," Tamani said, sweeping a lock of hair from her face. "Or die trying."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laurel hasn't seen Tamani since she begged him to let her go last year. Though her heart still aches, Laurel is confident that David was the right choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just as life is returning to normal, Laurel discovers that a hidden enemy lies in wait. Once again, Laurel must turn to Tamani to protect and guide her, for the danger that now threatens Avalon is one that no faerie thought would ever be possible. And for the first time, Laurel cannot be sure that her side will prevail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the third installment of Aprilynne Pike's Wings Series.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I can't just storm in and proclaim my intentions. I can't 'steal' you away. I just have to wait and hope that, someday, you'll ask," Tamani said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"And if I don't?" Laurel said, her voice barely above a whisper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Then I guess I'll be waiting forever."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Laurel has come to accept her true identity as a faerie, she refuses to turn her back on her human life - and especially her boyfriend, David - to return to the faerie world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she is summoned to Avalon, Laurel's feelings for the charismatic faerie sentry Tamani are undeniable. She is forced to make a choice - a choice that could break her heart.</description>

  <description>1,135,789. That’s how many subscribers sixteen-year-old West Ryder has on his web vlog series. But he only has eyes for one of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one of the internet’s most prestigious video bloggers, West talks about high school relationships under the name “Sam Green.”  As far as he knows, no one from school, not even his best friend, Cat, has seen his videos. But the highlight of the whole thing is Harper Knight, who comments every day at exactly 2:02 in the afternoon. He doesn’t know anything about her aside from the occasional deep philosophical messaging on why pizza tastes so delicious, but as stupid as it sounds, he might be falling for her. So when they finally agree to meet in real life, West’s hope for romance seems more and more in reach. But that all changes as soon as he arrives at their meeting spot and sees Cat walking toward him, wearing the same “I &amp;lt;3 Sam Green” T-shirt Harper promised she'd have on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To his alarm, West realizes he is falling in love with the best friend who has always been a sister to him.</description>

  <description>Moving to a new high school sucks. Especially a rich-kid private school. With uniforms. But nothing is worse than finding out the first girl you meet is dead. And a klepto. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one can see or hear Kimberlee except Jeff, so--in hopes of bringing an end to the snarkiest haunting in history--he agrees to help her complete her "unfinished business." But when the enmity between Kimberlee and Jeff's new crush, Sera, manages to continue posthumously, Jeff wonders if he's made the right choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clash meets sass in this uproarious modern-day retelling of Baroness Orczy's &lt;em&gt;The Scarlet Pimpernel&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Tavia Michaels is the sole survivor of the plane crash that killed her parents. When she starts to see strange visions of a boy she’s never spoken with in real life, she begins to suspect that there’s much about her past that she isn’t being told. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tavia immediately searches for answers, desperate to determine why she feels so drawn to a boy she hardly knows. But when Tavia discovers that the aunt and uncle who took her in after her parents' death may have actually been responsible for the plane crash that killed them--and that she may have been the true intended victim--she flees for the safety of Camden, Maine, where the boy she sees in her visions instructs her to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Tavia is on the run with no one to trust. No one, that is, except for her best friend and longtime crush, Benson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tavia feels torn between the boy who mysteriously comes to her at night and the boy who has been by her side every step of the way. But what Tavia doesn't know is that the world is literally falling apart and that to save it she will have to unite with the boy in her visions. Only problem? To do so would mean rejecting Benson's love. And that's the one thing Tavia Michaels swore she'd never do.</description>

  <description>This captivating and poignant 50-page digital original short story is a prequel to New York Times bestselling author Aprilynne Pike's Life After Theft—a haunting novel about the true cost of paying for one's mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most teenagers would do anything to have Kimberlee Schaffer's life. But beneath the beauty, the wealth, and the popularity, Kimberlee has a terrible problem: an uncontrollable, insatiable need to steal. Over the years, she's learned to hide her secret from those closest to her, but now it's completely consuming her life—and Kimberlee is afraid that if she doesn't find a way to put an end to her compulsion, she may see her perfect world come crumbling down.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling and creepy photo-novel perfect for fans of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller&lt;em&gt; Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sixteen-year-old Dan Crawford, New Hampshire College Prep is more than a summer program—it's a lifeline. An outcast at his high school, Dan is excited to finally make some friends in his last summer before college. But when he arrives at the program, Dan learns that his dorm for the summer used to be a sanatorium, more commonly known as an asylum. And not just any asylum—a last resort for the criminally insane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dan and his new friends, Abby and Jordan, explore the hidden recesses of their creepy summer home, they soon discover it's no coincidence that the three of them ended up here. Because the asylum holds the key to a terrifying past. And there are some secrets that refuse to stay buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring found photos of unsettling history and real abandoned asylums and filled with chilling mystery and page-turning suspense, Madeleine Roux's teen debut, &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt;, is a horror story that treads the line between genius and insanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Raising My Rainbow &lt;/em&gt;is Lori Duron’s frank, heartfelt, and brutally funny account of her and her family's adventures of distress and happiness raising a gender-creative son. Whereas her older son, Chase, is a Lego-loving, sports-playing boy's boy, her younger son, C.J., would much rather twirl around in a pink sparkly tutu, with a Disney Princess in each hand while singing Lady Gaga's "Paparazzi."&lt;br&gt;   C.J. is gender variant or gender nonconforming, whichever you prefer. Whatever the term, Lori has a boy who likes girl stuff—really likes girl stuff. He floats on the gender-variation spectrum from super-macho-masculine on the left all the way to super-girly-feminine on the right. He's not all pink and not all blue. He's a muddled mess or a rainbow creation. Lori and her family choose to see the rainbow.&lt;br&gt;   Written in Lori's uniquely witty and warm voice and launched by her incredibly popular blog of the same name, &lt;em&gt;Raising My&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rainbow &lt;/em&gt;is the unforgettable story of her wonderful family as they navigate the often challenging but never dull privilege of raising a slightly effeminate, possibly gay, totally fabulous son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Waking Dark&lt;/em&gt; is “a horror story worthy of Stephen King” (&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;) and “a book you won’t soon forget” (Cassandra Clare, author of the Mortal Instruments series)—perfect for readers of Gillian Flynn and Rick Yancey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; They called it the killing day. Twelve people murdered, in the space of a few hours, their killers also all dead by their own hand . . . except one. And that one has no answers to offer the shattered town.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Something is waking in the sleepy town of Oleander, Kansas—something dark and hungry that lives in the flat earth and the open sky, in the vengeful hearts of its upstanding citizens. As the town begins a descent into blood and madness, five survivors of the killing day are the only ones who can stop Oleander from destroying itself.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; They have nothing in common. They have nothing left to lose. And they have no way out. Which means they have no choice but to stand and fight, to face the darkness in their town—and in themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Suspense, chills, gasps—all that and a gem-like writing style that will make you shiver with beauty and horror. A book you won’t soon forget.” —Cassandra Clare, author of the bestselling Mortal Instruments series and Infernal Devices trilogy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Twisted, pulse-pounding, shocking, and very, very scary. With &lt;em&gt;The Waking Dark,&lt;/em&gt; Robin Wasserman conjures vintage Stephen King as she peers into the dark heart of a nightmare America, where violence and evil lurk behind the golden glow of small-town life, and new terrors arrive by the hour. A superb horror story that is by turns visceral and lyrical, heartrending and heart-stopping.” —Libba Bray, bestselling author of the Gemma Doyle trilogy and the Diviners series&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “This book has the combination of mystery and fright that I love. So many twists and shocks, I nearly jumped out of my chair several times! Trust me—this is a true chiller. Not to be missed!” —R. L. Stine&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “A thriller dark and beautiful and—yes—achingly romantic at every unexpected twist and turn. Astounding.” —Lauren Myracle, New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Infinite Moment of Us&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bliss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Wild, nihilistic madness that will get true horror fans raising their pitchforks and torches in frenzied glee. Wasserman writes as if hooked up to IVs of Stephen King and John Carpenter's spiked blood.” —Daniel Kraus, author of &lt;em&gt;Rotters&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Scowler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Great dialogue and intriguing subplots add to the action-packed story . . . the suspense doesn’t let up until the final pages." —&lt;em&gt;School Library Journal,&lt;/em&gt; Starred Review&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>If you've ever wished for a fresh and imaginative way of saying "I love you" to your beloved, peruse Chilean poet Pablo Neruda's 100 Love Sonnets. This intimate bilingual collection overflows with the master poet's signature sensuality and inventive imagery. Written in the 1950s for his cherished wife Matilde Urrutia, Neruda's earnest adoration leaps off the page in poem after poem: "Your heart is a clay toy shaped like a dove"; "Your kisses are clusters of fruit, fresh with dew." Thanks to translator Stephen Tapscott, Neruda's dreamy images carry over vividly from the Spanish and dance in the mind for days after they're read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neruda pays only loose tribute to the sonnet by employing a 14-line structure for each poem. As he says, his sonnets are made of wood, rather than the "silver, or crystal, or cannonfire" of a more refined sonnet. Neruda's humility is apparent as he refers again and again to the natural landscape of Isla Negra (the Pacific island where he and his wife lived) to describe his simple dedication to Matilde: "...I am like a scorched rock / that suddenly sings when you are near, because it drinks / the water you carry from the forest, in your voice."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journeying from the erotic celebration of the body to the spiritual depths of eternal union, 100 Love Sonnets shows why "two happy lovers make one bread" and "waking, they leave one sun empty in their bed."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From nineteenth-century London’s elegant ballrooms to its darkest slums, a spirited young woman and a nobleman investigating for the Crown unmask a plot by Napoleon to bleed England of its gold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chance led to Charlotte Raven’s transformation from chimney sweep to wealthy, educated noblewoman, but she still walks a delicate tightrope between two worlds, unable to turn her back on the ruthless crime lord who was once her childhood protector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lord Edward Durnham is tapped to solve the mystery of England’s rapidly disappearing gold, his search leads him to the stews of London, and Charlotte becomes his intriguing guide to the city’s dark, forbidding underworld. But as her involvement brings Charlotte to the attention of men who have no qualms about who they hurt, and as Edward forges a grudging alliance with the dangerous ghosts of Charlotte’s former life, she faces a choice: to continue living in limbo, or to close the door on the past and risk her heart and her happiness on an unpredictable future.</description>

  <description>Her heart races, her muscles coil, and every impulse in Alessa's body screams at her to run... but yet she's powerless to move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still struggling to find her footing after the sudden death of her parents, the last thing college freshman Alessa has the strength to deal with is the inexplicable visceral pull drawing her to a handsome ghostly presence.  In between grappling with exams and sorority soirees - and disturbing recurring dreams of being captive in a futuristic prison hell - Alessa is determined to unravel the mystery of the apparition who leaves her breathless.  But the terrifying secret she uncovers will find her groping desperately through her nightmares for answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because what Alessa hasn't figured out yet is that she's not really a student, the object of her obsession is no ghost, and her sneaking suspicions that something sinister is lurking behind the walls of her university's idyllic campus are only just scratching the surface...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opening installment in a twist-laden trilogy, Stitch spans the genres of paranormal romance and dystopian sci-fi to explore the challenges of a society in transition, where morality, vision, and pragmatism collide leaving the average citizen to suffer the results.</description>

  <description>Catherynne M. Valente enchanted readers with her spellbinding&lt;strong&gt; In the Night Garden&lt;/strong&gt;. Now she continues to weave her storytelling magic in a new book of Orphan’s Tales—an epic of the fantastic and the exotic, the monstrous and mysterious, that will transport you far away from the everyday….&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Her name and origins are unknown, but the endless tales inked upon this orphan’s eyelids weave a spell over all who listen to her read her secret history. And who can resist the stories she tells? From the Lake of the Dead and the City of Marrow to the artists who remain behind in a ghost city of spice, here are stories of hedgehog warriors and winged skeletons, loyal leopards and sparrow calligraphers. Nothing is too fantastic, anything can happen, but you’ll never guess what comes next in these intimately linked adventures of firebirds and djinn, singing manticores, mutilated unicorns, and women made entirely of glass and gears. Graced with the magical illustrations of Michael Kaluta, &lt;strong&gt;In the Cities of Coins and Spice&lt;/strong&gt; is a book of dreams and wonders unlike any you’ve ever encountered. Open it anywhere and you will fall under its spell. For here the story never ends and the magic is only beginning….</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old September lives in Omaha, and used to have an ordinary life, until her father went to war and her mother went to work. One day, September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket), who invites her on an adventure, implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle, and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods, and if she doesn’t . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends, including a book-loving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday. &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With exquisite illustrations by acclaimed artist Ana Juan, &lt;em&gt;Fairyland &lt;/em&gt;lives up to the sensation it created when the author first posted it online. For readers of all ages who love the charm of &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; and the soul of &lt;em&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/em&gt;, here is a reading experience unto itself: unforgettable, and so very beautiful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

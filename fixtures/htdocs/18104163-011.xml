  <description>Sixteen-year-old Maddie Dunn needs to learn how to use her special abilities before somebody else gets hurt. Ganzfield is a secret training facility full of people like her, but it's not exactly a nurturing place.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every social interaction carries the threat of mind-control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stray thought can burn a building to the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And people's nightmares don't always stay in their own heads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's still better than New Jersey,&lt;br&gt;especially once she meets the man of her dreams…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first three books of the Ganzfield series are in a single volume.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A lady never kisses and tells.&lt;br&gt;And her lover never forgets…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a lady of breeding and wealth, the Ministry of Marriage can always ensure a suitable match. But sometimes, the heart wants what it wants—in spite of the risks…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Practical Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Cecily Westruther is nothing if not practical. By agreeing to marry an older duke who already has an heir and a mistress, she can assume a wifely role—without the wifely duties. Only one thing stands in her way—a letter that could destroy her betrothal. Desperate to retrieve that letter, Cecily must match wits with the most dangerously seductive man she's ever known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Passionate Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disguised as a footman, Cecily gains entry to her adversary's house—only to be unmasked by London's most powerful man. Rand, Duke of Ashburn, is accustomed to getting any woman he wants—and he wants Cecily. He will stop at nothing, including seduction, to make her his. But Rand holds a secret more shocking and destructive than that letter could ever be.</description>

  <description>Fang Girl - noun – a female fan of vampire media who might be a little obsessive in her fandom.&lt;br&gt;[Derived from modern slang fanboy but always in reference to females. First used by Cassandra Duffy in Fabled Fang Girls]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassandra Duffy, an emerging voice in lesbian literature, releases her third short story collection, Fabled Fang Girls in a transparent attempt to satisfy the vampire addiction of her readership. Eight short stories of vampire lust and love revisit characters from Demons of Paradise and introduce new stories of lesbian sex and relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Princess of Castle Eclipse” – a beautiful fairytale of doomed love in the tragic tradition of European fables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Witch of Vigil’s Grove” and “Return to Vigil’s Grove” – two pieces of an upcoming novel that offer a chilling introduction to the town of Vigil’s Rest where a vampire haunts the forest, luring young girls to their doom with promises of forbidden love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Last Best Tip” – the critically acclaimed novella finds a new home in this collection. Grifts, swingers, a sassy but irresponsible vampire and her underachieving girlfriend occupy a clever urban fantasy landscape where even eternal children of the night have money problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“From Nightshift to Swing Shift” – Vendela and Brooke are back! The vampire fashionista and her Australian girlfriend have hit a lull in their peculiar relationship and turn to a beautiful Persian executive to inject some much-need passion back into the couple’s sex life to keep out the Alaskan cold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Lovely Predators” – a brief look at the upcoming Noire style mystery novel of the same name that follows a talented Los Angeles homicide detective as she investigates a series of grisly murders that keep leading her back to the doorstep of her new girlfriend who is keeping a dark secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Undead Housewives of the Other Orange County” – a farcical take on the Real Housewives television shows that interjects vampires and humanity to create a humorous story about what might really take place between bored housewives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Chains of Command” – a mixture of Duffy’s remarkable science fiction, paranormal romance, and hardcore erotica. Chains follows a vampire captain of a cutting-edge space warship who must break the will of her new executive officer during a long, deep space raid, but quickly finds the tables turned on her by the fiery and reckless, Commander Crash Langford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassandra Duffy floods this collection with vampires, sex, horror, romance, action, and humor in ways that truly display the depth and range of her remarkable talent. Sapphic Pixie Tales is proud to offer this outstanding collection of vampire fiction from the 21-year-old lesbian author.</description>

  <description>The lone anchor in Lucy’s life is a job she hates at a swingers club in the heart of middle America; without it, she would be just another twenty-something college dropout, who never quite reached her potential, and is as unlucky in love as most everything else. It’s a shame she hates her job. Sasha, her vampire crush, working in the bar across the way, is in a similar boat, but she has a way out…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy breaks the law, breaks rules she didn’t even know she had, and risks what little she has left to be with Sasha. In this sexy, lighthearted comedy of errors luck and flexibility aren’t always what they seem.</description>

  <description>Fiona and Gieo are back in the third book in the Raven Ladies series! The war of retribution against the city of Juarez has gone well through the autumn and winter months. Fiona, at the head of a fresh army of Ravens provided by the new White Queen Alondra, has captured or killed the fleeing remnants of the Juarez invaders responsible for the massacre at Tombstone. Supported by Gieo and her fledgling air force of modified World War II planes, Fiona is set to end the war of retribution with a final blow to the last bastion of the Juarez drug cartel. Before the final blow can be struck, the Slark make their return to the conflict, restored to their former glory and strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a disastrous battle, Fiona’s army is on the verge of breaking and Gieo has fallen into the hands of the marauder warlord General McKenzie. Fiona must leave the Ravens to find her captured beloved, riding out alone into the desert to seek help from the revived Apache Nation, the spirit world, and Gieo’s robot companion, Ramen, who is discovered to be of sinister origins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riding through the post-apocalyptic world of Dead Texas, Fiona infiltrates McKenzie’s marauders only to find the Ravens have once again lied to her. Fiona’s rescue might end in wedding bells or betrayal and seems destined for bloodshed either way.</description>

  <description>Eight short, erotica and romance stories involving paranormal creatures like vampires, werewolves, mummies, and more, from a lesbian author intended for a lesbian audience. The stories are split down two lines: one lighter and more romantic and the other darker and kinkier in their content. The darker sexual themes run the gamete of coercion, reluctance, lost loves, voyeurism, mind-control, domination/submission, and BDSM--a taste for every palette and kink, while the lighter side touches on first romances, first loves, intimate relationships, and the sweetness of committed couples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassandra Duffy/Lizzy Dark encompasses the full experience of living and loving as a lesbian while adding playful humor, some scares, and possibly even tears on the backdrop of a sexually rich paranormal setting.</description>

  <description>In the town of Vigil’s Rest, vampires haunt the forest, luring young girls to their doom with promises of forbidden love. After Deborah Poole, a local beauty queen goes missing, the town’s long history of cover-ups begins to unravel. She returns from the dead, more angel than demon, and acting as a spirit of mercy in the haunted forest that has known only vengeance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oppression and tightly held secrets keep Deborah from love for decades, finally shattering when the unlikely fulfillment of an ancient prophesy gives her a new chance at love and humanity in the form of a disillusioned teenage girl, Annabelle. But to severe Deborah’s chains to the past, the duo must unravel the three 200 year old mystery of the forest’s haunting and the town’s dark past.</description>

  <description>Harper, Sword Maiden for the illustrious Goddess of the Open Sea, has returned to the fabled city of Griffon's Rock at the end of the Last Road to rest for the winter months after a disappointing year treasure hunting. Her rest is cut short by a mysterious storm of divine origin, an attempted horse theft of her beloved mount, and the sudden appearance of a beautiful southerner who seems determined to capture Harper's heart. As the snows begin to fall, intrigue and romance heats up. The object of Harper's desire, the mysterious rogue Calista, appears destined to get everyone into fresh trouble with a mystical stew-brewing ogre, a greedy guild of Dwarven thieves, and finally an exalted march out of the snowy north bent on divine retribution. Harper must decide if her growing love for Calista is real or a product of the lies she's been told. Before the spring thaw, Harper will choose between the woman she loves and the Goddess that is the source of her magic.</description>

  <description>Claudia Marceau, sniper extraordinaire and notorious flirt, has grown bored with Tombstone and the Lazy Ravens as a whole. With her unrequited crush on the gunfighter Fiona Bishop growing ever more impossible after the inclusion of Gieo into the mix, she has found temporary comfort in the arms of the White Queen Veronica. But what she really wants is out—out of Tombstone, out of the Ravens, out of the range of the romance she can’t have. On the tumultuous last night, with Tombstone burning down around her, she makes her escape into the desert night to seek out the father she is certain still lives and the freedom she craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her years of experience as a scout and survivor serve her well on a tremendous journey through the post apocalyptic wasteland where she takes counsel from a scorched Owl, slays a rising caste of Slark, and survives an encounter with an army of mutants that forever changes her and the fortunes of humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she arrives in the City of Broken Bridges that arose from the ashes of San Francisco, she finds her father not only lives, but has become a powerful warlord charged with protecting the most technologically advanced city in human history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The maudlin French Canadian heroine becomes embroiled in a love tangle with a British sailor, a Scottish footballer, and the world’s last donut shop girl. In a landscape filled with man-eating trees, giant god-like robots, and vile mutants, Claudia strives to find a moment’s peace before the Lazy Ravens make their push to the west coast and claim a city with more secrets than people.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Neryn is alone in the land of Alban, where the oppressive king has ordered anyone with magical strengths captured and brought before him. Eager to hide her own canny skill--a uniquely powerful ability to communicate with the fairy-like Good Folk--Neryn sets out for the legendary Shadowfell, a home and training ground for a secret rebel group determined to overthrow the evil King Keldec. &lt;br&gt;During her dangerous journey, she receives aid from the Good Folk, who tell her she must pass a series of tests in order to recognize her full potential. She also finds help from a handsome young man, Flint, who rescues her from certain death--but whose motives in doing so remain unclear. Neryn struggles to trust her only allies. They both hint that she alone may be the key to Alban's release from Keldec's rule. Homeless, unsure of who to trust, and trapped in an empire determined to crush her, Neryn must make it to Shadowfell not only to save herself, but to save Alban.</description>

  <description>Neryn has finally found the rebel group at Shadowfell, and now her task is to seek out the elusive Guardians, vital to her training as a Caller. These four powerful beings have been increasingly at odds with human kind, and Neryn must prove her worth to them. She desperately needs their help to use her gift without compromising herself or the cause of overthrowing the evil King Keldec.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neryn must journey with the tough and steadfast Tali, who looks on Neryn's love for the double agent Flint as a needless vulnerability. And perhaps it is. What Flint learns from the king will change the battlefield entirely—but in whose favor, no one knows. </description>

  <description>Life can change in a split second.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addie hardly recognizes her life since her parents divorced. Her boyfriend used her. Her best friend betrayed her. She can’t believe this is the future she chose. On top of that, her ability is acting up. She’s always been able to Search the future when presented with a choice. Now she can manipulate and slow down time, too . . . but not without a price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Addie’s dad invites her to spend her winter break with him, she jumps at the chance to escape into the Norm world of Dallas, Texas. There she meets the handsome and achingly familiar Trevor. He’s a virtual stranger to her, so why does her heart do a funny flip every time she sees him? But after witnessing secrets that were supposed to stay hidden, Trevor quickly seems more suspicious of Addie than interested in her. And she has an inexplicable desire to change that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, her best friend, Laila, has a secret of her own: she can restore Addie’s memories . . . once she learns how. But there are powerful people who don’t want to see this happen. Desperate, Laila tries to manipulate Connor, a brooding bad boy from school—but he seems to be the only boy in the Compound immune to her charms. And the only one who can help her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Addie and Laila frantically attempt to retrieve the lost memories, Addie must piece together a world she thought she knew before she loses the love she nearly forgot . . . and a future that could change everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Knowing the outcome doesn’t always make a choice easier . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison Coleman’s life is one big “What if?” As a Searcher, whenever Addie is faced with a choice, she can look into the future and see both outcomes. It’s the ultimate insurance plan against disaster. Or so she thought. When Addie’s parents ambush her with the news of their divorce, she has to pick who she wants to live with—her father, who is leaving the paranormal compound to live among the “Norms,” or her mother, who is staying in the life Addie has always known. Addie loves her life just as it is, so her answer should be easy. One Search six weeks into the future proves it’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one potential future, Addie is adjusting to life outside the Compound as the new girl in a Norm high school where she meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive artist who understands her. In the other path, Addie is being pursued by the hottest guy in school—but she never wanted to be a quarterback’s girlfriend. When Addie’s father is asked to consult on a murder in the Compound, she’s unwittingly drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything she holds dear. With love and loss in both lives, it all comes down to which reality she’s willing to live through . . . and who she can’t live without.</description>

  <description>Her name is Pete Caldecott. She was just sixteen when she met Jack Winter, a gorgeous, larger-than-life  mage who thrilled her with his witchcraft. Then a spirit Jack summoned killed him before Pete’s eyes—or so she thought. Now a detective , Pete is investigating the case of a young girl kidnapped from the streets of London. A tipster’s chilling prediction has led police directly to the child…but when Pete meets the informant, she’s shocked to learn he is none other than Jack. Strung out on heroin, Jack a shadow of his former self.  But he’s able to tell Pete exactly where Bridget’s kidnappers are hiding: in the supernatural shadow-world of the fey.  Even though she’s spent years disavowing the supernatural, Pete follows Jack into the invisible fey underworld, where she hopes to discover the truth about what happened to Bridget—and what happened to Jack on that dark day so long ago…</description>

  <description>Rafael Angelos just got handed the greatest gift any teenage boy could ever dream of. Upon arriving at his new boarding school for senior year, he discovered that he is the ONLY male student. But what should have been a godsend isn't exactly heaven on Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raffi's about to learn that St. Mary's is actually a hub for demons-and that he was summoned to the school by someone expecting him to save the day. Raffi knows he's no angel-but it's pretty hard to deny that there's some higher plan at work when he wakes up one morning to discover a glowing circle around his head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen Keeble's debut novel, Fang Girl, has been praised for its pitch-perfect teen voice, and VOYA called it "refreshing and reminiscent of Louise Rennison's Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series." No Angel brings you angels and demons like you've never seen them-complete with the wry humor of Vladimir Tod, sinfully irreverent romance, and some hilariously demonic teenage dilemmas.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From award-winning author Stephanie Hemphill comes the fascinating story of Mary Shelley, a brilliant teenager who wrote one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time: Frankenstein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An all-consuming love affair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A family torn apart by scandal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young author on the brink of greatness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hideous Love is the fascinating story of Gothic novelist Mary Shelley, who as a teen girl fled her restrictive home only to find herself in the shadow of a brilliant but moody boyfriend, famed poet Percy Shelley. It is the story of the mastermind behind one of the most iconic figures in all of literature: a monster constructed out of dead bodies and brought to life by the tragic Dr. Frankenstein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary wrote Frankenstein at the age of nineteen, but inspiration for the monster came from her life-the atmospheric European settings she visited, the dramas swirling around her, and the stimulating philosophical discussions with the greatest minds of the period, like her close friend, Lord Byron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This luminous verse novel from award-winning author Stephanie Hemphill reveals how Mary Shelley became one of the most celebrated authors in history.</description>

  <description>Jess Mackey is living a meticulously fabricated lie of necessity. She's left the secret tragedy of her past behind along with who she was and is forging ahead with a clean slate. But Jess soon discovers that passion can't be left behind—neither her own, nor that of the one man who sees who she really is…and whose unexpected presence may breach the peaceful life Jess has painstakingly created for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devin Castile didn’t expect to meet a young woman who may be the missing puzzle piece to his existence…and who is also the victim of a heinous crime. Devin convinces himself that he can remain emotionally distant even while indulging his physical desire for her. But when Jess’s lies begin to crumble in the face of their undeniable attraction and the truth is revealed, one of them might pay with their life.</description>

  <description>A thousand years before the birth of Vlad Taltos, the Dragaeran Empire is a hotbed of intrigue, sorcery, intrigue, swashbuckling adventure, and intrigue. For those who would be heroes, it is a delightful time to be alive--and an easy place to die. &lt;br&gt;Khaavren of the House of Tiassa is a son of landless nobility, possessor of a good sword and "tolerably well acquainted with its use." Along with three loyal friends, he enthusiastically seeks out danger and excitement. But in a realm renowned for repartee and betrayals, where power is as mutable as magic, a young man like Khaavren, newly come from the countryside, had best be wary. His life depends on it. And so does the future of Dragaera. &lt;br&gt;When swordplay beckons, it's all for one--and one for..."The Phoenix Guards."&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Eva is a chosen one. Chosen to live, while others meet a swift and painful death from an incurable virus so lethal, a person is dead within days of symptoms emerging. In the POD system, a series of underground habitats built by the government, she waits with the other chosen for the deadly virus to claim those above. Separated from family and friends, it's in the PODs she meets David. And while true love might not conquer all, it's a balm for the broken soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a year, scientists believe the population has died, and without living hosts, so has the virus. That's the theory, anyway. But when the PODs are opened, survivors find the surface holds a vicious secret. The virus mutated, infecting those left top-side and creating... monsters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva and David hide from the infected in the abandoned PODs. Together they try to build a life--a new beginning. But the infected follow and are relentless in their attacks. Leaving Eva and David to fight for survival, and pray for a cure.</description>

  <description>When Sam's dad whisks him and his brother off to a remote beach town for the summer, he's all for it-- at first. Sam soon realizes, though, that this place is anything but ordinary. Time seems to slow down around here, and everywhere he looks, there are beautiful blond girls. Girls who seem inexplicably drawn to him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Sam meets DeeDee, one of the Girls, and she's different from the others. Just as he starts to fall for her, she pulls away, leaving him more confused than ever. He knows that if he's going to get her back, he'll have to uncover the secret of this beach and the girls who live here.</description>

  <description>It all begins with a stupid question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a Global Vagabond?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, but 18-year-old Bria Sandoval wants to be. In a quest for independence, her neglected art, and no-strings-attached hookups, she signs up for a guided tour of Central America—the wrong one. Middle-aged tourists with fanny packs are hardly the key to self-rediscovery. When Bria meets Rowan, devoted backpacker and dive instructor, and his outspokenly humanitarian sister Starling, she seizes the chance to ditch her group and join them off the beaten path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bria's a good girl trying to go bad. Rowan's a bad boy trying to stay good. As they travel across a panorama of Mayan villages, remote Belizean islands, and hostels plagued with jungle beasties, they discover what they've got in common: both seek to leave behind the old versions of themselves. And the secret to escaping the past, Rowan’s found, is to keep moving forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bria comes to realize she can't run forever, no matter what Rowan says. If she ever wants the courage to fall for someone worthwhile, she has to start looking back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirsten Hubbard lends her artistry to this ultimate backpacker novel, weaving her drawings into the text. Her career as a travel writer and her experiences as a real-life vagabond backpacking Central America are deeply seeded in this inspiring story.</description>

  <description>A secret she must never share. A secret that two warring species are determined to control. A universe's future at stake. Twenty-year-old Cassiel Winters joins Earth's new space academy in hopes of finding her brother, one of Command's top pilots and her only family, who's been reported MIA. But she quickly realizes she may not be cut out for life in space, where female cadets are outnumbered, competition's fierce, and she's already failed her hand-to-hand combat test once. Even the station's most respected officer, Lt. Damian King, probably can't help Cassiel pass the second time around-so why is he so interested in her progress? If only one of her freaky deja vu visions would offer an answer instead of mysterious messages like hide. When Cassiel's manipulated into a perilous mission, she encounters a warrior species bred to protect the universe from an even greater threat. And she learns that her secret visions are at the heart of it all. Now Cassiel must fight to control her own destiny and race to save her brother-even if it means pretending to be the pawn of Prime Or'ic, the cold-as-steel Thell'eon leader. Even if it means risking her life, facing hard truths, and making the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>Come explore the newer, naughtier Maverick's, where you are in control of the story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been a year since the decadent BDSM club was gutted in a fire. Tegan has scored an invitation to the grand reopening, where she can finally indulge the needs she's ignored for too long. On her wicked wish list: a thorough spanking, adventurous playmates and complete erotic satisfaction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a switch, Tegan can find pleasure as either a sub or a Domme. The question is, what—and who—is she in the mood for tonight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Grant: dominant and drop-dead gorgeous, he hasn't forgotten their last encounter. He'll make sure Tegan gets what she craves—if she submits to him alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eli: the sexy switch has always wanted more from Tegan. But taking their relationship to the next level could mean risking their friendship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam: the last man Tegan expects to encounter at the club, but one she'd love to see more of—if he behaves…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choose which ending you want for Tegan, or explore all of the sensual possibilities.</description>

  <description>Everyone has secrets they'd prefer stayed buried.  But information wants to be free... and so does Tamara Kingsley's ex-lover, incarcerated on the maximum-security prison planet, Alpha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tamara has done things she's not proud of, but that was years ago.  Now the headmistress of the Silvermist School of Magic for Girls, she has an honest life, one that makes her happy.  For the last twenty years she's fought like hell to keep it that way, and she thought she'd succeeded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's about to find out just how wrong she was to think her past was dead and gone.</description>

  <description>East London, 1888 - a city apart. A place of shadow and light where thieves, whores, and dreamers mingle, where children play in the cobbled streets by day and a killer stalks at night, where bright hopes meet the darkest truths. Here, by the whispering waters of the Thames, Fiona Finnegan, a worker in a tea factory, hopes to own a shop one day, together with her lifelong love, Joe Bristow, a costermonger's son. With nothing but their faith in each other to spur them on, Fiona and Joe struggle, save, and sacrifice to achieve their dreams. &lt;br&gt;But Fiona's life is shattered when the actions of a dark and brutal man take from her nearly everything-and everyone-she holds dear. Fearing her own death, she is forced to flee London for New York. There, her indomitable spirit propels her rise from a modest West Side shop-front to the top of Manhattan's tea trade. But Fiona's old ghosts do not rest quietly, and to silence them, she must venture back to the London of her childhood, where a deadly confrontation with her past becomes the key to her future.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>From the author of the bestselling "The Dangerous Book for Boys" &lt;br&gt;He was born Temujin, the son of a khan, raised in a clan of hunters migrating across the rugged steppe. Temujin's young life was shaped by a series of brutal acts: the betrayal of his father by a neighboring tribe and the abandonment of his entire family, cruelly left to die on the harsh plain. But Temujin endured--and from that moment on, he was driven by a singular fury: to survive in the face of death, to kill before being killed, and to conquer enemies who could come without warning from beyond the horizon. &lt;br&gt; Through a series of courageous raids against the Tartars, Temujin's legend grew. And so did the challenges he faced--from the machinations of a Chinese ambassador to the brutal abduction of his young wife, Borte. Blessed with ferocious courage, it was the young warrior's ability to learn, to imagine, and to judge the hearts of others that propelled him to greater and greater power. Until Temujin was chasing a vision: to unite many tribes into one, to make the earth tremble under the hoofbeats of a thousand warhorses, to subject unknown nations and even empires to his will.

  <description>Rarely, if ever, does a new writer dazzle us with such a vivid imagination and storytelling, flawlessly capturing the essence of a land, a people, a legend. Conn Iggulden is just such a writer, bringing to vivid life one of the most fascinating eras in human history. In a true masterpiece of historical fiction, Iggulden takes us on a breathtaking journey through ancient Rome, sweeping us into a realm of tyrants and slaves, of dark intrigues and seething passions. What emerges is both a grand romantic tale of coming-of-age in the Roman Empire and a vibrant portrait of the early years of a man who would become the most powerful ruler on earth: Julius Caesar. &lt;br&gt;On the lush Italian peninsula, a new empire is taking shape. At its heart is the city of Rome, a place of glory and decadence, beauty and bloodshed. Against this vivid backdrop, two boys are growing to manhood, dreaming of battles, fame, and glory in service of the mightiest empire the world has ever known. One is the son of a senator, a boy of privilege and ambition to whom much has been given and from whom much is expected. The other is a bastard child, a boy of strength and cunning, whose love for his adoptive family-and his adoptive brother-will be the most powerful force in his life. &lt;br&gt;As young Gaius and Marcus are trained in the art of combat-under the tutelage of one of Rome's most fearsome gladiators-Rome itself is being rocked by the art of treachery and ambition, caught in a tug-of-war as two rival generals, Marius and Sulla, push the empire toward civil war. For Marcus, a bloody campaign in Greece will become a young soldier's proving ground. For Gaius, the equally deadly infighting of the Roman Senate will be the battlefield where he hones his courage and skill. And for both, the love of an extraordinary slave girl will be an honor each will covet but only one will win. &lt;br&gt;The two friends are forced to walk different paths, and by the time they meet again everything will have changed. Both will have known love, loss, and violence. And the land where they were once innocent will be thrust into the grip of bitter conflict-a conflict that will set Roman against Roman...and put their friendship to the ultimate test. &lt;br&gt;Brilliantly interweaving history and adventure, Conn Iggulden conjures a stunning array of contrasts-from the bloody stench of a battlefield to the opulence of the greatest city in history, from the tenderness of a lover to the treachery of an assassin. Superbly rendered, grippingly told, Emperor, The Gates of Rome is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>Can you live 28 years without discovering you're a witch? — Lauren is downtown Chicago's youngest elite realtor. She's also a witch. She must be - the fetching spell for Witches' Chat isn't supposed to make mistakes. So says the woman who coded the spell, at least. — The tall, dark, and handsome guy sent to assess her is a witch too (and no, that doesn't end the way you might think). What he finds in Lauren will change lives, mess with a perfectly good career, and require lots of ice cream therapy.</description>

  <description>“Find Me.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are the words written on Tessa Waye’s diary. The diary that ends up with Wick Tate. But Tessa’s just been found . . . dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wick has the right computer-hacking skills for the job, but little interest in this perverse game of hide-and-seek. Until her sister Lily is the next target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Griff, trailer-park boy next door and fellow hacker, shows up, intent on helping Wick. Is a happy ending possible with the threat of Wick’s deadbeat dad returning, the detective hunting him sniffing around Wick instead, and a killer taunting her at every step?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foster child. Daughter of a felon. Loner hacker girl. Wick has a bad attitude and sarcasm to spare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she’s going to find this killer no matter what.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because it just got personal.</description>

  <description>Gwendolyn "Dough" X doesn't think she has much going for her—she carries a few extra pounds, her family struggles with their small bakery in a town full of millionaires, and the other kids at her New Jersey high school don't seem to know that she exists. Thank the stars for her longtime boyfriend, Philip P. Wishman—or "Wish." He moved away to California three years ago, when they were 13, but then professed his love for her via e-mail, and he's been her long-distance BF ever since. &lt;br&gt;At the beginning of her junior year, though, Wish e-mails that he's moving back to Jersey. Great, right? Well, except that Dough has gained about 70 pounds since the last time Wish saw her, while Wish—according to his Facebook photos—has morphed into a blonde god. Convinced that she'll be headed for Dumpsville the minute Wish lays eyes on her, Dough delays their meeting as long as she possibly can.&lt;br&gt;But when she sees Wish at school, something amazing happens. He looks at Dough like she's just as gorgeous as he is. But Wish is acting a little weird, obsessed with the sun and freaked out by rain. And the creepy new guy working at the bakery, Christian, is convinced that there's more to Wish's good looks than just healthy eating and lots of sun. He tells Dough that a mark on Wish's neck marks him as a member of the Luminati—an ancient cult of astrologers who can manipulate the stars to improve their lives. Is Wish and Dough's love meant to be—or are they star-crossed?</description>

  <description>Following her mother's death, the beautiful young heiress of the rich philanthropist Samuel Rogers grows up haughty, capricious and selfish. Recklessly, Anabel squanders away a good part of her father’s wealth and comes dangerously close to wrecking her life with drugs. Her childhood best friend Jacqueline attempts to reason with her, convinced that deep down Anabel is a wonderful person of a kind and compassionate heart. After she loses a million dollars in a Las Vegas casino, Mr. Rogers sends Anabel on a one-year training at one of his hotels in Italy – her mother’s birthplace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this unexpected turning of tables in her life, faced with her father’s bankruptcy and away from her home in America, Anabel proves that after all, the blood of the Rogers family runs through her veins. Forced to bear her cross of poverty, she finally acts with great will, resilience and vision. As she fights for her own bread she meets the love of her life in the face of her humble bodyguard Michael. While attending the spiritual school of the respected tutor and friend of her father’s Dr. Lee, Anabel also makes some real friends in Italy. She remembers how her father who used to support financially the establishment of spiritual institutions in Italy and America always said that sons and daughters of rich parents received equally warm welcome there. Many of the affluent realize that if their children do not undergo a sentient spiritual path when young they could easily grow up to fall victims of the merciless whims of prosperity just as Anabel did. Poor children are also sometimes sustained by wealthy individuals to receive this type of spiritual schooling, and Anabel finds out that Michael was one of Dr. Lee’s disciples. She slowly realizes the truth about her own life – she sees the emptiness of her existence up until now as well as the power of the Universal law which directs human evolution. She suffers first-hand the heavy blow of life's boomerang but she grasps its moral: you only reap what you sow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accompanied by her loyal assistant Susan, Anabel returns to America and rushes to see her ailing father whom she wants to cheer up with the news that with the help of Michael, Mrs. Bellucci, Dr. Lee and other friends she managed to overcome life's hardships and free herself from the poverty’s grip. She wants to inspire her father to have faith in life after his heavy financial loss. And then Anabel finds out the truth about her training and about her great love Michael…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I was obsessed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was as if he called to me, demanding I reach out and touch the brushstrokes of color swirled onto the canvas.  It was the most exquisite portrait I'd ever seen--everything about Lord Denbury was unbelievable...utterly breathtaking and eerily lifelike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a reason for that.  Because despite what everyone said, Denbury never had committed suicide.  He was alive.  Trapped within his golden frame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've crossed over into his world within the painting, and I've seen what dreams haunt him.  They haunt me too.  He and I are inextricably linked--bound together to watch the darkness seeping through the gas-lit cobblestone streets of Manhattan.  Unless I can free him soon, things will only get &lt;em&gt;Darker Still.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Fantasy becomes reality if you carry the mark...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chloe Bryant doesn’t know what to expect when she enters The Wolf’s Den. Drawn to the werewolf tattoo parlor for reasons she can’t explain, she soon discovers the sexy man from her dreams isn’t a figment of her imagination. Not only is Jackson Donovan real, but he explains the dreams they shared are due to their destined mating. It can’t be possible. She’s not a werewolf. Even if he swears the mark on her wrist indicates otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson is stunned to discover the beautiful minx from his dreams isn’t a full-blooded werewolf but a Halfling. The only way to uncover Chloe’s past is to stake a claim to her future. By taking the delectable female into his bed, he’ll unlock every secret she has to hide -- as well as awaken the passion she’s tucked away for too long -- by exploring her mind, body and soul one sweet inch at a time.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes love is an accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, it’s a strategy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miss Minerva Lane is a quiet, bespectacled wallflower, and she wants to keep it that way. After all, the last time she was the center of attention, it ended badly--so badly that she changed her name to escape her scandalous past. Wallflowers may not be the prettiest of blooms, but at least they don't get trampled. So when a handsome duke comes to town, the last thing she wants is his attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But that is precisely what she gets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clermont, is not fooled. When Minnie figures out what he's up to, he realizes there is more to than her spectacles and her quiet ways. And he's determined to lay her every secret bare before she can discover his. But this time, one shy miss may prove to be more than his match...</description>

  <description>"What if it were possible for me to live forever? Would you still love me then?" He asked me.&lt;br&gt;I stared into his light green eyes and said, "I'd love you until the end."&lt;br&gt;His eyes penetrated into mine before he leaned forward and whispered the words, "What if the end was now?"&lt;br&gt;My breath caught in my throat. "...Then I'd die loving you."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;18 year old Evangeline O'Shea hadn’t been the popular girl during her years at school. She was quiet, collected... smart. This made moving out of New York that much easier.&lt;br&gt;To go into Vancouver, Canada wasn't planned in any of her books.&lt;br&gt;However that opinion changes after she meets Michael Reeves, through an unlucky incident at Simon Fraser University. She didn't expect to fall for such a dark and mysterious man let alone her History lecturer... &lt;br&gt;And when she finds out that this man is in fact no man at all, she wonders if love is worth risking her life over…</description>

  <description>An apocalyptic alien invasion set humanity on the edge of extermination. Unable to match technology with the invaders, humanity bet their existence on their physical strength overcoming. In a desperate last stand by the world's greatest scientists, the cataclysm electromagnetic pulse wiped out all technology on the planet, stranding the aliens on earth, effectively locking them in the cage with the beasts of humanity that remained. Using pre-industrial weapons of war, the surviving humans fought back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years later, Gieo, the self-proclaimed last pilot on earth, was shot down yet again. She finds herself in the unwelcoming post apocalyptic old west town of Tombstone, the guest of the beautiful gunfighter Fiona with a turbulent history. Their budding romance hits an immediate snag when Fiona's mysterious past finally catches up with her, bringing with it old flames, hot grudges, and a rekindling of the war with the aliens that had cooled to a stalemate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sky-captain Gieo and her fleet of steam-powered dirigibles are humanity's best chance to turn the tide of the war against the alien invaders, but only if Fiona can protect her from blind cultists, jealous ex-girlfriends, and a town of apocalypse cowboys with suspect sanity.</description>

  <description>Love is like a wild animal. It can't be tamed…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the never-ending saga that is my love-hate relationship with Robson Trowbridge, I, half-Were Hedi Peacock, have had a change of heart. Ever since I shoved Trowbridge through the Gates of Merenwyn, I’ve been the leader of the pack—hard to believe, right? The thing is: I’m half-Fae. So even though my Were side is ready to heed the call of the wild, the other part of me is desperate to take flight. And much as it pains me to admit it, life without Trowbridge is really starting to &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; me down…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Am Were, &lt;em&gt;Hear Me Roar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make matters worse, the wolves of Creemore want my blood—and the North American Council of Weres wants me dead. So I’m just counting the days until Trowbridge returns from the other realm…and comes to my brave rescue…and becomes my alpha mate. Wishful thinking? Of course it is. But given all the mess I’ve been through already, what’s the harm in doing a little bit of daisy-plucking? Besides, Trowbridge owes me bigtime. &lt;em&gt;A girl can dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/thethingaboutweres/LeighEvans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/thethingabout...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>A series of murders in New York City has stymied the police and FBI alike, and they suspect the culprit is a single killer sending an indecipherable message. But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case. Special Agent Ty Grady is pulled out of undercover work after his case blows up in his face. He's cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic cliche: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer. Practically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again - this time at them. Now on the run, trying to track down a man who has focused on killing his pursuers, Grady and Garrett will have to figure out how to work together before they become two more notches in the murderer's knife."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this eBook original novella, Mary Ann Rivers introduces a soulful and sexy tale of courage, sacrifice, and love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will meet you on Wednesdays at noon in Celebration Park. Kissing only.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carrie West is happy with her life... isn’t she? But when she sees this provocative online ad, the thirtysomething librarian can’t help but be tempted. After all, the photo of the anonymous poster is far too attractive to ignore. And when Wednesday finally arrives, it brings a first kiss that’s hotter than any she’s ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian Newburgh is an attorney, but there’s more to his life... that he won't share with Carrie. Determined to have more than just Wednesdays, Carrie embarks on a quest to learn Brian’s story, certain that he will be worth the cost. But is she ready to gamble her heart on a man who just might be The One... even though she has no idea how their love story will end?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as an excerpt from the Loveswept title &lt;em&gt;Flirting with Disaster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Thalli has fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds left to live. The toxic gas that will complete her annihilation is invading her bloodstream. But she is not afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thalli is different than others in The State. She feels things. She asks questions. And in the State, this is not tolerated. The Ten scientists who survived the nuclear war that destroyed the world above believe that emotion was at the core of what went wrong—and they have genetically removed it from the citizens they have since created. Thalli has kept her malformation secret from those who have monitored her for most of her life, but when she receives an ancient piece of music to record as her community’s assigned musician, she can no longer keep her emotions secreted away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seen as a threat to the harmony of her Pod, Thalli is taken to the Scientists for immediate annihilation. But before that can happen, Berk—her former Pod mate who is being groomed as a Scientist—steps in and persuades the Scientists to keep Thalli alive as a test subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more time she spends in the Scientist’s Pod, the clearer it becomes that things are not as simple as she was programmed to believe. She hears stories of a Designer—stories that fill her mind with more questions: Who can she trust? What is this emotion called love? And what if she isn’t just an anomaly, but part of a greater design?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the follow-up to Colleen Hoover’s #1 New York Times bestseller &lt;em&gt;Hopeless&lt;/em&gt;, the charming and irresistible Dean Holder tells the passionate story that has melted thousands of hearts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hopeless&lt;/em&gt;, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but Holder’s past remained a mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent his entire life searching for her in an attempt to finally rid himself of the crushing guilt he has felt for years. But he could not have anticipated that the moment they reconnect, even greater remorse would overwhelm him…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes in life, if we wish to move forward, we must first dig deep into our past and make amends. In &lt;em&gt;Losing Hope&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Colleen Hoover reveals what was going on inside Holder’s head during all those hopeless moments—and whether he can gain the peace he desperately needs.</description>

  <description>Notorious Nora Sutherlin is famous for her delicious works of erotica, each one more popular with readers than the last. But her latest manuscript is different—more serious, more personal—and she's sure it'll be her breakout book...if it ever sees the light of day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zachary Easton holds Nora's fate in his well-manicured hands. The demanding British editor agrees to handle the book on one condition: he wants complete control. Nora must rewrite the entire novel to his exacting standards—in six weeks—or it's no deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nora's grueling writing sessions with Zach are draining…and shockingly arousing. And a dangerous former lover has her wondering which is more torturous—staying away from him...or returning to his bed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nora thought she knew everything about being pushed to your limits. But in a world where passion is pain, nothing is ever that simple.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Rose Zarelli, self-proclaimed word geek and angry girl, has some confessions to make…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. I'm &lt;em&gt;livid&lt;/em&gt; all the time. Why? My dad died. My mom barely talks. My brother abandoned us. I think I'm allowed to be &lt;em&gt;irate,&lt;/em&gt; don't you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. I make people &lt;em&gt;furious&lt;/em&gt; regularly. Want an example? I kissed Jamie Forta, a badass guy who &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be dating a cheerleader. She is now &lt;em&gt;enraged&lt;/em&gt; and out for blood. Mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. High school might as well be Mars. My best friend has been replaced by an alien, and I &lt;em&gt;see red&lt;/em&gt; all the time. (Mars is red and "seeing red" means being angry—get it?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some other vocab words that describe my life: &lt;em&gt;Inadequate. Insufferable. Intolerable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Don't know what they mean? Look them up yourself.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sorry. That was rude.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;RITA finalist Ruthie Knox returns with a brand-new eBook original novella, the finale of her delightfully sexy Camelot series!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hotel bar. A sexy stranger. A night of passion. There’s a part of Amber Mazzara that wants those things, wants to have a moment — just one — where life isn’t a complicated tangle of house and husband and kids and careers. Then, after a long, exhausting “vacation” with her family, her husband surprises her with a gift: a few days on the beach . . . alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only she won’t be alone long, because a handsome man just bought her a drink. He’s cool, he’s confident, and he wants to take Amber to bed and keep her there for days. Lucky for them both, he’s her husband. He’s only got a few days in Jamaica to make her wildest desires come true, but if he can pull it off, there’s reason to believe that this fantasy can last a lifetime.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A standalone short story in the Syntax universe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An assassin has come to Tower Oh-Seven-Two, and no one can keep him from his target.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only minutes from escape, he suffers a violent seizure, collapsing in a service corridor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lonely surveillance operator becomes the only person in the building to see him fall. Antho is no murderer, but in watching the killer stumble he recognizes something that links the two of them together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he rescues the assassin in secret, he finds the monster on his screen is only a young man, cursed with the effects of a trauma as outsized as his deadly skill—and somehow linked to the stirring of a terrifying power. Unable to walk away, Antho makes a choice that could cost them both their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He takes the assassin home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREE DOWNLOAD: &lt;a href="http://www.mmromancegroup.com/?p=67965" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.mmromancegroup.com/?p=67965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's "&lt;strong&gt;Love Has No Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;" event.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A brilliant debut mystery in a classic vein: Detective Cormoran Strike investigates a supermodel's suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, thelegendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may think you know detectives, but you've never met one quite like Strike. You may think you know about the wealthy and famous, but you've never seen them under an investigation like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing Cormoran Strike, this is the acclaimed first crime novel by J.K. Rowling, writing under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Ian McEwan’s symphonic novel of love and war, childhood and class, guilt and forgiveness provides all the satisfaction of a brilliant narrative and the provocation we have come to expect from this master of English prose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a hot summer day in 1934, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses a moment’s flirtation between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant and Cecilia’s childhood friend. But Briony’s incomplete grasp of adult motives—together with her precocious literary gifts—brings about a crime that will change all their lives. As it follows that crime’s repercussions through the chaos and carnage of World War II and into the close of the twentieth century, &lt;em&gt;Atonement&lt;/em&gt; engages the reader on every conceivable level, with an ease and authority that mark it as a genuine masterpiece.</description>

  <description>As an Arrow, an elite soldier in the Psy Council ranks, Judd Lauren was forced to do terrible things in the name of his people. Now a defector, his dark abilities have made him the most deadly of assassins - cold, pitiless, unfeeling. Until he meets Brenna . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna Shane Kincaid was an innocent before she was abducted - and had her mind violated - by a serial killer. Her sense of evil runs so deep, she fears she could become a killer herself. Then the first dead body is found, victim of a familiar madness. Judd is her only hope, yet her sensual changeling side rebels against the inhuman chill of his personality, even as desire explodes between them. Shocking and raw, their passion is a danger that threatens not only their hearts, but their very lives . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Never underestimate the power of a woman on a double espresso with a mocha latte chaser high.&lt;br&gt;- T-shirt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson isn't your everyday, run-of-the-mill grim reaper. She's more of a paranormal private eye/grim reaper extraordinaire. However, she gets sidetracked when the sexy, sultry son of Satan, Reyes Farrow, moves in next door. To further complicate matters, Reyes is her main suspect in an arson case. Charley has vowed to stay away from him until she can find out the truth...but then dead women start appearing in her apartment, one after another, each lost, confused, and terrified beyond reason. When it becomes apparent that her own sister, Gemma is the serial killer's next target, Charley has no choice but to ask for Reyes's help. Arsonist or not, he's the one man alive who could protect Gemma no matter who or what came at her. But he wants something in return. Charley. All of her, body and soul. And to keep her sister safe, it is a price she is willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is at it again in the sexy, suspenseful, and laugh-out-loud funny fifth installment of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best selling series.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Like None. In fact there are no answers in Books two, three, or four. There are a few in Book four point five, but only if you're paying very close attention. So if you're looking for a nice tidy story with sweet characters - you're gonna want to skip ALL these books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If on the other hand, you like science fiction, psycho girls with a lot of power, romance without commitment, liars, cheat, and killers... then Junco might be your girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How long can you lie to yourself before it all comes apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2152 the avian race is on Earth looking for something stolen from them decades ago – their genetics. At the center of the search lies the Rural Republic; a small backwards farming country with high hopes of military domination and a penchant for illegal bioengineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;19 year old Junco Coot is the daughter of the Rural Republic’s ranking commander. She’s the most foul-mouthed, wildly unpredictable and ruthless sniper the Rural Republic has ever trained. But when her father’s death sparks a trip into forbidden places, she triggers events that will change everything she knows to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an elite avian military officer, Tier’s mission is to destroy the bioengineering projects, kill Commander Coot’s daughter, and return home immediately. There’s just one problem. Junco isn’t who she claims to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no one to trust, not even herself, Junco must confront the secrets of her past and accept her place in the future, or risk losing herself completely.</description>

  <description>A child receives the body of Saint Lucia of Syracuse for her seventh birthday. A rebelling angel rewrites the Book of Judgement to protect the woman he loves. A young woman discovers the lost manuscript of Jane Austen written on the inside of her skin. A 747 populated by a dying pantheon makes the extraordinary journey to the beginning of the universe. Lyrical and tender, quirky and cutting, Helen Marshall’s exceptional debut collection weaves the fantastic and the horrific alongside the touchingly human in fifteen modern parables about history, memory, and cost of creating art.</description>

  <description>Inspired by one of the greatest creative minds in the English language—and William Shakespeare—here is an officially licensed retelling of George Lucas's epic &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; in the style of the immortal Bard of Avon. The saga of a wise (Jedi) knight and an evil (Sith) lord, of a beautiful princess held captive and a young hero coming of age, &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; abounds with all the valor and villainy of Shakespeare’s greatest plays. ’Tis a tale told by fretful droids, full of faithful Wookiees and fearsome Stormtroopers, signifying...pretty much everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reimagined in glorious iambic pentameter—and complete with twenty gorgeous Elizabethan illustrations—&lt;em&gt;William Shakespeare’s Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; will astound and edify Rebels and Imperials alike. Zounds! This is the book you’re looking for.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Ted Bundy. The Son of Sam. The Boston Strangler. Albert Fish. Henry Lee Lucas. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The DNA of the world&amp;amp;#8217;s most notorious serial killers has been cloned by the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a new breed of bioweapon. Now in Phase Three, the program includes dozens of young men who have no clue as to their evil heritage. Playing a twisted game of nature vs. nurture, scientists raise some of the clones with loving families and others in abusive circumstances. But everything changes when the most dangerous boys are set free by their creator. A man with demons of his own, former black ops soldier Shawn Castillo is hot on their trail. But Castillo didn&amp;amp;#8217;t count on the quiet young man he finds hiding in an abandoned house&amp;amp;#8212;a boy who has just learned he is the clone of Jeffrey Dahmer. As Jeffrey and Castillo race across the country on the trail of the rampaging teens, Castillo must protect the boy who is the embodiment of his biggest fears&amp;amp;#8212;and who may also be his last hope. Melding all-too-plausible science and ripped from- the-headlines horror, Cain&amp;amp;#8217;s Blood is a stunning debut about the potential for good and evil in us all.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A dark, romantic fantasy set against the backdrop of San Francisco devastated by the Great Quake...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the dawn of a new century in San Francisco and Delia Martin is a wealthy young woman whose life appears ideal. But a dark secret colors her life, for Delia’s most loyal companions are ghosts, as she has been gifted (or some would say cursed) with an ability to peer across to the other side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the great quake rocked her city in 1906, Delia has been haunted by an avalanche of the dead clamoring for her help. Delia flees to the other side of the continent, hoping to gain some peace. After several years in New York, Delia believes she is free…until one determined specter appears and she realizes that she must return to the City by the Bay in order to put this tortured soul to rest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will not be easy, as the ghost is only one of the many victims of a serial killer who was never caught. A killer who after thirty years is killing again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And who is now aware of Delia’s existence.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Jeff Jacobson had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer, the infamous serial killer who brutally murdered seventeen people more than twenty years ago. But Jeff’s life changes forever when the man he’d thought was his father hands him a government file telling him he was constructed in a laboratory only seven years ago, part of a top-secret government cloning experiment called ‘Project CAIN’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There, he was created entirely from Jeffrey Dahmer’s DNA. There are others like Jeff—those genetically engineered directly from the most notorious murderers of all time: The Son of Sam, The Boston Strangler, Ted Bundy . . . even other Jeffrey Dahmer clones. Some raised, like Jeff, in caring family environments; others within homes that mimicked the horrific early lives of the men they were created from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the most dangerous boys are set free by the geneticist who created them, the summer of killing begins. Worse, these same teens now hold a secret weapon even more dangerous than the terrible evil they carry within. Only Jeff can help track the clones down before it’s too late. But will he catch the ‘monsters’ before becoming one himself?</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Maya and seventeen-year-old Lochan have never had the chance to be “normal” teenagers. Having pulled together for years to take care of their younger siblings while their wayward, drunken mother leaves them to fend alone, they have become much more than brother and sister. And now, they have fallen in love. But this is a love that can never be allowed, a love that will have devastating consequences ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can something so wrong feel so right?</description>

  <description>After losing best friend and distant cousin Ann Weller in marriage to the Earl of Beresford, sharp-witted Charlotte Hayden feels inclined to be even ruder than usual to potential suitors. But after a compromising liaison with Beresford's wicked, wayward cousin, Shad, she's suddenly propelled into a reluctant marriage, and finds herself missing Ann more than ever. But when Ann returns from her honeymoon, she drops a bombshell—not only is she not sure she loves Beresford, she's also had a child out of wedlock, and is planning to betray her husband with her former lover. Charlotte's realization that she’s falling in love with Shad only serves to make her dilemma even worse: should she keep Ann's secret, or tell her husband the truth?</description>

  <description>Washington, D.C., Metro Police Detective Sergeant Sam Holland needs a big win to salvage her career--and her confidence--after a disastrous investigation. The perfect opportunity arises when Senator John O'Connor is found brutally murdered in his bed, and Sam is assigned to the case. Matters get complicated when Sam has to team up with Nick Cappuano, O'Connor's friend and chief of staff...and the man Sam had a memorable one-night stand with years earlier. Their sexual chemistry still sizzles, and Sam has to fight to stay focused on the case. Sleeping with a material witness is another mistake she can't afford--especially when the bodies keep piling up.</description>

  <description>Six years after a shocking tragedy left her emotionally and physically scarred, Ember Jones lives a life of quiet isolation in Barcelona. Determined to keep her troubled past a secret, she keeps her head down and her heart locked up tight. Until the day a beautiful, mysterious stranger walks into her life, and her carefully controlled world is shattered forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian McLoughlin is unlike anyone Ember has ever met. Wealthy, cultured, and utterly charismatic, he also has dark secrets of his own. They succumb to the undeniable pull between them and embark on a passionate affair, but things turn explosive when the truth about Christian and the reason he came to Barcelona is exposed. As their dark pasts collide, the two unlikely lovers find themselves caught in a web of danger and deceit that neither of them might survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Edge of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;, where hunter becomes hunted, no one can be trusted, and love is the most dangerous game of them all.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Looking back, I wonder if I had an inkling that my life was about to go from ordinary to extraordinary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sixteen-year-old Lillie Hart meets the gorgeous and mysterious Tom Windsor-Smith for the first time, it’s like fireworks — for her, anyway. Tom looks as if he would be more interested in watching paint dry; as if he is bored by her and by her small Nebraskan town in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Lillie begins to break down the walls of his seemingly impenetrable exterior, she starts to suspect that he holds the answers to her reoccurring nightmares and to the impossible memories which keep bubbling to the surface of her mind — memories of the two of them, together and in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she at last learns the truth about their connection, Lillie discovers that Tom has been hiding an earth-shattering secret; a secret that is bigger — and much more terrifying and beautiful — than the both of them. She also discovers that once you finally understand that the world is round, there is no way to make it flat again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An epic and deeply original sci-fi romance, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein’s theories and the world-bending wonder of true love itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the first chapter at: &lt;a href="http://ingridjonach.com.au/when-the-world-was-flat-excerpt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://ingridjonach.com.au/when-the-w...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>I wasn't always in love with Colton Calloway; I was in love with his younger brother, Kyle, first. Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go.</description>

  <description>The more things change…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years ago, the gods of ancient mythology awoke all around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more things stay the same…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This morning, Kyra Locke is late for school because of an argument with her father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Kyra lives in a transformed Washington, D.C., dominated by the embassies of divine pantheons and watched over by the mysterious Society of the Sun that governs mankind’s relations with the gods. But when rebellious Kyra encounters two trickster gods on her way home, one offering a threat and the other a warning, it turns out her life isn't what it seems. She escapes with the aid of Osborne "Oz" Spencer, a young Society field operative, only to discover that her scholar father has disappeared with a dangerous Egyptian relic. The Society needs the item back, and they aren’t interested in her protests that she knows nothing about it or her father's secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Kyra must depend on her wits and the suspect help of scary Sumerian gods, her estranged oracle mother, and, of course, Oz--whose first allegiance is to the Society. She has no choice if she’s going to recover the missing relic and save her father. And if she doesn't? Well, that may just mean the end of the world as she knows it. From the author of Blackwood comes a fresh, thrilling urban fantasy that will appeal to fans of Neil Gaiman, Cassandra Clare, and Rick Riordan.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An imaginative story of a woman caught in an alternate world—where she will need to learn the skills of magic to survive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nora Fischer’s dissertation is stalled and her boyfriend is about to marry another woman.  During a miserable weekend at a friend’s wedding, Nora wanders off and walks through a portal into a different world where she’s transformed from a drab grad student into a stunning beauty.  Before long, she has a set of glamorous new friends and her romance with gorgeous, masterful Raclin is heating up. It’s almost too good to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then the elegant veneer shatters. Nora’s new fantasy world turns darker, a fairy tale gone incredibly wrong. Making it here will take skills Nora never learned in graduate school. Her only real ally—and a reluctant one at that—is the magician Aruendiel, a grim, reclusive figure with a biting tongue and a shrouded past. And it will take her becoming Aruendiel’s student—and learning magic herself—to survive. When a passage home finally opens, Nora must weigh her "real life" against the dangerous power of love and magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For lovers of Lev Grossman's The Magicians series (&lt;em&gt;The Magicians &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Magician King&lt;/em&gt;) and Deborah Harkness's All Souls Trilogy (&lt;em&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of Night&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>We have fought battles that left more than a hundred corpses on the ground and not a word of it has ever been set down. The Order fights, but often it fights in shadow, without glory or reward. We have no banners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaelin Al Sorna's life changes forever the day his father abandons him at the gates of the Sixth Order, a secretive military arm of the Faith. Together with his fellow initiates, Vaelin undertakes a brutal training regime - where the price of failure is often death. Under the tutelage of the Order's masters, he learns how to forge a blade, survive the wilds and kill a man quickly and quietly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now his new skills will be put to the test. War is coming. Vaelin is the Sixth Order's deadliest weapon and the Realm's only hope. He must draw upon the very essence of his strength and cunning if he is to survive the coming conflict. Yet as the world teeters on the edge of chaos, Vaelin will learn that the truth can cut deeper than any sword.</description>

  <description>The Registry saved the country from collapse. But stability has come at a price. In this patriotic new America, girls are raised to be brides, sold at auction to the highest bidder. Boys are raised to be soldiers, trained by the state to fight to their death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly eighteen, beautiful Mia Morrissey excitedly awaits the beginning of her auction year. But a warning from her married older sister raises dangerous thoughts. Now, instead of going up on the block, Mia is going to escape to Mexico—and the promise of freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Mia wants is to control her own destiny—a brave and daring choice that will transform her into an enemy of the state, pursued by powerful government agents, ruthless bounty hunters, and a cunning man determined to own her . . . a man who will stop at nothing to get her back.</description>

  <description>They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of Australia’s most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and that’s why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they’re always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s his game and his rules. He’s content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, she’s exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and language.</description>

  <description>Meena has a secret guarded closely by her family—a secret as dangerous as the sea and buried just as deep. When court-appointed community-service workers are assigned to Flukes, the family-owned animal sanctuary, everyone is on high alert. It doesn’t help that Meena finds herself attracted to sexy-as-sin Blake Weathering, one of the new workers. If he wasn’t so distracting, she might be able to land Flukes a much-needed cruise-line contract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blake Weathering, the first in his family to attend public school, has developed a tough image. Unfortunately, it lands him in trouble. Now banned from his high school graduation ceremony, getting his diploma is dependent upon a community-service gig cleaning up fish crap. No diploma, no trust fund fortune—and no way to escape his overbearing father. The last thing he needs is the distraction of a mysterious girl with teal eyes who pulls at his heartstrings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Blake discovers Meena’s secret, they are both thrown into a desperate search for information about her past. Two worlds pull them in opposite directions, and they will have to fight to hold on to all that really matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** This novel is not intended for young readers. ***</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; is a spine-tingling novel of supernatural suspense from master of horror Joe Hill, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victoria McQueen has a secret gift for finding things: a misplaced bracelet, a missing photograph, answers to unanswerable questions. On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether it’s across Massachusetts or across the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing – and terrifying – playground of amusements he calls “Christmasland.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one day, Vic goes looking for trouble—and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manx’s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. He’s on the road again and he’s picked up a new passenger: Vic’s own son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Exclusive to the print editions of &lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; are more than 15 illustrations by award-winning Locke &amp;amp; Key artist Gabriel Rodríguez.</description>

  <description>Written in 1948, &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; was George Orwell's chilling prophecy about the future. And while the year 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's narrative is timelier than ever. &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; presents a startling and haunting vision of the world, so powerful that it is completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the power of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of multiple generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions. A legacy that seems only to grow with the passage of time.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller, the shocking story of one of the few people born in a North Korean political prison to have escaped and survived. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North Korea is isolated and hungry, bankrupt and belligerent. It is also armed with nuclear weapons. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people are being held in its political prison camps, which have existed twice as long as Stalin's Soviet gulags and twelve times as long as the Nazi concentration camps. Very few born and raised in these camps have escaped. But Shin Donghyuk did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Escape from Camp 14&lt;/em&gt;, acclaimed journalist Blaine Harden tells the story of Shin Dong-hyuk and through the lens of Shin's life unlocks the secrets of the world's most repressive totalitarian state. Shin knew nothing of civilized existence-he saw his mother as a competitor for food, guards raised him to be a snitch, and he witnessed the execution of his own family. Through Harden's harrowing narrative of Shin's life and remarkable escape, he offers an unequaled inside account of one of the world's darkest nations and a riveting tale of endurance, courage, and survival.</description>

  <description>A decade in the future, humanity thrives in the absence of sickness and disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We owe our good health to a humble parasite - a genetically engineered tapeworm developed by the pioneering SymboGen Corporation. When implanted, the tapeworm protects us from illness, boosts our immune system - even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost every human being has a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives...and will do anything to get them.</description>

  <description>UltraAgent Surefire’s plan is simple: Capture the transhuman thief Raven. Win back the respect of her father. Get a raise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except Surefire just broke the number one rule of her employer, UltraSecurity, a niche security firm that solves crimes committed by genetically enhanced humans like Raven. She trailed Raven into a warehouse without backup. And something more powerful than any transhuman is waiting inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raven’s plan is simple: Atone for his past crimes. Return stolen spiritual artifacts to restore the world’s balance. Don’t get caught by UltraSecurity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until a spunky UltraSecurity agent is suddenly on his tail, although Raven wishes she was on … well, never mind … he can’t get distracted from his mission. Because she’s followed him into a warehouse filled with his reclaimed relics, and Raven’s ex-partner in crime is about to unleash a supernatural-sized complication into his plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His old partner has accidentally summoned an Aztec god who will destroy the world unless Raven stops this spirit with a superiority complex. To do this, Raven must team up with Surefire and reveal the truth about his powers, exposing her to a force that can either save the world or destroy them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following Raven into that warehouse throws Surefire into a surreal world filled with moody gods, day-glo skulls, dizzying dimensional portals, maniacal half-roach magicians, and a sexy thief who is more than he appears under his snug t-shirt. Is Raven a criminal, or is he working for a higher power? Surefire needs to be certain, because if she joins him on this mission, she’ll have to surrender everything she believed in for a surefire way to save the world, discover her destiny and find true love.</description>

      <![CDATA[**EDIT: So, I'm removing my rating for this book. I'm also going to give it a second shot as this is the first novel by this author and my issues were more with the editing than the story itself. I don't usually do this but in this case I'm willing to make an exception. <br /><br /><br />Original review:<br />[spoilers...]]>

Forgiveness proves elusive, and trouble finds her anyway when she discovers a secret club at school connected to the death of her best friend. She learns that swim team members participate in a “Fantasy Slut League,” scoring points for their sexual acts with unsuspecting girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke, wracked with guilt over her friend’s death, decides to infiltrate the league by becoming one of the “unsuspecting girls,” and exact revenge on the boys who stole away her best friend. An unexpected romance complicates her plans, and her dogged pursuit of justice turns her reckless as she underestimates just how far the boys will go to keep their sex club a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is a New Adult fiction book with mature themes. It contains graphic sex and language and a description of sexual violence.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s a fallen angel. She’s a rockabilly reporter. Together they must solve a deadly string of murders plaguing the mortal and the immortal worlds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Griffin Shaw used to be a PI, but that was over fifty years ago when gumshoes hoofed the streets . . . and he was still alive. Now he’s a Centurion, an angel who assists other murdered souls through their journey to the afterlife. But while Shaw might be an angel … he’s no saint. Haunted by the mysterious events surrounding his own death, he seizes a chance to wreak some vengeance when he witnesses a deadly attack on journalist Katherine “Kit” Craig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joining forces, the unlikely avengers take to the streets, hunting a killer whose trail of bodies stretches across Las Vegas and into an immortal netherworld. It is a dangerous trek that lead them into the darkest corners of Sin City and into the heart of an evil conspiracy extending beyond the lights of the Strip that could destory them both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But destruction isn’t the only threat Griffin faces. The closer he gets to Kit, the more he finds himself bewitched by her mortal charms. Can he resist falling under her spell? And does he want to?</description>

  <description>Piper's world is dying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each day brings hotter temperatures and heat bubbles that threaten to destroy the earth. Amid this global heating crisis, Piper lives under the oppressive rule of her mother, who suffocates her even more than the weather does. Everything changes on her eighteenth birthday, when her mother is called away on a mysterious errand and Piper seizes her first opportunity for freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piper discovers a universe she never knew existed—a sphere of gods and monsters—and realizes that her world is not the only one in crisis. While gods battle for control of the Underworld, Piper’s life spirals out of control as she struggles to find the answer to the secret that has been kept from her since birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An imaginative melding of mythology and dystopia, Solstice is the first YA novel by talented newcomer P. J. Hoover.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A fresh, meaty, sink-your-teeth-in-and-hold-on-tight new adult fantasy series kicks off with King Hall…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;King Hall — where the Mysticals go to learn their craft, get their degrees, and transition into adulthood. And where four new Rulers will rise and meet their destinies.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lily Ruckler is adept at one thing:  survival.  Born a Mystical hybrid, her mere existence is forbidden, but her nightmare is only about to start. Fluke, happenstance, and a deep personal loss finds Lily deeply entrenched with those who would destroy her simply for existing — The Mystical Kings.  Being named future Queen of the Shifters shoves Lily into the spotlight, making her one of the most visible Mysticals in the world. But with risk comes a certain solace — her burgeoning friendships with the other three Prodigies: a wicked Vampire, a wild-child Mage, and a playboy Elemental. Backed by their faith and trust, Lily begins to relax into her new life. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Then chaos erupts as the fragile peace between Commoners and Mysticals is broken, and suddenly Lily realises the greatest threat was never from within, and her fear takes on a new name: the revolution. </description>

  <description>there are two sides to every breakup. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is Jordan and Courtney, totally in love. Sure, they were an unlikely high school couple. But they clicked; it worked. They're even going to the same college, and driving cross-country together for orientation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then Jordan dumps Courtney -- for a girl he met on the Internet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's too late to change plans, so the road trip is on. Courtney's heartbroken, but figures she can tough it out for a few days. &lt;em&gt;La la la&lt;/em&gt; -- this is Courtney pretending not to care. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But in a strange twist, Jordan cares. A lot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Turns out, he's got a secret or two that he's not telling Courtney. And it has everything to do with why they broke up, why they can't get back together, and how, in spite of it all, this couple is destined for each other.</description>

  <description>With what should have been the greatest heist of their career gone spectacularly sour, Locke and his trusted partner, Jean, have barely escaped with their lives. Or at least Jean has. But Locke is slowly succumbing to a deadly poison that no alchemist or physiker can cure. Yet just as the end is near, a mysterious Bondsmage offers Locke an opportunity that will either save him or finish him off once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magi political elections are imminent, and the factions are in need of a pawn. If Locke agrees to play the role, sorcery will be used to purge the venom from his body - though the process will be so excruciating he may well wish for death. Locke is opposed, but two factors cause his will to crumble: Jean's imploring - and the Bondsmage's mention of a woman from Locke's past: Sabetha. She is the love of his life, his equal in skill and wit, and now, his greatest rival. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Locke was smitten with Sabetha from his first glimpse of her as a young fellow orphan and thief-in-training. But after a tumultuous courtship, Sabetha broke away. Now they will reunite in yet another clash of wills. For faced with his one and only match in both love and trickery, Locke must choose whether to fight Sabetha - or to woo her. It is a decision on which both their lives may depend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Richard Cohen, a former homosexual, now married with three children, struggled for most of his life with unwanted same-sex attractions.  He tried desperately to find professionals who understood his condition and help him heal.  Because "it was so difficult to explain myself to therapists, who didn't have a clue," Cohen eventually became a psychotherapist and developed both a groundbreaking understanding of same-sex attractions and a comprehensive treatment plan for healing homosexuality.  "Coming Out Straight" not only details Cohen's personal journey out of homosexuality but also recounts his experiences helping thousands of men, women and adolescents heal their gender identity.  &lt;p&gt;Recoginizing that the "gay rights movement" has done a great service in bringing the issue of homosexuality of the closet and into the light, Cohen points out that in the name of tolerance, society has now succumbed to acceptance.  "If we embrace someone's homosexuality as normal and natural, their potential for wholeness will remain dormant beneath their emotional wounds.  It's not bad to have same-sex attractions, as they represent a drive to heal unmet love needs. However, acting upon them leads to frustration and pain."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple language, "Coming Out Straight" presents the basic causes of same-sex attractions, a clear model for recovery, and stories of individuals who made the change. The book has three parts: In Part I, the author shares his own story and the root causes of same-sex attractions.  Part II presents a four-stage model of recovery and healing.  Part III discusses the healing of homophobia by overcoming fear and hatred of homosexuality.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the book is meant to educate therapists, clergy, and other professionals, it also assists those who struggle with their own same-sex attractions as well as their loved ones.  "Coming Out Straight" sets forth an easy to understand primer on homosexuality, both for family members and friends of homosexuals, as well as for the general public.  It will open the door to a new, happier, and fulfilling heterosexual life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>There is a new breed of atheist which our educational system is pumping out like mad. These are militant atheists who have an agenda to eliminate Christianity from the face of the earth. Believers are in a war and we need powerful weapons to "fight the good fight of faith." This book reveals not just the weakness of the atheists' arguments and the solid foundation on which the Christian stands, but does so with humor and warmth. Few books take the time to address the atheist's conscience. By way of a lively Q&amp;amp;A format, "You Can Lead an Atheist" gives empirical evidence for the existence of God. Not only that, this book shows the existence of God can be proven and anyone can do it!</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us&lt;/em&gt;. To put things simply: If women today were happy, "Ally McBeal" would not be such a huge TV hit — a television phenomenon that not only provokes endless discussion nationwide but also has the distinction of mention in a Time Magazine cover story addressing the state of feminism.&lt;p&gt;The anxiety-riddled character "Ally McBeal" has tapped into something simmering beneath the surface of today's professional, "successful" women. It's called misery. Worse, it's called misery without a comprehensible origin. It is this odd, pervasive unhappiness that Danielle Crittenden confronts in her fascinating, enlightening book &lt;em&gt;What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise of &lt;em&gt;What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us&lt;/em&gt; is that with all of the success of feminism — all of the doors that have been opened, all of the new freedoms women of this generation enjoy — "we may have inadvertently also smashed the foundations necessary for our happiness." Crittenden does not in any way suggest women revert back to the pre-&lt;em&gt;Feminine Mystique&lt;/em&gt; days of suburban housewife malaise, but she does confront the possibility that there might have been some crucial good in many of the old patterns of living that women today reject entirely. Crittenden explains that women in the '90s have "heeded their mother's advice: Do something with your life; don't depend upon a man to take care of you; don't make the same mistakes I did. So they have made different mistakes. They are the women who postponed marriage and childbirth to pursue their careers only tofindthemselves at 35 still single and baby-crazy, with no husband in sight. They are the unwed mothers who now depend on the state to provide what the fathers of their children won't — a place to live and an income to raise their kids on. They are the eighteen-year-old girls who believed they could lead the unfettered sexual lives of men, only to have ended up in an abortion clinic or attending grade twelve English while eight months pregnant. They are the new brides who understand that when a couple promises to stay together 'forever,' they have little better than a 50-50 chance of sticking to it. They are the female partners at law firms who thought they'd made provisions for everything about their career — except for that sudden, unexpected moment when they find their insides shredding the first day they return from maternity leave, having placed their infants in a stranger's arms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us&lt;/em&gt; examines the new problems in today's society and outlines the erroneous ways of thinking that created these problems. With a lighthearted tone and good humor throughout, Crittenden intelligently leads readers through an exploration of love, marriage, motherhood, and even aging. Her examination of dating among women in their 20s and 30s is fascinating, harsh — and yes, depressing. She paints a stark portrait of women in their 20s who brush aside sincere suitors because they believe they're too young to consider marriage, only to discover in their mid-30s that the crowd beating down their door has thinned considerably — and perhaps irrevocably. There is perhaps no more salient truth in Crittenden's book than her statement, "It is usually at precisely this moment — when a single woman looks up from her work and realizes she's ready to take on family life — that men make themselves most absent." Further, it is impossible to deny that in terms of sexual appeal, men have a longer shelf life. A successful man can attract women of any age well into his 50s, 60s...or beyond. They can father children well into old age. And according to Crittenden, "this disparity in sexual staying power is something feminists rather recklessly overlooked when they urged women to abandon marriage and domesticity in favor of autonomy and self-fulfillment outside the home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Crittenden, even when a young woman today manages to get married, she is most likely not headed down the path to wedded bliss. In striving so furiously not to be taken for granted as wives were in previous generations, women today often err too far in the opposite direction. Crittenden makes ironic mention of Gloria Steinem's remark that women have become "the husbands we wanted to marry"; Crittenden suggests that perhaps women today are more likely to resemble the husbands we left behind: "balky, self-absorbed, and supremely sure that our needs should come before anyone else's." Crittenden warns that a sense of entitlement devoid of compromise is not likely to lead women into enduring, happy unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most significant arena of mixed messages is the realm of motherhood. Crittenden is unflinching in her look at the tug of war between work responsibility and the job of motherhood. She explores the myriad decisions and conflicts that arise upon the birth of a child. Some women are eager to return to work but feel guilty leaving their child. Some women are desperate to remain at home with their child but cannot afford to do so. Other women would prefer to remain home with their child, and can afford to do so, but are wary of leaving their jobs because if they ever need to return to the workforce they will have lost their foothold. Crittenden is critical of our culture's pervasive attitude that suggests a woman is not "doing anything" once she steps out of the workforce — an attitude that could only hold weight in a society such as ours in which "the virtues of work have been so inflated that we can no longer appreciate anything that's not accompanied by a paycheck." And as for the idea that work is a liberating alternative to the drudgery of housework and childrearing, Crittenden suggests that the number of people who have interesting, fulfilling jobs are in the great minority. Crittenden calls for women to reevaluate what they have been socialized to believe — that work offers a more defining sense of self than raising children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what did our mothers never tell us? Maybe they did not tell us what Crittenden explains very carefully: Women can't have it both ways. They probably can't have "it all." Life, relationships, careers...all are full of compromises that are natural and not necessarily a threat to who we are as individuals. Crittenden asserts that "If we wish to live for ourselves and think only about ourselves, we will manage to retain our independence but little else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us&lt;/em&gt; offers a revised perspective on womanhood that is truly liberating. &lt;br&gt;— Isabel Rifkin&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Manning Up&lt;/em&gt;, Manhattan Institute fellow and &lt;em&gt;City Journal&lt;/em&gt; contributing editor Kay Hymowitz argues that the gains of the feminist revolution have had a dramatic, unanticipated effect on the current generation of young men. Traditional roles of family man and provider have been turned upside down as �pre-adult” men, stuck between adolescence and �real” adulthood, find themselves lost in a world where women make more money, are more educated, and are less likely to want to settle down and build a family. Their old scripts are gone, and young men find themselves adrift. Unlike women, they have no biological clock telling them it’s time to grow up. Hymowitz argues that it’s time for these young men to �man up.”</description>

  <description>Regan Martin stopped believing in Christmas miracles six years ago when she lost everything—her house, her job, and her impeccable reputation in the wine industry—after she fell in love with a man she had no idea was married. Then Regan gets a chance for a fresh start in the Napa Valley. With her dream job, dream home, and her daughter enrolled in a wonderful new school, she starts wondering if holiday wishes really do come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she soon tumbles back down to earth when she learns that her new boss is none other than Gabe DeLuca, the scorned wife’s brother. Gabe wants nothing more than home-wrecking Regan Martin out of his life, his sister’s world, and his family’s business. Mostly, he wants the lush beauty out of his head. Yet his attempts to run her out of town have him thinking twice, especially when he sees that Regan may hold the key to tracking down his sister’s stolen start-up capital. Even worse for Gabe, Regan might just be his Christmas wish and hold the key to his heart.</description>

  <description>When Alexis “Lexi” Moreau caught her husband, Jeff, sampling the sous-chef’s more intimate wares in their New York restaurant, she ran—all the way back to her hometown of St. Helena, California. Six months later, Lexi has no husband and no restaurant. But she does have a three-step plan: First, convert her grandmother’s bakery into her dream bistro. Second, ignore Grandma’s matchmaking attempts. And third, avoid Marco DeLuca, her ex’s commitment-phobic, distractingly sexy best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In school Lexi was off-limits for Marco. After all, she was his buddy’s girl. But she’s still as smart and as gorgeous—and apparently as immune to his charms—as she used to be. Yet the simple fake romance they agree upon to dodge Lexi’s grandmother’s matchmaking plans soon turns deliciously complicated. And the sultry summer might bring together all the right ingredients for Marco to win the only woman he’s ever wanted.</description>

  <description>When Mallory’s boyfriend, Jeremy, cheats on her with an online girlfriend, Mallory decides the best way to de-Jeremy her life is to de-modernize things too. Inspired by a list of goals her grandmother made in1962, Mallory swears off technology and returns to a simpler time (when boyfriends couldn’t cheat with computer avatars). The List:&lt;br&gt;1. Run for pep club secretary&lt;br&gt;2. Host a fancy dinner party/soiree&lt;br&gt;3. Sew a dress for Homecoming&lt;br&gt;4. Find a steady&lt;br&gt;5. Do something dangerous&lt;br&gt;But simple proves to be crazy-complicated, and the details of the past begin to change Mallory’s present. Add in a too-busy grandmother, a sassy sister, and the cute pep-club president–who just happens to be her ex’s cousin–and soon Mallory begins to wonder if going vintage is going too far.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Catherynne M. Valente comes a brilliant reinvention of one the best known fairy tales of all time. In the novella Six-Gun Snow White, Valente transports the title's heroine to a masterfully evoked Old West where Coyote is just as likely to be found as the seven dwarves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A plain-spoken, appealing narrator relates the history of her parents—a Nevada silver baron who forced the Crow people to give up one of their most beautiful daughters, Gun That Sings, in marriage to him. With her mother's death in childbirth, so begins a heroine's tale equal parts heartbreak and strength. This girl has been born into a world with no place for a half-native, half-white child. After being hidden for years, a very wicked stepmother finally gifts her with the name Snow White, referring to the pale skin she will never have. Filled with fascinating glimpses through the fabled looking glass and a close-up look at hard living in the gritty gun-slinging West, readers will be enchanted by this story at once familiar and entirely new.</description>

  <description>Danika hasn’t had an easy life. Being insanely attracted to bad boys has never helped make it easier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One look at Tristan, and every brain cell she possessed went up in smoke. This man was trouble with a capital T. It was a given.&lt;br&gt;She knew better. Bad boys were bad. Especially for her. Considering her history, it was crazy to think otherwise. So why did crazy have to feel so damn fine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For as long as she could remember, Danika had been focused on the future with single-minded purpose. Tristan came along and taught her everything there was to know about letting go, and living in the present. She fell, hard and deep. Of course, that only made her impact with the ground that much more devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad Things is about Tristan and Danika, and their train wreck of a love story. This series can be read as a standalone, or with the Up in the Air series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad Things is a full length novel, at roughly 105,000 words.&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>My name is Gwen Frost, and I go to Mythos Academy; a school of myths, magic and warrior whiz kids, where even the lowliest geek knows how to chop off somebody's head with a sword and Logan Quinn, the hottest Spartan guy in school, also happens to be the deadliest. But lately, things have been weird, even for Mythos. First, mean girl Jasmine Ashton was murdered in the Library of Antiquities. Then, someone stole the Bowl of Tears, a magical artifact that can be used to bring about the second Chaos War. You know, death, destruction and lots of other bad, bad things. Freaky stuff like this goes on all the time at Mythos, but I'm determined to find out who killed Jasmine and why; especially since I should have been the one who died...</description>

I'm the most feared assassin in the South — when I'm not busy at the Pork Pit cooking up the best barbecue in Ashland. As a Stone elemental, I can hear everything from the whispers of the gravel beneath my feet to the vibrations of the soaring Appalachian Mountains above me. My Ice magic also comes in handy for making the occasional knife. But I don't use my powers on the job unless I absolutely have to. Call it professional pride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now that a ruthless Air elemental has double-crossed me and killed my handler, I'm out for revenge. And I'll exterminate anyone who gets in my way — good or bad. I may look hot, but I'm still one of the bad guys. Which is why I'm in trouble, since irresistibly rugged Detective Donovan Caine has agreed to help me. The last thing this coldhearted killer needs when I'm battling a magic more powerful than my own is a sexy distraction...especially when Donovan wants me dead just as much as the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Tras diez años de exilio, Falquián regresa a Elenia para reanudar sus obligaciones como caballero Pandion y paladín de la reina. Sin embargo, su joven reina, Ehlana, sufre una fatal enfermedad, supuestamente la misma que llevó a la tumba al rey Aldreas, su padre. Permanece con vida gracias al poderoso hechizo invocado por Sephrenia, la mujer de edad indefinida que inicia a los Pandion en los secretos de la magia. Ehlana está sentada en su trono, petrificada dentro de un bloque de cristal y abocada a la muerte, a menos que alguien encuentre un remedio antes de que transcurra un año.</description>

  <description>Love is hottest in the darkness before dawn.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Elissande Edgerton is a desperate woman, a virtual prisoner in the home of her tyrannical uncle. Only through marriage can she claim the freedom she craves. But how to catch the perfect man?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Vere is used to baiting irresistible traps. As a secret agent for the government, he’s tracked down some of the most devious criminals in London, all the while maintaining his cover as one of Society’s most harmless—and idiotic—bachelors. But nothing can prepare him for the scandal of being ensnared by Elissande.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced into a marriage of convenience, Elissande and Vere are each about to discover that they’re not the only one with a hidden agenda. With seduction their only weapon—and a dark secret from the past endangering both their lives—can they learn to trust each other even as they surrender to a passion that won’t be denied?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Note: Original cover edition for ASIN# B006XHT9RE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Parker is a vampire with a gift so strong and substantial that she is invited to partake in a test for a place in the Grand High Master Vampire’s private army. She finds that not only has the army never included a woman, but it has never included a Sventé vampire; a breed that is regarded by the super strong Pagori breed and the hypnotically beautiful Keja breed to be too tame and human-like. Most refuse to take her seriously, especially a Pagori commander named Jared who she craves in spite of herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Grand High Master, however, sees her potential and offers her the position of Jared’s co-commander to help train the newest squad in time for the impending attack on his home. Sam has to demonstrate to Jared and the squad of chauvinists why it is incredibly foolish to underestimate a wilful, temperamental, borderline-homicidal Sventé female. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This novel contains an iron-willed female vampire with an energy whip, a sexist male vampire who is determined to have her, explicit vampy sex, and a romance story with real bite.</description>

  <description>When the Duke of Lexington meets the mysterious Baroness von Seidlitz-Hardenberg on a transatlantic liner, he is fascinated. She’s exactly what he’s been searching for—a beautiful woman who interests and entices him. He falls hard and fast—and soon proposes marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then she disappears without a trace…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For in reality, the “baroness” is Venetia Easterbrook—a proper young widow who had her own vengeful reasons for instigating an affair with the duke. But the plan has backfired. Venetia has fallen in love with the man she despised—and there’s no telling what might happen when she is finally unmasked…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck. I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former piano prodigy Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone learning about her past and to make the boy who took everything from her—her identity, her spirit, her will to live—pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh Bennett’s story is no secret:  every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left.  Now all he wants is be left alone and people allow it because when your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone except Nastya, the mysterious new girl at school who starts showing up and won’t go away until she’s insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But the more he gets to know her, the more of an enigma she becomes. As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets she’s been hiding—or if he even wants to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sea of Tranquility&lt;/em&gt; is a rich, intense, and brilliantly imagined story about a lonely boy, an emotionally fragile girl, and the miracle of second chances.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name...&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt; We do it in the dark. Under the sheets. With a penlight. We wear sunglasses and a baseball hat at the bookstore. We have a "special place" where we store them. Let's face it: Not many folks are willing to publicly admit they love romance novels. Meanwhile, romance continues to be the bestselling fiction genre. Ever. So what's with all the shame?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarah Wendell and Candy Tan -- the creators of the wildly popular blog Smart Bitches, Trashy Books -- have no shame! They look at the good, the bad, and the ugly in the world of romance novels and tackle the hard issues and questions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt; -- The heroine's irresistible Magic Hoo Hoo and the hero's untamable Wang of Mighty Lovin'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -- Sexual trends. Simultaneous orgasms. Hymens. And is anal really the new oral?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -- Romance novel cover requirements: man titty, camel toe, flowers, long hair, animals, and the O-face&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -- Are romance novels really candy-coated porn or vehicles by which we understand our sexual and gender politics? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;With insider advice for writing romances, fun games to discover your inner Viking warrior, and interviews with famous romance authors, &lt;em&gt;Beyond Heaving Bosoms&lt;/em&gt; shows that while some romance novels are silly -- maybe even tawdry -- they can also be intelligent, savvy, feminist, and fabulous, just like their readers!</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor&lt;/em&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Park&lt;/em&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds—smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When sweet revenge turns sour… Book two of a trilogy from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jenny Han and Siobhan Vivian.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lillia, Kat, and Mary had the perfect plan. Work together in secret to take down the people who wronged them. But things didn’t exactly go the way they’d hoped at the Homecoming Dance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not even close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now, it looks like they got away with it. All they have to do is move on and pick up the pieces, forget there ever was a pact. But it’s not easy, not when Reeve is still a total jerk and Rennie’s meaner than she ever was before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there’s sweet little Mary…she knows there’s something seriously wrong with her. If she can’t control her anger, she’s sure that someone will get hurt even worse than Reeve was. Mary understands now that it’s not just that Reeve bullied her—it’s that he made her love him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, burn for a burn. A broken heart for a broken heart. The girls are up to the task. They’ll make Reeve fall in love with Lillia and then they will crush him. It’s the only way he’ll learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems once a fire is lit, the only thing you can do is let it burn...</description>

  <description>Chase Grayson has never been interested in having a relationship that lasts longer than it takes for him and his date to get dressed again. But then he stumbles into a gray-eyed girl whose innocence pours off her, and everything changes. From the minute Harper opens her mouth to let him know just how much he disgusts her, he's hooked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a princess deserves a Prince Charming who can make her dreams come true. Not a guy who can turn her life into a nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All good intentions go out the window when Harper starts to fall for the guy Chase has come to view as a brother. He wanted to protect her by keeping her away, but he can't stand to see her with anyone else, and he'll do anything to make her his. But when it comes down to Harper choosing between the two, will Chase have the strength to step back from the girl who has become his whole world if it means she's happy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lines will be crossed. Friendships will be put to the test. And hearts will be shattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CAUTION: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT READ &lt;em&gt;TAKING CHANCES&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Catherine has spent her life being the perfect princess. She’s kept her hands clean, her head down, and most importantly—men at arm’s length. After all, most men are after only one thing, and for Cathy there’s a lot more at stake than her bed; she has to worry about the fate of an entire nation. But at the rate she’s going, Cathy is afraid she’ll give the Virgin Queen a run for her money. She is tired of waiting for someone good enough to come along. She has a plan, and it all hinges on seducing the one man who seems utterly unimpressed by all things royal. The one man she is tempted by more than any other . . .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When David arrives at the royal wedding of his friend, the newly ordained Duchess Samantha Rousseau, he expected to feel uncomfortable and out of his element, but he wasn’t prepared to be targeted by Prince Alex’s gorgeous younger sister. With Cathy’s giant blue eyes, killer figure, and sense of humor, it won’t take long before he gives in. But when he finds out just how innocent the crown princess really is, will he play the part of knight in shining armor or the dashing rogue?</description>

  <description>Ava McKenzie is a creature of habit. Life is passing her by and she has nothing to show for it. She’s had the same job since she started college, she orders the same dish every time she goes to her favorite restaurant, and only reads books from authors she knows. There is nothing new or surprising in her life… until her best friend marries a man from London. When her newlywed friend asks her to house-sit while she honeymoons, Ava jumps at the chance. She thinks this could be the very thing she needs to shake up her life. Ava throws herself head first into her new lifestyle; she wants to try everything, go everywhere, and never get stuck in a rut again. Of course, offing a man in a car garage hadn’t been one of the things on her list to try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owen Walker spends every day in a new place with a new case. As one of the most renowned assassins in the world, he has his choice of marks—and he’s never failed in a mission. When a new hit takes him back to his hometown, he looks forward to spending time somewhere familiar. What he isn’t expecting is to help an attractive, confused American woman find out how she’s ended up on a hit man’s list. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Ava and Owen dodge bullets, will they be able to escape their undeniable attraction to each other? Or will all of that chemistry blow up in a shower of hot and dangerous sparks?</description>

  <description>The very first book from #OneVoice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A collection of fifty true victims and survivors stories from around the world with one common theme - domestic violence/abuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each one written from the heart and unedited so raw and full of the pain and feelings they convey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALL revenue from the profits will be donated to charities around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From emotional abuse to violence, rape and a victim on trial for 1st degree murder this book carries a STRONG WARNING - please purchase but read with caution as the subject matter between these pages is graphic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out why some of our survivors feel that Fifty Shades Of Grey and it's main character, Christian Grey is NOT a romantic love story but a tale of domestic abuse and violence that has destroyed one woman's life that we know of!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you see the signs but most of all do you recognise the signs that hide within this book?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I speak on behalf of all #OneVoice victims and survivors when I say that if one person walks away from a violent relationship after reading this book we will all be a happy bunch of survivors and know that we have helped just a little!</description>

  <description>Luce would die for Daniel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she has. Over and over again. Throughout time, Luce and Daniel have found each other, only to be painfully torn apart: Luce dead, Daniel left broken and alone. But perhaps it doesn't need to be that way....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luce is certain that something - or someone - in a past life can help her in her present one. So she begins the most important journey of &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; lifetime...going back eternities to witness firsthand her romances with Daniel...and finally unlock the key to making their love last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cam and the legions of angels and Outcasts are desperate to catch Luce, but none are as frantic as Daniel. He chases Luce through their shared pasts, terrified of what might happen if she rewrites history. Because their romance for the ages could go up in flames...forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweeping across centuries, PASSION is the third novel in the unforgettably epic FALLEN series.</description>

Daniel hides Luce at Shoreline, a school on the rocky California coast with unusually gifted students: Nephilim, the offspring of fallen angels and humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Shoreline, Luce learns what the Shadows are, and how she can use them as windows to her previous lives. Yet the more Luce learns, the more she suspects that Daniel hasn't told her everything. He's hiding something - something dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if Daniel's version of the past isn't actually true? What if Luce is really meant to be with someone else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second novel in the addictive FALLEN series...where love never dies.</description>

  <description>The last man she ever wanted to see…&lt;br&gt;Might be the only one who can save her…&lt;br&gt;Things are about to get HOT in the bayou!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evie Baker’s luck just ran out. Thanks to an ex-partner with organized crime ties, she’s lost her restaurant, her money, and nearly all her self-respect. Forced to return to her hometown and work as a shampoo girl in her mother’s salon, she doesn’t think her luck can get any worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then someone starts shooting at her, her sullen baby sister is suddenly missing, and the high school heartthrob who stole her heart—and her virginity—is the only man big enough and bad enough to help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Matt “Richie Rich” Girard can’t afford to get involved. He’s already on the verge of a court-martial after a Top Secret op gone wrong, and he’s been ordered to stay out of trouble while he’s home for his sister’s wedding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Evie’s ex-partner turns up dead, staying out of trouble is the last thing on Matt’s mind. He failed Evie once before; he can’t fail her again. If he’s going to protect her from a killer, and find her sister before time runs out, he’ll have to risk his entire future—and both their lives—to do it.</description>

  <description>Ruthie Knox’s Camelot series continues in this sizzling eBook original novel, featuring two headstrong souls who bump heads—and bodies—as temptation and lust bring nothing but delicious trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An accomplished lawyer and driven single mother, Ellen Callahan isn’t looking for any help. She’s doing just fine on her own. So Ellen’s more than a little peeved when her brother, an international pop star, hires a security guard to protect her from a prying press that will stop at nothing to dig up dirt on him. But when the tanned and toned Caleb Clark shows up at her door, Ellen might just have to plead the fifth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back home after a deployment in Iraq and looking for work as a civilian, Caleb signs on as Ellen’s bodyguard. After combat in the hot desert sun, this job should be a breeze. But guarding the willful beauty is harder than he imagined—and Caleb can’t resist the temptation to mix business with pleasure. With their desires growing more undeniable by the day, Ellen and Caleb give in to an evening of steamy passion. But will they ever be able to share more than just a one-night stand? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: How to Misbehave, Flirting with Disaster, and About Last Night.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What woman can resist a hot man in a hard hat? Beloved author Ruthie Knox kicks off her new Camelot series with this deliciously sexy original novella, in which a good girl learns how to misbehave . . . with all her heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As program director for the Camelot Community Center, Amber Clark knows how to keep her cool. That is, until a sudden tornado warning forces her to take shelter in a darkened basement with a hunk of man whose sex appeal green lights her every fantasy. With a voice that would melt chocolate, he asks her if she is okay. Now she's hot all over and wondering: How does a girl make a move?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building contractor Tony Mazzara was just looking to escape nature's fury. Instead, he finds himself all tangled up with lovely Amber. Sweet and sexy, she's ready to unleash her wild side. Their mutual desire reaches a fever pitch and creates a storm of its own--unexpected, powerful, and unforgettable. But is it bigger than Tony can handle? Can he let go of painful memories and let the force of this remarkable woman show him a future he never dreamed existed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: Along Came Trouble, Flirting with Disaster, and Room at the Inn.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>2013 RITA® Award finalist for Best Paranormal Romance of 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There exists a world beyond our own. It is a world of ancient magic and well-guarded secrets, a world of strict laws and harsh punishments for those who betray them, a world inhabited by the Ikati, a race of gifted people who are so much more than they first appear. Brought together by fate in this world of danger and beauty, two people with dark pasts will meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan is beautiful, smart, sexy…and about to die. Convicted of treason against her shape-shifting kin, she is given one last chance at redemption; discover the hidden lair of the enemy intent on destroying every one of her kind, or forfeit her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xander is ruthless, heartless, cold-blooded…and assigned to kill her if she fails in her task. Expecting to feel nothing but contempt for the traitor under his watch, the assassin accompanies Morgan on her search, but as the two race through the heart of Italy while the clock winds down to zero hour, he finds himself drawn into a dangerous web of desire as powerful as it is forbidden. Their passion will test everything they believe in, and endanger the future of the tribe itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sensual, edgy, and action-packed, Edge of Oblivion is a must-read for lovers of dark paranormal romance.</description>

  <description>Boy Nobody is the perennial new kid in school, the one few notice and nobody thinks much about.   He shows up in a new high school, in a new town, under a new name, makes few friends and doesn't stay long.   Just long enough for someone in his new friend's family to die -- of "natural causes." Mission accomplished, Boy Nobody disappears, and moves on to the next target.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his own parents died of not-so-natural causes at the age of eleven, Boy Nobody found himself under the control of The Program, a shadowy government organization that uses brainwashed kids as counter-espionage operatives.   But somewhere, deep inside Boy Nobody, is somebody: the boy he once was, the boy who wants normal things (like a real home, his parents back), a boy who wants out. And he just might want those things badly enough to sabotage The Program's next mission.</description>

  <description>The heroines of Lauren Willig's bestselling Pink Carnation series have engaged in espionage all over nineteenth-century Europe. In the sixth stand-alone volume, our fair English heroine travels to India, where she finds freedom—and risk—more exciting than she ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Everyone warned Miss Penelope Deveraux that her unruly behavior would land her in disgrace someday. She never imagined she's be whisked off to India to give the scandal of her hasty marriage time to die down. As Lady Frederick Staines waits, Penelope plunges into the treacherous waters of the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad, where no one is quite what they seem—even her husband. In a strange country, where elaborate court dress masks even more elaborate intrigues and a dangerous spy called the Marigold leaves venomous cobras as his calling card, there is only one person Penelope can trust...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Captain Alex Reid has better things to do than play nursemaid to a pair of aristocrats. Or so he thinks—until Lady Frederick Staines out-shoots, out-rides, and out-swims every man in the camp. She also has an uncanny ability to draw out the deadly plans of the Marigold and put herself in harm's way. With danger looming from local warlords, treacherous court officials, and French spies, Alex realizes that an alliance with Lady Staines just might be the only thing standing in the way of a plot designed to rock the very foundations of the British Empire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Filled with humor, raw emotion, a strong voice, and a brilliant dog named Sandy Koufax, When You Were Here explores the two most powerful forces known to man-death and love. Daisy Whitney brings her characters to life with a deft touch and resonating authenticity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danny's mother lost her five-year battle with cancer three weeks before his graduation-the one day that she was hanging on to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Danny is left alone, with only his memories, his dog, and his heart-breaking ex-girlfriend for company. He doesn't know how to figure out what to do with her estate, what to say for his Valedictorian speech, let alone how to live or be happy anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he gets a letter from his mom's property manager in Tokyo, where she had been going for treatment, it shows a side of his mother he never knew. So, with no other sense of direction, Danny travels to Tokyo to connect with his mother's memory and make sense of her final months, which seemed filled with more joy than Danny ever knew. There, among the cherry blossoms, temples, and crowds, and with the help of an almost-but-definitely-not Harajuku girl, he begins to see how it may not have been ancient magic or mystical treatment that kept his mother going. Perhaps, the secret of how to live lies in how she died.</description>

  <description>Juliet Lamprey is having the time of her life running her successful bakery, TART, when Gideon Carter comes back into her life. Returning home to help his grandfather run the family on the farm, Gideon is back for good. When they meet again, the spark between them is immediate, and it isn’t long before the former childhood friends play catch up in bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s not good news for local lawyer Cal Whaley. Though the sexually open but strictly monogamous Cal has loved Jules for a long time, he’s hardly ever taken it further than friendship. When he sees her start to fall for Gideon, he knows he has to make his move or risk losing her forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who would have anticipated that all three of them would connect on such an intimate level? The trio’s scalding liaisons take them places they’ve never dreamed. But such an intensely passionate and unusual relationship comes with equally as complicated emotions, and when Jules must suddenly leave town, she wonders if she’ll have a choice to make when she returns</description>

  <description>Unexpected Desire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been ten years since clean-cut, sexy-as-hell police officer Todd Keenan had a white-hot fling with Erin Brown, the provocative, wild rocker chick next door. Their power exchange in the bedroom got under his skin. But love wasn't in the cards just yet...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, life has thrown the pair back together. But picking up where they left off is tough, in light of a painful event from Erin's past. As Todd struggles to earn her trust, their relationship takes an unexpected and exciting turn when Todd's best friend, Ben, ends up in their bed--and all three are quite satisfied in this relationship without a name. As the passion they share transforms Erin, will it be enough to help her face the evil she thought she had left behind?</description>

  <description>The Winter Rose begins in London in the summer of 1900. It has been twelve years since a dark, murderous figure stalked the alleys and courts of Whitechapel. Time has passed, places and people have changed. And yet, East London is still poor, still brutal, still a shadow city to its western twin. &amp;amp; nbsp; Reformers, moved by the plight of the poor, work to better their conditions. Among them is an idealistic young woman named India Selwyn-Jones. Newly graduated from medical school, India joins a practice in Whitechapel and tends to its people. With the help of her influential fiancé Freddie Lytton, an up-and-coming Liberal MP she works to shut down the area's opium dens that destroy both body and soul. Her selfless activities better her patients' lives and bring her immense gratification, but unfortunately, they also bring her into direct conflict with East London's ruling crime lord, Sid Malone. Some of the characters from Donnelly's Booksense pick, &amp;amp; nbsp; The Tea Rose, including Fiona and Joe, appear as minor characters in The Winter Rose, and Malone, as readers of The Tea Rose will remember, is Fiona Finnegan's lost brother. Born Charlie Finnegan, he was separated from his family after his mother was murdered and survived the hard streets of East London by becoming a criminal. India is not good for business and at first, Malone wants her out. But against all odds, India and Sid fall in love. Different in nearly every way, they share one thing in common, they're both wounded souls.Their love is impossible and they know it, yet they cling to it desperately. Lytton, India's fiancé, will stop at nothing to marry India and gain her family's fortune. Fractious criminal underlings and rivals conspire against Sid. When Sid is finally betrayed by one of his own, he must flee London to save his life. Mistakenly thinking him dead, India, pregnant and desperate, marries Freddie to provide a father for hers and Sid's child. India and Sid must each make a terrible sacrifice. A sacrifice that will change them both forever. One that will lead them to other lives, and other places and perhaps one distant, bittersweet day back to each other.</description>

  <description>Cynthia Eden delves into the dark realms of the Others, where desires and dangerous games await the unsuspecting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assistant DA Erin Jerome has a secret. Make that two. One: She’s not entirely human–she’s Other, desperately trying to keep her supernatural strength under wraps. Two: she’s got a killer stalking her–an Other rogue set on “gifting” her bloody corpses, not to mention nights lying awake in terror. Small wonder she’s been having bad luck with men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the bounty hunter on her new case isn’t worried about any of that. Jude Donovan is a shapeshifter himself, and the new DA’s midnight hair and addictive scent tell him all he thinks he needs to know:  She’s gorgeous, she’s definitely not human, and she’s bringing out the animal in him in a really good way. He might have to track a psychotic Other stalker through half of Louisiana. But he might also get the chance to watch Erin’s wild side come out and play.</description>

  <description>For as long as Josephine Alibrandi can remember, it’s just been her, her mom, and her grandmother. Now it’s her final year at a wealthy Catholic high school. The nuns couldn’t be any stricter—but that doesn’t seem to stop all kinds of men from coming into her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught between the old-world values of her Italian grandmother, the nononsense wisdom of her mom, and the boys who continue to mystify her, Josephine is on the ride of her life. This will be the year she falls in love, the year she discovers the secrets of her family’s past—and the year she sets herself free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told with unmatched depth and humor, this novel—which swept the pool of Australian literary awards and became a major motion picture—is one to laugh through and cry with, to cherish and remember.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I am Friday Brown. I buried my mother. My grandfather buried a swimming pool. A boy who can’t speak has adopted me. A girl kissed me. I broke and entered. Now I’m fantasizing about a guy who’s a victim of crime and I am the criminal. I’m going nowhere and every minute I’m not moving, I’m being tail-gated by a curse that may or may not be real. They call me Friday. It has been foretold that on a Saturday I will drown…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friday, 17, flees memories of her mother, granddad,  and the family curse. She joins Silence in a street gang led by beautiful charismatic Arden, and escapes to a ghost town in the outback. In Murungal Creek, the town of never leaving, Friday faces the ghosts of her past. Sometimes you have to stay to finish what you started, and before you can find out who you are, you have to become someone you never meant to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I'm dreaming of the boy in the tree. I tell him stories. About the Jellicoe School and the Townies and the Cadets from a school in Sydney. I tell him about the war between us for territory. And I tell him about Hannah, who lives in the unfinished house by the river. Hannah, who is too young to be hiding away from the world. Hannah, who found me on the Jellicoe Road six years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor is leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School. She has to keep the upper hand in the territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs - the enigmatic leader of the cadets, and someone she thought she would never see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now Hannah, the person Taylor had come to rely on, has disappeared. Taylor's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago. She needs to find out more, but this means confronting her own story, making sense of her strange, recurring dream, and finding her mother - who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moving, joyous and brilliantly compelling new novel from the best-selling, multi-award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Looking for Alibrandi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Saving Francesca&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Emily Vargas has been taken captive. As part of his conditioning methods, her captor refuses to speak to her, knowing how much she craves human contact. He's far too beautiful to be a monster. Combined with his lack of violence toward her, this has her walking a fine line at the edge of sanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in the first person from Emily's perspective, &lt;em&gt;Comfort Food&lt;/em&gt; explores what happens when all expectations  of pleasure and pain are turned upside down, as whips become comfort and chicken soup becomes punishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCLAIMER: This is not a story about consensual BDSM. This is a story about “actual” slavery. If reading an erotic story without safewords makes you uncomfortable, this is not the book for you. This is a work of fiction, and the author does not endorse or condone any behavior done to another human being without their consent.</description>

  <description>It's customary for Gothic romance novels to include a mysterious girl locked in the attic. Hannah Smith just wishes she wasn't that girl. As a narcoleptic and the companion to an earl's daughter with a strange affliction of her own, Hannah knows she's lucky to have a roof over her head and food in her belly when so many orphans starve on the streets. Yet freedom is something Hannah longs for. She did not, however, want her freedom to arrive in the form of kidnapping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken by handsome Jack Langley to a place known as Freak House, she finds herself under the same roof as a mad scientist, his niece, a mute servant and Jack, a fire starter with a mysterious past. They assure Hannah she is not a prisoner and that they want to help her. The problem is, they think she's the earl's daughter. What will they do when they discover they took the wrong girl?</description>

Only one thing stands in her way: Elena, the consort who must be destroyed ...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This is an alternate-cover entry for ASIN B004FN1P1Q.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cameron Winters is a freak. Fortunately, no one but her family knows the truth... that Cameron can read minds. For years Cameron has hidden behind a facade of normalcy, warned that there are those who would do her harm. When gorgeous and mysterious Lewis Douglas arrives he destroys everything Cameron has ever believed and tempts her with possibilities of freedom. Determined to embrace her hidden talents, Cameron heads to a secret haven with Lewis; a place where she meets others like her, Mind Readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Cameron soon finds out some things are too good to be true. When the Mind Readers realize the extent of Cameron’s abilities, they want to use her powers for their own needs. Cameron suddenly finds herself involved in a war in which her idea of what is right and wrong is greatly tested. In the end she’ll be forced to make a choice that will not only threaten her relationship with Lewis, but her very life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE EPIC STORY OF &lt;em&gt;THE PASSAGE&lt;/em&gt; CONTINUES...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt;, the great viral plague had left a small group of survivors clinging to life amidst a world transformed into a nightmare. In the second volume of this epic trilogy, this same group of survivors, led by the mysterious, charismatic Amy, go on the attack, leading an insurrection against the virals: the first offensives of the Second Viral War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To do this, they must infiltrate a dozen hives, each presided over by one of the original Twelve. Their secret weapon: Alicia, transformed at the end of book one into a half human, half viral—but whose side, in the end, is she really on?</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Maybe it was the Shenanigans gift certificate that put her over the edge. When children's librarian and self-professed nice girl Jane Jameson is fired by her beastly boss and handed twenty-five dollars in potato skins instead of a severance check, she goes on a bender that's sure to become Half Moon Hollow legend. On her way home, she's mistaken for a deer, shot, and left for dead. And thanks to the mysterious stranger she met while chugging neon-colored cocktails, she wakes up with a decidedly unladylike thirst for blood.  &lt;p&gt; Jane is now the latest recipient of a gift basket from the Newly Undead Welcoming Committee, and her life-after-lifestyle is taking some getting used to. Her recently deceased favorite aunt is now her ghostly roommate. She has to fake breathing and endure daytime hours to avoid coming out of the coffin to her family. She's forced to forgo her favorite down-home Southern cooking for bags of O negative. Her relationship with her sexy, mercurial vampire sire keeps running hot and cold. And if all that wasn't enough, it looks like someone in Half Moon Hollow is trying to frame her for a series of vampire murders. What's a nice undead girl to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Queen Victoria rules with an immortal fist. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The undead matriarch of a Britain where the Aristocracy is made up of werewolves and vampires, where goblins live underground and mothers know better than to let their children out after dark. A world where being nobility means being infected with the Plague (side-effects include undeath), Hysteria is the popular affliction of the day, and leeches are considered a delicacy. And a world where technology lives side by side with magic. The year is 2012 and Pax Britannia still reigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xandra Vardan is a member of the elite Royal Guard, and it is her duty to protect the Aristocracy. But when her sister goes missing, Xandra will set out on a path that undermines everything she believed in and uncover a conspiracy that threatens to topple the empire. And she is the key-the prize in a very dangerous struggle.</description>

  <description>After Kari breaks up with her date during Beginner's Night at Club Shadowlands, she's given the option to continue with an experienced dominant. Despite her steamy fantasies about BDSM, the inexperienced schoolteacher plans to simply observe. Yet under the unyielding hands of Master Dan, she not only participates, but gives him everything he asks for. There is nothing she can hide from him. Not her passion…or her love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still mourning the death of his wife, Master Dan avoids getting involved with women and he never takes a sub twice. But this modest little beginner is such a sweetie, one night is far from enough. As he plumbs her responses, taking her ever deeper into the world of BDSM, the gentle submissive begins to show him how barren his life has become and what a dark citadel he's made of his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During their three nights together, the teacher will learn to submit...can she teach the master to love?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Maddie Moore's whole life needs a makeover.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one fell swoop, Maddie loses her boyfriend (her decision) and her job (so &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; her decision). But rather than drowning her sorrows in bags of potato chips, Maddie leaves L.A. to claim the inheritance left by her free-spirited mother—a ramshackle inn nestled in the little coastal town of Lucky Harbor, Washington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting over won't be easy. Yet Maddie sees the potential for a new home and a new career—if only she can convince her two half-sisters to join her in the adventure. But convincing Tara and Chloe will be difficult because the inn needs a big makeover too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contractor Maddie hires is a tall, dark-haired hottie whose eyes—and mouth—are making it hard for her to remember that she's sworn off men. Even harder will be Maddie's struggles to overcome the past, though she's about to discover that there's no better place to call home than Lucky Harbor.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Kissing her best friend's brother never felt so right…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sela Sullivan is resolved to be the best maid of honor ever, even if it means tolerating the best man. Insufferable, too-handsome Luke Watters is not only the guy who humiliated her at a kissing booth in high school, but he also happens to be her best friend’s older brother. Positive he’s the same arrogant jock, Sela vows to focus on her duties and steer clear of the frustrating—and frustratingly tempting—Luke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a world-renowned extreme-sports photographer, Luke is used to undertaking life-risking adventures. But risking his heart for the beautiful Sela Sullivan, who clearly still hates him for his rejection all those years ago? He didn’t see that coming. Sela inspires a passion he’s never known, and the more time they spend together, the more he craves her. But can he prove to the maid of honor he’s become a man of honor?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Rebelling against her legacy as the MC's princess, Tru Tennyson escaped the ruthless, male-dominated culture of the Defiance motorcycle club. Three years later, her newfound freedom is ripped away, thanks to a massive hybrid storm that killed millions. Now, in the post-Chaos world of semi-darkness and near-total anarchy where gangs rule, she discovers the dangerous world of Defiance may be the one thing that can keep her safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tru is at the MC's mercy when she's dragged back to her former home … and to the only man she's ever pictured a future with. Caspar is the bastard son of the club's leader, her safe haven when life got rough — and her onetime lover the night she left. When Tru refuses to trade sex for power and be claimed by a rival club leader, she also dares to announce she wants Caspar instead, throwing the MC into turmoil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tru's brazen revolt could start a gang war and destroy the club from within. Now both Tru and the MC must wait for Caspar's response … and the inevitable fallout.</description>

  <description>Genre: Erotic Romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It started with a diary...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When author Samantha Crews purchases the contents of a storage unit, she has no idea that the antique desk inside holds an old diary that will change her life. But that’s exactly what happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Samantha reads through the yellowed journal and accompanying letters, she’s drawn into a sensual web woven by the erotic story of a love affair between a sheltered young woman and a jaded, scarred recluse. To Samantha’s dismay, the diary ends abruptly, with nothing resolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devastated by the parallels to her own life, she sets out on a quest to find out how the story ends. Will she discover that Colleen and Leo overcame the obstacles separating them to achieve a happily-ever-after? Or were the forces pulling at them too strong, their burgeoning love too fragile to survive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunset Motel, Book One, is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences only. It contains explicit descriptions of M/F sexual intimacy. Reader discretion is advised.</description>

  <description>Penemuel (Pen) fell from grace over a millennium ago, yet there are still times she questions her decision to follow her twin brother, Azael, to Hell. Now that the archangel Michael has returned, threatening Lucifer’s vie for the throne, she begins questioning everything she has always believed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Hell prepares for war - spreading a demonic virus and pilfering innocent souls to build an army - the lines separating the worlds blur. Fates erase and the future is left unwritten. Azael is determined that he and his sister will continue to serve as demons together, but for the first time in her life, Pen is not ruled by destiny. She has the freedom of choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With choice comes sacrifice, and Pen must decide which side she’s willing to risk everything fighting for: the light, or the dark.</description>

  <description>Walter Wangerin's profound fantasy concerns a time when the sun turned around the earth and the animals could speak, when Chauntecleer the Rooster ruled over a more or less peaceful kingdom. What the animals did not know was that they were the Keepers of Wyrm, monster of evil long imprisoned beneath the earth ... and Wyrm, sub terra, was breaking free.</description>

  <description>A magnificent epic of love, war and Russia from the international bestselling author of TULLY and ROAD TO PARADISE Leningrad 1941: the white nights of summer illuminate a city of fallen grandeur whose palaces and avenues speak of a different age, when Leningrad was known as St Petersburg. Two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha, share the same bed, living in one room with their brother and parents. The routine of their hard impoverished life is shattered on 22 June 1941 when Hitler invades Russia. For the Metanov family, for Leningrad and particularly for Tatiana, life will never be the same again. On that fateful day, Tatiana meets a brash young man named Alexander. The family suffers as Hitler's army advances on Leningrad, and the Russian winter closes in. With bombs falling and the city under siege, Tatiana and Alexander are drawn inexorably to each other, but theirs is a love that could tear Tatiana's family apart, and at its heart lies a secret that could mean death to anyone who hears it. Confronted on the one hand by Hitler's vast war machine, and on the other by a Soviet system determined to crush the human spirit, Tatiana and Alexander are pitted against the very tide of history, at a turning point in the century that made the modern world</description>

  <description>When reserved flight attendant Bianca gets one look at billionaire hotel owner James Cavendish, she loses all of her hard-won composure. For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions. But what tempts her like never before is the dominant pull he seems to have over her from the moment they meet, and the promise of pleasure, and pain, that she reads in his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn’t resist. I saw the dangerous and damaged soul inside–so much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I’d been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession…</description>

  <description>Most women wouldn't mind waking up to find six feet of perfectly-defined male muscle cooking for them. Then again, Anaya Bancroft isn't most women. She's the innkeeper and co-owner of Emerald Valley Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast and it's only pure desperation -- and a complete lack of ability in the kitchen -- that have her turning to her ex for help with the B&amp;amp;B's biggest event of the year. Devlin Levi may be a famous chef, but he broke Naya's heart once and she's not about to let him do it again. Devlin is welcome in her kitchen, but that's it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least, that was the plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devlin has a plan of his own, one that could change everything. He wants Naya to give him eight nights. Eight nights of unbridled passion, eight sexual fantasies explored and fulfilled, eight chances to prove they're made for each other. If, at the end of their time together, Naya still believes they can't make a relationship work, the two of them will part -- for good. It's a bargain Naya can't resist, even though she fears it will end in heartbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, a lot can happen in eight nights...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: light bondage.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Silver smoke winds around my torso, peeling away from my ribs and back, stealing the dark mist covering my hands and lower extremities...tattoos dissolving into demon flesh, coalescing into small dark bodies. My boys. The only friends I have in this world. Demons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a demon hunter. I am a demon. I am Hunter Kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By day, her tattoos are her armor. By night, they unwind from her body to take on forms of their own--demons of the flesh, turned into flesh. This is the only family demon hunter Maxine Kiss has ever-known. It's the only way to live, and the very way she'll die. For one day her demons will abandon her for her daughter to assure their own survival--leaving Maxine helpless against her enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But such is the way of Earth's last protector--the only one standing between humanity and the demons breaking out from behind the prison veil. It is a life lacking in love, reveling in death, until one moment--and one man-- changes everything...</description>

  <description>In a magical land ruled by ruthless Elven lords, the Fire Lord's son, Dominic Raikes, plays a deadly game to conceal his growing might from his malevolent father—until his arranged bride awakens in him passions he thought he had buried forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Cassandra has been raised in outward purity and innocence, while secretly being trained as an assassin. Her mission is to bring down the Elven Lord and his champion son. But when she gets to court, she discovers that nothing is what it seems, least of all the man she married.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But beneath the gilded castles lies an unspeakable evil, greater than either Dominic or Cassandra had ever fathomed, and without each other they may not survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;View our feature on Meljean Brook’s &lt;em&gt;The Iron Duke&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; First in an all-new series where seductive danger and steampunk adventure abound in the gritty world of the Iron Seas. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After the Iron Duke freed England from Horde control, he instantly became a national hero. Now Rhys Trahaearn has built a merchant empire on the power-and fear-of his name. And when a dead body is dropped from an airship onto his doorstep, bringing Detective Inspector Mina Wentworth into his dangerous world, he intends to make her his next possession.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But when Mina uncovers the victim's identity, she stumbles upon a conspiracy that threatens the lives of everyone in England. To save them, Mina and Rhys must race across zombie-infested wastelands and treacherous oceans-and Mina discovers the danger is not only to her countrymen, as she finds herself tempted to give up everything to the Iron Duke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>It is the year 2059. Several major world cities are under the control of a security force called Scion. Paige Mahoney works in the criminal underworld of Scion London, part of a secret cell known as the Seven Seals. The work she does is unusual: scouting for information by breaking into others’ minds. Paige is a dreamwalker, a rare kind of clairvoyant, and in this world, the voyants commit treason simply by breathing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Paige is captured and arrested, she encounters a power more sinister even than Scion. The voyant prison is a separate city—Oxford, erased from the map two centuries ago and now controlled by a powerful, otherworldly race. These creatures, the Rephaim, value the voyants highly—as soldiers in their army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paige is assigned to a Rephaite keeper, Warden, who will be in charge of her care and training. He is her master. Her natural enemy. But if she wants to regain her freedom, Paige will have to learn something of his mind and his own mysterious motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bone Season introduces a compelling heroine—a young woman learning to harness her powers in a world where everything has been taken from her. It also introduces an extraordinary young writer, with huge ambition and a teeming imagination. Samantha Shannon has created a bold new reality in this riveting debut.</description>

  <description>Song of Dragons, an epic fantasy trilogy, tells the story of Requiem -- a fallen, ancient land whose people could become dragons... and whose last survivors dream of flying again. With over 100,000 copies sold, the Song of Dragons novels have captivated readers around the world. Now you can read the entire trilogy in one collection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BOOK 1: BLOOD OF REQUIEM -- Requiem, a kingdom of men who could become dragons, lies in ruin. Its destroyer, the tyrant Dies Irae, leads his griffins on a hunt for survivors. Will Requiem's last children perish in the wilderness... or once more become dragons and fly to war?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BOOK 2: TEARS OF REQUIEM -- Dies Irae masters new servants: the nightshades, demons of shadow who fear no sword or arrow. They suck the souls from all who live, like a glutton sucking marrow from bones. Can Requiem's last children, a mere scattering of survivors, defeat them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BOOK 3: LIGHT OF REQUIEM -- The world lies in ruin. Forests smolder. The crows feast. From the ashes, Dies Irae raises new soldiers: monsters sewn together from dead body parts. As the undead army marches, Requiem's survivors muster what forces they can... and prepare for their last stand.</description>

  <description>Chava is a golem, a creature made of clay, brought to life by a disgraced rabbi who dabbles in dark Kabbalistic magic. When her master, the husband who commissioned her, dies at sea on the voyage from Poland, she is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York in 1899. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire, born in the ancient Syrian desert. Trapped in an old copper flask by a Bedouin wizard centuries ago, he is released accidentally by a tinsmith in a Lower Manhattan shop. Though he is no longer imprisoned, Ahmad is not entirely free – an unbreakable band of iron binds him to the physical world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Golem and the Jinni&lt;/em&gt; is their magical, unforgettable story; unlikely friends whose tenuous attachment challenges their opposing natures – until the night a terrifying incident drives them back into their separate worlds. But a powerful threat will soon bring Chava and Ahmad together again, challenging their existence and forcing them to make a fateful choice.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Tales of alpha angels...from four alpha authors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They soar through the night, unearthly creatures of legends and lore. Four masters of urban fantasy and paranormal romance explore the rapture of the heavens above, and the darkness below in four all-new stories of angels and guardians, and good and evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Angel's Wolf&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Nalini Singh — In the spellbinding universe of the Guild Hunters, a vampire becomes obsessed with the seductive angel who rules the Louisiana territory. But in her court, all is not what it appears to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alphas: Origins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Ilona Andrews — A woman is kidnapped into a world divided by a superhuman civil war. As the captive of an irresistibly dangerous male, she has two choices: submit and become a pawn, or take hold of her own destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nocturne&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Sharon Shinn — Accepting a position in a secluded and whispered-about mansion, a woman soon discovers the source of its mystery: the blind, tormented angel who lives there, and whose secrets could now destroy them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ascension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Meljean Brook — When vampires disappear from a community he's protecting, a world-weary Guardian doesn't know what evil he's hunting, but he'd rather hunt alone than accept help from his ex-lover and fellow Guardian, Radha. But Radha refuses to leave him, because she's determined not just to help him save the community...but to save him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The New York Times bestselling Kate Daniels novels have been hailed as “top-notch urban fantasy” (Monsters and Critics). Now, Ilona Andrews delves deeper into Kate’s world, and reveals its untold stories…&lt;br&gt;After being kicked out of the Order of the Knights of Merciful Aid, Andrea’s whole existence is in shambles. She tries to put herself back together by working for Cutting Edge, a small investigative firm owned by her best friend. When several shapeshifters working for Raphael Medrano—the male alpha of the Clan Bouda, and Andrea’s former lover—die unexpectedly at a dig site, Andrea is assigned to investigate. Now she must work with Raphael as her search for the killer leads into the secret underbelly of supernatural Atlanta. And dealing with her feelings for him might have to take a back seat to saving the world…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes a free bonus: a Kate Daniels novella, "Magic Gifts"</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?</description>

  <description>Camilla can set her watch by her hunky rocket-scientist neighbor who jogs past her window each day. She relishes each glimpse of his shirtless abs, and is dying to see more. But it's hard to connect with a man who doesn't seem to know she exists...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ivan feels at home in the lab, not in social situations. When he finally approaches his attractive neighbor, it's not for a date—he wants tutoring in how to behave at an important fundraiser. Ivan doesn't expect the chemistry between them to be quite so explosive, and is surprised when Cami actually accepts his proposal to embark on a series of "lessons."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cami soon discovers Ivan's schedule isn't the only thing he likes to be strict about—he needs to be charge in the bedroom as well. She's shocked at how much she comes to enjoy her submissive side, but wonders if a real relationship is in the equation...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the end of the world. Six students have taken cover in Cortege High but shelter is little comfort when the dead outside won’t stop pounding on the doors. One bite is all it takes to kill a person and bring them back as a monstrous version of their former self. To Sloane Price, that doesn’t sound so bad. Six months ago, &lt;em&gt;her &lt;/em&gt;world collapsed and since then, she’s failed to find a reason to keep going. Now seems like the perfect time to give up. As Sloane eagerly waits for the barricades to fall, she’s forced to witness the apocalypse through the eyes of five people who actually &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to live. But as the days crawl by, the motivations for survival change in startling ways and soon the group’s fate is determined less and less by what’s happening outside and more and more by the unpredictable and violent bids for life—&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;death—inside. When everything is gone, what do &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;hold on to?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This whole grim reaper thing should have come with a manual.&lt;br&gt;Or a diagram of some kind.&lt;br&gt;A flow chart would have been nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is a part-time private investigator and full-time grim reaper. Meaning, she sees dead people. Really. And it's her job to convince them to "go into the light." But when these very dead people have died under less than ideal circumstances (like murder), sometimes they want Charley to bring the bad guys to justice. Complicating matters are the intensely hot dreams she's been having about an entity who has been following her all her life...and it turns out he might not be dead after all. In fact, he might be something else entirely. But what does he want with Charley? And why can't she seem to resist him? And what does she have to lose by giving in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With scorching-hot tension and high-octane humor, &lt;em&gt;First Grave on the Right&lt;/em&gt; is your signpost to paranormal suspense of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For fans of Jennifer Chiaverini and Sarah Addison Allen, &lt;em&gt;The Wishing Thread&lt;/em&gt; is an enchanting novel about the bonds between sisters, the indelible pull of the past, and the transformational power of love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; The Van Ripper women have been the talk of Tarrytown, New York, for centuries. Some say they’re angels; some say they’re crooks. In their tumbledown “Stitchery,” not far from the stomping grounds of the legendary Headless Horseman, the Van Ripper sisters—Aubrey, Bitty, and Meggie—are said to knit people’s most ardent wishes into beautiful scarves and mittens, granting them health, success, or even a blossoming romance. But for the magic to work, sacrifices must be made—and no one knows that better than the Van Rippers.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; When the Stitchery matriarch, Mariah, dies, she leaves the yarn shop to her three nieces. Aubrey, shy and reliable, has dedicated her life to weaving spells for the community, though her sisters have long stayed away. Bitty, pragmatic and persistent, has always been skeptical of magic and wants her children to have a normal, nonmagical life. Meggie, restless and free-spirited, follows her own set of rules. Now, after Mariah’s death forces a reunion, the sisters must reassess the state of their lives even as they decide the fate of the Stitchery. But their relationships with one another—and their beliefs in magic—are put to the test. Will the threads hold?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes an exclusive conversation between Sarah Addison Allen and Lisa Van Allen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Look for special features inside. Join the Random House Reader’s Circle for author chats and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Gwyn Jacobs doesn’t believe in fairy tales. Ever since her ex-husband walked out, leaving her alone with three small children, Gwyn has been mother, father, and bread-winner all rolled into one. Her own scarred heart aside, she refuses to open up her children’s lives to the possibility of another heartbreak, and so she has an unbending policy of no dating and no unattached men in their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until her very own fairy tale falls into her lap...and the hero won’t take no for an answer.</description>

  <description>Confessions of Marie Antoinette, the riveting and sweeping final novel in Juliet Grey’s trilogy on the life of the legendary French queen, blends rich historical detail with searing drama, bringing to life the early years of the French Revolution and the doomed royal family’s final days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Versailles, 1789. As the burgeoning rebellion reaches the palace gates, Marie Antoinette finds her privileged and peaceful life swiftly upended by violence. Once her loyal subjects, the people of France now seek to overthrow the crown, placing the heirs of the Bourbon dynasty in mortal peril.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Displaced to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, the royal family is propelled into the heart of the Revolution. There, despite a few staunch allies, they are surrounded by cunning spies and vicious enemies. Yet despite the political and personal threats against her, Marie Antoinette remains above all a devoted wife and mother, standing steadfastly by her husband, Louis XVI, and protecting their young son and daughter. And though the queen and her family try to flee, and she secretly attempts to arrange their rescue from the clutches of the Revolution, they cannot outrun the dangers encircling them, or escape their shocking fate.</description>

  <description>In 1918, the world seems on the verge of apocalypse. Americans roam the streets in gauze masks to ward off the deadly Spanish influenza, and the government ships young men to the front lines of a brutal war, creating an atmosphere of fear and confusion. Sixteen-year-old Mary Shelley Black watches as desperate mourners flock to séances and spirit photographers for comfort, but she herself has never believed in ghosts. During her bleakest moment, however, she’s forced to rethink her entire way of looking at life and death, for her first love—a boy who died in battle—returns in spirit form. But what does he want from her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring haunting archival early-twentieth-century photographs, this is a tense, romantic story set in a past that is eerily like our own time.</description>

  <description>Beware of Long Lankin, that lives in the moss. . . .When Cora and her younger sister, Mimi, are sent to stay with their elderly aunt in the isolated village of Byers Guerdon, they receive a less than warm welcome. Auntie Ida is eccentric and rigid, and the girls are desperate to go back to London. But what they don't know is that their aunt's life was devastated the last time two young sisters were at Guerdon Hall, and she is determined to protect her nieces from an evil that has lain hidden for years. Along with Roger and Peter, two village boys, Cora must uncover the horrifying truth that has held Bryers Guerdon in its dark grip for centuries -- before it's too late for little Mimi. Riveting and intensely atmospheric, this stunning debut will hold readers in its spell long after the last page is turned.</description>

  <description>Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So did his father before him, until he was gruesomely murdered by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father's mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. They follow legends and local lore, destroy the murderous dead, and keep pesky things like the future and friends at bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Searching for a ghost the locals call Anna Dressed in Blood, Cas expects the usual: track, hunt, kill. What he finds instead is a girl entangled in curses and rage, a ghost like he's never faced before. She still wears the dress she wore on the day of her brutal murder in 1958: once white, now stained red and dripping with blood. Since her death, Anna has killed any and every person who has dared to step into the deserted Victorian she used to call home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet she spares Cas's life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;STRINGS is not suitable for slut shamers, uptight stone throwers, Holier-Than-Thou prudes, humorless virgins, persons with chronic neck or back pain, pearl-clutching bitties, those who disparage crude humor or vulgarity in their many forms, closed-minded people with sticks up their asses, or anyone under the age of 18. The vile, base language and shocking, unholy sexual acts contained herein are not condoned by anyone with a lick of sense and should certainly not be reproduced without proper training and protection. The potty-mouthed and perpetually horny "heroine" (the term is used loosely) of this book does not resemble a normal, well-adjusted, or remotely believable person in any way, shape, or form. The author acknowledges that the characters in this book are shallow and two-dimensional; the plot is both ridiculous and insipid. She makes no apologies for any of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Readers are strongly advised to wear latex gloves whilst reading to minimize contamination risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free-spirited musician Letty Dillinger adheres to a strict, “no strings attached” policy when it comes to men. After a wild night of unabashed sex in a fancy hotel room, she never expects to see the adventurous stud she dubs “Shades” again. When her all-girl rock trio books a tour at the last minute as the opening act for their archenemies, Letty’s shocked to discover she knows the competition’s new lead singer. Intimately. Shades is no longer a one-night stand. Now he’s the guy she has to one-up on stage every night for the sake of her career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing close quarters on a bus with her sexy nemesis and his bad-boy buddies puts Letty’s Golden Rule to the test. On this tour, guitar strings aren’t the only things being played. And when heartstrings are pulled too hard, they’re bound to snap sooner or later.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Groundling, Fennel, is Sightless. She's never been able to see her lush forest home, but she knows its secrets. She knows how the shadows shift when she passes under a canopy of trees. She knows how to hide in the cool, damp caves when the Scourge comes. She knows how devious and arrogant the Groundlings' tree-dwelling neighbors, the Lofties, can be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she's always known this day would come—the day she faces the Scourge alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sightless, like Fenn, are mysteriously protected from the Scourge, the gruesome creatures roaming the forests, reeking of festering flesh and consuming anything—and anyone—living. A Sightless Groundling must brave the Scourge and bring fresh water to the people of the forest. Today, that task becomes Fenn's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fenn will have a Lofty Keeper, Peree, as her companion. Everyone knows the Lofties wouldn’t hesitate to shoot an arrow through the back of an unsuspecting Groundling like Fenn, but Peree seems different. A boy with warm, rough hands who smells like summer, he is surprisingly kind and thoughtful. Although Fenn knows his people are treacherous, she finds herself wanting to trust him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their forest community teeters on the brink of war, Fenn and Peree must learn to work together to survive the Scourge and ensure their people’s survival. But when Fenn uncovers a secret that shatters her truths, she’s forced to decide who and what to protect—her people, her growing love for Peree, or the elusive dream of lasting peace in the forest.</description>

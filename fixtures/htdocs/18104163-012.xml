  <description>It's customary for Gothic romance novels to include a mysterious girl locked in the attic. Hannah Smith just wishes she wasn't that girl. As a narcoleptic and the companion to an earl's daughter with a strange affliction of her own, Hannah knows she's lucky to have a roof over her head and food in her belly when so many orphans starve on the streets. Yet freedom is something Hannah longs for. She did not, however, want her freedom to arrive in the form of kidnapping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken by handsome Jack Langley to a place known as Freak House, she finds herself under the same roof as a mad scientist, his niece, a mute servant and Jack, a fire starter with a mysterious past. They assure Hannah she is not a prisoner and that they want to help her. The problem is, they think she's the earl's daughter. What will they do when they discover they took the wrong girl?</description>

      <![CDATA[While I like the premise of this book, I’ve decided that it’s just not for me. My biggest issue was how much it was <em>telling</em> me and how little it was <em>showing</em> me. Because of this, I wasn’t as invested in the story or the characters as I would have liked. In addition, the writing was a bit...awkward...]]>

  <description>The best thing between Oliver Barrett and Mackenzie Williams is a fence. Ever since Oliver's new-neighbor gestures were met with unfriendly responses, he's decided to keep his distance. After all, he's in this seaside town to get his life on track again. That doesn't include working hard to get on Mackenzie's good side—no matter how intriguing she may be. His intentions are put to the test, however, when his dog becomes infatuated with hers. The two crafty canines do their best to break down the barriers between the properties. And where the dogs go…, well, the humans must follow! It doesn't take long for a powerful attraction to build between Oliver and Mackenzie. They soon discover that the worst of first impressions can lead to the best possible outcomes….</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;THE HOT NEW NAME IN PARANORMAL ROMANCE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nalini Singh dives into a world torn apart by a powerful race with phenomenal powers of the mind-and none of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world that denies emotions, where the ruling Psy punish any sign of desire, Sascha Duncan must conceal the feelings that brand her as flawed. To reveal them would be to sentence herself to the horror of "rehabilitation" - the complete psychic erasure of everything she ever was... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both human and animal, Lucas Hunter is a changeling hungry for the very sensations the Psy disdain. After centuries of uneasy coexistence, these two races are now on the verge of war over the brutal murders of several changeling women. Lucas is determined to find the Psy killer who butchered his packmate, and Sascha is his ticket into their closely guarded society. But he soon discovers that this ice-cold Psy is very capable of passion - and that the animal in him is fascinated by her. Caught between their conflicting worlds, Lucas and Sascha must remain bound to their identities - or sacrifice everything for a taste of darkest temptation...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Thomas Jones has come to Vegas to win yet another account for his marketing company. But when he sits across from beautiful and sensual Brianna Faulk to deliver his pitch, his desire to leave Vegas as quickly as possible is replaced by the need to get close to her. Yet she resists his&lt;br&gt;charm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brianna knows a date with Thomas could jeopardize her job, but he’s so maddening and insistent, she has a hard time denying him just one date. But that’s all it can be: one date. Because she has to protect her job and her secrets, even if it means giving up a chance at a life she never thought she’d have again.</description>

  <description>Hy Breasil is grimmer than it used to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the Architect closed the door, there were regular crossings, and a great war decimated both humans and Ferishers. The native fae who refused to treat with the invaders faded; their bodies withered and died, stranding them as hungry, angry spirits that haunt the countryside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That means there’s always trouble brewing in Dorstaad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Janus Mikani and Celeste Ritsuko work for the Criminal Investigation Department, keeping citizens safe from things that go bump in the night. He’s a hardboiled cynic with an uncanny sixth sense; she’s determined to justify her promotion as the first female detective in her division. Together, they’re trying to keep a black tide from drowning the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the second body surfaces, murdered with the same type of infernal device, the entire CID must face the truth. There’s a madman on the loose, twining magic and blood… and only Mikani and Ritsuko can unravel the intricate, lethal conspiracy before the Royale killer completes his macabre plan, unleashing old, forbidden magic on an unsuspecting populace. If the maniac succeeds, it could mean the end of everything…</description>

  <description>The year is 1881. Meet the Mackenzie family--rich, powerful, dangerous, eccentric. A lady couldn't be seen with them without ruin. Rumors surround them--of tragic violence, of their mistresses, of their dark appetites, of scandals that set England and Scotland abuzz. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The youngest brother, Ian, known as the Mad Mackenzie, spent most of his young life in an asylum, and everyone agrees he is decidedly odd. He's also hard and handsome and has a penchant for Ming pottery and beautiful women. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Ackerley, widow, has recently come into a fortune. She has decided that she wants no more drama in her life. She was raised in drama--an alcoholic father who drove them into the workhouse, a frail mother she had to nurse until her death, a fussy old lady she became constant companion to. No, she wants to take her money and find peace, to travel, to learn art, to sit back and fondly remember her brief but happy marriage to her late husband. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Ian Mackenzie decides he wants her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first of a new historical series.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meet Bobbie Faye Sumrall. This “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;titanium magnolia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;(Bookreporter.com)&lt;em&gt; from Louisiana&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;won’t take sass from no one! And she is determined to have herself a good day—even if she has to kill someone to get it…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;“Bobbie Faye is a hurricane-force heroine who makes this novel the perfect adventure yarn.”—&lt;em&gt;The Tampa Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bobbie Faye wakes up on the morning of the Lake Charles Contraband Days Festival, she’s looking forward to balloons, booze, and babies in pirate costumes. Instead, she discovers that her trailer’s flooded, her no-good brother’s been kidnapped, and the criminals are demanding her mom’s tiara as ransom.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;“An outrageous hoot.”&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;The New Orleans Times-Picayune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Bobbie Faye is committing (unintentional) bank robbery and (fully intentional) car jacking to retrieve her family heirloom. The one bright spot comes in the hard-muscled, impossibly sexy form of Trevor, the guy whose truck she just took hostage. Luckily, Bobbie Faye knows how to outsmart angry bears, drive a speedboat, and handle a gun. As for handling Trevor? No gun-shyness there. Now, if only that pesky state police detective, who also happens to be a pissed-off ex-boyfriend, would stay out of her way . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;“Hilarious, pitch perfect.”&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/em&gt;(starred review)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First published as "Bobbie Faye's Very (very, very, very) Bad Day."&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This is a stand alone novel that is an adult spin-off of the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/66252-lux"&gt;Lux Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You do not need to read a Lux book to read Obsession and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s arrogant, domineering, and... To. Die. For.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter is a ruthless killer. And the Department of Defense has him firmly in their grasp, which usually doesn’t chafe too badly because he gets to kill bad guys. Most of the time he enjoys his job. That is, until he’s saddled with something he’s never had to do before: protect a human from his mortal enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serena Cross didn’t believe her best friend when she claimed to have seen the son of a powerful senator turn into something... unnatural. Who would? But then she witnesses her friend’s murder at the hands of what can only be an alien, thrusting her into a world that will kill to protect their secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter stirs Serena’s temper and her lust despite their differences. Soon he’s doing the unthinkable—breaking the rules he’s lived by, going against the government to keep Serena safe. But are the aliens and the government the biggest threats to Serena’s life… or is it Hunter?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Earth, Fire, Air, Water – they have more power than you dream.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since her ex-boyfriend spread those lies about her, Becca Chandler is suddenly getting all the guys—all the ones she &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; want. Then she saves Chris Merrick from a beating in the school parking lot. Chris is different. &lt;em&gt;Way&lt;/em&gt; different: he can control water—just like his brothers can control fire, wind, and earth. They’re powerful. Dangerous. Marked for death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now that she knows the truth, so is Becca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secrets are hard to keep when your life’s at stake. When Hunter, the mysterious new kid around school, turns up with a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, Becca thinks she can trust him. But then Hunter goes head-to-head with Chris, and Becca wonders who’s hiding the most dangerous truth of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The storm is coming . . .&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The gripping &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller that is Game of Thrones for teens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In a land where magic has been forgotten but peace has reigned for centuries, a deadly unrest is simmering. Three kingdoms grapple for power—brutally transforming their subjects' lives in the process. Amidst betrayals, bargains, and battles, four young people find their fates forever intertwined:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleo: &lt;/strong&gt;A princess raised in luxury must embark on a rough and treacherous journey into enemy territory in search of a magic long thought extinct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonas:&lt;/strong&gt; Enraged at injustice, a rebel lashes out against the forces of oppression that have kept his country impoverished—and finds himself the leader of a people's revolution centuries in the making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucia:&lt;/strong&gt; A girl adopted at birth into a royal family discovers the truth about her past—and the supernatural legacy she is destined to wield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnus:&lt;/strong&gt; Bred for aggression and trained to conquer, a firstborn son begins to realize that the heart can be more lethal than the sword. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The only outcome that's certain is that kingdoms will fall. Who will emerge triumphant when all they know has collapsed?</description>

  <description>If you enjoy Elizabeth Peter’s Vicky Bliss series or Romancing the Stone, Elusive has the same mix of mystery, international travel, and light romance.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoe Hunter loves living on the edge. Free-spirited and spontaneous, she’s built a life stringing together various freelance gigs that keep her bank account barely in the black. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when her ex, Jack, goes missing along with several million dollars from his business and the FBI zeros in on her as a person of interest, Zoe’s life goes from delightfully unpredictable to downright frightening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plunged into a world of fake identities, deception, and murder, she’s afraid to trust anyone. Zoe impulsively skips town in a search for answers that takes her from Las Vegas to Italy, but instead of tracking down answers, she only uncovers more questions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who was Jack? Is he dead or did he fake his disappearance? And, what was he mixed up in—art theft, the mafia, espionage, or all three? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SERIES NOTES: On the Run Series &lt;br&gt;Book #1:  Elusive &lt;br&gt;Book #2:  Secretive</description>

  <description>"I'm lucky just to be alive."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva was never supposed to have survived this long. As the recessive soul, she should have faded away years ago. Instead, she lingers in the body she shares with her sister soul, Addie. When the government discovered the truth, they tried to “cure” the girls, but Eva and Addie escaped before the doctors could strip Eva’s soul away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now fugitives, Eva and Addie find shelter with a group of hybrids who run an underground resistance. Surrounded by others like them, the girls learn how to temporarily disappear to give each soul some much-needed privacy. Eva is thrilled at the chance to be alone with Ryan, the boy she’s falling for, but troubled by the growing chasm between her and Addie. Despite clashes over their shared body, both girls are eager to join the rebellion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet as they are drawn deeper into the escalating violence, they start to wonder: How far are they willing to go to fight for hybrid freedom? Faced with uncertainty and incredible danger, their answers may tear them apart forever.</description>

  <description>SECRETS…In the hidden world that exists beside our own, a mirror world of ancient magic and elegant deceptions, a world of people who are so much more than they first appear, a war is brewing. Most of these Gifted people—the Ikati, a savage, sensual race of lethal predators—are content to hide behind human smiles, disguising their splendor in order to survive. But others are discontent. And they will hide no longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BETRAYALS…Eliana lives for two things only: vengeance on the man who killed her father and seeing her father’s dream of living in the open with humans come to pass. But that dream is far too dangerous for The Hunt, a group of elite Ikati assassins with one objective: eliminate her before she can expose their secrets to the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SEDUCTION…Demetrius is haunted by the memory of the woman he once loved. He will risk everything to save her from the killers on her tail…and convince her, before the ancient walls between two worlds crumble, that only together can they defeat their real enemy, a brilliant, cunning traitor far more deadly than either of them can guess.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Using magic meant it used you back. Forget the fairy-tale, hocus-pocus, wave a wand and bling-o, sparkles and pixie dust crap. Magic, like booze, sex, and drugs, gave as good as it got.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything has a cost. And every act of magic exacts a price from its user - maybe a two-day migraine, or losing the memory of your first kiss. But some people want to use magic without paying, and they Offload the cost onto innocents. When that happens, it falls to a Hound to identify the spell's caster - and Allison Beckstrom's the best there is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daughter of a prominent Portland businessman, Allie would rather moonlight as a Hound than accept the family fortune - and the strings that come with it. But when she discovers a little boy dying from a magic Offload that has her father's signature all over it, Allie is thrown into the high-stakes world of corporate espionage and black magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Allie's out for the truth - and must call upon forces that will challenge everything she knows, change her in ways she could never imagine ... and make her capable of things that powerful people will do anything to control.</description>

  <description>Ree will face the darkest form of betrayal before the year is out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen year old Ree McKenna has three goals: get through high school, convince her crush she is more than his best friend’s little sister, and save money for college. Fate, though, has other plans for her. After the untimely death of her older brother, Ree is haunted by dreadful nightmares and terrifying visions. To make matters worse, Ree has started to suspect that something dangerous is stalking her from the shadows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A night full of frightening surprises leaves Ree with unsettling news. Gifted by the gods with unusual powers, she must devote herself to a battle that could very well lead to not only her death, but the demise of everyone she knows and loves. After all, Ree is the only mortal standing between the Earth and utter darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in Savannah, Ga, Mortal Obligation is the first book of The Dark Betrayal Trilogy.</description>

  <description>Violet Ambrose is grappling with two major issues: Jay Heaton and her morbid secret ability. While the sixteen-year-old is confused by her new feelings for her best friend since childhood, she is more disturbed by her "power" to sense dead bodies—or at least those that have been murdered. Since she was a little girl, she has felt the echoes that the dead leave behind in the world... and the imprints that attach to their killers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet has never considered her strange talent to be a gift; it mostly just led her to find the dead birds her cat had tired of playing with. But now that a serial killer has begun terrorizing her small town, and the echoes of the local girls he's claimed haunt her daily, she realizes she might be the only person who can stop him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his fierce protectiveness over her, Jay reluctantly agrees to help Violet on her quest to find the murderer—and Violet is unnerved to find herself hoping that Jay's intentions are much more than friendly. But even as she's falling intensely in love, Violet is getting closer and closer to discovering a killer... and becoming his prey herself.</description>

  <description>In the violent country of Ludania, the classes are strictly divided by the language they speak. The smallest transgression, like looking a member of a higher class in the eye while they are speaking their native tongue, results in immediate execution. Seventeen-year-old Charlaina has always been able to understand the languages of all classes, and she's spent her life trying to hide her secret. The only place she can really be free is the drug-fueled underground clubs where people go to shake off the oppressive rules of the world they live in. It's there that she meets a beautiful and mysterious boy named Max who speaks a language she's never heard before . . . and her secret is almost exposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie is intensely attracted to Max, even though she can't be sure where his real loyalties lie. As the emergency drills give way to real crisis and the violence escalates, it becomes clear that Charlie is the key to something much bigger: her country's only chance for freedom from the terrible power of a deadly regime.</description>

  <description>The girl who wouldn’t die. Hunting a killer who shouldn’t exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chicago 1931. Violent drifter Harper Curtis stumbles upon a house that hides a secret as shocking as his own twisted nature: it opens onto other times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper uses it to stalk his ‘shining girls’ across decades – and cut the fire out of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s the perfect killer. Unstoppable. Untraceable. Until one of his victims survives and turns the hunt around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chicago, 1992. Kirby Mazrachi’s determination to find the man who tried to kill her has taken over her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cops no longer return her calls. Her mother copes by writing morbid children’s books. Her only ally is Dan, the burnt-out ex-homicide reporter who covered her case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Kirby closes in on her would-be killer, what she finds is ... impossible. Murders scattered across the decades along with evidence that makes no sense. Meanwhile, Harper is closing in on her, too.</description>

  <description>Cassandra Palmer can see the future and communicate with spirits—talents that make her attractive to the dead and the undead. The ghosts of the dead aren’t usually dangerous; they just like to talk…a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The undead are another matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like any sensible girl, Cassie tries to avoid vampires. But when the bloodsucking mafioso she escaped three years ago finds Cassie again with vengeance on his mind, she’s forced to turn to the vampire Senate for protection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The undead senators won’t help her for nothing, and Cassie finds herself working with one of their most powerful members, a dangerously seductive master vampire—and the price he demands may be more than Cassie is willing to pay....&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Rose Zarelli has big plans for sophomore year—everything is going to be different. This year, she’s going to be the talented singer with the killer voice, the fabulous girl with the fashionista best friend, the brainiac who refuses to let Jamie Forta jerk her around...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...but if she’s not careful, she’s also going to be the sister who misses the signals, the daughter who can only think about her own pain, the “good girl” who finds herself in mid-scandal again (because no good deed goes unpunished) and possibly worst of all...the almost-girlfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When all else fails, stop looking for love and go find yourself.</description>

  <description>It's been several generations since a genetic experiment gone wrong caused the Reduction, decimating humanity and giving rise to a Luddite nobility who outlawed most technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elliot North has always known her place in this world. Four years ago Elliot refused to run away with her childhood sweetheart, the servant Kai, choosing duty to her family's estate over love. Since then the world has changed: a new class of Post-Reductionists is jumpstarting the wheel of progress, and Elliot's estate is foundering, forcing her to rent land to the mysterious Cloud Fleet, a group of shipbuilders that includes renowned explorer Captain Malakai Wentforth--an almost unrecognizable Kai. And while Elliot wonders if this could be their second chance, Kai seems determined to show Elliot exactly what she gave up when she let him go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Elliot soon discovers her old friend carries a secret--one that could change their society . . . or bring it to its knees. And again, she's faced with a choice: cling to what she's been raised to believe, or cast her lot with the only boy she's ever loved, even if she's lost him forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by Jane Austen's &lt;em&gt;Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;For Darkness Shows the Stars&lt;/em&gt; is a breathtaking romance about opening your mind to the future and your heart to the one person you know can break it.</description>

  <description>There's a girl who could throw herself head first into life and forge an unbreakable name, an identity that stands on its own without fathers or brothers or lovers who devour and shatter. &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;I'VE NEVER BEEN THAT GIRL.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sixteen-year-old Ophelia Castellan will never be just another girl at Elsinore Academy. Seeing ghosts is not a skill prized in future society wives. Even when she takes her pills, the bean sidhe beckon, reminding her of a promise to her dead mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in the wake of the Headmaster's sudden death, the whole academy is in turmoil, and Ophelia can no longer ignore the fae. Especially once she starts seeing the Headmaster's ghosts- two of them- on the school grounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the center of her crumbling world is Dane, the Headmaster's grieving son. He, too, understands the power of a promise to a parent- even a dead one. To him, Ophelia is the only person not tainted by deceit and hypocrisy, a mirror of his own broken soul. And to Ophelia, Dane quickly becomes everything. Yet even as she gives more of herself to him, Dane slips away. Consumed by suspicion, rage, and madness, he spirals towards his tragic fate- dragging Ophelia, and the rest of Elsinore, with him.&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;YOU KNOW HOW THIS STORY ENDS.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yet even in the face of certain death, Ophelia has a choice to make- and a promise to keep. She is not the girl others want her to be. But in Dot Hutchison's dark and sensuous debut novel, the name "Ophelia" is as deeply, painfully, tragically real as "Hamlet".</description>

  <description>When Kaylee Cavanaugh screams, someone dies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when teen pop star Eden croaks onstage and Kaylee doesn’t wail, she knows something is dead wrong. She can’t cry for someone who has no soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Kaylee needs right now is to be skipping school, breaking her dad’s ironclad curfew and putting her too-hot-to-be-real boyfriend’s loyalty to the test. But starry-eyed teens are trading their souls: a flickering lifetime of fame and fortune in exchange for eternity in the Netherworld—a consequence they can’t possibly understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaylee can’t let that happen, even if trying to save their souls means putting her own at risk...</description>

  <description>What if a woman who knows nothing about sports inherits a professional football team? The Windy City definitely isn't ready for Phoebe Somerville, the outrageous York knockout who’s taking over their home town team. And Phoebe is definitely not prepared for the Stars' head coach Dan Calebow, a sexist jock taskmaster with a one-track mind. This is the book that began it all. The Chicago Stars are about to take the field...and they’re not the only ones playing for keeps.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;SHE MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN HER PEOPLE AND HER FREEDOM...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xylara is the Daughter of the Warrior King, Xyron. With her father dead and her incompetent half-brother on the throne, the kingdom is in danger of falling to the warring Firelanders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before she was old enough for a marriage-of-alliance, Xylara was trained as a healer. She can't usurp her brother or negotiate a peace--but she can heal the brave ones injured in battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not only her countrymen are wounded, and Xylara's conscience won't let Firelander warriors die when she can do something to save them. She learns their language and their customs and tries to make them as comfortable as possible, despite their prisoner-of-war status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She never expects that these deeds, done in good faith, would lead to the handsome and mysterious Firelander Warlord demanding her in exchange for a cease-fire. Xylara knows must trade the life she has always known for the well-being of her people, and so she becomes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Warprize&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Once he had scorched the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had driven back overwhelming darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had loved with such passion, his name was legend...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAIREN SOUL&lt;br&gt;Long ago, in the magical holocaust known as the Mage Wars, the immortal Fey and their allies fought to defeat the grasping evil of the Elden Mages and their dark-gifted supporters. During those wars, in a fit of grief-induced madness caused by the death of his mate, Fey shapeshifter Rain Tairen Soul nearly destroyed the world in a blaze of tairen fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a thousand years later, a new threat calls him from the Fading Lands, back into the world that had cost him so dearly. Now an ancient, familiar evil is regaining its strength, and a new voice beckons him--more compelling, more seductive, more maddening than any before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the power of his most bitter enemy grows and ancient alliances crumble, the wildness in his blood will not be denied. The tairen must claim his truemate and embrace the destiny woven for him in the mists of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17732017.Dawn_of_Eden" title="Dawn of Eden"&gt;Dawn of Eden&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Julie Kagawa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before The Immortal Rules, there was the Red Lung, a relentless virus determined to take out all in its path. For Kylie, the miracle of her survival is also her burden-as a doctor at one of the clinics for the infected, she is forced to witness endless suffering. What's worse, strange things are happening to the remains of the dead, and by the time she befriends Ben Archer, she's beginning to wonder if a global pandemic is the least of her problems.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17805609.Thistle___Thorne" title="Thistle &amp;amp; Thorne"&gt;Thistle &amp;amp; Thorne&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Ann Aguirre&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a catastrophic spill turns the country into a vast chemical wasteland, those who could afford it retreated to fortresses, self-contained communities run by powerful corporations. But for Mari Thistle, life on the outside-in the Red Zone-is a constant struggle. To protect her family, Mari teams up with the mysterious Thorne Goodman. Together, they'll face an evil plot in both the underworld of the Red Zone and the society inside the fortresses that could destroy those on the outside...for good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sun Storm&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Karen Duvall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Daggot has been chasing storms since she was a child. But after the biggest solar flares in history nearly destroy the planet, she becomes a Kinetic, endowed by her exposure to extreme radiation with the power to sense coming storms-in the cosmos and beyond. And she's not the only one. Sarah believes the Kinetics are destined to join forces and halt the final onslaught of the sun. She'll vow to keep trying to convince the one missing link in their chain of defense, the enigmatic Ian Matthews, up until the world ends.</description>

  <description>Lost in a world full of monstrous fairies, a troubled sixteen year old has to find out who she is and why her memories were stolen before she is found by those who want her dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She takes the name "Memory" and knows she has just one goal - to find her way home, wherever that is. But this land is strange. No technology to be seen, and iron is banned, thanks to a pact the humans have with the magical creatures who share their pre-industrial era world. In her t-shirt and torn jeans, Memory knows she's different, even before she performs impossible magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by her past, chased by a dragon, wanted by the king and stalked by the strange, handsome savage that seems to know her, everyone is after Memory, and she suspects it's not just for her eye-catching outfit. Her forgotten past holds dangerous secrets that will challenge everything she believes and risk the lives of everyone she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Memory's Wake contains over 45 illustrations by the author and artist.</description>

  <description>The spine-tingling horror of Stephen King meets an eerie mystery worthy of Sara Shepard's Pretty Little Liars series in Kate Karyus Quinn's haunting debut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a cool autumn night, Annaliese Rose Gordon stumbled out of the woods and into a high school party. She was screaming. Drenched in blood. Then she vanished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, Annaliese is found wandering down a road hundreds of miles away. She doesn't know who she is. She doesn't know how she got there. She only knows one thing: She is not the real Annaliese Rose Gordon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Annaliese is haunted by strange visions and broken memories. Memories of a reckless, desperate wish . . . a bloody razor . . . and the faces of other girls who disappeared. Piece by piece, Annaliese's fractured memories come together to reveal a violent, endless cycle that she will never escape—unless she can unlock the twisted secrets of her past.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mila 2.0&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in an electrifying sci-fi thriller series about a teenage girl who discovers that she is an experiment in artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mila was never meant to learn the truth about her identity. She was a girl living with her mother in a small Minnesota town. She was supposed to forget her past—that she was built in a secret computer science lab and programmed to do things real people would never do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she has no choice but to run—from the dangerous operatives who want her terminated because she knows too much and from a mysterious group that wants to capture her alive and unlock her advanced technology. However, what Mila’s becoming is beyond anyone’s imagination, including her own, and it just might save her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mila 2.0&lt;/em&gt; is Debra Driza’s bold debut and the first book in a Bourne Identity-style trilogy that combines heart-pounding action with a riveting exploration of what it really means to be human. Fans of &lt;em&gt;I Am Number Four&lt;/em&gt; will love Mila for who she is and what she longs to be—and a cliffhanger ending will leave them breathlessly awaiting the sequel.</description>

  <description>Heart-stopping and electric, MILA 2.0: Origins: The Fire contains a short prequel story and an excerpt to MILA 2.0, the first book in a riveting Bourne Identity–style trilogy by Debra Driza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mila can't remember anything before the fire that took her father's life. It's normal to have some memory loss after traumatic events, but Mila doesn't remember if she's ever learned to ride a bike, or if she's ever been in love. Nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that she isn't supposed to remember—that she was built in a computer science lab and programmed to forget. Because if she remembers, she might discover her true identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is: If she relived the fire, what would she see?</description>

  <description>Complete in one breathtaking volume — Books One and Two of an unforgettable historical romance series by an exciting new author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were two Viking lords, the brothers Wolf and Dragon, bound both by blood and by a shared ambition to end the war with their lifelong enemies, the Saxons. They know that their only hope for peace is to persuade the Saxon Lord Hawk to unite his noble family with theirs — in a bond sealed forever by the sanctity of marriage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together these three men will strive to overcome centuries-old rivalries and hatred. Each will unite in marriage with an extraordinary woman who has her own special gift — and her own dreams of bringing about an end to war....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book One&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Dream of Me&lt;/strong&gt; we meet the Viking leader Wolf Hakonson as he embarks on a mission to kidnap the Lady Cymbra, a legendary beauty Wolf mistakenly believes is the cause of war. Instead he discovers that she is a gifted healer who will challenge him to confront his deepest yearnings — and together they will become soul mates who forge a future blessed by peace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book Two&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The drama continues in &lt;strong&gt;Believe in Me&lt;/strong&gt;, when the Saxon Lord Hawk, brother of Cymbra, seeks to strengthen the alliance by wedding a Norse noblewoman. But Lady Krysta arrives bearing many secrets — including her gift for seeing what others cannot. And as an unexpected love ignites, only Krysta can sense the looming danger that threatens the peace — and Hawk as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, discover Josie Litton....</description>

  <description>**New Adult featuring mature situations and sexual content - recommended for ages 18+**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad girl,Georgia King, is trying to survive after spiraling into a darkness that nearly took her life. With her college dreams on hold she's trying to get healthy--trying to still the craziness inside her.  She has no room for someone like Ben Lancaster and if he was smart he'd stay away. Because everyone knows Georgia is bad news--she ruins people--and if Ben isn't careful, he'll be next in line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Lancaster is a young, hot shot hockey player on his way to the top. Newly signed to the Philadelphia Flyers, he's living the dream. The girls. The money. The fame. He thought he had everything he wanted until he met Georgia. Suddenly he wants more--he wants her. He'll do whatever it takes to get her and Ben Lancaster always gets what he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the girl who's different from anyone he's ever known is hiding secrets. And as the dog days of summer pass, only time will tell if Georgia's secrets can be healed. Or if her bruised soul is strong enough to resist Ben Lancaster...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Ben Lancaster had just tattooed himself onto my soul and the thing about tattoos?  They’re painful to remove."--Georgia King.</description>

  <description>Mackenzie “Max” Miller has a problem. Her parents have arrived in town for a surprise visit, and if they see her dyed hair, tattoos, and piercings, they just might disown her. Even worse, they’re expecting to meet a nice, wholesome boyfriend, not a guy named Mace who has a neck tattoo and plays in a band. All her lies are about to come crashing down around her, but then she meets Cade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cade moved to Philadelphia to act and to leave his problems behind in Texas. So far though, he’s kept the problems and had very little opportunity to take the stage. When Max approaches him in a coffee shop with a crazy request to pretend to be her boyfriend, he agrees to play the part. But when Cade plays the role a little too well, they’re forced to keep the ruse going. And the more they fake the relationship, the more real it begins to feel.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Melissa de la Cruz and Michael Johnston comes this remarkable first book in a spellbinding new series about the dawn of a new kind of magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to New Vegas, a city once covered in bling, now blanketed in ice. Like much of the destroyed planet, the place knows only one temperature—freezing. But some things never change. The diamond in the ice desert is still a 24-hour hedonistic playground and nothing keeps the crowds away from the casino floors, never mind the rumors about sinister sorcery in its shadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of this city is Natasha Kestal, a young blackjack dealer looking for a way out. Like many, she's heard of a mythical land simply called “the Blue.” They say it’s a paradise, where the sun still shines and the waters are turquoise. More importantly, it’s a place where Nat won’t be persecuted, even if her darkest secret comes to light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But passage to the Blue is treacherous, if not impossible, and her only shot is to bet on a ragtag crew of mercenaries led by a cocky runner named Ryan Wesson to take her there. Danger and deceit await on every corner, even as Nat and Wes find themselves inexorably drawn to each other. But can true love survive the lies? Fiery hearts collide in this fantastic tale of the evil men do and the awesome power within us all.</description>

  <description>Twenty-one year old Kaitlin’s life is turned upside down when her estranged mother disappears, leaving her to take care of Sam and Neri, the brother and sister she hasn’t seen in three years. &lt;br&gt;In the final year of her degree, caring for a hormonal fifteen year old and an inquisitive five year old wasn’t exactly part of her plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things get even more complicated when the only job that will work with her new schedule happens to be as a receptionist in a high class adult establishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devon Walkerson is the detective assigned to Katherine Delancy’s disappearance. The last thing he expected was to fall in love with Kaitlin. Devon has been hurt before, and is reluctant to put himself out there again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devon’s hot and cold behaviour is driving Kaitlin insane. As much as she can’t resist him, Kaitlin can’t keep letting him into her heart until he figures out what he wants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Kaitlin struggles to come to terms with unresolved feelings toward her mother, reconnecting with Neri and Sam, and falling in love with a man who may or may not feel the same way she’ll discover just how far she will go for her family.</description>

  <description>Twenty year old Emma hasn’t left the house since she was attacked as a child. Now, with the impending release of her attacker from prison, Emma knows it’s more important than ever for her to regain control of her life. From her unrelenting nightmares, to her strained relationships, to her crippling agoraphobia, Emma feels as though her life is spiraling out of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her professor, Simon Anderson enters her life, Emma must deal with feelings she has never experienced before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though both she and Simon know their relationship is bordering on inappropriate, neither of them are able to ignore the intense chemistry that is quickly developing between them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What was supposed to keep her mind off the attack has left her more confused than ever. When there are so many reasons why you shouldn’t be together, is simply being in love really enough?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is book one in a two book series.</description>

  <description>The year is 1945. Claire Randall, a former combat nurse, is back from the war and reunited with her husband on a second honeymoon--when she walks through a standing stone in one of the ancient stone circles that dot the British Isles.  Suddenly she is a Sassenach--an "outlander"--in a Scotland torn by war and raiding Highland clans in the year of Our Lord...1743.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hurled back in time by forces she cannot understand, Claire is catapulted into intrigues and dangers that may threaten her life...and shatter her heart.  For here she meets James Fraser, a gallant young Scots warrior, and becomes a woman torn between fidelity and desire...and between two vastly different men in two irreconcilable lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fate has thrown two sworn enemies...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of all the hotel rooms rented by all the adulterous politicians in Chicago, female Assistant U.S. Attorney Cameron Lynde had to choose the one next to 1308, where some hot-and-heavy lovemaking ends with a death. And of all the FBI agents in Illinois, it had to be Special Agent Jack Pallas who gets assigned to this high-profile homicide. The same Jack Pallas who still blames Cameron for a botched crackdown three years ago—and for nearly ruining his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into each other's arms...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Work with Cameron Lynde? Are they kidding? Maybe, Jack thinks, this is some kind of welcome-back prank after his stint away from Chicago. But it's no joke; the pair is going to have to put their rocky past behind them and focus on the case at hand. That is, if they can cut back on the razor-sharp jibes—and smother the flame of their sizzling-hot sexual tension.</description>

  <description>Leader of the most powerful army in the heavens, Zacharel has been deemed nearly too dangerous, too ruthless&amp;amp;#151;and if he isn&amp;amp;#39;t careful, he&amp;amp;#39;ll lose his wings. But this warrior with a heart of ice will not be deterred from his missions at any cost&amp;amp;#133;until a vulnerable human tempts him with a carnal pleasure he&amp;amp;#39;s never known before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accused of a crime she did not commit, Annabelle Miller has spent four years in an institution for the criminally insane. Demons track her every move, and their king will stop at nothing to have her. Zacharel is her only hope for survival, but is the brutal angel with a touch as hot as hell her salvation&amp;amp;#151;or her ultimate damnation?</description>

  <description>Ella and Micha have survived tragedy and heartbreak. When they're together, anything seems possible. But now they are thousands of miles apart, and managing their long distance relationship will put their love to the test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ella is back at school, trying hard not worry so much about her future. But with her father in and out of rehab, she's having a hard time making it through the days. All she wants is Micha by her side, but she refuses to let her problems get in the way of his dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micha spends his days touring the country with his band, but deep down he knows something is missing. Being away from Ella is harder than he thought it would be. He wants her closer to him-needs her with him. But he won't ask her to leave college, just to be with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The few moments they do spend together are intense and passionate, but it only makes it more difficult when they have to part. They know they want to be together, but is wanting something enough to get them to their forever?</description>

  <description>The dark secret Kayden has kept hidden for years is out. Worse, he's facing charges for battery. The only way he stands a chance against the charges is if Callie speaks up, something he'll never ask her to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie knows Kayden is going back to his dark place and desperately wants to save him. But saving him means admitting her secrets aloud. Callie and Kayden are stronger than they think, especially when they're together. Together they move forward, face their demons, and finally start to heal from their traumatic pasts.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The fight for survival begins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An ancient prophecy warns of a girl destined to cause the extinction of the vampire race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when 17-year-old Axelia falls into a sacred well filled with blood and emerges a vampire, the immortal empire believes she is this legendary destroyer. Hunted by soldiers and mercenaries, Axelia and her reluctant ally, the vampire bladesmith Lucas, must battle to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How will she convince the empire that she is just an innocent teenager-turned bloodsucker and not a creature of destruction? And if she cannot, can a vampire who is afraid of bugs summon the courage to fight a nation of immortals?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“My plan: Get into the city. Get Nadia. Find a way out. Simple.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week ago, seventeen-year-old Lela Santos’s best friend, Nadia, killed herself. Today, thanks to a farewell ritual gone awry, Lela is standing in paradise, looking upon a vast gated city in the distance—hell. No one willingly walks through the Suicide Gates, into a place smothered in darkness and infested with depraved creatures. But Lela isn’t just anyone—she’s determined to save her best friend’s soul, even if it means sacrificing her eternal afterlife. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lela struggles to find Nadia, she’s captured by the Guards, enormous, not-quite-human creatures that patrol the dark city’s endless streets. Their all-too-human leader, Malachi, is unlike them in every way except one: his deadly efficiency. When he meets Lela, Malachi forms his own plan: get her out of the city, even if it means she must leave Nadia behind. Malachi knows something Lela doesn’t—the dark city isn’t the worst place Lela could end up, and he will stop at nothing to keep her from that fate.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;His powers - Inhuman...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His passion - Beyond immortal...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All her life, Ashlyn Darrow has been tormented by voices from the past. To end the nightmare, she has come to Budapest seeking help from men rumored to have supernatural abilities, not knowing she'll be swept into the arms of Maddox, their most dangerous member -- a man trapped in a hell of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither can resist the instant hunger than calms their torments... and ignites an irresistible passion. But every heated touch and burning kiss will edge them closer to destruction -- and a soul-shattering test of love...&lt;br&gt;Though they carry an eternal curse, the Lords of the Underworld are irresistibly seductive -- and unimaginably powerful...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Don’t miss this incredible new paranormal series from Gena Showalter!&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>A breathtaking new urban fantasy trilogy from the critically acclaimed, award winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Swan Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadows on the Moon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fifteen year old Mio Yamato furtively sneaks the katana - an ancestral Japanese sword - out of its hiding place in her parent's attic to help liven up her Christmas party costume, she has no idea of the darkness she is about to unleash on modern day London, or the family secrets that she is going to uncover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The paralysing paranoia that descends on her before she gets to her friend's party is her first clue. The vivid and terrifying visions that nearly get her killed are a pretty good warning too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The giant nine-tailed cat demon that comes after the sword and tries to rip her throat out? Overkill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seconds away from becoming kitty-food, Mio is saved by Shinobu, a mysterious warrior boy. But it's already too late. Mio has ruptured the veil between the mortal realm and the Underworld, and now the gods and monsters of ancient Japan stalk the streets of London, searching for her and the sword. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of her best friend Jack, a fox spirit named Hikaru - and the devoted protection of the betwitchingly familiar Shinobu - Mio attempts to discover the true nature of the sword and its connection to the Yamato family. Because if she doesn't learn how to control the katana's incredible powers, she's in danger of being overwhelmed by them. And if she can't keep the sword safe from the terrible creatures who want it for their own, she'll lose not only her own life... but the love of a lifetime.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Bluebeard fairy tale retold. . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When seventeen-year-old Sophia Petheram’s beloved father dies, she receives an unexpected letter. An invitation—on fine ivory paper, in bold black handwriting—from the mysterious Monsieur Bernard de Cressac, her godfather. With no money and fewer options, Sophie accepts, leaving her humble childhood home for the astonishingly lavish Wyndriven Abbey, in the heart of Mississippi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie has always longed for a comfortable life, and she finds herself both attracted to and shocked by the charm and easy manners of her overgenerous guardian. But as she begins to piece together the mystery of his past, it’s as if, thread by thread, a silken net is tightening around her. And as she gathers stories and catches whispers of his former wives—all with hair as red as her own—in the forgotten corners of the abbey, Sophie knows she’s trapped in the passion and danger of de Cressac’s intoxicating world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glowing strands of romance, mystery, and suspense are woven into this breathtaking debut—a thrilling retelling of the “Bluebeard” fairy tale.</description>

  <description>Fate isn’t something to mess with… and now, neither is Alex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex has always feared two things: losing herself in the Awakening and being placed on the Elixir. But love has always been stronger than Fate, and Aiden St. Delphi is willing to make war on the gods—and Alex herself—to bring her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gods have killed thousands and could destroy entire cities in their quest to stop Seth from taking Alex’s power and becoming the all-powerful God Killer. But breaking Alex’s connection to Seth isn’t the only problem. There are a few pesky little loopholes in the whole “an Apollyon can’t be killed” theory, and the only person who might know how to stop the destruction has been dead for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding their way past the barriers that guard the Underworld, searching for one soul among countless millions, and then somehow returning will be hard enough. Alex might be able to keep Seth from becoming the God Killer… or she might become the God Killer herself.</description>

  <description>Budding designer Lola Nolan doesn’t believe in fashion...she believes in costume. The more expressive the outfit--more sparkly, more fun, more wild--the better. But even though Lola’s style is outrageous, she’s a devoted daughter and friend with some big plans for the future. And everything is pretty perfect (right down to her hot rocker boyfriend) until the dreaded Bell twins, Calliope and Cricket, return to the neighborhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Cricket--a gifted inventor--steps out from his twin sister’s shadow and back into Lola’s life, she must finally reconcile a lifetime of feelings for the boy next door.</description>

  <description>Pleasure is their ultimate weapon . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Runa Wagner never meant to fall in love with the sexy stranger who seemed to know her every deepest desire. But she couldn't resist the unbelievable passion that burned between them, a passion that died when she discovered his betrayal and found herself forever changed. Now, determined to make Shade pay for the transformation that haunts her, Runa searches for him, only to be taken prisoner by his darkest enemy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Seminus Demon with a love-curse that threatens him with eternal torment, Shade hoped he'd seen the last of Runa and her irresistible charm. But when he wakes up in a dank dungeon chained next to an enraged and mysteriously powerful Runa, he realizes that her effect on him is more dangerous than ever. As their captor casts a spell that bonds them as lifemates, Shade and Runa must fight for their lives and their hearts-or succumb to a madman's evil plans.</description>

  <description>Setting: New York City, present day&lt;p&gt; Sensuality rating: 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-powered attorney Victoria Kensington knows how to protect herself. In fact, she's spent her whole life protecting her vulnerable sister, Audrey, from their stern father's disapproval. But when Audrey, who's supposed to be painting in Venice, collapses at Victoria's feet in Central Park dressed only in a hospital gown, Victoria doesn't know what to think. And when Audrey disappears without a trace, Victoria will do anything to find out what has happened to her sister, even if it means allowing FBI associate Zachary Hamilton, the only man she's  ever loved, back into her life--and her heart. Even if it means finding out her father knows a whole lot more than he's letting on, Victoria will let nothing stop her from saving Audrey. But when Victoria has several close calls, Zach insists on sticking close to her, really close. Will Victoria find a second chance at having the kind of family she always wanted and maybe even a second chance at love? Andrea Kane creates a knockout of a suspenseful romance, one that will keep readers guessing until the very end.&lt;em&gt;--Alison Trinkle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>After six years of “angels” coming out of the sky and taking people from her town, 16-year-old Riley Carver has just about had it living with the constant fear. When one decides to terrorize her in her own backyard, it’s the final straw. She takes her mother’s shotgun and shoots the thing. So it’s dead. Or … not? In place of the creature she shot, is a guy. A really hot guy.  A really hot alive and breathing guy.  Oh, and he’s totally naked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not sure what to do, she drags his unconscious body to the tool shed and ties him up. After all, he’s an angel and they have tricks. When he regains consciousness she’s all set to interrogate him about why the angels come to her town, and how to get back her best friend (and almost boyfriend) Chris, who was taken the year before. But it turns out the naked guy in her shed is just as confused about everything as she is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He thinks it’s 1956.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the deep south, OUTCAST is a story of love, trust, and coming of age. It’s also a story about the supernatural, a girl with a strange sense of humor who’s got wicked aim, a greaser from the 50’s, and an army of misfits coming together for one purpose: To kick some serious angel ass.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Ender’s Game&lt;/em&gt; in an epic new series from award-winning author Rick Yancey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it’s the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth’s last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie’s only hope for rescuing her brother—or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.</description>

  <description>When nurse Tish Everett forced open the pesky but lovely locket she found at an estate sale, she had no idea she was answering the call of Criminy Stain, from the far off land of Sang. He’d cast a spell for her, but when she’s transported right to him, she’s not so sure she’s ready to be under the spell of another man. (It didn’t go so well last time with controlling, abusive, domineering Jeff.) If only Criminy wasn’t so deliciously rakish….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the inhabitants of Sang are Pinkies—human—and the other half are Bludmen, who in Tish’s world would be called vampires. But they don’t mess with any of the bat/coffin/no sunlight nonsense. They’re rather like you and me, just more fabulous, long living, and mostly indestructible. (They're also very good kissers.) But when the evil Mayor of Manchester (formerly Bludchester) redoubles his efforts to rid Sang of the Bludmen once and for all, stealing Tish’s locket in hopes of traveling back to her world himself for reinforcements, Criminy and Tish must battle ghosts, sea monsters, wayward submarines, a secret cabal, and thundering Bludmares to get the locket back and allow Tish to return home…but has she found love with Criminy? Could she stay in Sang forever?</description>

  <description>Done with being the world's biggest pushover, Haley decides that things are going to change starting with the aggravating neighbor who has too much charm and not enough restraint. What she didn't expect was to be sucked into his world, but Haley has a game plan and she won't let herself forget just what the bad boy next door is capable of.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Jason expected was for his little shy neighbor to go Rambo on him over some ruined flowers. After he decides to take her under his wing he can't help but notice that she fits very nicely in his life. Now the only thing left is to convince her that this is anything but a game.</description>

  <description>One of them is a bestselling Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist. The other is a winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor. Together, they form the League of Comic Justice, battling evildoers in the name of . . . Okay, we made that line up. What they do form is a writing team of pure comic genius, and they will have you laughing like idiots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Philip Horkman is a happy man-the owner of a pet store called The Wine Shop, and on Sundays a referee for kids' soccer. Jeffrey Peckerman is the sole sane person in a world filled with goddamned jerks and morons, and he's having a really bad day. The two of them are about to collide in a swiftly escalating series of events that will send them running for their lives, pursued by the police, soldiers, terrorists, subversives, bears, and a man dressed as Chuck E. Cheese.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where that all takes them you can't begin to guess, but the literary journey there is a masterpiece of inspiration and mayhem. But what else would you expect from the League of Comic Justice?</description>

  <description>Richly imagined, gothically spooky, and replete with the ingenious storytelling ability of a born novelist, &lt;em&gt;The Good Thief&lt;/em&gt; introduces one of the most appealing young heroes in contemporary fiction and ratifies Hannah Tinti as one of our most exciting new talents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twelve year-old Ren is missing his left hand. How it was lost is a mystery that Ren has been trying to solve for his entire life, as well as who his parents are, and why he was abandoned as an infant at Saint Anthony's Orphanage for boys. He longs for a family to call his own and is terrified of the day he will be sent alone into the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then a young man named Benjamin Nab appears, claiming to be Ren's long-lost brother, and his convincing tale of how Ren lost his hand and his parents persuades the monks at the orphanage to release the boy and to give Ren some hope. But is Benjamin really who he says he is? Journeying through a New England of whaling towns and meadowed farmlands, Ren is introduced to a vibrant world of hardscrabble adventure filled with outrageous scam artists, grave robbers, and petty thieves. If he stays, Ren becomes one of them. If he goes, he's lost once again. As Ren begins to find clues to his hidden parentage he comes to suspect that Benjamin not only holds the key to his future, but to his past as well.</description>

  <description>Anna is looking forward to her senior year in Atlanta, where she has a great job, a loyal best friend, and a crush on the verge of becoming more. Which is why she is less than thrilled about being shipped off to boarding school in Paris--until she meets Étienne St. Clair. Smart, charming, &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt;, Étienne has it all...including a serious girlfriend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the City of Light, wishes have a way of coming true. Will a year of romantic near-misses end with their long-awaited French kiss?</description>

  <description>Fed up with her wild behavior, sixteen-year-old Lex's parents ship her off to upstate New York to live with her Uncle Mort for the summer, hoping that a few months of dirty farm work will whip her back into shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But Uncle Mort's true occupation is much dirtier than shoveling manure. He's a Grim Reaper. And he's going to teach Lex the family business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She quickly assimilates into the peculiar world of Croak, a town populated by reapers who deliver souls from this life to the next. But Lex can't stop her desire for justice - or is it vengeance? - whenever she encounters a murder victim, craving to stop the attackers before they can strike again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she ditch Croak and go rogue with her reaper skills?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Imagine there is someone you like so much that just thinking about them leaves you desperate and reckless. You crave them in a way that's not rational, not right, and you're becoming somebody you don't recognise, and certainly don't respect, but you don't even care. And this person you like is unattainable. Except for one thing... He lives downstairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abbie has three obsessions. Art. The ocean. And Kane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But since Kane's been back, he's changed. There's a darkness shadowing him that only Abbie can see. And it wants her in its world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gothic story about the very dark things that feed the creative process.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Miranda wakes up alone on a park bench with no memory. In her panic, she releases a mysterious energy that incites pure terror in everyone around her. Except Peter, a boy who isn’t at all surprised by Miranda’s shocking ability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Left with no choice but to trust this stranger, Miranda discovers she was trained to be a weapon and is part of an elite force of genetically-altered teens who possess flawless combat skills and powers strong enough to destroy a city. But adjusting to her old life isn’t easy—especially with Noah, the boyfriend she can’t remember loving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Miranda uncovers a dark truth that sets her team on the run. Suddenly her past doesn’t seem to matter... when there may not be a future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan Krokos’ debut is a tour-de-force of non-stop action that will leave readers begging for the next book in this bold and powerful new series.</description>

  <description>"No secret stays hidden forever."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A phone call from an old friend sets Dr. Giovanni Vecchio back on the path of a mystery he'd abandoned years before. He never expected a young librarian could hold the key to the search, nor could he have expected the danger she would attract. Now he and Beatrice De Novo will follow a twisted maze that leads from the archives of a university library, through the fires of Renaissance Florence, and toward a confrontation they never could have predicted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Hidden Fire is a paranormal mystery/romance for adult readers. It is the first book in the Elemental Mysteries Series.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Strange Angels&lt;/em&gt;, Dru Anderson has what her grandmother called “the touch.” (Comes in handy when you’re traveling from town to town with your dad, hunting ghosts, suckers, wulfen, and the occasional zombie.) Then her dad turns up dead—but still walking—and Dru knows she’s next. Even worse, she’s got two guys hungry for her affections, and they’re not about to let the fiercely independent Dru go it alone. Will Dru discover just how special she really is before coming face-to-fang with whatever—or &lt;em&gt;whoever&lt;/em&gt;— is hunting her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Connor, Risa, and Lev are running for their lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Second Civil War was fought over reproductive rights.  The chilling resolution: Life is inviolable from the moment of conception until age thirteen.  Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, parents can have their child "unwound," whereby all of the child's organs are transplanted into different donors, so life doesn't technically end.  Connor is too difficult for his parents to control.  Risa, a ward of the state is not enough to be kept alive.  And Lev is a tithe, a child conceived and raised to be unwound.  Together, they may have a chance to escape and to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Sloane’s world, true feelings are forbidden, teen suicide is an epidemic, and the only solution is The Program.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sloane knows better than to cry in front of anyone. With suicide now an international epidemic, one outburst could land her in The Program, the only proven course of treatment. Sloane’s parents have already lost one child; Sloane knows they’ll do anything to keep her alive. She also knows that everyone who’s been through The Program returns as a blank slate. Because their depression is gone—but so are their memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under constant surveillance at home and at school, Sloane puts on a brave face and keeps her feelings buried as deep as she can. The only person Sloane can be herself with is James. He’s promised to keep them both safe and out of treatment, and Sloane knows their love is strong enough to withstand anything. But despite the promises they made to each other, it’s getting harder to hide the truth. They are both growing weaker. Depression is setting in. And The Program is coming for them.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I should not exist. But I do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva and Addie started out the same way as everyone else—two souls woven together in one body, taking turns controlling their movements as they learned how to walk, how to sing, how to dance. But as they grew, so did the worried whispers. Why aren’t they settling? Why isn’t one of them fading? The doctors ran tests, the neighbors shied away, and their parents begged for more time. Finally Addie was pronounced healthy and Eva was declared gone. Except, she wasn’t . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the past three years, Eva has clung to the remnants of her life. Only Addie knows she’s still there, trapped inside their body. Then one day, they discover there may be a way for Eva to move again. The risks are unimaginable-hybrids are considered a threat to society, so if they are caught, Addie and Eva will be locked away with the others. And yet . . . for a chance to smile, to twirl, to speak, Eva will do anything.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;One girl. One road. One chance to save what remains…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a plague of vampires is unleashed in the world, Katie is kicked out of her Amish community for her refusal to adhere to the new rules of survival. Now in exile, she enters an outside world of unspeakable violence with only her two “English” friends and a horse by her side. Together they seek answers and other survivors—but each sunset brings the threat of vampire attack, and each sunrise the threat of starvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet through this darkness come the shining ones: luminescent men and women with the power to deflect vampires and survive the night. But can these new people be trusted, and are they even people at all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this edge-of-your-seat thriller, it’s up to one Amish girl to save her family, her community, and the boy she loves . . . but what will she be asked to leave behind in return?</description>

  <description>After a bizarre accident, Ingrid Waverly is forced to leave London with her mother and younger sister, Gabby, trading a world full of fancy dresses and society events for the unfamiliar city of Paris.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Paris there are no grand balls or glittering parties, and, disturbingly, the house Ingrid’s twin brother, Grayson, found for them isn’t a house at all. It’s an abandoned abbey, its roof lined with stone gargoyles that could almost be mistaken for living, breathing creatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Grayson has gone missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one seems to know of his whereabouts but Luc, a devastatingly handsome servant at their new home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ingrid is sure her twin isn’t dead—she can feel it deep in her soul—but she knows he’s in grave danger. It will be up to her and Gabby to navigate the twisted path to Grayson, a path that will lead Ingrid on a discovery of dark secrets and otherworldly truths. And she’ll learn that once they are uncovered, they can never again be buried.</description>

  <description>THE DEPARTED HAVE ARRIVED.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world is not the way it was. The dead have risen, and the living are under attack. The powerful Church of Real Truth, in charge since the government fell, has sworn to reimburse citizens being harassed by the deceased. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consequently, there are many false claims of hauntings from those hoping to profit. Enter Chess Putnam, a fully-tattooed witch, freewheeling Debunker, and ghost hunter. She’s got a real talent for nailing human liars and banishing the wicked dead. But she’s keeping a dark secret from the Church: a little drug problem that’s landed her in hot and dangerous water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chess owes a lot of money to a murderous drug lord named Bump. And Bump wants immediate payback. All Chess has to do is dispatch a very nasty species of undead from an old airport. But the job involves black magic, human sacrifice, a nefarious demonic creature, and crossing swords with enough wicked energy to wipe out a city of souls. Toss in lust for a rival gang leader and a dangerous attraction to Bump’s ruthless enforcer, and Chess begins to wonder if the rush is really worth it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hell, yeah.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You can run from the grave, but you can’t hide…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half-vampire Cat Crawfield is now Special Agent Cat Crawfield, working for the government to rid the world of the rogue undead. She’s still using everything Bones, her sexy and dangerous ex, taught her, but when Cat is targeted for assassination, the only man who can help her is the vampire she left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being around Bones awakens all her emotions, from the adrenaline rush of slaying vamps side by side to the reckless passion that consumed them. But a price on her head—wanted: dead or half-alive—means her survival depends on teaming up with Bones. And no matter how hard Cat tries to keep things professional between them, she’ll find that desire lasts forever…and Bones won’t let her get away again. Original.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Anna Van Housen has a secret.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gifted illusionist, Anna assists her mother, the renowned medium Marguerite Van Housen, in her stage show and séances, easily navigating the underground world of magicians, mediums, and mentalists in 1920’s New York. As the illegitimate daughter of Harry Houdini—or so Marguerite claims—sleight of hand illusions have never been a challenge for Anna. The real trick is keeping her own gifts secret from her opportunistic mother. Because while Marguerite’s own powers may be a sham, Anna possesses a true ability to sense people’s feelings and foretell the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Anna’s powers intensify, she begins to experience frightening visions of her mother in peril, which leads her to explore the powers she’s tried so long to hide. And when a mysterious young man named Cole moves into the flat downstairs, introducing Anna to a secret society that studies people with gifts like hers, she is forced to confront her past and rethink everything she’s ever known. Is her mother truly in danger, or are Anna’s visions merely illusion? And could the great Houdini really be her father, or is it just another of Marguerite’s tricks?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Teri Brown comes a world bursting with magic, with romance, and the temptations of Jazz Age New York—and the story of a girl about to become the mistress of her own destiny.</description>

  <description>The king's scholar, the magus, believes he knows the site of an ancient treasure. To attain it for his king, he needs a skillful thief, and he selects Gen from the king's prison. The magus is interested only in the thief's abilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Gen is interested in is anyone's guess. Their journey toward the treasure is both dangerous and difficult, lightened only imperceptibly by the tales they tell of the old gods and goddesses.</description>

  <description>Love ties them together. Death can't tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best. Birthday. Ever. At least, it was supposed to be. With Logan's band playing a critical gig and Aura's plans for an intimate after-party, Aura knows it will be the most memorable night of her boyfriend's life. She never thought it would be his last. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan's sudden death leaves Aura devastated. He's gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, sort of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like everyone born after the Shift, Aura can see and hear ghosts. This mysterious ability has always been annoying, and Aura had wanted nothing more than to figure out why the Shift happened so she can undo it. But not with Logan's violet-hued spirit still hanging around. Because dead Logan is almost as real as ever. &lt;em&gt;Almost&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn't help that Aura's new friend Zachary is so understanding - and so very alive. His support means more to Aura than she cares to admit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Aura's relationships with the dead and the living grow ever complicated, so do her feelings for Logan and Zachary. Each holds a piece of Aura's heart - and clues to the secret of the Shift.</description>

  <description>Liam MacGregor is cursed. Haunted by the wails of fantastical Bean Sidhes and labeled a demon by the villagers of Dòchas, Liam has accepted that things will never get better for him—until a wealthy heiress named Annabel Leighton arrives on the island and Liam’s fate is changed forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Anna, Liam finally finds the happiness he has always been denied; but, the violent, mythical Otherworlders, who inhabit the island and the sea around it, have other plans. They make awager on the couple’s love, testing its strength through a series of cruel obstacles. But the tragedies draw Liam and Anna even closer.  Frustrated, the creatures put the couple through one last trial—and this time it’s not only their love that’s in danger of being destroyed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on Edgar Allan Poe’s chilling poem, "Annabel Lee," Mary Lindsey creates a frighteningly beautiful gothic novel that glorifies the power of true love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An un-putdownable thriller for fans of Uglies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a crash kills their father and leaves them orphaned, Zel knows she needs to protect her sister, Dyl. But before Zel has a plan, Dyl is taken by strangers using bizarre sensory weapons, and Zel finds herself in a safe house for teens who aren’t like any she’s ever seen before—teens who shouldn't even exist. Using broken-down technology, her new friends’ peculiar gifts, and her own grit, Zel must find a way to get her sister back from the kidnappers who think a powerful secret is encoded in Dyl’s DNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spiraling, intense, romantic story set in 2150—in a world of automatic cars, nightclubs with auditory ecstasy drugs, and guys with four arms—this is about the human genetic “mistakes” that society wants to forget, and the way that outcasts can turn out to be heroes.</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author tempts success in this stunning debut novel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; National bestselling author Eileen Wilks draws readers into a bold new world where the magical and mundane co-exist in an uneasy alliance--and a cop balanced on her own knife-edged struggle is their only hope against a cold-blooded killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily Yu is a San Diego police detective investigating a series of grisly murders that appear to be the work of a werewolf. To hunt down the killer, she must infiltrate the clans. Only one man can help her--a were named Rule Turner, a prince of the lupi, whose charismatic presence disturbs Lily. Rule has his own reasons for helping the investigation--reasons he doesn't want to share with Lily. Logic and honor demand she keep her distance, but the attraction between them is immediate and devastating-and beyond human reason. Now, in a race to fend off evil, Lily finds herself in uncharted territory, tested as never before, and at her back a man who she's not sure she can trust.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Aurora Lahey has figured out why everyone is trying to kill her...now she just needs to figure out how to stop them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between all the hell-hired assassins and secret society traitors hunting her down, Aurora didn’t think life as the Divinicus Nex could get worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, she's discovered some lethal powers of her own. Plus, six sexy, super-charged, demon-hunting Hex Boys are watching her back. And yes, Aurora doesn't mind running into the muscled arms of the hottest one—and he’s not complaining either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a seductive stranger with questionable motives delivers a deadly ultimatum, Aurora and the Hex Boys plunge into a do-or-die hunt for a legendary treasure that will either finally shift power in their favor or unleash hell on earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pursued by demons of mythical proportions, Aurora and the Hex Boys race deeper into a shadowy world of a centuries old mystery and brutal conspiracy, where no one and nothing is what it seems. Where love and betrayal go hand-in-hand, and trusting the wrong person not only breaks your heart, but can get you killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hiding her Divinicus Nex status from those chasing her, lying to her pretend-wish-he-were-real boyfriend, dodging demons, breaking into tombs, hunting her blackmailer, and passing Physics...Aurora could do that in her sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or more likely, die trying.</description>

  <description>Who is Jenna Fox? Seventeen-year-old Jenna has been told that is her name. She has just awoken from a coma, they tell her, and she is still recovering from a terrible accident in which she was involved a year ago. But what happened before that? Jenna doesn't remember her life. Or does she? And are the memories really hers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fascinating novel represents a stunning new direction for acclaimed author Mary Pearson. Set in a near future America, it takes readers on an unforgettable journey through questions of bio-medical ethics and the nature of humanity. Mary Pearson's vividly drawn characters and masterful writing soar to a new level of sophistication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/theadorationofjennafox/MaryEPearson" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/theadorationo...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>This Omnibus Edition collects the five Wool books into a single volume. It is for those who arrived late to the party and who wish to save a dollar or two while picking up the same stories in a single package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first Wool story was released as a standalone short in July of 2011. Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. My thanks go out to those reviewers who clamored for more. Without you, none of this would exist. Your demand created this as much as I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;First came the storms.&lt;br&gt;Then came the Fever.&lt;br&gt;And the Wall.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a string of devastating hurricanes and a severe outbreak of Delta Fever, the Gulf Coast has been quarantined. Years later, residents of the Outer States are under the assumption that life in the Delta is all but extinct… but in reality, a new primitive society has been born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fen de la Guerre is living with the O-Positive blood tribe in the Delta when they are ambushed. Left with her tribe leader’s newborn, Fen is determined to get the baby to a better life over the wall before her blood becomes tainted. Fen meets Daniel, a scientist from the Outer States who has snuck into the Delta illegally. Brought together by chance, kept together by danger, Fen and Daniel navigate the wasteland of Orleans. In the end, they are each other’s last hope for survival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sherri L. Smith delivers an expertly crafted story about a fierce heroine whose powerful voice and firm determination will stay with you long after you’ve turned the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;There are some things you can’t leave behind…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;A broken-down camper hidden deep in a national forest is the only home fifteen year-old Carey can remember. The trees keep guard over her threadbare existence, with the one bright spot being Carey’s younger sister, Jenessa, who depends on Carey for her very survival. All they have is each other, as their mentally ill mother comes and goes with greater frequency. Until that one fateful day their mother disappears for good, and two strangers arrive. Suddenly, the girls are taken from the woods and thrust into a bright and perplexing new world of high school, clothes and boys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Carey must face the truth of why her mother abducted her ten years ago, while haunted by a past that won’t let her go… a dark past that hides many a secret, including the reason Jenessa hasn’t spoken a word in over a year. Carey knows she must keep her sister close, and her secrets even closer, or risk watching her new life come crashing down.</description>

  <description>The year is 2113. In Jenna Strong's world, ACID—the most brutal controlling police force in history—rule supreme. No throwaway comment or whispered dissent goes unnoticed—or unpunished. And it was ACID agents who locked Jenna away for life, for a horrendous crime she struggles to remember. But Jenna's violent prison time has taught her how to survive by any means necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious rebel group breaks her out, she must use her strength, speed, and skill to stay one step ahead of ACID, and try to uncover the truth about what really happened on that terrible night two years ago. They have taken her life, her freedom, and her true memories away from her. How can she reclaim anything when she doesn't know who to trust?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong, gritty writing, irresistible psychological suspense, and action consume the novel as Jenna struggles to survive against the all-controlling ACID. &lt;em&gt;Seriously sinister stuff.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>What would you do if you were born to be a predator? Would you fight your natural instincts or give in to your nature? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden is a soul eater closing in on her awakening. Her family has convinced her that soon she will have to take a life in order to save her own. It’s a decision Eden doesn’t want to deal with even as her hunger for souls grows stronger every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To complicate her impossible position, new guy in school Noah Valois’ determination to befriend her puts Eden in touch with a humanity she’s never known. Addicted to his company, his friendship and affection, she becomes more and more terrified that giving into her hunger will mean losing him forever…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;… But when she discovers that Noah is not what he seems, his betrayal forces her to face two choices. One will offer her revenge and the destruction of a boy she loved. The other may offer her a life of eternal redemption…</description>

  <description>JUSTINE KNOWS SHE’S GOING TO DIE. ANY SECOND NOW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justine Jones has a secret. A hardcore hypochondriac, she’s convinced a blood vessel is about to burst in her brain. Then, out of the blue, a startlingly handsome man named Packard peers into Justine’s soul and invites her to join his private crime-fighting team. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime deal. With a little of Packard’s hands-on training, Justine can weaponize her neurosis, turning it outward on Midcity’s worst criminals, and finally get the freedom from fear she’s always craved. End of problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is it? In Midcity, a dashing police chief is fighting a unique breed of outlaw with more than human powers. And while Justine’s first missions, including one against a nymphomaniac husband-killer, are thrilling successes, there is more to Packard than meets the eye. Soon, while battling her attraction to two very different men, Justine is plunging deeper into a world of wizardry, eroticism, and cosmic secrets. With Packard’s help, Justine has freed herself from her madness—only to discover a reality more frightening than anyone’s worst fears.</description>

  <description>Tana lives in a world where walled cities called Coldtowns exist. In them, quarantined monsters and humans mingle in a decadently bloody mix of predator and prey. The only problem is, once you pass through Coldtown’s gates, you can never leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One morning, after a perfectly ordinary party, Tana wakes up surrounded by corpses. The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coldest Girl in Coldtown&lt;/em&gt; is a wholly original story of rage and revenge, of guilt and horror, and of love and loathing from bestselling and acclaimed author Holly Black.</description>

  <description>What would you change?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imprisoned in the heart of a secret military base, Em has nothing except the voice of the boy in the cell next door and the list of instructions she finds taped inside the drain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Em can complete the final instruction. She’s tried everything to prevent the creation of a time machine that will tear the world apart. She holds the proof: a list she has never seen before, written in her own hand. Each failed attempt in the past has led her to the same terrible present—imprisoned and tortured by a sadistic man called the doctor while war rages outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marina has loved her best friend, James, since they were children. A gorgeous, introverted science prodigy from one of America’s most famous families, James finally seems to be seeing Marina in a new way, too. But on one disastrous night, James’s life crumbles, and with it, Marina’s hopes for their future. Marina will protect James, no matter what. Even if it means opening her eyes to a truth so terrible that she may not survive it... at least, not as the girl she once was. Em and Marina are in a race against time that only one of them can win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Our Yesterdays&lt;/em&gt; is a wrenching, brilliantly plotted story of fierce love, unthinkable sacrifice, and the infinite implications of our every choice.</description>

  <description>Enter a world of fierce wolves, stunning magic and romance...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s bad enough feeling different among the human crowd, but feeling different among wolves? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one said returning to her pack would be easy, especially after ten years without them, but seventeen year old Caia Ribeiro is unprepared for the realities of the transition. Raised in a world where kids aren’t scared by bedtime tales of the bogeyman but by the real life threat of enemy supernaturals who might come creeping into their community to kill them in their sleep, Caia is used to the darkness; she’s used to the mystery and the intrigue of the ancient underworld war she’s bound to by chance of birth. What she’s having trouble with are pack members treating her with wary suspicion, the Elders tucking secrets behind their backs out of her sightline, and her young Alpha, Lucien, distracting her, with a dangerous attraction, from her decision to uncover the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the saying goes ‘the truth will out’ and when it does, Caia will only have so long to prepare herself before the war comes pounding on their door threatening to destroy the safe, secret lives of the wolves… and the girl they protect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YA Paranormal Romance recommended for ages 16 and up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moon Spell the Second Edition: Revised and Re-edited. Published 10th October 2011.

  <description>My name is Evie Claremont and this was to be the making of me–my freshman year of college. I’d been hoping that once I’d arrived on Crestwood’s campus, the nightmare that I’ve been having would go away. It hasn’t.&lt;br&gt;I may be an inexperienced seventeen-year-old, but I’m grounded…sane. I look for rational explanations to even the strangest circumstances. Since meeting sophomore Reed Wellington, however, nothing makes any sense. Whenever he’s near, I feel an attraction to him–a magnetic kind of force pulling me towards him. I know what you’re thinking…that sounds fairly awesome. Yeah, it would be…if he liked me, but Reed acts as if I’m the worst thing that has ever happened to Crestwood…or him. But get this, for some reason every time I turn around he’s there, barging into my life.&lt;br&gt;What is the secret that he’s keeping from me? I’m hoping that it’s anything but what I suspect: that he’s not exactly normal…and neither am I. So, maybe Crestwood won’t be the making of me, but it could be the breaking of me. I’ve been left to wonder if the dark future my dream is foretelling is…inescapable.</description>

  <description>They hear the most silent of footsteps.&lt;br&gt;They are faster than anything you've ever seen.&lt;br&gt;And They won't stop chasing you...until you are dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amy is watching TV when it happens, when the world is attacked by Them. These vile creatures are rapidly devouring mankind. Most of the population is overtaken, but Amy manages to escape—and even rescue “Baby,” a toddler left behind in the chaos. Marooned in Amy’s house, the girls do everything they can to survive—and avoid Them at all costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of hiding, they are miraculously rescued and taken to New Hope, a colony of survivors living in a former government research compound. While at first the colony seems like a dream with plenty of food, safety, and shelter, New Hope slowly reveals that it is far from ideal. And Amy soon realizes that unless things change, she’ll lose Baby—and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebellious, courageous, and tender, this unforgettable duo will have you on the edge of your seat as you tear through the pulse-pounding narrow escapes and horrifying twists of fate in this thrilling debut from author Demitria Lunetta.</description>

  <description>Five years ago, Wren Connolly was shot three times in the chest. After 178 minutes she came back as a Reboot: stronger, faster, able to heal, and less emotional. The longer Reboots are dead, the less human they are when they return. Wren 178 is the deadliest Reboot in the Republic of Texas. Now seventeen years old, she serves as a soldier for HARC (Human Advancement and Repopulation Corporation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wren’s favorite part of the job is training new Reboots, but her latest newbie is the worst she’s ever seen. As a 22, Callum Reyes is practically human. His reflexes are too slow, he’s always asking questions, and his ever-present smile is freaking her out. Yet there’s something about him she can’t ignore. When Callum refuses to follow an order, Wren is given one last chance to get him in line—or she’ll have to eliminate him. Wren has never disobeyed before and knows if she does, she’ll be eliminated, too. But she has also never felt as alive as she does around Callum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The perfect soldier is done taking orders.</description>

  <description>Think you know about gargoyles? The beautiful winged race disappeared eight hundred years ago. Their greatest enemies were the brutal harpies that people today mistake for gargoyles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like all gargoyles, Valor is protective by nature. When he wakes to find a human girl in trouble, his first impulse is to help her. But the greatest risk to MacKenzie’s safety is himself. One scratch from the poisonous barbs on his knuckes and she’ll be lost to him forever.</description>

  <description>By way of a staggering deception, Karou has taken control of the chimaera rebellion and is intent on steering its course away from dead-end vengeance. The future rests on her, if there can even be a future for the chimaera in war-ravaged Eretz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common enemy, common cause.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jael's brutal seraph army trespasses into the human world, the unthinkable becomes essential, and Karou and Akiva must ally their enemy armies against the threat. It is a twisted version of their long-ago dream, and they begin to hope that it might forge a way forward for their people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And, perhaps, for themselves. Toward a new way of living, and maybe even love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are bigger threats than Jael in the offing. A vicious queen is hunting Akiva, and, in the skies of Eretz ... something is happening. Massive stains are spreading like bruises from horizon to horizon; the great winged stormhunters are gathering as if summoned, ceaselessly circling, and a deep sense of wrong pervades the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;What power can bruise the sky?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the streets of Rome to the caves of the Kirin and beyond, humans, chimaera and seraphim will fight, strive, love, and die in an epic theater that transcends good and evil, right and wrong, friend and enemy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the very barriers of space and time, what do gods and monsters dream of? And does anything else matter?</description>

  <description>The Bastion was humanity's last hope against the fearsome undead creatures known as the Inferi Scourge. A fortified city with a high wall, surrounded by lush land rich with all the resources needed to survive, protected by high mountain summits, and a massive gate to secure the only pass into the valley, the Bastion became the last stronghold of the living on earth. But one fateful day, the gate failed and the Inferi Scourge destroyed the human settlements outside the walls and trapped the survivors inside the city. Now decades later, the last remaining humans are struggling to survive in a dying city as resources and hope dwindle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vanguard Maria Martinez has lived her whole life within the towering walls of steel. She yearns for a life away from the overcrowded streets, rolling blackouts, and food shortages, but there is no hope for anyone as long as the Inferi Scourge howl outside the high walls. Her only refuge from the daily grind is in the arms of her lover, Dwayne Reichardt, an officer in the Bastion Constabulary. Both are highly-decorated veterans of the last disastrous push against the Inferi Scourge. Their secret affair is her only happiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day Maria is summoned to meet with a mysterious representative from the Science Warfare Division and is offered the opportunity to finally destroy the Inferi Scourge in the valley and close the gate. The rewards of success are great, but she will have to sacrifice everything, possibly even her life, to accomplish the ultimate goal of securing the future of humanity and saving it from extinction.</description>

  <description>Rose Drayton lives on the Edge, between the world of the Broken (where people drive cars, shop at Wal-Mart, and magic is a fairy tale) and the Weird (where blueblood aristocrats rule, changelings roam, and the strength of your magic can change your destiny). Only Edgers like Rose can easily travel from one world to the next, but they never truly belong in either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose thought if she practiced her magic, she could build a better life for herself. But things didn’t turn out how she planned, and now she works a minimum wage, off the books job in the Broken just to survive. Then Declan Camarine, a blueblood noble straight out of the deepest part of the Weird, comes into her life, determined to have her (and her power).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a terrible danger invades the Edge from the Weird, a flood of creatures hungry for magic, Declan and Rose must work together to destroy them—or they’ll devour the Edge and everyone in it.</description>

  <description>Kiersten White, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Paranormalcy&lt;/em&gt;, is back with &lt;em&gt;The Chaos of Stars&lt;/em&gt;—an enchanting novel set in Egypt and San Diego that captures the magic of first love and the eternally complicated truth about family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isadora's family is seriously screwed up—which comes with the territory when you're the human daughter of the ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris. Isadora is tired of living with crazy relatives who think she's only worthy of a passing glance—so when she gets the chance to move to California with her brother, she jumps on it. But her new life comes with plenty of its own dramatic—and dangerous—complications . . . and Isadora quickly learns there's no such thing as a clean break from family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending Ally Carter's humor and the romance of Cynthia Hand's &lt;em&gt;Unearthly, The Chaos of Stars&lt;/em&gt; takes readers on an unforgettable journey halfway across the world and back, and proves there's no place like home.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;FEAR THE HEAT...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When eighteen year old Ari Johnson is transported from her bedroom into the chilling realm of Mount Qaf - home to the terrifying and mercurial Jinn - she learns a truth that rocks her very world. Suddenly her anxiety over college and her broken friendship with Charlie seem like small change compared to the war she now finds herself stuck in the middle of. Her unease isn’t lessened any by the hot guardian, Jai, who won’t stop following her around everywhere - a Jinn whose loyalty Ari hates to question but must. She has no idea who she can trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the truth burns through her life in its determination to turn it to ashes, Ari will have to battle with ancient deadly creatures, epic family drama and heart-wrenching romantic entanglements.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land. She finds starting new is not easy while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. She can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka. But as her power grows, Alina slips deeper into the Darkling’s game of forbidden magic, and farther away from Mal. Somehow, she will have to choose between her country, her power, and the love she always thought would guide her--or risk losing everything to the oncoming storm.</description>

  <description>Kami Glass loves someone she’s never met . . . a boy she’s talked to in her head ever since she was born. She wasn’t silent about her imaginary friend during her childhood, and is thus a bit of an outsider in her sleepy English town of Sorry-in-the-Vale. Still, Kami hasn’t suffered too much from not fitting in. She has a best friend, runs the school newspaper, and is only occasionally caught talking to herself. Her life is in order, just the way she likes it, despite the voice in her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that changes when the Lynburns return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lynburn family has owned the spectacular and sinister manor that overlooks Sorry-in-the-Vale for centuries. The mysterious twin sisters who abandoned their ancestral home a generation ago are back, along with their teenage sons, Jared and Ash, one of whom is eerily familiar to Kami. Kami is not one to shy away from the unknown—in fact, she’s determined to find answers for all the questions Sorry-in-the-Vale is suddenly posing. Who is responsible for the bloody deeds in the depths of the woods? What is her own mother hiding? And now that her imaginary friend has become a real boy, does she still love him? Does she hate him? Can she trust him?</description>

  <description>Finnikin of the Rock and his guardian, Sir Topher, have not been home to their beloved Lumatere for ten years.  Not since the dark days when the royal family was murdered and the kingdom put under a terrible curse.  But then Finnikin is summoned to meet Evanjalin, a young woman with an incredible claim: the heir to the throne of Lumatere, Prince Balthazar, is alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evanjalin is determined to return home and she is the only one who can lead them to the heir.  As they journey together, Finnikin is affected by her arrogance . . . and her hope.  He begins to believe he will see his childhood friend, Prince Balthazar, again.  And that their cursed people will be able to enter Lumatere and be reunited with those trapped inside.  He even believes he will find his imprisoned father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Evanjalin is not what she seems.  And the truth will test not only Finnikin's faith in her . . . but in himself.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;You stop fearing the devil when you’re holding his hand…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing much exciting rolls through Violet White’s sleepy, seaside town… until River West comes along. River rents the guest house behind Violet’s crumbling estate, and as eerie, grim things start to happen, Violet begins to wonder about the boy living in her backyard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is River just a crooked-smiling liar with pretty eyes and a mysterious past? Or could he be something more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet’s grandmother always warned her about the Devil, but she never said he could be a dark-haired boy who takes naps in the sun, who likes coffee, who kisses you in a cemetery... who makes you want to kiss back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet’s already so knee-deep in love, she can’t see straight. And that’s just how River likes it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blending faded decadence and the thrilling dread of gothic horror, April Genevieve Tucholke weaves a dreamy, twisting contemporary romance, as gorgeously told as it is terrifying—a debut to watch.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A novel about the end of days full of surprising beginnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The world is living in the shadow of oncoming disaster. An asteroid is set to strike the earth in just one week’s time; catastrophe is unavoidable. The question isn’t how to save the world—the question is, what to do with the time that's left? Against this stark backdrop, three island teens wrestle with intertwining stories of love, friendship and family—all with the ultimate stakes at hand. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alexandra Coutts's TUMBLE &amp;amp; FALL is a powerful story of courage, love, and hope at the end of the world. </description>

  <description>On the evening of Sofia Claremont's seventeenth birthday, she is sucked into a nightmare from which she cannot wake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quiet evening walk along a beach brings her face to face with a dangerous pale creature that craves much more than her blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is kidnapped to an island where the sun is eternally forbidden to shine.&lt;br&gt;An island uncharted by any map and ruled by the most powerful vampire coven on the planet. She wakes here as a slave, a captive in chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sofia's life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn when she is the one selected out of hundreds of girls to join the harem of Derek Novak, the dark royal Prince.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his addiction to power and obsessive thirst for her blood, Sofia soon realizes that the safest place on the island is within his quarters, and she must do all within her power to win him over if she is to survive even one more night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she succeed? ...or is she destined to the same fate that all other girls have met at the hands of the Novaks?</description>

  <description>INTENSE. DANGEROUS. ADDICTIVE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn’t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University’s Walking One-Night Stand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wants—and needs—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.</description>

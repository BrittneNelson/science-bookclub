  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of &lt;em&gt;I Am the Messenger,&lt;/em&gt; has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>From the author of the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life — and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Miri lives on a mountain where, for generations, her ancestors have quarried stone and lived a simple life. Then word comes that the king's priests have divined her small village the home of the future princess. In a year's time, the prince himself will come and choose his bride from among the girls of the village. The king's ministers set up an academy on the mountain, and every teenage girl must attend and learn how to become a princess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miri soon finds herself confronted with a harsh academy mistress, bitter competition among the girls, and her own conflicting desires to be chosen and win the heart of her childhood best friend. But when bandits seek out the academy to kidnap the future princess, Miri must rally the girls together and use a power unique to the mountain dwellers to save herself and her classmates.&lt;/div&gt;

      <![CDATA[I read the original Pinocchio back when I could still read in Italian.  This graphic novel continues with that story as Pinocchio battles vampires, with the help of his conveniently pointy nose.  I really thought this book kept the spirit of the original book--very dark and twisted humor, actually....]]>

  <description>Seemingly nothing in this world daunts the young criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl. In the fairy world, however, there is a small thing that has gotten under his skin on more than one occasion: Opal Koboi. In The Last Guardian, the evil pixie is wreaking havoc yet again. This time his arch rival has somehow reanimated dead fairy warriors who were buried in the grounds of Fowl Manor. Their spirits have possessed Artemis’s little brothers, making his siblings even more annoying than usual. The warriors don’t seem to realize that the battle they were fighting when they died—a battle against Artemis—is long over. Artemis has until sunrise to get the spirits to vacate his brothers and go back into the earth where they belong. Can he count on a certain LEPrecon fairy to join him in what could well be his last stand?</description>

  <description>I have two weeks. You’ll shoot me at the end no matter what I do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what you do to enemy agents. It’s what we do to enemy agents. But I look at all the dark and twisted roads ahead and cooperation is the easy way out. Possibly the only way out for a girl caught red-handed doing dirty work like mine — and I will do anything, anything, to avoid SS-Hauptsturmführer von Linden interrogating me again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has said that I can have as much paper as I need. All I have to do is cough up everything I can remember about the British War Effort. And I’m going to. But the story of how I came to be here starts with my friend Maddie. She is the pilot who flew me into France — an Allied Invasion of Two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are a sensational team.</description>

The main characters, 2 young women from Great Britain during World War II, are wonderfully, realistically written. I especially live the story of their friendship.

  <description>In the aftermath of his terrible war, Ender Wiggin disappeared, and a powerful voice arose: the Speaker for the Dead, who told of the true story of the Bugger War.&lt;br&gt;	Now long years later, a second alien race has been discovered, but again the aliens’ ways are strange and frightening…again, humans die. And it is only the Speaker for the Dead, who is also Ender Wiggin the Xenocide, who has the courage to confront the mystery…and the truth.</description>

  <description>In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Darkness never dies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took on the Fold, Alina must try to make a life with Mal in an unfamiliar land. She finds starting new is not easy while keeping her identity as the Sun Summoner a secret. She can’t outrun her past or her destiny for long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Darkling has emerged from the Shadow Fold with a terrifying new power and a dangerous plan that will test the very boundaries of the natural world. With the help of a notorious privateer, Alina returns to the country she abandoned, determined to fight the forces gathering against Ravka.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Zombies have infested a fallen America. A young girl named Temple is on the run. Haunted by her past and pursued by a killer, Temple is surrounded by death and danger, hoping to be set free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty-five years, civilization has survived in meager enclaves, guarded against a plague of the dead. Temple wanders this blighted landscape, keeping to herself and keeping her demons inside her heart. She can't remember a time before the zombies, but she does remember an old man who took her in and the younger brother she cared for until the tragedy that set her on a personal journey toward redemption. Moving back and forth between the insulated remnants of society and the brutal frontier beyond, Temple must decide where ultimately to make a home and find the salvation she seeks.</description>

  <description>The heroic son of Poseidon makes an action-packed comeback in the second must-read installment of Rick Riordan's amazing young readers series. Starring Percy Jackson, a "half blood" whose mother is human and whose father is the God of the Sea, Riordan's series combines cliffhanger adventure and Greek mythology lessons that results in true page-turners that get better with each installment. In this episode, The Sea of Monsters, Percy sets out to retrieve the Golden Fleece before his summer camp is destroyed, surpassing the first book's drama and setting the stage for more thrills to come.</description>

Kronos’s army is stronger than ever, and with every god and half-blood he recruits, the evil Titan’s power only grows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the Olympians struggle to contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his advance on New York City, where Mount Olympus stands virtually unguarded. Now it’s up to Percy Jackson and an army of young demigods to stop the Lord of Time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this momentous final book in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling series, the long-awaited prophecy surrounding Percy’s sixteenth birthday unfolds. And as the battle for Western civilization rages on the streets of Manhattan, Percy faces a terrifying suspicion that he may be fighting against his own fate.</description>

      <![CDATA[Woohoo!  I finally finished the series!<br /><br />I would actually give this book 4.5 stars, since it's not perfect, but it was such a great read.  I have to give kudos to Rick Riordan.  He managed to tie up all of his loose ends from other books as well as ones he created in this one.  <br /><br />Of course, this book fea...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"My gown suited me as well as I could ever hope, though I could not but envy the young ladies who would attract the honest compliments of the night. My bodice did not plunge as dramatically as some, and no man--no man I would ever want to meet, surely--could fit his hands round my waist. What I lacked in beauty I would simply have to earn with charm..."&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Benevolence is not your typical princess--and &lt;em&gt;Princess Ben&lt;/em&gt; is certainly not your typical fairy tale.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With her parents lost to assassins, Princess Ben ends up under the thumb of the conniving Queen Sophia. Starved and miserable, locked in the castle's highest tower, Ben stumbles upon a mysterious enchanted room. So begins her secret education in the magical arts:mastering an obstinate flying broomstick, furtively emptying the castle's pantries, setting her hair on fire... But Ben's private adventures are soon overwhelmed by a mortal threat to her kingdom. Can Ben save the country and herself from tyranny?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001). Unforgettable!&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark’s Eve,” Neeve said. “Either you’re his true love . . . or you killed him.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them—not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can’t entirely explain. He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she’s not so sure anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the Shiver trilogy and The Scorpio Races, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we’ve never been before.</description>

  <description>It happens at the start of every November: the Scorpio Races. Riders attempt to keep hold of their water horses long enough to make it to the finish line. Some riders live. Others die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At age nineteen, Sean Kendrick is the returning champion. He is a young man of few words, and if he has any fears, he keeps them buried deep, where no one else can see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puck Connolly is different. She never meant to ride in the Scorpio Races. But fate hasn’t given her much of a chance. So she enters the competition — the first girl ever to do so. She is in no way prepared for what is going to happen.</description>

  <description>Marcelo Sandoval hears music no one else can hear--part of the autism-like impairment no doctor has been able to identify--and he's always attended a special school where his differences have been protected. But the summer after his junior year, his father demands that Marcelo work in his law firm's mailroom in order to experience "the real world." There Marcelo meets Jasmine, his beautiful and surprising coworker, and  Wendell, the son of another partner in the firm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He learns about competition and jealousy, anger and desire. But it's a picture he finds in a file -- a picture of a girl with half a face -- that truly connects him with the real world:  its suffering, its injustice, and what he can do to fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminiscent of "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" in the intensity and purity of its voice, this extraordinary novel is a love story, a legal drama, and a celebration of the music each of us hears inside.</description>

      <![CDATA[I wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  I really enjoyed it.  The book starts out a little bit slow, introducing us to Marcelo and his unique problems--he has sort of a mild case of Asperger's Syndrome.  His father is a high-powered lawyer who wants Marcelo to be "normal" and functional in society.  So,...]]>

  <description>'His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.' With these words "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" draws to a close. And here, in this seventh and final book, Harry discovers what fate truly has in store for him as he inexorably makes his way to that final meeting with Voldemort. In this thrilling climax to the phenomenally bestselling series, J.K. Rowling will reveal all to her eagerly waiting readers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.  Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it.  District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Ender’s Game&lt;/em&gt; in an epic new series from award-winning author Rick Yancey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it’s the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth’s last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie’s only hope for rescuing her brother—or even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.</description>

  <description>From the privileged streets of modern Brooklyn to the heart of the French Revolution, Jennifer Donnelly, author of the award-winning novel &lt;em&gt;A Northern Light&lt;/em&gt;, artfully weaves two girls’ stories into one unforgettable account of life, loss, and enduring love. &lt;em&gt;Revolution&lt;/em&gt; spans centuries and vividly depicts the eternal struggles of the human heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BROOKLYN: Andi Alpers is on the edge. She’s angry at her father for leaving, angry at her mother for not being able to cope, and heartbroken by the loss of her younger brother, Truman. Rage and grief are destroying her. And she’s about to be expelled from Brooklyn Heights’ most prestigious private school when her father intervenes. Now Andi must accompany him to Paris for winter break.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;PARIS: Alexandrine Paradis lived over two centuries ago. She dreamed of making her mark on the Paris stage, but a fateful encounter with a doomed prince of France cast her in a tragic role she didn’t want—and couldn’t escape.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Two girls, two centuries apart. One never knowing the other. But when Andi finds Alexandrine’s diary, she recognizes something in her words and is moved to the point of obsession. There’s comfort and distraction for Andi in the journal’s antique pages—until, on a midnight journey through the catacombs of Paris, Alexandrine’s words transcend paper and time, and the past becomes suddenly, terrifyingly present.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>A phenomenal worldwide bestseller for over thirty years, Richard Adams's Watership Down is a timeless classic and one of the most beloved novels of all time. Set in England's Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale of adventure, courage and survival follows a band of rabbits on their flight from the intrusion of man and the certain destruction of their home. Led by a stouthearted pair of brothers, they journey forth from their native Sandleford Warren through the harrowing trials posed by predators and adversaries, to a mysterious promised land and a more perfect society.</description>

  <description>Four decades of peace have done little to ease the mistrust between humans and dragons in the kingdom of Goredd. Folding themselves into human shape, dragons attend court as ambassadors, and lend their rational, mathematical minds to universities as scholars and teachers. As the treaty's anniversary draws near, however, tensions are high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seraphina Dombegh has reason to fear both sides. An unusually gifted musician, she joins the court just as a member of the royal family is murdered—in suspiciously draconian fashion. Seraphina is drawn into the investigation, partnering with the captain of the Queen's Guard, the dangerously perceptive Prince Lucian Kiggs. While they begin to uncover hints of a sinister plot to destroy the peace, Seraphina struggles to protect her own secret, the secret behind her musical gift, one so terrible that its discovery could mean her very life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her exquisitely written fantasy debut, Rachel Hartman creates a rich, complex, and utterly original world. Seraphina's tortuous journey to self-acceptance is one readers will remember long after they've turned the final page.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is by far one of the best high fantasy novels I've read in years.  You would think that dragons had been done to death.  I admit rolling my eyes at the thought of reading about dragon kingdoms and all that.  But Hartman has created such an intricate and believable world, different from any I've...]]>

  <description>The war begins...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darrow is a Helldiver, one of a thousand men and women who live in the vast caves beneath the surface of Mars. Generations of Helldivers have spent their lives toiling to mine the precious elements that will allow the planet to be terraformed. Just knowing that one day people will be able to walk the surface of the planet is enough to justify their sacrifice. The Earth is dying, and Darrow and his people are the only hope humanity has left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the day Darrow learns that it is all a lie. Mars is habitable - and indeed has been inhabited for generations by a class of people calling themselves the Golds. The Golds regard Darrow and his fellows as slave labour, to be exploited and worked to death without a second thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of a mysterious group of rebels, Darrow disguises himself as a Gold and infiltrates their command school, intent on taking down his oppressors from the inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the command school is a battlefield. And Darrow isn't the only student with an agenda...</description>

  <description>Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a dark and dusty shop, a devil’s supply of human teeth grown dangerously low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious "errands", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful, haunted Akiva fixes fiery eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past. But will Karou live to regret learning the truth about herself?</description>

  <description>Fans of The Twilight Saga will be enthralled by this riveting story of Bree Tanner, a character first introduced in Eclipse, and the darker side of the newborn vampire world she inhabits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bree Tanner can barely remember life before she had uncannily powerful senses, superhuman reflexes, and unstoppable physical strength. Life before she had a relentless thirt for blood...life before she became a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Bree knows is that living with her fellow newborns has few certainties and even fewer rules: watch your back, don't draw attention to yourself, and above all, make it home by sunrise or die. What she doesn't know: her time as an immortal is quickly running out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Bree finds an unexpected friend in Diego, a newborn just as curious as Bree about their mysterious creator, whom they only know as &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. As they come to realize that the newborns are pawns in a game larger than anything they could have imagined, Bree and Diego must choose sides and decide whom to trust. But when everything you know about vampires is based on a lie, how do you find the truth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another irresistile combination of danger, mystery, and romance, Stephenie Meyer tells the devastating story of the newborn army as they prepare to close in on Bella Swan and the Cullens, following their encounter to its unforgettable conclusion.</description>

  <description>In this third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder and Captain Thorne are fugitives on the run, now with Scarlet and Wolf in tow. Together, they’re plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and her army. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their best hope lies with Cress, a girl imprisoned on a satellite since childhood who's only ever had her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, she’s just received orders from Levana to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is separated. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a high price. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai. Cress, Scarlet, and Cinder may not have signed up to save the world, but they may be the only hope the world has.</description>

  <description>Cinder, the cyborg mechanic, returns in the second thrilling installment of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles. She's trying to break out of prison--even though if she succeeds, she'll be the Commonwealth's most wanted fugitive. Halfway around the world, Scarlet Benoit's grandmother is missing. It turns out there are many things Scarlet doesn't know about her grandmother or the grave danger she has lived in her whole life. When Scarlet encounters Wolf, a street fighter who may have information as to her grandmother's whereabouts, she is loath to trust this stranger, but is inexplicably drawn to him, and he to her. As Scarlet and Wolf unravel one mystery, they encounter another when they meet Cinder.

      <![CDATA[Wow!  Just as intense as Cinder!  I love this series because it's way more sci-fi than fantasy, but with a fairy tale twist.  And the world Marissa Meyer created is so cool!  I can't wait for the next book!]]>

      <![CDATA[I loved, loved, LOVED this book! I could barely read it fast enough! I love the combination of science fiction, dystopian society, and fairy tale! There's a twist I saw coming a mile away, but there were enough surprises along the way to keep it exciting and entertaining. Great book! I can't wait...]]>

  <description>Paul Fisher sees the world from behind glasses so thick he looks like a bug-eyed alien. But he’s not so blind that he can’t see there are some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unusual things about his family’s new home in Tangerine County, Florida. Where else does a sinkhole swallow the local school, fire burn underground for years, and lightning strike at the same time every day? The chaos is compounded by constant harassment from his football–star brother, and adjusting to life in Tangerine isn’t easy for Paul—until he joins the soccer team at his middle school. With the help of his new teammates, Paul begins to discover what lies beneath the surface of his strange new hometown. And he also gains the courage to face up to some secrets his family has been keeping from him for far too long. In Tangerine, it seems, &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I am Outcast.&lt;br&gt;The kids behind me laugh so loud I know they're laughing about me. I can't help myself. I turn around. It's Rachel, surrounded by a bunch of kids wearing clothes from the Eastside Mall. Rachel Bruin, my ex-best friend. She stares at something above my left ear. Words climb up my throat. This was the girl who suffered through Brownies with me, who taught me how to swim, who understood about my parents, who didn't make fun of my bedroom. If there is anyone in the entire galaxy I am dying to tell what really happened, it's Rachel. My throat burns.&lt;br&gt;Her eyes meet mine for a second. "I hate you," she mouths silently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melinda Sordino's freshman year is off to a horrible start. She busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, and now her friends--and even strangers--all hate her. Months pass and things aren't getting better. She's a pariah. The lowest of the low. Avoided by everyone. But eventually, she'll reveal what happened at the party. And when she finally speaks the truth, everything will change.</description>

  <description>According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for "social") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.</description>

  <description>'R' is a zombie. He has no name, no memories and no pulse, but he has dreams. He is a little different from his fellow Dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amongst the ruins of an abandoned city, R meets a girl. Her name is Julie and she is the opposite of everything he knows - warm and bright and very much alive, she is a blast of colour in a dreary grey landscape. For reasons he can't understand, R chooses to save Julie instead of eating her, and a tense yet strangely tender relationship begins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has never happened before. It breaks the rules and defies logic, but R is no longer content with life in the grave. He wants to breathe again, he wants to live, and Julie wants to help him. But their grim, rotting world won't be changed without a fight...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Chronicles of Narnia&lt;/em&gt;, by C.S. Lewis, is one of the very few sets of books that should be read three times: in childhood, early adulthood, and late in life. In brief, four children travel repeatedly to a world in which they are far more than mere children and everything is far more than it seems. Richly told, populated with fascinating characters, perfectly realized in detail of world and pacing of plot, the story is infused throughout with the timeless issues of good and evil, faith and hope. This edition includes all seven volumes.</description>

  <description>Small towns are nothing if not friendly. Friendship, Wisconsin (population: &lt;s&gt;689&lt;/s&gt; 688) is no different. Around here, everyone wears a smile. And no one ever locks their doors. Until, that is, high school sweetheart Ruth Fried is found murdered. Strung up like a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Friendship’s police are more adept at looking for lost pets than catching killers. So Ruth’s best friend, Kippy Bushman, armed with only her tenacious Midwestern spirit and Ruth’s secret diary (which Ruth’s mother had asked her to read in order to redact any, you know, sex parts), sets out to find the murderer. But in a quiet town like Friendship—where no one is a suspect—anyone could be the killer.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>Panic began as so many things do in Carp, a dead-end town of 12,000 people in the middle of nowhere: because it was summer, and there was nothing else to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heather never thought she would compete in Panic, a legendary game played by graduating seniors, where the stakes are high and the payoff is even higher. She’d never thought of herself as fearless, the kind of person who would fight to stand out. But when she finds something, and someone, to fight for, she will discover that she is braver than she ever thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodge has never been afraid of Panic. His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game, he’s sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he’s not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them—and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.</description>

  <description>Alone on a desert island — everything and everyone he knows and loves has been washed away in a storm — Mau is the last surviving member of his nation. He’s completely alone — or so he thinks until he finds the ghost girl. She has no toes, wears strange lacy trousers like the grandfather bird, and gives him a stick that can make fire.&lt;br&gt;Daphne, sole survivor of the wreck of the Sweet Judy, almost immediately regrets trying to shoot the native boy. Thank goodness the powder was wet and the gun only produced a spark. She’s certain her father, distant cousin of the Royal family, will come and rescue her but it seems, for now, that all she has for company is the boy and the foul-mouthed ship’s parrot, until other survivors arrive to take refuge on the island. Together, Mau and Daphne discover some remarkable things (including how to milk a pig, and why spitting in beer is a good thing), and start to forge a new nation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Encompassing themes of death and nationhood, Terry Pratchett’s new novel is, as can be expected, extremely funny, witty and wise. Mau’s ancestors have something to teach us all. Mau just wishes they would shut up about it and let him get on with saving everyone’s lives!</description>

  <description>The beloved American classic about a young girl's coming-of-age at the turn of the century, Betty Smith's &lt;em&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant and moving tale filled with compassion and cruelty, laughter and heartache, crowded with life and people and incident. The story of young, sensitive, and idealistic Francie Nolan and her bittersweet formative years in the slums of Williamsburg has enchanted and inspired millions of readers for more than sixty years. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the daily experiences of the unforgettable Nolans are raw with honesty and tenderly threaded with family connectedness -- in a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as incredibly rich moments of universal experience.</description>

  <description>The king's scholar, the magus, believes he knows the site of an ancient treasure. To attain it for his king, he needs a skillful thief, and he selects Gen from the king's prison. The magus is interested only in the thief's abilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Gen is interested in is anyone's guess. Their journey toward the treasure is both dangerous and difficult, lightened only imperceptibly by the tales they tell of the old gods and goddesses.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Strange Angels&lt;/em&gt;, Dru Anderson has what her grandmother called “the touch.” (Comes in handy when you’re traveling from town to town with your dad, hunting ghosts, suckers, wulfen, and the occasional zombie.) Then her dad turns up dead—but still walking—and Dru knows she’s next. Even worse, she’s got two guys hungry for her affections, and they’re not about to let the fiercely independent Dru go it alone. Will Dru discover just how special she really is before coming face-to-fang with whatever—or &lt;em&gt;whoever&lt;/em&gt;— is hunting her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Have you ever had the feeling that you've lived another life? Been somewhere that has felt totally familiar, even though you've never been there before, or felt that you know someone well, even though you are meeting them for the first time? It happens. In 2073 on the remote and secretive island of Blessed, where rumour has it that no one ages and no children are born, a visiting journalist, Eric Seven, and a young local woman known as Merle are ritually slain. Their deaths echo a moment ten centuries before, when, in the dark of the moon, a king was slain, tragically torn from his queen. Their souls search to be reunited, and as mother and son, artist and child, forbidden lovers, victims of a vampire they come close to finding what they've lost. In a novel comprising seven parts, each influenced by a moon - the flower moon, the harvest moon, the hunter's moon, the blood moon - this is the story of Eric and Merle whose souls have been searching for each other since their untimely parting.</description>

      <![CDATA[I was intrigued by this book since it just won the Printz award.  Sedgwick tells the story of a visitor to the mysterious island of Blessed in 2073.  That one is followed by another tale from 2011, of an archaeologist digging on the island.  The stories continue, going back in time, linking to each...]]>

  <description>Lovable ne'er-do-well Delilah Dirk has travelled to Japan, Indonesia, France, and even the New World. Using the skills she's picked up on the way, Delilah's adventures continue as she plots to rob a rich and corrupt Sultan in Constantinople. With the aid of her flying boat and her newfound friend, Selim, she evades the Sultan's guards, leaves angry pirates in the dust, and fights her way through the countryside. For Delilah, one adventure leads to the next in this thrilling and funny installment in her exciting life.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little bit Tintin, a little bit Indiana Jones, &lt;em&gt;Delilah Dirk&lt;/em&gt; is a great pick for any reader looking for a smart and foolhardy heroine...and globetrotting adventures.</description>

  <description>You wouldn’t expect Nate and Charlie to be friends. Charlie’s the laid-back captain of the basketball team, and Nate is the neurotic, scheming president of the robotics club. But they are friends, however unlikely—until Nate declares war on the cheerleaders. At stake is funding that will either cover a robotics competition or new cheerleading uniforms—but not both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's only going to get worse: after both parties are stripped of their funding on grounds of abominable misbehavior, Nate enrolls the club's robot in a battlebot competition in a desperate bid for prize money. Bad sportsmanship? Sure. Chainsaws? Why not. Running away from home on Thanksgiving to illicitly enter a televised robot death match? Of course!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Faith Erin Hicks' and Prudence Shen's world of high school class warfare and robot death matches, Nothing can possibly go wrong.</description>

  <description>12,090 A.D. It is a dark time for the world. Humanity is just crawling out from under three hundred years of domination by the race of vampires known as the Nobility. The war against the vampires has taken its toll; cities lie in ruin, the countryside is fragmented into small villages and fiefdoms that still struggle against nightly raids by the fallen vampires - and the remnants of their genetically manufactured demons and werewolves. Every village wants a Hunter - one of the warriors who have pledged their laser guns and their swords to the eradication of the Nobility. But some Hunters are better than others, and some bring their own kind of danger with them. From creator Hideyuki Kikuchi, one of Japan's leading horror authors with illustrations by renowned Japanese artist, Yoshitaka Amano, best known for his illustrations in Neil Gaiman's Sandman: The Dream Hunters and the Final Fantasy games.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A love out of time. A spaceship built of secrets and murder.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Amy joins her parents as frozen cargo aboard the vast spaceship Godspeed and expects to awaken on a new planet, three hundred years in the future. Never could she have known that her frozen slumber would come to an end fifty years too soon and that she would be thrust into the brave new world of a spaceship that lives by its own rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amy quickly realizes that her awakening was no mere computer malfunction. Someone - one of the few thousand inhabitants of the spaceship - tried to kill her. And if Amy doesn't do something soon, her parents will be next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Amy must race to unlock Godspeed's hidden secrets. But out of her list of murder suspects, there's only one who matters: Elder, the future leader of the ship and the love she could never have seen coming.</description>

  <description>She’s no angel...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poor Dru Anderson. Her parents are long gone, her best friend is a werewolf, and she’s just learned that the blood flowing through her veins isn’t entirely human. (So what else is new?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Dru is stuck at a secret New England Schola for other teens like her, and there’s a big problem—she’s the only girl in the place. A school full of cute boys wouldn’t be so bad, but Dru’s killer instinct says that one of them wants her dead. And with all eyes on her, discovering a traitor within the Order could mean a lot more than social suicide...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Dru survive long enough to find out who has betrayed her trust—and maybe even her heart?</description>

  <description>Last year as college freshman, narrator Cal was infected by  exotic goth Morgan with a parasite that caused following girlfriends to become vampire-like ghouls he calls parasite-positives "Peeps". A carrier without symptoms, he hunts his progeny for the centuries old bureaucratic Night Watch. But victims are showing more sanity, pretty human Lacey is pushing his buttons, and her apartment building basement houses fierce hordes of ravening rats, red-eyed cats, and monstrous worms that threaten all. Morgan has the secret to a centuries-old conspiracy and upcoming battle to save the human race.</description>

  <description>For centuries, mystical creatures of all description were gathered to a hidden refuge called Fablehaven to prevent their extinction. The sanctuary survives today as one of the last strongholds of true magic in a cynical world. Enchanting? Absolutely. Exciting? You bet. Safe? Well, actually, quite the opposite ... Kendra and her brother Seth have no idea their grandfather is the current caretaker of Fablehaven. Inside the gated woods, ancient laws give relative order among greedy trolls, mischievous satyrs, plotting witches, spiteful imps, and jealous fairies. However, when the rules get broken, an arcane evil is unleashed, forcing Kendra and Seth to face the greatest challenge of their lives. To save her family, Fablehaven, and perhaps the world, Kendra must find the courage to do what she fears most.</description>

  <description>Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, Crown Princess of Kildenree, spends the first years of her life under her aunt's guidance learning to communicate with animals. As she grows up Ani develops the skills of animal speech, but is never comfortable speaking with people, so when her silver-tongued lady-in-waiting leads a mutiny during Ani's journey to be married in a foreign land, Ani is helpless and cannot persuade anyone to assist her.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becoming a goose girl for the king, Ani eventually uses her own special, nearly magical powers to find her way to her true destiny. Shannon Hale has woven an incredible, original and magical tale of a girl who must find her own unusual talents before she can become queen of the people she has made her own.</description>

  <description>The cons get craftier and the stakes rise ever higher in the riveting sequel to &lt;em&gt;White Cat—now in paperback!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After rescuing his brothers from Zacharov’s retribution, Cassel is trying to reestablish some kind of normalcy in his life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was never going to be easy for someone from a worker family that’s tied to one of the big crime families—and whose mother’s cons get more reckless by the day. But Cassel is coming to terms with what it means to be a worker, and he’s figuring out how to have friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except normal doesn’t last very long. Soon Cassel is being courted by both sides of the law and is forced to confront his past—a past he remembers only in scattered fragments, and one that could destroy his family and his future. Cassel will have to decide whose side he wants to be on, because neutrality is not an option. And then he will have to pull off his biggest con ever to survive…. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Six months have passed since the terrifying battle with Charlie Pink-eye and the Motor City Hammer in the zombie-infested mountains of the Rot &amp;amp;amp; Ruin. It&amp;amp;#8217;s also six months since Benny Imura and Nix Riley saw something in the air that changed their lives. Now, after months of rigorous training with Benny&amp;amp;#8217;s zombie-hunter brother Tom, Benny and Nix are ready to leave their home forever and search for a better future. Lilah the Lost Girl and Benny&amp;amp;#8217;s best friend Lou Chong are going with them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds easy. Sounds wonderful. Except that everything that can go wrong does. Before they can even leave there is a shocking zombie attack in town. But as soon as they step into the Rot &amp;amp;amp; Ruin they are pursued by the living dead, wild animals, insane murderers and the horrors of Gameland &amp;amp;#8211;where teenagers are forced to fight for their lives in the zombie pits. Worst of all&amp;amp;#8230;could the evil Charlie Pink-eye still be alive? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the great Rot &amp;amp;amp; Ruin everything wants to kill you. Everything&amp;amp;#8230;and not everyone in Benny&amp;amp;#8217;s small band of travelers will make it out alive.</description>

  <description>In the zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic America where Benny Imura lives, every teenager must find a job by the time they turn fifteen or get their rations cut in half. Benny doesn't want to apprentice as a zombie hunter with his boring older brother Tom, but he has no choice. He expects a tedious job whacking zoms for cash, but what he gets is a vocation that will teach him what it means to be human.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;ARTEMIS FOWL HAS LOST HIS MIND...JUST WHEN THE WORLD NEEDS HIM MOST.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Artemis has committed his entire fortune to a project he believes will save the planet and its inhabitants, both human and fairy. Can it be true? Has goodness taken hold of the world’s greatest teenage criminal mastermind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Holly Short is unconvinced, and discovers that Artemis is suffering from Atlantis Complex, a psychosis common among guilt-ridden fairies -- not humans -- and most likely triggered by Artemis’s dabbling with fairy magic. Symptoms include obsessive-compulsive behavior, paranoia, multiple personality disorder and, in extreme cases, embarrassing professions of love to a certain feisty LEPrecon fairy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Atlantis Complex has struck at the worst possible time. A deadly foe from Holly’s past is intent on destroying the actual city of Atlantis. Can Artemis escape the confines of his mind -- and the grips of a giant squid -- in time to save the underwater metropolis and its fairy inhabitants?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling author Eoin Colfer delivers a knockout, fast-paced, and hilarious adventure in &lt;em&gt;Artemis Fowl: The Atlantis Complex&lt;/em&gt;, the seventh book in the blockbuster series.</description>

  <description>Cassel comes from a family of Curse Workers - people who have the power to change your emotions, your memories, your luck, by the slightest touch of their hands. And since curse work is illegal, they're all criminals. Many become mobsters and con artists. But not Cassel. He hasn't got magic, so he's an outsider, the straight kid in a crooked family. You just have to ignore one small detail - he killed his best friend, Lila, three years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassel has carefully built up a facade of normalcy, blending into the crowd. But his facade starts to crumble when he finds himself sleepwalking, propelled into the night by terrifying dreams about a white cat that wants to tell him something. He's noticing other disturbing things too, including the strange behavior of his two brothers. They are keeping secrets from him. As Cassel begins to suspect he's part of a huge con game, he must unravel his past and his memories. To find out the truth, Cassel will have to out-con the conmen.</description>

  <description>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder -- much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.</description>

      <![CDATA[Really great beginning of a new series.  You'd think that the market is so saturated with modern supernatural series in the young adult section that nothing new can be good.  But this is definitely the exception!  Clary discovers that there is another world that most of us cannot see, the dark world...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Connor, Risa, and Lev are running for their lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Second Civil War was fought over reproductive rights.  The chilling resolution: Life is inviolable from the moment of conception until age thirteen.  Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, parents can have their child "unwound," whereby all of the child's organs are transplanted into different donors, so life doesn't technically end.  Connor is too difficult for his parents to control.  Risa, a ward of the state is not enough to be kept alive.  And Lev is a tithe, a child conceived and raised to be unwound.  Together, they may have a chance to escape and to survive.</description>

This means that 100% of their bodies are donated to those who need/want them.  Since the person is not technically "dead", it isn't murder.<br /><br />Anyway, the author...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor&lt;/em&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Park&lt;/em&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds—smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

      <![CDATA[Most of these stories were awesome, but some stank it up!  I was really impressed with "Blue Moon" by Richelle Mead.  It takes place in an alternate universe where vampires are kindof like mob bosses who treat humans like second-class citizens.  The main character is a vampire named Lucy, who begins...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;IT TAKES THE WISDOM OF YODA TO SURVIVED THE SIXTH GRADE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Dwight, a sixth-grade oddball. Dwight does a lot of weird things, like wearing the same T-shirt for a month or telling people to call him "Captain Dwight." This is embarrassing, particularly for Tommy, who sits with him at lunch every day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Dwight does one cool thing. He makes origami. One day he makes an origami finger puppet of Yoda. And that's when things get mysterious. Origami Yoda can predict the future and suggest the best way to deal with a tricky situation. His advice actually works, and soon most of the sixth grade is lining up with questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tommy wants to know how Origami Yoda can be so smart when Dwight himself is so clueless. Is Yoda tapping into the Force? It's crucial that Tommy figure out the mystery before he takes Yoda's advice about something VERY IMPORTANT that has to do with a girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Tommy's case file of his investigation into "The Strange Case of Origami Yoda."</description>

  <description>When her best guy friend falls victim to a vicious hate crime, sixteen-year-old Cat sets out to discover who in her small town did it. Richly atmospheric, this daring mystery mines the secrets of a tightly knit Southern community and examines the strength of will it takes to go against everyone you know in the name of justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against a backdrop of poverty, clannishness, drugs, and intolerance, Myracle has crafted a harrowing coming-of-age tale couched in a deeply intelligent mystery. Smart, fearless, and compassionate, this is an unforgettable work from a beloved author.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A vibrant new voice . . . a modern classic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; For generations, the Beaumont family has harbored a magical     secret. They each possess a "savvy" -a special supernatural power that strikes when they turn thirteen. Grandpa Bomba moves mountains, her older brothers create hurricanes and spark electricity . . . and now it's the eve of Mibs's big day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As if waiting weren't hard enough, the family gets scary news two days before Mibs's birthday: Poppa has been in a terrible accident. Mibs develops the singular mission to get to the hospital and prove that her new power can save her dad. So she sneaks onto a salesman's bus . . . only to find the bus heading in the opposite     direction. Suddenly Mibs finds herself on an unforgettable odyssey that will force her to make sense of growing up-and of other people, who might also have a few secrets hidden just beneath the skin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Don't even &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; of starting this book unless you're sitting in a comfortable chair and have lots of time. A fast-paced, impossible-to-put-down adventure awaits as the young orphan Peter and his mates are dispatched to an island ruled by the evil King Zarboff. They set sail aboard the &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt;, a ship carrying a precious and mysterious trunk in its cargo hold, and the journey quickly becomes fraught with excitement and danger. &lt;br&gt; Discover richly developed characters in the sweet but sophisticated Molly, the scary but familiar Black Stache, and the fearless Peter. Treacherous battles with pirates, foreboding thunderstorms at sea, and evocative writing immerses the reader in a story that slowly and finally reveals the secrets and mysteries of the beloved &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school... again. And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus' master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus' stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.</description>

      <![CDATA[I learned so much about Greek mythology from this book.  I like the twist on the typical lonely boy-who-suddenly-finds-he-has-powers this time--Percy discovers that he's actually a demigod.  He goes on a quest with 2 friends and the adventures are insane!  Lots of fun.]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks at age 14:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debate Club.&lt;br&gt;Her father’s “bunny rabbit.”&lt;br&gt;A mildly geeky girl attending a highly competitive boarding school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks at age 15:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A knockout figure.&lt;br&gt;A sharp tongue.&lt;br&gt;A chip on her shoulder.&lt;br&gt;And a gorgeous new senior boyfriend: the supremely goofy, word-obsessed Matthew Livingston.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankie Laundau-Banks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;No longer the kind of girl to take “no” for an answer.&lt;br&gt;Especially when “no” means she’s excluded from her boyfriend’s all-male secret society.&lt;br&gt;Not when her ex boyfriend shows up in the strangest of places.&lt;br&gt;Not when she knows she’s smarter than any of them.&lt;br&gt;When she knows Matthew’s lying to her.&lt;br&gt;And when there are so many, many pranks to be done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks, at age 16:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Possibly a criminal mastermind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of how she got that way.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book just barely got picked as the Printz Honor book, and I'm not surprised.  Lockhart is a wonderful author and I thoroughly enjoyed her character of a 15 year old girl at a private school, breaking into the powerful all-boys club.  Frankie's character is incredibly smart and so real--she say...]]>

  <description>More than anything, Joel wants to be a Rithmatist. Chosen by the Master in a mysterious inception ceremony, Rithmatists have the power to infuse life into two-dimensional figures known as Chalklings. Rithmatists are humanity’s only defense against the Wild Chalklings — merciless creatures that leave mangled corpses in their wake. Having nearly overrun the territory of Nebrask, the Wild Chalklings now threaten all of the American Isles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the son of a lowly chalkmaker at Armedius Academy, Joel can only watch as Rithmatist students study the magical art that he would do anything to practice. Then students start disappearing — kidnapped from their rooms at night, leaving trails of blood. Assigned to help the professor who is investigating the crimes, Joel and his friend Melody find themselves on the trail of an unexpected discovery — one that will change Rithmatics — and their world — forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bestselling author Brandon Sanderson brings his unique brand of epic storytelling to the teen audience with an engrossing tale of danger and suspense—the first of a series. With his trademark skills in world-building, Sanderson has created a magic system that is so inventive and detailed that that readers who appreciate games of strategy and tactics just may want to bring Rithmatics to life in our world.</description>

  <description>Cherie Priest's much-anticipated steampunk debut has finally arrived in the form of a paperback original. Its plot features the sort of calibrated suspense that readers of her &lt;em&gt;Four and Twenty Blackbirds&lt;/em&gt; would expect. &lt;em&gt;Boneshaker&lt;/em&gt; derives its title from the Bone-Shaking Drill Engine, a device designed to give Russian prospectors a leg up in the race for Klondike gold. Unfortunately, there was one hitch: On its trial run, the Boneshaker went haywire and, long story short, turned much of Seattle into a city of the dead. Now, 16 years later, a teenage boy decides to find out what is behind that mysterious wall. Can his mother save him in time? Zombie lit of the first order.</description>

  <description>Ten-year-old Nathan Abercrombie is having a really bad day. First, Shawna Lanchester, the prettiest girl in his class, doesn’t invite him to her party. Then he gets picked last in gym class. Things couldn’t get any worse…until he gets doused with an experimental serum that turns him into a half-dead zombie!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan soon discovers that being half dead isn’t all bad. He doesn’t need any sleep, so he can stay up all night and play games online. He doesn’t feel any pain, so there’s no need to worry about Rodney the bully anymore. Still, Nathan would rather be human. Will he find a cure? Or will Nathan be half-dead forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fans of David Lubar’s popular Weenies short story collections—which have sold more than one million copies—will love &lt;em&gt;My Rotten Life&lt;/em&gt;, the first of a series of hilariously rotten adventures starring Nathan Abercrombie, Accidental Zombie.</description>

      <![CDATA[My 10-year-old loved this book and I enjoyed it too.  Nathan Abercrombie is accidentally turned into a zombie by a mad scientist.  As he becomes more and more "dead", he finds abilities and advantages to his current state.  It's funny and silly too.  I found myself envying him--he doesn't have to sle...]]>

  <description>Holy unanticipated occurrences! A cynic meets an unlikely superhero in a genre-breaking new novel by master storyteller Kate DiCamillo. It begins, as the best superhero stories do, with a tragic accident that has unexpected consequences. The squirrel never saw the vacuum cleaner coming, but self-described cynic Flora Belle Buckman, who has read every issue of the comic book Terrible Things Can Happen to You!, is the just the right person to step in and save him. What neither can predict is that Ulysses (the squirrel) has been born anew, with powers of strength, flight, and misspelled poetry—and that Flora will be changed too, as she discovers the possibility of hope and the promise of a capacious heart. From #1 New York Times best-selling author Kate DiCamillo comes a laugh-out-loud story filled with eccentric, endearing characters and featuring an exciting new format—a novel interspersed with comic-style graphic sequences and full-page illustrations, all rendered in black-and-white by up-and-coming artist K.G. Campbell.</description>

  <description>The master puppeteer, Gaspare Grisini, is so expert at manipulating his stringed puppets that they appear alive. Clara Wintermute, the only child of a wealthy doctor, is spellbound by Grisini’s act and invites him to entertain at her birthday party. Seeing his chance to make a fortune, Grisini accepts and makes a splendidly gaudy entrance with caravan, puppets, and his two orphaned assistants. &lt;br&gt;Lizzie Rose and Parsefall are dazzled by the Wintermute home. Clara seems to have everything they lack — adoring parents, warmth, and plenty to eat. In fact, Clara’s life is shadowed by grief, guilt, and secrets. When Clara vanishes that night, suspicion of kidnapping falls upon the puppeteer and, by association, Lizzie Rose and Parsefall. &lt;br&gt;As they seek to puzzle out Clara’s whereabouts, Lizzie and Parse uncover Grisini’s criminal past and wake up to his evil intentions. Fleeing London, they find themselves caught in a trap set by Grisini’s ancient rival, a witch with a deadly inheritance to shed before it’s too late.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book kept me guessing the whole time, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! 3 children, 2 poor and 1 wealthy, become "puppets" of an evil puppet master and a witch. But they still manage to rely upon each other and choose their own path in the end. I especially loved the setting--Victorian England.]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Matt Phelan, graphic novelist extraordinaire, presents a rollicking tribute to vaudeville, small-town dreams, and Buster Keaton as a boy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer of 1908, in Muskegon, Michigan, a visiting troupe of vaudeville performers is about the most exciting thing since baseball. They’re summering in nearby Bluffton, so Henry has a few months to ogle the elephant and the zebra, the tightrope walkers and — lo and behold — a slapstick actor his own age named Buster Keaton. The show folk say Buster is indestructible; his father throws him around as part of the act and the audience roars, while Buster never cracks a smile. Henry longs to learn to take a fall like Buster, "the human mop," but Buster just wants to play ball with Henry and his friends. With signature nostalgia, Scott O’Dell Award–winning graphic novelist Matt Phelan visualizes a bygone era with lustrous color, dynamic lines, and flawless dramatic pacing.</description>

      <![CDATA[I read this with my 7 and 9 year old. They found it really interesting to see the world during Buster Keaton's early days, although they probably didn't quite get the teenage friendship issues in the story.  I enjoyed it a lot and found the graphic novel format to work really well with the story.]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;With diabolical wit, the author of TANATALIZE revisits a deliciously dark world where vampires vie with angels — and girls just want to have fangs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At last, Miranda is the life of the party: all she had to do was die. Elevated and adopted by none other than the reigning King of the Mantle of Dracul, Miranda goes from high-school theater wannabe to glamorous royal fiend overnight. Meanwhile, her reckless and adoring guardian angel, Zachary, demoted to human guise as the princess’s personal assistant, has his work cut out for him trying to save his girl’s soul and plan the Master’s fast-approaching Death Day gala. In alternating points of view, Miranda and Zachary navigate a cut-throat eternal aristocracy as they play out a dangerous and darkly hilarious love story for the ages.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"Get ready to sleep with the lights on!" — GIRLS' LIFE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lovesick count and the ghost of his brutalized servant . . . a serial killer who defies death . . . a house with a violent mind of its own and another that holds a grotesque secret within its peeling walls. Here are witches who feast on faces, changeling rites of passage, a venerable vampire &lt;br&gt;contemplating his end, and a fanged brat who drains the patience of a bumbling teenage boy. Here too are a flamboyant young novelist in search of a subject more compelling than his own eerie existence and &lt;br&gt;the daughter of a sorcerer fighting to free her lover — and her will — from sinister bonds. Enter the world of GOTHIC!, a celebration of the literary form made famous by such writers as Mary Shelley and Edgar Allan Poe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With chilling stories by: &lt;br&gt;Joan Aiken &lt;br&gt;M. T. Anderson &lt;br&gt;Neil Gaiman &lt;br&gt;Caitlín R. Kiernan &lt;br&gt;Gregory Maguire &lt;br&gt;Garth Nix &lt;br&gt;Celia Rees &lt;br&gt;Janni Lee Simner &lt;br&gt;Vivian Vande Velde &lt;br&gt;Barry Yourgrau</description>

  <description>When suburban Claudia Kincaid decides to run away, she knows she doesn’t just want to run from somewhere, she wants to run to somewhere — to a place that is comfortable, beautiful, and, preferably, elegant. She chooses the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Knowing her younger brother Jamie has money and thus can help her with a serious cash-flow problem, she invites him along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once settled into the museum, Claudia and Jamie find themselves caught up in the mystery of an angel statue that the museum purchased at auction for a bargain price of $225. The statue is possibly an early work of the Renaissance master, Michelangelo, and therefore worth millions. Is it? Or isn’t it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claudia is determined to find out. Her quest leads her to Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the remarkable old woman who sold the statue, and to some equally remarkable discoveries about herself.</description>

  <description>High in his attic bedroom, twelve-year-old David mourns the death of his mother, with only the books on his shelf for company. But those books have begun to whisper to him in the darkness. Angry and alone, he takes refuge in his imagination and soon finds that reality and fantasy have begun to meld. While his family falls apart around him, David is violently propelled into a world that is a strange reflection of his own -- populated by heroes and monsters and ruled by a faded king who keeps his secrets in a mysterious book, The Book of Lost Things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking readers on a vivid journey through the loss of innocence into adulthood and beyond, New York Times bestselling author John Connolly tells a dark and compelling tale that reminds us of the enduring power of stories in our lives.</description>

  <description>An American classic and great bestseller for over thirty years, &lt;em&gt;A Separate Peace&lt;/em&gt; is timeless in its description of adolescence during a period when the entire country was losing its innocence to the second world war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set at a boys' boarding school in New England during the early years of World War II, &lt;em&gt;A Separate Peace&lt;/em&gt; is a harrowing and luminous parable of the dark side of adolescence. Gene is a lonely, introverted intellectual. Phineas is a handsome, taunting, daredevil athlete. What happens between the two friends one summer, like the war itself, banishes the innocence of these boys and their world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bestseller for more than thirty years, &lt;em&gt;A Separate Peace&lt;/em&gt; is John Knowles's crowning achievement and an undisputed American classic.</description>

  <description>Tally thought they were a rumor, but now she's one of them. A Special. A superamped fighting machine, engineered to keep the uglies down and the pretties stupid. &lt;br&gt;But maybe being perfectly programmed with strength and focus isn't better than anything she's ever known. Tally still has memories of something else. &lt;br&gt;But it's easy for her to tune that out--until she's offered a chance to stamp out the rebels of the New Smoke permanently. It all comes down to one last choice: listen to that tiny, faint heartbeat, or carry out the mission she's programmed to complete. Either way, Tally's world will never be the same.</description>

      <![CDATA[My favorite of the trilogy.  I love the ways this book surprised me.  Tally goes through a lot here and is totally confused, but she makes some good choices in the end.  I would love to have a hoverboard, by the way, but I can live without the special titanium bones (or whatever she had).]]>

  <description>Everybody gets to be supermodel gorgeous. What could be wrong with that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tally is about to turn sixteen, and she can't wait. Not for her license - for turning pretty. In Tally's world, your sixteenth birthday brings an operation that turns you from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to have a really great time. In just a few weeks Tally will be there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tally's new friend Shay isn't sure she wants to be pretty. She'd rather risk life on the outside. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world and it isn't very pretty. The authorities offer Tally the worst choice she can imagine: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The choice Tally makes changes her world forever...</description>

  <description>It's late summer 1793, and the streets of Philadelphia are abuzz with mosquitoes and rumors of fever. Down near the docks, many have taken ill, and the fatalities are mounting. Now they include Polly, the serving girl at the Cook Coffeehouse. But fourteen-year-old Mattie Cook doesn't get a moment to mourn the passing of her childhood playmate. New customers have overrun her family's coffee shop, located far from the mosquito-infested river, and Mattie's concerns of fever are all but overshadowed by dreams of growing her family's small business into a thriving enterprise. But when the fever begins to strike closer to home, Mattie's struggle to build a new life must give way to a new fight-the fight to stay alive.</description>

  <description>THE CHOSEN ONE MUST BE RETRIEVED FROM EARTH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HE WILL BRING DOWN THE WALL AND RESTORE THE KINGDOM TO GLORY&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HIS NAME IS TOM PARKING&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this mysterious yet oddly ordinary-looking prophecy, Tom's fate is sealed: he's been plucked from his life and whisked away to a magical kingdom to be its Chosen One.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's just one problem: The kingdom is mostly made of garbage from Earth. Okay, well, two problems: the king hates Tom. Also, the princess likes to wear fake mustaches. And being Chosen One seems to consist mainly of cleaning out rats' noses at the Royal Rat-Snottery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, basically, the kingdom sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Tom turns down the job of Chosen One, he thinks he's making a smart decision. But when Tom discovers he's been replaced by his best friend Kyle, who's always been cooler, more athletic, and better with girls, Tom wants Crap Kingdom back—at any cost. And the hilarity that ensues will determine the fate of the universe.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Dead girl walking,” the boys say in the halls.&lt;br&gt;“Tell us your secret,” the girls whisper, one toilet to another.&lt;br&gt;I am that girl.&lt;br&gt;I am the space between my thighs, daylight shining through.&lt;br&gt;I am the bones they want, wired on a porcelain frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lia and Cassie are best friends, wintergirls frozen in matchstick bodies, competitors in a deadly contest to see who can be the skinniest. But what comes after size zero and size double-zero? When Cassie succumbs to the demons within, Lia feels she is being haunted by her friend’s restless spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her most emotionally wrenching, lyrically written book since the multiple-award-winning &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt;, Laurie Halse Anderson explores Lia’s descent into the powerful vortex of anorexia, and her painful path toward recovery.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;After five months of sheer absolute craziness I was going back to being plain old background D.J. In photographs of course I’m always in the background . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;   But it turns out other folks have big plans for D.J. Like her coach. College scouts. All the town hoops fans. A certain Red Bend High School junior who’s keen for romance and karaoke. Not to mention Brian Nelson, who she should not be thinking about! Who she is done with, thank you very much. But who keeps showing up anyway . . .&lt;br&gt;   Readers first fell in love with straight-talking D. J. Schwenk in &lt;em&gt;Dairy Queen; &lt;/em&gt;they followed her ups and downs both on and off the court in &lt;em&gt;The Off Season. &lt;/em&gt;Now D. J.steps out from behind the free-throw line in this final installment of the Dairy Queen trilogy.</description>

  <description>Life is looking up for D.J. Schwenk. She’s in eleventh grade, finally. After a rocky summer, she’s reconnecting in a big way with her best friend, Amber. She’s got kind of a thing going with Brian Nelson, who’s cute and popular and smart but seems to like her anyway. And then there’s the fact she’s starting for the Red Bend High School football team—the first girl linebacker in northern Wisconsin, probably. Which just shows you can’t predict the future. As autumn progresses, D.J. struggles to understand Amber, Schwenk Farm, her relationship with Brian, and most of all her family. As a whole herd of trouble comes her way, she discovers she’s a lot stronger than she—or anyone—ever thought.&lt;br&gt;   This hilarious, heartbreaking and triumphant sequel to the critically acclaimed Dairy Queen takes D.J. and all the Schwenks from Labor Day to a Thanksgiving football game that you will never forget.</description>

  <description>When you don’t talk, there’s a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.&lt;br&gt;Harsh words indeed, from Brian Nelson of all people. But, D. J. can’t help admitting, maybe he’s right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you don’t talk, there’s a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.&lt;br&gt;Stuff like why her best friend, Amber, isn’t so friendly anymore. Or why her little brother, Curtis, never opens his mouth. Why her mom has two jobs and a big secret. Why her college-football-star brothers won’t even call home. Why her dad would go ballistic if she tried out for the high school football team herself. And why Brian is so, so out of her league. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you don’t talk, there’s a lot of stuff that ends up not getting said.&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the summer that fifteen-year-old D. J. Schwenk of Red Bend, Wisconsin, learns to talk, and ends up having an awful lot of stuff to say.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book really surprised me.  D.J. is a 15 year old farmer's daughter who tells the story of her summer.  She works hard on the farm and also gets to know a football player from a nearby town.  I absolutely loved the main character.  She treats herself like she's dumb, but she really is not.

  <description>The day after they moved in, Coraline went exploring.... In Coraline's family's new flat are twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. Thirteen of the doors open and close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourteenth is locked, and on the other side is only a brick wall, until the day Coraline unlocks the door to find a passage to another flat in another house just like her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only it's different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, things seem marvelous in the other flat. The food is better. The toy box is filled with wind-up angels that flutter around the bedroom, books whose pictures writhe and crawl and shimmer, little dinosaur skulls that chatter their teeth. But there's another mother, and another father, and they want Coraline to stay with them and be their little girl. They want to "change" her and never let her go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other children are trapped there as well, lost souls behind the mirrors. Coraline is their only hope of rescue. She will have to fight with all her wits and all the tools she can find if she is to save the lost children, her ordinary life, and herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Critically acclaimed and award-winning author Neil Gaiman will delight readers with his first novel for all ages.</description>

      <![CDATA[I liked this book, but I found it to be a lot darker than The Graveyard.  Coraline goes through a secret passage and finds a world that closely mirrors her own.  She has to battle the "other mother" to be able to return to her normal life.  I wanted her to succeed so much, that I was a little impati...]]>

  <description>At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent young fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the "gift" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: "Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally." When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.</description>

  <description>In Mary's world there are simple truths. The Sisterhood always knows best. The Guardians will protect and serve. The Unconsecrated will never relent. And you must always mind the fence that surrounds the village; the fence that protects the village from the Forest of Hands and Teeth. But, slowly, Mary’s truths are failing her. She’s learning things she never wanted to know about the Sisterhood and its secrets, and the Guardians and their power, and about the Unconsecrated and their relentlessness. When the fence is breached and her world is thrown into chaos, she must choose between her village and her future—between the one she loves and the one who loves her. And she must face the truth about the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Could there be life outside a world surrounded in so much death?&lt;p&gt;Carrie Ryan lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. You can visit Carrie at &lt;a href="http://www.carrieryan.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.carrieryan.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Every war has turning points and every person too.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Daisy is sent from Manhattan to England to visit her aunt and cousins she’s never met: three boys near her age, and their little sister. Her aunt goes away on business soon after Daisy arrives. The next day bombs go off as London is attacked and occupied by an unnamed enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As power fails, and systems fail, the farm becomes more isolated. Despite the war, it’s a kind of Eden, with no adults in charge and no rules, a place where Daisy’s uncanny bond with her cousins grows into something rare and extraordinary. But the war is everywhere, and Daisy and her cousins must lead each other into a world that is unknown in the scariest, most elemental way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A riveting and astonishing story.</description>

  <description>Fed up with her wild behavior, sixteen-year-old Lex's parents ship her off to upstate New York to live with her Uncle Mort for the summer, hoping that a few months of dirty farm work will whip her back into shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But Uncle Mort's true occupation is much dirtier than shoveling manure. He's a Grim Reaper. And he's going to teach Lex the family business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She quickly assimilates into the peculiar world of Croak, a town populated by reapers who deliver souls from this life to the next. But Lex can't stop her desire for justice - or is it vengeance? - whenever she encounters a murder victim, craving to stop the attackers before they can strike again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she ditch Croak and go rogue with her reaper skills?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts—and a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ismae’s most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany—where she finds herself woefully under prepared—not only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death’s vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?</description>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Sarah Zorn intends to spend the Wisconsin summer with her “boyfriend” Curtis, waiting for a dead calf named Boris to decompose in time for the science fair. Her plans upend, however, when her fake-boyfriend strategy goes seriously awry just as her hippie Grandma Z invites her on a last-minute Roman holiday. As Sarah explores Italy’s ancient wonders, she can’t stop “boy-liking” Curtis . . . or puzzling over her grandmother’s odd behavior. Written as Sarah’s journal, this satisfying middle grade novel navigates the murky waters of first love, friendship, and family with heart and good humor.</description>

  <description>It's one thing to find out you're a vampire princess. It's a whole other thing to actually rule. Newly married Jessica Packwood is having a hard enough time feeling regal with her husband, Lucius, at her side. But when evidence in the murder of a powerful elder points to Lucius, sending him into solitary confinement, Jessica is suddenly on her own. Determined to clear her husband's name, Jessica launches into a full-scale investigation, but hallucinations and nightmares of betrayal keep getting in her way. Jessica knows that with no blood to drink, Lucius's time is running out. Can she figure out who the real killer is —and whom she can trust— before it's too late?</description>

  <description>PLACES, EVERYONE!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie loves theater. And while she would totally try out for her middle school's production of &lt;em&gt;Moon Over Mississippi&lt;/em&gt;, she can't really sing. Instead she's the set designer for the drama department stage crew, and this year she's determined to create a set worthy of Broadway on a middle-school budget. But how can she, when she doesn't know much about carpentry, ticket sales are down, and the crew members are having trouble working together? Not to mention the onstage AND offstage drama that occurs once the actors are chosen. And when two cute brothers enter the picture, things get even crazier!</description>

  <description>THE FALSE PRINCE is the thrilling first book in a brand-new trilogy filled with danger and deceit and hidden identities that will have readers rushing breathlessly to the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a discontent kingdom, civil war is brewing. To unify the divided people, Conner, a nobleman of the court, devises a cunning plan to find an impersonator of the king's long-lost son and install him as a puppet prince. Four orphans are recruited to compete for the role, including a defiant boy named Sage. Sage knows that Conner's motives are more than questionable, yet his life balances on a sword's point -- he must be chosen to play the prince or he will certainly be killed. But Sage's rivals have their own agendas as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sage moves from a rundown orphanage to Conner's sumptuous palace, layer upon layer of treachery and deceit unfold, until finally, a truth is revealed that, in the end, may very well prove more dangerous than all of the lies taken together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An extraordinary adventure filled with danger and action, lies and deadly truths that will have readers clinging to the edge of their seats.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;then.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sam met Grace, he was a wolf and she was a girl. Eventually he found a way to become a boy, and their loved moved from curious distance to the intense closeness of shared lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That should have been the end of their story. But Grace was not meant to stay human. Now she is the wolf. And the wolves of Mercy Falls are about to be killed in one final, spectacular hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam would do anything for Grace.

  <description>For years, Grace has watched the wolves in the woods behind her house. One yellow-eyed wolf—her wolf—is a chilling presence she can't seem to live without.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Sam has lived two lives: In winter, the frozen woods, the protection of the pack, and the silent company of a fearless girl. In summer, a few precious months of being human… until the cold makes him shift back again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Grace meets a yellow-eyed boy whose familiarity takes her breath away. It's her wolf. It has to be. But as winter nears, Sam must fight to stay human—or risk losing himself, and Grace, forever.</description>

  <description>High school totally bites when you’re half human, half vampire. Freshman year sucks for Vlad Tod. Bullies still harass him. The photographer from the school newspaper is tailing him. And failing his studies could be deadly. A trip to Siberia gives “study abroad” a whole new meaning as Vlad connects with other vampires and advances his mind-control abilities, but will he return home with the skills to recognize a vampire slayer when he sees one? In this thrilling sequel to &lt;em&gt;Eighth Grade Bites&lt;/em&gt;, Vlad must confront the secrets of the past and battle forces that once again threaten his life. Find out why author D. J. MacHale calls &lt;em&gt;The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod&lt;/em&gt; “Gruesome, heartwarming, spellbinding.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch a QuickTime trailer for this book.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[About 2/3 of the way through this book, I started berating myself for having even started it.  Teenagers in love who have cancer sounds like the worst possible premise for a story ever.  When it became clear that someone was going to die, I got pretty annoyed at myself.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The long-awaited second book in the dystopian &lt;em&gt;Matched&lt;/em&gt; trilogy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In search of a future that may not exist and faced with the decision of who to share it with, Cassia journeys to the Outer Provinces in pursuit of Ky - taken by the Society to his certain death - only to find that he has escaped, leaving a series of clues in his wake. Cassia's quest leads her to question much of what she holds dear, even as she finds glimmers of a different life across the border. But as Cassia nears resolve and certainty about her future with Ky, an invitation for rebellion, an unexpected betrayal, and a surprise visit from Xander - who may hold the key to the uprising and, still, to Cassia's heart - change the game once again. Nothing is as expected on the edge of Society, where crosses and double crosses make the path more twisted than ever.</description>

      <![CDATA[I liked this second book in the series because there is more action and adventure. I realize that Cassia and Ky are very shaped by the world of the Society. The way she thinks and speaks sounds so naive and romanticized, it bugged me a little. But I definitely enjoyed reading about these characte...]]>

  <description>Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate... until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.</description>

  <description>It all comes down to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vlad’s running out of time. The Elysian Council has given him weeks to live, and that’s if the Slayer Society doesn’t kill him – along with all the citizens of Bathory – first. Then there’s the issue of Vlad’s father, who may or may not still be alive after all these years, and oh yeah, that tiny little detail in the Pravus prophecy about Vlad enslaving Vampirekind and the human race. So much for college applications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this epic finale to Heather Brewer’s heart-stopping Chronicles of Vladimir Tod, dark secrets will be revealed, old friends will become enemies, and warm blood will run cold. Just be careful it isn’t yours.</description>

      <![CDATA[I love Vlad Tod!  He's so relatable and normal, even though he's a half-vampire. <br /><br />My main issue with this series is that Heather Brewer's female characters really lack depth.  Since the major players are guys, it works fine anyway.  But sometimes I wanted to shake those girls and yell, "Get a persona...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In Tenth Grade Bleeds&lt;/em&gt;, it’s another sucky year at Bathory High for Vladimir Tod. The evil vampire D’Ablo is hunting for the ritual that could steal Vlad’s powers. His best friend Henry doesn’t want to be his drudge anymore. And as if all that weren’t enough, it’s getting harder for Vlad to resist feeding on the people around him. When months go by with no word from Uncle Otis and D’Ablo shows up demanding Vlad’s father’s journal, Vlad realizes that having a normal high school year is the least of his concerns. Vlad needs to act fast, and even his status as the Pravus won’t save him this time . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Printz Award–winning classic gets a new look.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The Watson family moves to Stoneygate, an old coal-mining town, to care for Kit’s recently widowed grandfather. When Kit meets John Askew, another boy whose family has both worked and died in the mines, Askew invites Kit to join him in playing a game called Death. As Kit’s grandfather tells him stories of the mine’s past and the history of the Watson family, Askew takes Kit into the mines, where the boys look to find the childhood ghosts of their long-gone ancestors. Written in haunting, lyrical prose, &lt;em&gt;Kit’s Wilderness &lt;/em&gt;examines the bonds of family from one generation to the next, and explores how meaning and beauty can be revealed from the depths of darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Michael L. Printz Award Winner&lt;br&gt;An ALA Notable Book &lt;br&gt;A &lt;/em&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;em&gt;Best Book&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Vivian Gandillon relishes the change, the sweet, fierce ache that carries her from girl to wolf. At sixteen, she is beautiful and strong, and all the young wolves are on her tail. But Vivian still grieves for her dead father; her pack remains leaderless and in disarray, and she feels lost in the suburbs of Maryland. She longs for a normal life. But what is normal for a werewolf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Vivian falls in love with a human, a meat-boy. Aiden is kind and gentle, a welcome relief from the squabbling pack. He’s fascinated by magic, and Vivian longs to reveal herself to him. Surely he would understand her and delight in the wonder of her dual nature, not fear her as an ordinary human would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivian’s divided loyalties are strained further when a brutal murder threatens to expose the pack. Moving between two worlds, she does not seem to belong in either. What is she really—human or beast? Which tastes sweeter—blood or chocolate?</description>

  <description>The fifty contestants in the Miss Teen Dream pageant thought this was going to be a fun trip to the beach, where they could parade in their state-appropriate costumes and compete in front of the cameras. But sadly, their airplane had another idea, crashing on a desert island and leaving the survivors stranded with little food, little water, and practically no eyeliner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's a beauty queen to do? Continue to practice for the talent portion of the program - or wrestle snakes to the ground? Get a perfect tan - or learn to run wild? And what should happen when the sexy pirates show up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the heart of non-exfoliated darkness. Your tour guide? None other than Libba Bray, the hilarious, sensational, Printz Award-winning author of A Great and Terrible Beauty and Going Bovine. The result is a novel that will make you laugh, make you think, and make you never see beauty the same way again.</description>

It's up to Em to triumph over evil while controlling the amulet's power . . . without losing herself!</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;The stunning conclusion to the Gregor the Overlander series, now in paperback!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone in the Underland has been taking great pains to keep The Prophecy of Time from Gregor. Gregor knows it must say something awful but he never imagined just how awful: It calls for the warrior's death. Now, with an army of rats approaching, and his mom and sister still in Regalia, Gregor the warrior must gather up his courage to help defend Regalia and get his family home safely. The entire existence of the Underland is in Gregor's hands, and time is running out. There is a code to be cracked, a mysterious new princess, Gregor's burgeoning dark side, and a war to end all wars.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>The war against Voldemort is not going well; even the Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the &lt;em&gt;Daily Prophet,&lt;/em&gt; looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, as with all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate—and lose a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here at Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort—and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.</description>

  <description>Book Two left off with Gregor reading the Prophecy of Blood: a prophecy that calls for Gregor and Boots to return to the Underland to help ward off a deadly plague. But this time, Gregor's mother refuses to let him return to the Underland... until the rat Ripred assures the family that Gregor and Boots are just needed for a short meeting, which the crawlers will attend only if their "princess" Boots is present. Gregor's mom finally relents, on the condition that she go with them. The Underland plague is spreading, and when one of Gregor's family is stricken, he begins to understand his role in the Prophecy of Blood, and must summon all his power to end the biological warfare that threatens the warmblooded creatures of the Underland.</description>

  <description>Harry Potter is lucky to reach the age of thirteen, since he has already survived the murderous attacks of the feared Dark Lord on more than one occasion. But his hopes for a quiet term concentrating on Quidditch are dashed when a maniacal mass-murderer escapes from Azkaban, pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guard the prison. It's assumed that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry to be. But is it a coincidence that he can feel eyes watching him in the dark, and should he be taking Professor Trelawney's ghoulish predictions seriously?</description>

  <description>Sopramondo, New York: il padre di Gregor e Boots soffre di una misteriosa malattia che gli impedisce di lavorare, e con il solo stipendio della madre e le medicine da pagare, la famiglia è in gravi difficoltà economiche. Non c'è un centesimo per festeggiare il Natale, e spesso per? no la cena è un problema. La situazione potrebbe precipitare da un momento all'altro. Sottomondo, Regalia: nella capitale del mondo sotterraneo, nelle viscere di New York, i problemi sono ancora più impellenti. Il momento è giunto. La profezia del Flagello parla chiaro. Se non sarà compiuta, il Sottomondo sarà distrutto. Ares e Luxa sanno che la salvezza può venire solo da Gregor di Sopramondo. Che ha giurato di non tornare mai più. Ma un modo per costringerlo c'è.

  <description>Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on a broomstick. He's never worn a Cloak of Invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny cupboard under the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.</description>

  <description>Eoin Colfer has made millions of fans around the world with his much-loved character, Artemis Fowl, the star of his hugely best-selling series. Now, in a beautifully written novel that is already breaking records in his native Ireland, Colfer introduces readers to a lovable but troubled heroine, who has been given the opportunity for a special kind of redemption. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meg Finn is in trouble-unearthly trouble. Cast out of her home by her stepfather after her mother's death, Meg is a wanderer, a troublemaker. But after her latest stunt, finding a place to sleep is the least of her worries. Belch, her partner in crime, has gotten her involved in the attempted robbery of an elderly man, Lowrie McCall. And things go horribly wrong. After an accidental explosion, Meg's spirit is flung into limbo, and a race begins between the demonic and the divine to win her soul. Irreverent, hilarious, and touchingly hopeful, The Wish List takes readers on a journey of second chances, where joy is found in the most unexpected places.</description>

  <description>And so, Stanley Yelnats seems set to serve an easy sentence, which is only fair because he is as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he is. Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a bizarre, almost otherworldly place that has no lake and nothing that is green. Nor is it a camp, at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. It is a place that once held "the largest lake in Texas," but today it is only a scorching desert wasteland, dotted with countless holes dug by the boys who live at the camp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trouble started when Stanley was accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated by basketball great Clyde "Sweetfeet" Livingston to a celebrity auction. In court, the judge doesn't believe Stanley's claim that the shoes fell from the sky onto his head. And yet, that's exactly what happened. Oddly, though, Stanley doesn't blame the judge for falsely convicting him. Instead, he blames the whole misadventure on his "no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather." Thanks to this benighted distant relative, the Yelnats family had been cursed for generations. For Stanley, his current troubles are just a natural part of being a Yelnats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Camp Green Lake, the warden makes the boys "build character" by spending all day, every day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the treacherous warden is searching for something, and before long Stanley begins his own search—for the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fate conspires to resolve it all—the family curse, the mystery of the holes, the drought that destroyed Green Lake, and also, the legend of Kissing Kate Barlow, an infamous outlaw of the Wild West. The great wheel of justice has ground slowly for generations, but now it is about to reveal its verdict.</description>

It is his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and there are spells to be learnt, potions to be brewed and Divination lessons (sigh) to be attended.

  <description>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girl's bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble beings, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.  She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.  Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An unforgettable epic romantic thriller about a girl from the future who might be able to save the world . . . if she lets go of the one thing she’s found to hold on to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow the rules. Remember what happened. Never fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of seventeen-year-old Prenna James, who immigrated to New York when she was twelve. Except Prenna didn’t come from a different country. She came from a different time—a future where a mosquito-borne illness has mutated into a pandemic, killing millions and leaving the world in ruins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prenna and the others who escaped to the present day must follow a strict set of rules: never reveal where they’re from, never interfere with history, and never, ever be intimate with anyone outside their community. Prenna does as she’s told, believing she can help prevent the plague that will one day ravage the earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But everything changes when Prenna falls for Ethan Jarves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Ann Brashares, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&lt;/em&gt; series, The Here and Now is thrilling, exhilarating, haunting, and heartbreaking—and a must-read novel of the year.</description>

  <description>At the Manhattan School for Art and Music, where everyone is “different” and everyone is “special,” Gretchen Yee feels ordinary. She’s the kind of girl who sits alone at lunch, drawing pictures of Spider-Man, so she won’t have to talk to anyone; who has a crush on Titus but won’t do anything about it; who has no one to hang out with when her best (and only real) friend Katya is busy.&lt;br&gt;One day, Gretchen wishes that she could be a fly on the wall in the boys’ locker room–just to learn more about guys. What are they really like? What do they really talk about? Are they really cretins most of the time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fly on the Wall&lt;/em&gt; is the story of how that wish comes true.</description>

  <description>Before our history began, another now forgotten civilization thrived. The people who roamed Early Earth were much like us: curious, emotional, funny, ambitious, and vulnerable. In this series of illustrated and linked tales, Isabel Greenberg chronicles the explorations of a young man as he paddles from his home in the North Pole to the South Pole. There, he meets his true love, but their romance is ill-fated. Early Earth's unusual and finicky polarity means the lovers can never touch. &lt;br&gt;     As intricate and richly imagined as the work of Chris Ware, and leavened with a dry wit that rivals Kate Beaton's in &lt;em&gt;Hark! A Vagrant&lt;/em&gt;, Isabel Greenberg's debut will be a welcome addition to the thriving graphic novel genre.</description>

  <description>Tim Macbeth, a seventeen-year-old albino and a recent transfer to the prestigious Irving School, where the motto is “Enter here to be and find a friend.” A friend is the last thing Tim expects or wants—he just hopes to get through his senior year unnoticed. Yet, despite his efforts to blend into the background, he finds himself falling for the quintessential “It” girl, Vanessa Sheller, girlfriend of Irving’s most popular boy. To Tim's surprise, Vanessa is into him, too, but she can kiss her social status goodbye if anyone ever finds out. Tim and Vanessa begin a clandestine romance, but looming over them is the Tragedy Paper, Irving’s version of a senior year thesis, assigned by the school’s least forgiving teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jumping between viewpoints of the love-struck Tim and Duncan, a current senior about to uncover the truth of Tim and Vanessa, The Tragedy Paper is a compelling tale of forbidden love and the lengths people will go to keep their love.</description>

  <description>It says quite a lot about Jeremy Johnson Johnson that the strangest thing about him isn't even the fact his mother and father both had the same last name. Jeremy once admitted he's able to hear voices, and the townspeople of Never Better have treated him like an outsider since. After his mother left, his father became a recluse, and it's been up to Jeremy to support the family. But it hasn't been up to Jeremy alone. The truth is, Jeremy can hear voices. Or, specifically, one voice: the voice of the ghost of Jacob Grimm, one half of the infamous writing duo, The Brothers Grimm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob watches over Jeremy, protecting him from an unknown dark evil whispered about in the space between this world and the next. But when the provocative local girl Ginger Boultinghouse takes an interest in Jeremy (and his unique abilities), a grim chain of events is put into motion. And as anyone familiar with the Grimm Brothers know, not all fairy tales have happy endings...</description>

      <![CDATA[This is the story of a boy, a girl, and a ghost, who happens to be one of the brothers Grimm.  He is the narrator, and does a wonderful job (I especially enjoyed the audio version!).  The story is creepy and a fantastical, like a Grimm fairy tale.  I really enjoyed the originality!]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Tender Morsels &lt;/em&gt;is a dark and vivid story, set in two worlds and worrying at the border between them. Liga lives modestly in her own personal heaven, a world given to her in exchange for her earthly life. Her two daughters grow up in this soft place, protected from the violence that once harmed their mother. But the real world cannot be denied forever—magicked men and wild bears break down the borders of Liga’s refuge. Now, having known Heaven, how will these three women survive in a world where beauty and brutality lie side by side?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winning what you want may cost you everything you love&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a general’s daughter in a vast empire that revels in war and enslaves those it conquers, seventeen-year-old Kestrel has two choices: she can join the military or get married. But Kestrel has other intentions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day, she is startled to find a kindred spirit in a young slave up for auction. Arin’s eyes seem to defy everything and everyone. Following her instinct, Kestrel buys him—with unexpected consequences. It’s not long before she has to hide her growing love for Arin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he, too, has a secret, and Kestrel quickly learns that the price she paid for a fellow human is much higher than she ever could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a richly imagined new world, &lt;em&gt;The Winner’s Curse&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Rutkoski is a story of deadly games where everything is at stake, and the gamble is whether you will keep your head or lose your heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Incapable. Awkward. Artless. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what the other girls whisper behind her back. But sixteen-year-old Adelice Lewys has a secret: She wants to fail. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gifted with the ability to weave time with matter, she’s exactly what the Guild is looking for, and in the world of Arras, being chosen to work the looms is everything a girl could want. It means privilege, eternal beauty, and being something other than a secretary. It also means the power to manipulate the very fabric of reality. But if controlling what people eat, where they live, and how many children they have is the price of having it all, Adelice isn’t interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that her feelings matter, because she slipped and used her hidden talent for a moment. Now she has one hour to eat her mom’s overcooked pot roast. One hour to listen to her sister’s academy gossip and laugh at her dad’s jokes. One hour to pretend everything’s okay. And one hour to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because tonight, they’ll come for her.</description>

  <description>Incarceron -- a futuristic prison, sealed from view, where the descendants of the original prisoners live in a dark world torn by rivalry and savagery. It is a terrifying mix of high technology -- a living building which pervades the novel as an ever-watchful, ever-vengeful character, and a typical medieval torture chamber -- chains, great halls, dungeons. A young prisoner, Finn, has haunting visions of an earlier life, and cannot believe he was born here and has always been here. In the outer world, Claudia, daughter of the Warden of Incarceron, is trapped in her own form of prison -- a futuristic world constructed beautifully to look like a past era, an imminent marriage she dreads. She knows nothing of Incarceron, except that it exists. But there comes a moment when Finn, inside Incarceron, and Claudia, outside, simultaneously find a device -- a crystal key, through which they can talk to each other. And so the plan for Finn's escape is born ...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a world free of bloodshed and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not that world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art student and monster's apprentice Karou finally has the answers she has always sought. She knows who she is—and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; she is. But with this knowledge comes another truth she would give anything to undo: She loved the enemy and he betrayed her, and a world suffered for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this stunning sequel to the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/em&gt;, Karou must decide how far she'll go to avenge her people. Filled with heartbreak and beauty, secrets and impossible choices, &lt;em&gt;Days of Blood &amp;amp; Starlight&lt;/em&gt; finds Karou and Akiva on opposing sides as an age-old war stirs back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Karou and her allies build a monstrous army in a land of dust and starlight, Akiva wages a different sort of battle: a battle for redemption. For &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can any hope be salvaged from the ashes of their broken dream?</description>

  <description>Scarlett March lives to hunt the Fenris--the werewolves that took her eye when she was defending her sister Rosie from a brutal attack. Armed with a razor-sharp hatchet and blood-red cloak, Scarlett is an expert at luring and slaying the wolves. She's determined to protect other young girls from a grisly death, and her raging heart will not rest until every single wolf is dead. &lt;p&gt;Rosie March once felt her bond with her sister was unbreakable. Owing Scarlett her life, Rosie hunts ferociously alongside her. But even as more girls' bodies pile up in the city and the Fenris seem to be gaining power, Rosie dreams of a life beyond the wolves. She finds herself drawn to Silas, a young woodsman who is deadly with an ax and Scarlett's only friend--but does loving him mean betraying her sister and all that they've worked for?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In his first book for young adults, bestselling author Sherman Alexie tells the story of Junior, a budding cartoonist growing up on the Spokane Indian Reservation. Determined to take his future into his own hands, Junior leaves his troubled school on the rez to attend an all-white farm town high school where the only other Indian is the school mascot. Heartbreaking, funny, and beautifully written, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, which is based on the author's own experiences, coupled with poignant drawings by acclaimed artist Ellen Forney, that reflect the character's art, chronicles the contemporary adolescence of one Native American boy as he attempts to break away from the life he was destined to live.</description>

It's also painfully sad at times.  The story revolves around a boy who realizes he is headed toward a dead end if he remains in the reservati...]]>

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Kyra has grown up in an isolated community without questioning the fact that her father has three wives and she has twenty brothers and sisters, with two more on the way. That is, without questioning them much---if you don’t count her secret visits to the Mobile Library on Wheels to read forbidden books, or her meetings with Joshua, the boy she hopes to choose for herself instead of having a man chosen for her. &lt;p&gt;But when the Prophet decrees that she must marry her sixty-year-old uncle---who already has six wives---Kyra must make a desperate choice in the face of violence and her own fears of losing her family forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>“I’ve got my entire life planned out for the next ten years — including my PhD and Pulitzer Prize,” claims 16-year-old overachiever Vassar Spore, daughter of overachiever parents, who in true overachiever fashion named her after an elite women’s college. Vassar expects her sophomore summer to include AP and AAP (Advanced &lt;em&gt;Advanced&lt;/em&gt; Placement) classes. Surprise! Enter a world-traveling relative who sends her plans into a tailspin when she blackmails Vassar’s parents into forcing their only child to backpack with her through Southeast Asia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a journey from Malaysia to Cambodia to the remote jungles of Laos, Vassar sweats, falls in love, hones her outdoor survival skills — and uncovers a family secret that turns her whole world upside-down.      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Vassar Spore can &lt;em&gt;plan&lt;/em&gt; on one thing: she’ll never be the same again.&lt;br&gt;</description>

Jenny Lowe, a primatologist studying chimpanzees—the bonobos—is running for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A civil war has exploded and Jenny is trapped in its crosshairs . . . She runs to the camp of a fellow primatologist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rebels have already been there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone is dead except a young girl, the daughter of Jenny’s brutally murdered fellow scientist—and competitor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenny and the child flee, Jenny grabbing the notebooks of the primatologist who’s been killed. She brings the girl to Chicago to await the discovery of her relatives. The girl is fifteen and lovely—her name is Lucy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Realizing that the child has no living relatives, Jenny begins to care for her as her own. When she reads the notebooks written by Lucy’s father, she discovers that the adorable, lovely, magical Lucy is the result of an experiment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is part human, part ape—a hybrid human being . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laurence Gonzales’s novel grabs you from its opening pages and you stay with it, mesmerized by the shy but fierce, wonderfully winning Lucy.</description>

  <description>Think vampires are romantic, sexy, and powerful? Think again. Vampires are dead. And unless they want to end up staked, they have to give up fanging people, admit their addiction, join a support group, and reform themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nina Harrison, fanged at fifteen and still living with her mother, hates the Reformed Vampire Support Group meetings every Tuesday night. Even if she does appreciate Dave, who was in a punk band when he was alive, nothing exciting ever happens. That is, until one of group members is mysteriously destroyed by a silver bullet. With Nina (determined to prove that vamps aren't useless or weak) and Dave (secretly in love with Nina) at the helm, the misfit vampires soon band together to track down the hunter, save a werewolf, and keep the world safe from the likes of themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The perfect anecdote to slick vampire novels, this murder-mystery comedy of errors will thrill fans of Evil Genius.</description>

The story is narrated by Nina, who was "fanged" at 15, so still looks (and acts) like a teenager.  She meets with other vampires in Sydney, Australia who don't want to become ruthless murd...]]>

  <description>On the morning of her wedding, Pell Ridley creeps out of bed in the dark, kisses her sisters goodbye and flees — determined to escape a future that offers nothing but hard work and sorrow. She takes the only thing that truly belongs to her: Jack, a white horse, and small mute Bean who refuses to be left behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The road ahead is rich with longing, silence and secrets, and each encounter leads her closer to the untold story of her past. Then Pell meets a hunter, infuriating, mysterious and cold. Will he help her to find what she seeks?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all the hallmarks of Meg Rosoff’s extraordinary writing, &lt;strong&gt;The Bride’s Farewell&lt;/strong&gt; also breaks new ground for this author, in a nineteenth-century, Hardyesque setting. This is a moving story of love and lost things, with a core of deep, beautiful romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Vlad has to keep his vampire urges under control while dealing with the pressures of middle school. Thirteen-year-old Vladimir Tod really hates junior high. Bullies harass him, the principal is dogging him, and the girl he likes prefers his best friend. Oh, and Vlad has a secret: His mother was human, but his father was a vampire. With no idea of the extent of his powers, Vlad struggles daily with his blood cravings and his enlarged fangs. When a substitute teacher begins to question him a little too closely, Vlad worries that his cover is about to be blown. But then he faces a much bigger problem: He’s being hunted by a vampire killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch a QuickTime trailer for this book.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>SELECTED BY &lt;em&gt;Good Morning America's&lt;/em&gt; "READ THIS!" BOOK CLUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in South Carolina in 1964, &lt;em&gt;The Secret Life of Bees&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Lily Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. When Lily's fierce-hearted black "stand-in mother," Rosaleen, insults three of the deepest racists in town, Lily decides to spring them both free. They escape to Tiburon, South Carolina--a town that holds the secret to her mother's past. Taken in by an eccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters, Lily is introduced to their mesmerizing world of bees and honey, and the Black Madonna. This is a remarkable novel about divine female power, a story women will share and pass on to their daughters for years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PENGUIN READERS GUIDE INSIDE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Description from back cover of book.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is the story of a teenage boy, Steve Harmon, on trial for helping 2 men hold up a drug store.  Steve is really into filmmaking, and writes most of the story of his trial in screenplay form.  It works really well, drawing in the reader and helping bring it to life.  Plus, it took about 2 hours o...]]>

  <description>Ivan is an easygoing gorilla. Living at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade, he has grown accustomed to humans watching him through the glass walls of his domain. He rarely misses his life in the jungle. In fact, he hardly ever thinks about it at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, Ivan thinks about TV shows he’s seen and about his friends Stella, an elderly elephant, and Bob, a stray dog. But mostly Ivan thinks about art and how to capture the taste of a mango or the sound of leaves with color and a well-placed line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he meets Ruby, a baby elephant taken from her family, and she makes Ivan see their home—and his own art—through new eyes. When Ruby arrives, change comes with her, and it’s up to Ivan to make it a change for the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katherine Applegate blends humor and poignancy to create Ivan’s unforgettable first-person narration in a story of friendship, art, and hope.</description>

  <description>In the beginning they were a group of nine. Nine aliens who left their home planet of Lorien when it fell under attack by the evil Mogadorian. Nine aliens who scattered on Earth. Nine aliens who look like ordinary teenagers living ordinary lives, but who have extraordinary, paranormal skills. Nine aliens who might be sitting next to you now. The Nine had to separate and go into hiding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mogadorian caught Number One in Malaysia, Number Two in England, and Number Three in Kenya. All of them were killed. John Smith, of Paradise, Ohio, is Number Four. He knows that he is next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I AM NUMBER FOUR is the thrilling launch of a series about an exceptional group of teens as they struggle to outrun their past, discover their future—and live a normal life on Earth.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: Lena Haloway is content in her safe, government-managed society. She feels (mostly) relaxed about the future in which her husband and career will be decided, and looks forward to turning 18, when she’ll be cured of deliria, a.k.a. love. She tries not to think about her mother’s suicide (her last words to Lena were a forbidden “I love you”) or the supposed “Invalid” community made up of the uncured just beyond her Portland, Maine, border. There’s no real point—she believes her government knows how to best protect its people, and should do so at any cost. But 95 days before her cure, Lena meets Alex, a confident and mysterious young man who makes her heart flutter and her skin turn red-hot. As their romance blossoms, Lena begins to doubt the intentions of those in power, and fears that her world will turn gray should she submit to the procedure. In this powerful and beautifully written novel, Lauren Oliver, the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt;, throws readers into a tightly controlled society where options don’t exist, and shows not only the lengths one will go for a chance at freedom, but also the true meaning of sacrifice. --&lt;em&gt;Jessica Schein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lauren Oliver’s &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; Playlist &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117060.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117061.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, the government requires that all teenagers be cured of love, a.k.a. deliria, to keep society safe. But 95 days before her treatment, Lena Haloway falls for a boy--and must face the truth about her own feelings and the world in which she lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this exclusive playlist, Lauren Oliver shares the songs that capture this haunting novel about the power of love and what one will risk in order to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Gayle Forman and Lauren Oliver: Author One-on-One&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gayle Forman is is a self-described "perpetual teenager" and an award-winning author and journalist whose articles have appeared in numerous publications. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and children.  She is the author of &lt;em&gt;Where She Went&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;.  Recently she sat down with Lauren Oliver to discuss their work. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Lauren interviewed Gayle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Gayle Forman&lt;/em&gt;: Lauren Oliver is kind of mind-blowing. She wrote her intensely moving debut, Before I Fall when she was 26, which seems impossible given the book’s depth and wisdom. She followed up with the deliciously provocative love story &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, the first of a trilogy, and her first middle-grade book, &lt;em&gt;Liesl &amp;amp; Po&lt;/em&gt; comes out in the fall of 2011. On top of that, she’s constantly cooking up book ideas for her literary development company. Somehow, she managed to slow down long enough for us to talk shop over lunch in our mutual hometown, Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img alt="Gayle Forman" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117062.gif" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; You have like 100 balls in the air. Are you one of those people who thrives on an insane amount of activity?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been busy and overextended my whole life. I wrote half of &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; while I had a full-time job, was a full-time grad student, and worked part-time in a nightclub. I wrote the first half of the book on my phone on the subway. I’d email the chapters to myself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; You wrote the book on your phone?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s very rare that I write on my computer. A lot of times I’m writing on subways or in the back of cabs or on airplanes. I know the exact quantity of lines on my BlackBerry and how it relates to word count.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that brings me right to my question about process. How does an idea become a book for you? How did &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; arrive?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’d read an essay by Gabriel Garcia Marquez that said that all great books are either about death or love and I’d already written about death. And I started thinking that I’d never written a love story. It was out of my comfort zone. The next day I was at the gym, and the TV was on and the news report was all about the swine flu epidemic. It was the latest in the flu scares. And I thought it was so weird how easily people become panicked. You can convince people that anything is an epidemic. So much is propaganda. And the two ideas just combined in my head. And the character of Lena started narrating immediately.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img alt="Lauren Oliver" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117063.gif" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Moral of the story, budding writers: Go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of my breakthrough ideas come at the gym or while showering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Me too!  And I’ll run out and start writing and be dripping in a towel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve actually ruined computers that way. I think what happens is punctuated equilibrium: a period when changes are accumulating but not visibly, the simmering is happening. Then, when your mind is very relaxed, what was unconscious becomes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; On the surface, there’s a very big leap between your first two books. &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; follows Sam, a prototypical mean girl who has to relive the last day of her life while &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; follows Lena who lives in a creepy world in which love has been outlawed. But really, both of these girls start out conformists and challenge the constraints on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Transformation is very important to me. I definitely am very interested in how people become who they are. In change. In characters who are damaged who and who feel initially unlovable—and in their redemption through feelings of love.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Who are you more like, Lena or Sam?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Sam is more similar to how I was in high school. I was rebellious. I went out and partied and did all the bad things that she did. Lena is just… she’s so obedient and so scared of doing anything wrong. I was so fond of her. I kind of loved her in this way, I felt so protective of her. She’s so fragile and also brave.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; That was exactly how I felt about Mia in &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;. I loved the strength of both Sam and Lena, in relation to their love interests. Even in &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, where Alex is the one who sparks Lena’s rebellion, she’s no damsel in distress.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t believe in damsels. That’s not a model of femininity or heroism I subscribe to. Everyone has to learn to save themselves. It can be through the mechanisms of loving other people but you have to learn to save yourself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Dystopian fiction is very hot right now. Did you have any idea you’d be on the cutting edge of this trend?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I never heard that word when I wrote &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, I knew what it meant but not as a category. &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to be a meditation on love, what it does, good and bad. Because there have been times when if I could have reached inside to take out my own heart out, I would’ve. Books can’t come from categories; they come from a desire to say something about the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Forget everything you ever knew about unicorns...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Real unicorns are venomous, man-eating monsters with huge fangs and razor-sharp horns. Fortunately, they've been extinct for a hundred and fifty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astrid had always scoffed at her eccentric mother's stories about killer unicorns. But when one of the monsters attacks her boyfriend—thereby ruining any chance of him taking her to the prom—Astrid finds herself headed to Rome to train as a unicorn hunter at the ancient cloisters the hunters have used for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, at the cloisters all is not what it seems. Outside, the unicorns wait to attack. And within, Astrid faces other, unexpected threats: from the crumbling, bone-covered walls that vibrate with a terrible power to the hidden agendas of her fellow hunters to—perhaps most dangerously of all—her growing attraction to a handsome art student ... an attraction that could jeopardize everything.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Pretty girls in pretty dresses, partying until dawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Irresistible boys with mischievous smiles and dangerous intentions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;White lies, dark secrets, and scandalous hookups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Manhattan, 1899. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful sisters Elizabeth and Diana Holland rule Manhattan’s social scene. Or so it appears. When the girls discover their status among New York City’s elite is far from secure, suddenly everyone—from the backstabbing socialite Penelope Hayes, to the debonair bachelor Henry Schoonmaker, to the spiteful maid Lina Broud—threatens Elizabeth’s and Diana’s golden future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the fate of the Hollands resting on her shoulders, Elizabeth must choose between family duty and true love. But when her carriage overturns near the East River, the girl whose glittering life lit up the city’s gossip pages is swallowed by the rough current. As all of New York grieves, some begin to wonder whether life at the top proved too much for this ethereal beauty, or if, perhaps, someone wanted to see Manhattan’s most celebrated daughter disappear...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world of luxury and deception, where appearance matters above everything and breaking the social code means running the risk of being ostracized forever, five teenagers lead dangerously scandalous lives. This thrilling trip to the age of innocence is anything but innocent.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Revenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eugenides, the Thief of Eddis, stole Hamiathes's Gift, the Queen of Attolia lost more than a mythical relic. She lost face. Everyone knew that Eugenides had outwitted and escaped her. To restore her reputation and reassert her power, the Queen of Attolia will go to any length and accept any help that is offered...she will risk her country to execute the perfect revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eugenides can steal anything. And he taunts the Queen of Attolia, moving through her strongholds seemingly at will. So Attolia waits, secure in the knowledge that the Thief will slip, that he will haunt her palace one too many times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; ...at what price?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eugenides finds his small mountain country at war with Attolia, he must steal a man, he must steal a queen, he must steal peace. But his greatest triumph, and his greatest loss, comes in capturing something that the Queen of Attolia thought she had sacrificed long ago...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books for the Teen Age 2001 (NYPL) and Bulletin Blue Ribbon Best of 2000 Award</description>

The Queen of Attolia has many of the same elements, including the interesting personality of the main character, Eugenides.

  <description>By scheming and theft, the Thief of Eddis has become King of Attolia. Eugenides wanted the queen, not the crown, but he finds himself trapped in a web of his own making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he drags a naive young guard into the center of the political maelstrom. Poor Costis knows he is the victim of the king's caprice, but his contempt for Eugenides slowly turns to grudging respect. Though struggling against his fate, the newly crowned king is much more than he appears. Soon the corrupt Attolian court will learn that its subtle and dangerous intrigue is no match for Eugenides.</description>

  <description>After the grisly murder of his entire family, a toddler wanders into a graveyard where the ghosts and other supernatural residents agree to raise him as one of their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead. There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack—who has already killed Bod's family . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beloved master storyteller Neil Gaiman returns with a luminous new novel for the audience that embraced his New York Times bestselling modern classic Coraline. Magical, terrifying, and filled with breathtaking adventures, The Graveyard Book is sure to enthrall readers of all ages.</description>

The author was so inventive and I never knew what was going to happen next.  The book is scary, funny, sad, sweet, and beautiful.]]>

It is an exceptional community. Everyone is happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jacob nears his thirteenth birthday, he anxiously anticipates his new role as an adult and all the changes that will bring. But as the day approaches, a far greater change threatens Jacob's future. It all starts with a searing pain in his eyes ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first book of David Stahler Jr.'s gripping Truesight trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ages 12+</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;There are six things very wrong with my life:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. I have one of those under-the-skin spots that will never come to a head but lurk in a red way for the next two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. It is on my nose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. I have a three-year-old sister who may have peed somewhere in my room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. In fourteen days the summer hols will be over and then it will be back to Stalag 14 and Oberfuhrer Frau Simpson and her bunch of sadistic teachers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. I am very ugly and need to go into an ugly home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. I went to a party dressed as a stuffed olive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this wildly funny journal of a year in the life of Georgia Nicolson, British author Louise Rennison has perfectly captured the soaring joys and bottomless angst of being a teenager. In the spirit of &lt;em&gt;Bridget Jones's Diary&lt;/em&gt;, this fresh, irreverent, and simply hilarious book will leave you laughing out loud. As Georgia would say, it's "Fabbity fab fab!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;About the Author:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise Rennison lives in Brighton, the San Francisco of England (apart from the sun, Americans, the Golden Gate Bridge, and earthquakes). Since the success of her one-woman autobiographical show, &lt;em&gt;Stevie Wonder Felt My Face&lt;/em&gt;, she has written for many British comedy stars; currently she is a roving reporter and columnist and is working on two more books about Georgia. She has two goldfish, Finn and Bjork, who are her biggest fans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This book was hilarious!  Georgia, the "heroine", is 14 and so incredibly vain and shallow that she's impossible not to like.

  <description>One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</description>

      <![CDATA[It took me a lot longer to finish this one.  I think it's because I kept getting angry at Tris.  She couldn't think very far in advance, and so many of her choices messed things up.  But the conclusion (which took a long time to get to) helped make up for it.  Too bad so many people had to die along...]]>

  <description>Fourteen-year-old Sophronia is the bane of her mother's existence. Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper etiquette at tea--and god forbid anyone see her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. She enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But little do Sophronia or her mother know that this is a school where ingenious young girls learn to finish, all right--but it's a different kind of finishing. Mademoiselle Geraldine's certainly trains young ladies in the finer arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but also in the other kinds of finishing: the fine arts of death, diversion, deceit, espionage, and the modern weaponries. Sophronia and her friends are going to have a rousing first year at school.</description>

In this world, there are also vampires and werewolves, but most of them are very well-behaved.  I enjoyed the story, but I didn't find it very compelling.  I'm...]]>

  <description>Late on a hot summer night in 1965, Charlie Bucktin, a precocious and bookish boy of thirteen, is startled by an urgent knock on the window of his sleep-out. His visitor is Jasper Jones, an outcast in the regional mining town of Corrigan. Rebellious, mixed-race and solitary, Jasper is a distant figure of danger and intrigue for Charlie. So when Jasper begs for his help, Charlie eagerly steals into the night by his side, terribly afraid but desperate to impress. Jasper takes him to his secret glade in the bush, and it's here that Charlie bears witness to Jasper's horrible discovery. With his secret like a brick in his belly, Charlie is pushed and pulled by a town closing in on itself in fear and suspicion as he locks horns with his tempestuous mother; falls nervously in love and battles to keep a lid on his zealous best friend, Jeffrey Lu. And in vainly attempting to restore the parts that have been shaken loose, Charlie learns to discern the truth from the myth, and why white lies creep like a curse. In the simmering summer where everything changes, Charlie learns why the truth of things is so hard to know, and even harder to hold in his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This edition is now out of print.</description>

  <description>Mirabelle's past is shrouded in secrecy, from her parents' tragic deaths to her guardians' half-truths about why she can't return to her birthplace, Beau Rivage. Desperate to see the town, Mira runs away a week before her sixteenth birthday—and discovers a world she never could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Beau Rivage, nothing is what it seems—the strangely pale girl with a morbid interest in apples, the obnoxious playboy who's a beast to everyone he meets, and the chivalrous guy who has a thing for damsels in distress. Here, fairy tales come to life, curses are awakened, and ancient stories are played out again and again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fairy tales aren't pretty things, and they don't always end in happily ever after. Mira has a role to play, a fairy tale destiny to embrace or resist. As she struggles to take control of her fate, Mira is drawn into the lives of two brothers with fairy tale curses of their own . . . brothers who share a dark secret. And she'll find that love, just like fairy tales, can have sharp edges and hidden thorns.</description>

  <description>All Jin Wang wants is to fit in. When his family moves to a new neighborhood, he suddenly finds that he's the only Chinese American student at his school. Jocks and bullies pick on him constantly, and he has hardly any friends. Then, to make matters worse, he falls in love with an all-American girl...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born to rule over all the monkeys in the world, the story of the Monkey King is one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables. Adored by his subjects, master of the arts of kung-fu, he is the most powerful monkey on earth. But the Monkey King doesn't want to be a monkey. He wants to be hailed as a god...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, and he's ruining his cousin Danny's life. Danny's a popular kid at school, but every year Chin-Kee comes to visit, and every year Danny has to transfer to a new school to escape the shame. This year, though, things quickly go from bad to worse...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These three apparently unrelated tales come together with an unexpected twist, in a modern fable that is hilarious, poignant and action-packed. &lt;em&gt;American Born Chinese&lt;/em&gt; is an amazing rise, all the way up to the astonishing climax--and confirms what a growing number of readers already know: Gene Yang is a major talent.</description>

  <description>Mackie Doyle is not one of us. Though he lives in the small town of Gentry, he comes from a world of tunnels and black murky water, a world of living dead girls ruled by a little tattooed princess. He is a Replacement, left in the crib of a human baby sixteen years ago. Now, because of fatal allergies to iron, blood, and consecrated ground, Mackie is fighting to survive in the human world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mackie would give anything to live among us, to practice on his bass or spend time with his crush, Tate. But when Tate's baby sister goes missing, Mackie is drawn irrevocably into the underworld of Gentry, known as Mayhem. He must face the dark creatures of the Slag Heaps and find his rightful place, in our world, or theirs.</description>

      <![CDATA[Very creepy yet entertaining.  The story is based on a town that is "prosperous" because every 7 years, one of their children gets stolen and a demon/faerie baby replaces that child.  I put prosperous in quotes because it didn't really seem that way to me.  The story is told by Mackie, one of the re...]]>

  <description>Just when seventeen-year-old Cullen Witter thinks he understands everything about his small and painfully dull Arkansas town, it all disappears. . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer before Cullen's senior year, a nominally-depressed birdwatcher named John Barling thinks he spots a species of woodpecker thought to be extinct since the 1940s in Lily, Arkansas. His rediscovery of the so-called Lazarus Woodpecker sparks a flurry of press and woodpecker-mania. Soon all the kids are getting woodpecker haircuts and everyone's eating "Lazarus burgers." But as absurd as the town's carnival atmosphere has become, nothing is more startling than the realization that Cullen’s sensitive, gifted fifteen-year-old brother Gabriel has suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Cullen navigates his way through a summer of finding and losing love, holding his fragile family together, and muddling his way into adulthood, a young missionary in Africa, who has lost his faith, is searching for any semblance of meaning wherever he can find it. As distant as the two stories seem at the start, they are thoughtfully woven ever closer together and through masterful plotting, brought face to face in a surprising and harrowing climax. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complex but truly extraordinary, tinged with melancholy and regret, comedy and absurdity, this novel finds wonder in the ordinary and emerges as ultimately hopeful. It's about a lot more than what Cullen calls, “that damn bird.” It’s about the dream of second chances.</description>

  <description>A strange novel for strange young people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young Samuel Johnson and his dachshund Boswell are trying to show initiative by trick-or-treating a full three days before Hallowe’en. Which is how they come to witness strange goings-on at 666 Crowley Avenue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Abernathys don’t mean any harm by their flirtation with Satanism. But it just happens to coincide with a malfunction in the Large Hadron Collider that creates a gap in the universe. A gap in which there is a pair of enormous gates. The gates to Hell. And there are some pretty terrifying beings just itching to get out. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Samuel persuade anyone to take this seriously? Can he harness the power of science to save the world as we know it?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Since their mother's death, Carter and Sadie have become near strangers. While Sadie has lived with her grandparents in London, her brother has traveled the world with their father, the brilliant Egyptologist, Dr. Julius Kane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, Dr. Kane brings the siblings together for a "research experiment" at the British Museum, where he hopes to set things right for his family. Instead, he unleashes the Egyptian god Set, who banishes him to oblivion and forces the children to flee for their lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Sadie and Carter discover that the gods of Egypt are waking, and the worst of them —Set— has his sights on the Kanes. To stop him, the siblings embark on a dangerous journey across the globe - a quest that brings them ever closer to the truth about their family and their links to a secret order that has existed since the time of the pharaohs.</description>

  <description>WELCOME TO FOO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourteen-year-old Leven Thumps (a.k.a. "Lev") lives a wretched life in Burnt Culvert, Oklahoma. But his life is about to change and his destiny be fulfilled as he learns about a secret gateway that bridges two worlds -- the real world and Foo, a place created  at the beginning of time in the folds of the mind that makes it possible for mankind to dream and hope, aspire and imagine. But Foo is in chaos, and three transplants from that dreamworld have been sent to retrieve Lev, who alone has the power to save Foo.&lt;p&gt;Enter Clover, a wisecracking, foot-high sidekick; Winter, a girl with a special power of her own; and Geth, the rightful heir to Foo. Their mission: to convince Lev that he has the power to save Foo. Can this unique band of travelers help Lev overcome his doubt? Will Lev find the gateway in time? Or will Sabine and his dark shadows find the gateway first and destroy mankind?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

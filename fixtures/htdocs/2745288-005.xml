  <description>*new adult romance*&lt;br&gt;**explicit scenes and language**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t care what my cousin says; I am not the queen of impossible relationships. I mean, just because my last boyfriend tried to kill me and left a bit of a scar on my neck, then forced me to move across the country and legally change my name to Reese Randall to escape him, does not mean—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Oh, who am I kidding? For a freshman in college, I have to have the worst dating track record ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It’s no wonder love is the last thing on my mind when Mason Lowe enters my life. But the chemistry between us is like bam! Our connection defies logic. And he’s just so freaking hot. Being around him makes me feel more alive than I’ve ever felt before. I even like bickering with him. He could be my soul mate...except for one teeny tiny glitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's a gigolo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boy, do I know how to pick them.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> Surprisingly, this actually works for the most part. A little too skeeved out by one thing to bump up the rating, but this was an engaging read with good chemistry between the leads. Loved how Reese interacts with his little sister, too. ]]>

  <description>For the first time, ten years after her abduction from her Salt Lake City bedroom, Elizabeth Smart reveals how she survived and the secret to forging a new life in the wake of a brutal crime&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On June 5, 2002, fourteen-year-old Elizabeth Smart, the daughter of a close-knit Mormon family, was taken from her home in the middle of the night by religious fanatic, Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. She was kept chained, dressed in disguise, repeatedly raped, and told she and her family would be killed if she tried to escape. After her rescue on March 12, 2003, she rejoined her family and worked to pick up the pieces of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now for the first time, in her memoir, MY STORY, she tells of the constant fear she endured every hour, her courageous determination to maintain hope, and how she devised a plan to manipulate her captors and convinced them to return to Utah, where she was rescued minutes after arriving.  Smart explains how her faith helped her stay sane in the midst of a nightmare and how she found the strength to confront her captors at their trial and see that justice was served.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the nine years after her rescue, Smart transformed from victim to advocate, traveling the country and working to educate, inspire and foster change. She has created a foundation to help prevent crimes against children and is a frequent public speaker. In  2012, she married Matthew Gilmour, whom she met doing mission work in Paris for her church, in a fairy tale wedding that made the cover of &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; magazine.</description>

  <description>Hope Delafield hasn’t always had an easy life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has red hair and a temper to match, as her mother is constantly reminding her. She can’t wear heels, is terrified of heights and being a primary school teacher isn’t exactly the job she dreamed of doing, especially when her class are stuck on the two times table.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least Hope has Jack, and Jack is the God of boyfriends. He’s sweet, kind, funny, has a killer smile, a cool job on a fashion magazine and he’s pretty (but in a manly way). Hope knew that Jack was The One ever since their first kiss after the Youth Club Disco and thirteen years later, they’re still totally in love. Totally. They’re even officially pre-engaged. And then Hope catches Jack kissing her best friend Susie…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does true love forgive and forget? Or does it get mad… and get even?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> The middle drags on for far too long and had me very frustrated with our heroine (I felt so bad for her, but the constant waffling made me so irritated, even though I understood it), but Sarra writes in such an engaging way and the bits with Wilson are SO worth sticking around for. <br /><br />]]>

  <description>Allie lost everything the night her boyfriend, Trip, died in a horrible car accident—including her memory of the event. As their small town mourns his death, Allie is afraid to remember because doing so means delving into what she’s kept hidden for so long: the horrible reality of their abusive relationship.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When the police reopen the investigation, it casts suspicion on Allie and her best friend, Blake, especially as their budding romance raises eyebrows around town. Allie knows she must tell the truth. Can she reach deep enough to remember that night so she can finally break free? Debut writer Jennifer Shaw Wolf takes readers on an emotional ride through the murky waters of love, shame, and, ultimately, forgiveness.</description>

  <description>She’s the sexiest secret at East Park University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rylan Willow is the top model for East Park Exposed, the university’s underground and insanely successful erotic magazine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her friends know her as Evan Cosette, a biochemistry major with a flawless GPA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;East Park Exposed has kept Evan’s tuition paid. All she has to do is keep up the naïve school-girl disguise when she’s on campus and her secret is safe, her two worlds separate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Dallas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the magazine runs a co-ed shoot to broaden readership, Evan’s partner is a gorgeous and disgustingly brilliant grad student. Evan doesn’t know how much of Dallas Whitley she’ll be able to handle, especially when he wants to study with her outside the studio. She promises herself that she can just be friends with Dallas. He has a girlfriend, after all. And Evan needs to focus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She can’t when the co-ed printing brings sales through the roof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She can’t when her photographer wants to crank the heat for the next issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every steamy shoot leaves Evan gasping for breath, her true feelings for Dallas clouded by their camera-charade. But the more time she spends with him in the real world, the more she risks someone finding out the truth about her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She needs to decide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who gets Dallas—Rylan, or Evan?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> Immensely readable and fun. Definitely adults only, however--I don't think I'd even put this in the New Adult category, although it is technically at the right age/time. It's just more erotica/soapy romance than anything else.<br /><br />]]>

  <description>Avery has just met her hot upstairs neighbor. He's irresistible. Tattooed. And a virgin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nursing student Avery Michaels wants nothing to do with dating—she's perfectly happy single. Privy to too many of her mother's bad decisions and even worse taste in boyfriends, all Avery can handle is a string of uncomplicated hookups whenever the mood strikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she meets smoking hot tattoo artist Bennett, she wants him—for just one night. But he won't accept a no-strings-attached arrangement. He lives by a straight-laced code of values based on his own troubled upbringing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bennett sees something special in Avery and he wants more from her. Way more. As Avery wrestles with her emotions for Bennett, danger and tragedy force them to open up to each other. And Avery must face the terrifying realization that she wants more from him, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she needs to make a choice—let Bennett go or finally let him &lt;em&gt;in.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Rebecca Blue is a rebel with an attitude whose life is changed by a chance encounter with a soon-to-be dead girl. Rebel (as she’s known) decides to complete the dead girl’s bucket list to prove that choice, not chance, controls her fate. In doing so, she unexpectedly opens her mind and heart to a world she once dismissed—a world of friendships, family, and faith. With a shaken sense of self, she must reevaluate her loner philosophy—particularly when she falls for Nate, the golden boy do-gooder who never looks out for himself. Perfect for fans of Jay Asher’s blockbuster hit Thirteen Reasons Why, Coriell’s second novel features her sharp, engaging voice along with realistic drama and unforgettable characters.</description>

  <description>In the future, humans live in city-like spaceships orbiting far above Earth's toxic atmosphere. No one knows when, or even if, the long-abandoned planet will be habitable again. But faced with dwindling resources and a growing populace, government leaders know they must reclaim their homeland... before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, one hundred juvenile delinquents are being sent on a high-stakes mission to recolonize Earth. After a brutal crash landing, the teens arrive on a savagely beautiful planet they've only seen from space. Confronting the dangers of this rugged new world, they struggle to form a tentative community. But they're haunted by their past and uncertain about the future. To survive, they must learn to trust - and even love - again.</description>

  <description>Instant bridegroom...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaan had been jilted! She'd been left at the altar by Piers Danvers...but Rafe Danvers was waiting to step right into his half brother's shoes. Older, darker, stronger and the head of the Danvers business empire, it was Rafe who had persuaded Piers to abandon Shaan. Now, with the same ruthless determination, Rafe insisted that she become his bride instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dazed, Shaan accepted his proposal, but she was also confused: until this moment, Rafe had acted as if he despised her. Suddenly he wanted to proclaim her to the world as his wife and, behind closed doors, to have her in his bed!</description>

  <description>She'd barely survived the terrible scandal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leonie knew the nightmare was behind her now, yet she couldn't help feeling bitter. Four years earlier her name had been splashed across the country on a charge of blackmail--a crime she'd been completely innocent of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Giles Noble, the powerful prosecuting attorney, hadn't been convinced. Leonie still burned at the memory. How she longed to set the record straight!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her chance came when fate threw Giles and her together for a weekend--a weekend that brought changes to last a lifetime!</description>

  <description>Saul Jerrard was the key to her dream&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man, they said, who knows his own mind and is about as tough to crack as a granite wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprisingly, Candace's visit to the South Pacific island of Fala'isi was going better than she'd expected. Saul was a charming, attractive man who actually seemed to like her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Candace was uneasy--his reaction could be just a facade to hide a deeper purpose. For she had no idea what Saul had in mind for her immediate future...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"You'll be quite safe with me."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially these simple words comforted Cressida, narrowly saved from the terrifying storm at sea that had taken her father's life. Physically and emotionally she needed the security of her rescuer, Luke Scrivener's New Zealand homestead and his powerful broad shoulders to lean on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But once surrounded by Luke's calm, immovable strength, Cressida, after years of being cloistered and controlled by her father, instinctively rebelled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be far too easy to become dependent once again--dependent, powerless and possessed by the magnetism of this vital man.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"See what you've got me into--"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finley wished she'd never set eyes on the woeful stray spaniel that led her into Blake Caird's realm. For although she was bound to recover from the pneumonia that had prompted her vacation, she'd never get over a man like Blake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What passed between them cut deeper than mere attraction, was more searing than physical passion. It was a recognition--an awareness that there was no going back. But Finley had to return to work sometime. She couldn't share Blake's isolated island paradise forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Living together seemed impossible--but living apart was infinitely worse....&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Beauty and the beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fashion model Simone Atkinson had her reasons for being afraid of men whose guarded expressions hid private demons. Which is why all alarms went off when Angus Grey began his pursuit. He'd obviously convinced himself he knew exactly the kind of woman she was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lost in a wasteland of bitter desire, Angus expected a greedy little sensualist, but Simone vowed to prove him wrong. Fascinated by his strength, his gentleness, the passion he kept so firmly under control, she was tempted to let down her guard. Dare she give love a second chance?</description>

  <description>Where she was concerned Trent had no scruples&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing--not even Trent's divorce--could alter the fact that he'd cruelly jilted Melly in favor of a more advantageous marriage. His undeniable love for her only made his betrayal all the more searing, her return to New Zealand even more unsettling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trent wanted her back. No, demanded it! Passion, trust... the lot. His single-minded ambition was to lay bare her love for him at any cost. Yet he hardly even tried to explain the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And until he did, how could Melly trust opportunity not to sway his ambition a second time?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It was hard to keep a distance between them&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because her late husband had made no secret of his hatred for Quinn Fraser, Camilla had tried to keep away from the man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Quinn Fraser was an arrogant, superior aristocrat-not the sort to respond to that sort of treatment. He was used to taking what he wanted. And it appeared he wanted Camilla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However hard she fought the attraction between them, she knew that the end result was inevitable. Perhaps she should just give in and save herself the struggle.....</description>

  <description>He was wrong in his assessment of her&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Completely wrong. But as far as Leon venetos was concerned, there was no smoke without fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scandalmongers had branded Alexa as the mistress of wealthy financier&lt;br&gt;Sam Darcy and that was enough for Leon. "Women like you are easily bought for the price of a few jewels," he told her contemptuously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was why Alexa fought so hard against the attraction that drew her inexorably toward him. A man who could never offer her what she really wanted....</description>

  &lt;em&gt;"He's tough and he's brilliant and he's got no weaknesses.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was how Leo Dacre's brother had described him. And Tansy Ormerod was about to find out just how accurate those words were! Leo intended to find out exactly what had happened to his drop-out half-brother Ricky. Tansy knew, but had no intention of telling him. But Leo wasn't used to being denied...especially by someone like Tansy! So when bribes and threats failed, he kidnapped her. Tansy was confident she would survive the ordeal intact. But that was before she realised the passions that Leo could release in her...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She wasn't a child anymore!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden knew little of life beyond her family's New Zealand sheep station. She realized exactly how little when Blade Hammond returned to Onemahutu. Five years had only enhanced his golden looks and rugged physique--and Eden's teenage crush. A crush that was now fueled by desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blade made it clear he still thought her a child. She couldn't compete with the glamorous sophisticates he dated--she could only suffer the torment of loving a man so far out of reach. But had Eden just imagined the flash of white-hot emotion behind the golden mask of Blade Hammond's features--or had Blade finally realized she was a woman ... ?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exciting, dangerous men do not make good husbands.  But neither do excitable, passionate adolescents make reasonable wives.  And so, with a little help from a big misunderstanding, Petra's marriage to New Zealand businessman Caine Fleming had failed very quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the eight years since Caine had left, Petra had grown up-hiding her pain behind a glossy, brittle mask of sophistication.  Now her cool demeanor only makes Caine more determined to break through that calm, serene shield to force the real Petra Fleming out of hiding-and turn the stone princess back into a passionate woman.</description>

  <description>She was his wife, not his mistress&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amber knew Alex would find her. You just didn't hide forever from one of the most powerful men in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nine years ago, as a naive young bride, Amber had fled from what she felt was an unbearable marriage. She'd always expected a reckoning for the public insult to a proud and formidable husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nothing had prepared her for Alex's unique revenge--her willing seduction! It would take all of Amber's willpower to resist the memories of how he was capable of making her feel.</description>

  <description>She never wanted a reconciliation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years ago Catlin Loring had stumbled on her husband in bed with another woman. Shattered, she'd fled New Zealand and begun a new life in Australia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, forced to return to Conal for a favor, she was surprised to discover he wanted her back. "All's fair in love and war," he said. "This is both. I'll use any trick I can to get you into my bed."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she was determined not to surrender her heart to a man--however persuasive and irresistible--who would never be satisfied with merely one woman.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"He's not a good man to fall in love with!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faine had not ignored the warning, but even without his wealth, charm and good looks, Burke Harding had a magnetism,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His determined pursuit and assault on her heart soon overcame her wavering resistance. She agreed to marry him, but some deep instinct of self-preservation kept her from revealing her love--and in time her decision was vindicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I carefully avoided telling you that I love you," he told her when Faine discovered she was a stand-in for the woman he really loved--but could not have.</description>

  <description>Prince Luka of Dacia is a man with a lot to lose if his secret leaks out too early. He trusts nothing and no one, least of all his unexpected desire for Alexa Mytton. She might be beautiful, but she's dangerous - and there's no time to get her off the remote island where she and he have come face-to-face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn between passion and privacy, Luka commands Alexa be detained for the purpose of indulging in both. He'll keep her behind closed doors, in the lap of luxury, entirely for his pleasure....</description>

  <description>Small towns are nothing if not friendly. Friendship, Wisconsin (population: &lt;s&gt;689&lt;/s&gt; 688) is no different. Around here, everyone wears a smile. And no one ever locks their doors. Until, that is, high school sweetheart Ruth Fried is found murdered. Strung up like a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Friendship’s police are more adept at looking for lost pets than catching killers. So Ruth’s best friend, Kippy Bushman, armed with only her tenacious Midwestern spirit and Ruth’s secret diary (which Ruth’s mother had asked her to read in order to redact any, you know, sex parts), sets out to find the murderer. But in a quiet town like Friendship—where no one is a suspect—anyone could be the killer.</description>

  <description>Grant Sullivan had been one of the government's most effective agents, and he's agreed to rescue Jane Hamilton Greer, a wealthy socialite possibly engaged in espionage. In the time they spent together, questions of guilt and innocence began to fade against the undeniable reality that two people from such different worlds should never have met.</description>

  <description>She was a beautiful heiress far from home who dreamed of being loved for herself alone. Arrogant and powerful, he didn't ask questions. He commanded and took her trust love, and passion - then left her with only her cold stubborn pride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They'd shared a night of enchantment, a night Deborah McLeod had paid for in endless nights of joyless solitude, alone with her memories-and her little son - until a strange twist of fate swept Storm Grainger from California to the McLeod's Virginia estate. In spite of herself she longed for him, ached for him. Now he stood before her. Four years ago he had used her and betrayed her. Would her own treacherous heart betray her now?</description>

  <description>Mary Rose Ramirez, daughter of Veronica Ganz, is named after her aunt, who died in a fire many years ago. Her aunt was a great hero – she saved the lives of everyone in her apartment building. At least, that’s what Mary Rose thinks until she finds a box of odds and ends her aunt had treasured, and overhears some conversation she shouldn’t.</description>

  <description>Alice Love is twenty-nine, crazy about her husband, and pregnant with her first child. &lt;br&gt;So imagine Alice’s surprise when she comes to on the floor of a gym (a gym! She HATES the gym) and is whisked off to the hospital where she discovers the honeymoon is truly over — she’s getting divorced, , she has three kids, and she’s actually 39 years old. Alice must reconstruct the events of a lost decade, and find out whether it’s possible to reconstruct her life at the same time. She has to figure out why her sister hardly talks to her, and how is it that she’s become one of those super skinny moms with really expensive clothes. Ultimately, Alice must discover whether forgetting is a blessing or a curse, and whether it’s possible to start over.</description>

  <description>Ginnie is delighted when she is asked to be a junior bridesmaid. But her joy is short-lived. Her first shock comes minutes after reading the invitation. A hard-packed snowball, tossed in fun by her friend Geneva, strikes her on the cheekbone, grazing her eye - which begins to turn black. A bridesmaid with a black eye! Impossible! There is nothing to do but to cancel plans for joining the wedding party. That calamity, however, is only the beginning. One crisis follows on the heels of another as Ginnie and her parents arrange to attend the ceremony as guests of the groom. The Christmas wedding is to be held in Nantucket. They plan to go by plane, but the weather is uncertain. Then Ginnie seems to be coming down with a virus - and at the last minute, the cat has kittens, which cannot be found! Will Ginnie and her family be able to get to the wedding after all?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A chilling and intense first novel, the story of a solitary young woman drawn into an online world run by a charismatic web guru who entices her into impersonating a glamorous but desperate woman.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Leila discovers the Web site Red Pill, she feels she has finally found people who understand her. A sheltered young woman raised by her mother, Leila has often struggled to connect with the girls at school; but on Red Pill, a chat forum for ethical debate, Leila comes into her own, impressing the Web site's founder, a brilliant and elusive man named Adrian. Leila is thrilled when Adrian asks to meet her, flattered when he invites her to be part of "Project Tess." Tess is a woman Leila might never have met in real life. She is beautiful, urbane, witty, and damaged. As they e-mail, chat, and Skype, Leila becomes enveloped in the world of Tess, learning every single thing she can about this other woman—because soon, Leila will have to become her. An ingeniously plotted novel of stolen identity, &lt;em&gt;Kiss Me First&lt;/em&gt; is brilliantly frightening about the lies we tell—to ourselves, to others, for good, and for ill.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> Fascinating, and not what I expected, both good and bad. I have no problems at all with the "unlikeability" of the narrator, and while the dispassionate writing style isn't my favorite, it could be a deliberate choice given the subject of the novel. It does lag a bit here and there, and...]]>

There's an interesting nostalgic tone in this narrative, and the carnie world is a fun place to be. <br /><br />It's a bit on the predictable side, and a little more complexity would have made it better.

  <description>On the outside, seventeen-year-old Madelyne Summers looks like your typical blond cheerleader—perky, popular, and dating the star quarterback. But inside, Maddie spends more time agonizing over what will happen in the next issue of her favorite comic book than planning pep rallies with her squad. That she’s a nerd hiding in a popular girl's body isn’t just unknown, it's anti-known. And she needs to keep it that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summer is the only time Maddie lets her real self out to play, but when she slips up and the adorkable guy behind the local comic shop’s counter uncovers her secret, she’s busted. Before she can shake a pom-pom, Maddie’s whisked into Logan’s world of comic conventions, live-action role-playing, and first-person-shooter video games. And she loves it. But the more she denies who she really is, the deeper her lies become…and the more she risks losing Logan forever.</description>

  <description>The mother-daughter partnership that produced the Little House books has fascinated scholars and readers alike. Now, John E. Miller, one of America’s leading authorities on Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane, combines analyses of both women to explore this collaborative process and shows how their books reflect the authors’ distinctive views of place, time, and culture. Along the way, he addresses the two most controversial issues for Wilder/Lane aficionados: how much did Lane actually contribute to the writing of the Little House books, and what was Wilder’s real attitude toward American Indians.&lt;br&gt;            Interpreting these writers in their larger historical and cultural contexts, Miller reconsiders their formidable artistic, political, and literary contributions to American cultural life in the 1930s. He looks at what was happening in 1932—from depression conditions and politics to chain stores and celebrity culture—to shed light on Wilder’s life, and he shows how actual “little houses” established ideas of home that resonated emotionally for both writers.&lt;br&gt;            In considering each woman’s ties to history, Miller compares Wilder with Frederick Jackson Turner as a frontier mythmaker and examines Lane’s unpublished history of Missouri in the context of a contemporaneous project, Thomas Hart Benton’s famous Jefferson City mural. He also looks at Wilder’s &lt;em&gt;Missouri Ruralist &lt;/em&gt;columns to assess her pre–Little House values and writing skills, and he readdresses her literary treatment of Native Americans. A final chapter shows how Wilder’s and Lane’s conservative political views found expression in their work, separating Lane’s more libertarian bent from Wilder’s focus on writing moralist children’s fiction.&lt;br&gt;            These nine thoughtful essays expand the critical discussion on Wilder and Lane beyond the Little House. Miller portrays them as impassioned and dedicated writers who were deeply involved in the historical changes and political challenges of their times—and contends that questions over the books’ authorship do not do justice to either woman’s creative investment in the series. Miller demystifies the aura of nostalgia that often prevents modern readers from seeing Wilder as a real-life woman, and he depicts Lane as a kindred artistic spirit, helping readers better understand mother and daughter as both women and authors.</description>

  <description>When Laura Ingalls Wilder was a little girl in the late 1800's, her family moved nine times in three years. The Wilders faced great hardships on the prairie. The crops they planted were destroyed by grasshoppers. Brutal snowstorms brought them close to starvation. But for Laura, who was born with her father's pioneer spirit, home wasn't a house--it was being with Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie. At the age of 65 she put pen to paper and wrote about her memories. Through hard work and the help of her daughter, Rose, she became a successful author. The wonderful books she left behind tell the story of a rich life in the face of good times and bad.</description>

  <description>      In 1894 Laura Ingalls Wilder, her husband Almanzo and their seven-year-old daughter Rose left their drought-stricken farm in South Dakota and traveled to a new farm -- and a new beginning -- in the Ozarks. In this extraordinary diary Mrs. Wilder describes the towns passed, the rivers crossed, and the many people they met along the way. And between the lines, and in Rose Wilder Lane's beautiful setting, we sense some of the happiness this frontier family shared.&lt;br&gt;      Nearly forty years later, in 1932, Mrs. Wilder would begin writing her "Little House" books for children, in which she wrote evocatively of her own pioneer childhood in the American wilderness. Readers already familiar with the &lt;em&gt;
  &lt;u&gt;Little House&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; books will welcome this further visit, with Laura. Those reading her for the first time will appreciate the accurate glimpse of the prairie frontier which her journal affords. For young adult and adult readers.  (source - back cover)</description>

  <description>Kelly Kathleen Ferguson needed to know-was connecting with her lifelong heroine the key to knowing herself? She decided to find out. Kelly donned a prairie dress and retraced the pioneer journey of Laura Ingalls Wilder. From Wisconsin to Minnesota, South Dakota to Missouri, she explored Laura's past and her own. Part travelogue, part memoir and part social commentary, My Life as Laura shows how a relationship with a pioneer girl who lived in little houses long ago can give a sense of purpose for today. Judy Blunt, author of the national best seller Breaking Clean, says My Life as Laura is "Hilarious, perceptive and true, a homespun story as genuine as the ones that inspired it."  -</description>

  <description>“My parents suck ass. Banning me from the phone and restricting my computer privileges are the most tyrannical parental gestures I can think of. Don’t they realize that Hope’s the only one who keeps me sane? . . . I don’t see how things could get any worse.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her best friend, Hope Weaver, moves away from Pineville, New Jersey, hyperobservant sixteen-year-old Jessica Darling is devastated. A fish out of water at school and a stranger at home, Jessica feels more lost than ever now that the only person with whom she could really communicate has gone. How is she supposed to deal with the boy- and shopping-crazy girls at school, her dad’s obsession with her track meets, her mother salivating over big sister Bethany’s lavish wedding, and her nonexistent love life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fresh, funny, utterly compelling fiction debut by first-time novelist Megan McCafferty, &lt;strong&gt;Sloppy Firsts&lt;/strong&gt; is an insightful, true-to-life look at Jessica’s predicament as she embarks on another year of teenage torment--from the dark days of Hope’s departure through her months as a type-A personality turned insomniac to her completely mixed-up feelings about Marcus Flutie, the intelligent and mysterious “Dreg” who works his way into her heart. Like a John Hughes for the twenty-first century, Megan McCafferty taps into the inherent humor and drama of the teen experience. This poignant, hilarious novel is sure to appeal to readers who are still going through it, as well as those who are grateful that they don’t have to go back and grow up all over again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Karin Slaughter comes a fast and furious tale in which no one is quite who they seem. This electrifying eBook novella featuring Will Trent is a prequel to Slaughter’s upcoming novel, &lt;em&gt;Unseen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Detective Will Trent is standing in a Georgia convenience store, waiting on an obstinate Icee frozen drink machine. To the surveillance cameras and bored staff of the Lil’ Dixie Gas-n-Go, however, Will appears to be someone very different—the menacing ex-con Bill Black. Going undercover as Bill, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent is about to infiltrate the most corrupt town in the most corrupt county in the new American South. But first: his Icee.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Everything changes in one horrific instant, as all hell breaks loose at the Lil’ Dixie. A cop is shot. A bag of cash goes flying across the floor. A young woman disappears while a killer takes off in a battered pick-up truck. Within seconds, Will is in pursuit.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes an exclusive preview of Karin Slaughter’s thrilling new novel of suspense, &lt;em&gt;Unseen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>No one would suspect shy Lily Calloway’s biggest secret. While everyone is dancing at college bars, Lily stays in the bathroom. To get laid. Her compulsion leads her to one-night stands, steamy hookups and events she shamefully regrets. The only person who knows her secret happens to have one of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loren Hale’s best friend is his bottle of bourbon. Lily comes at a close second. For three years, they’ve pretended to be in a real relationship, hiding their addictions from their families. They’ve mastered the art of concealing flasks and random guys that filter in and out of their apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when they go on a family boat trip, surrounded by open seas and limited male bodies in sight, Lily’s confronted with a big fear. Only one guy onboard can fill her addiction, and she’s sworn off going &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; with Loren Hale ever again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the only person who can truly help her can barely help himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;**This is a New Adult book recommended for readers 18 and up**&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sick of being the only virgin among her friends, Bliss Edwards decides the best way to deal with the problem is to lose it as quickly and simply as possible - a one-night stand. But her plan turns out to be anything but simple when she freaks out and leaves a gorgeous guy alone and naked in her bed with an excuse that no one with half-a-brain would ever believe. And as if that weren't embarrassing enough, when she arrives for her first class of her last college semester, she recognizes her new theatre professor. She'd left him naked in her bed about 8 hours earlier.</description>

  <description>THE GIRL WHO WOULDN'T DIE HUNTS THE KILLER WHO SHOULDN'T EXIST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future is not as loud as war, but it is relentless. It has a terrible fury all its own." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Curtis is a killer who stepped out of the past. Kirby Mazrachi is the girl who was never meant to have a future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirby is the last shining girl, one of the bright young women, burning with potential, whose lives Harper is destined to snuff out after he stumbles on a House in Depression-era Chicago that opens on to other times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the urging of the House, Harper inserts himself into the lives of the shining girls, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. He's the ultimate hunter, vanishing into another time after each murder, untraceable-until one of his victims survives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to bring her would-be killer to justice, Kirby joins the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; to work with the ex-homicide reporter, Dan Velasquez, who covered her case. Soon Kirby finds herself closing in on the impossible truth . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SHINING GIRLS is a masterful twist on the serial killer tale: a violent quantum leap featuring a memorable and appealing heroine in pursuit of a deadly criminal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>1,135,789. That’s how many subscribers sixteen-year-old West Ryder has on his web vlog series. But he only has eyes for one of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As one of the internet’s most prestigious video bloggers, West talks about high school relationships under the name “Sam Green.”  As far as he knows, no one from school, not even his best friend, Cat, has seen his videos. But the highlight of the whole thing is Harper Knight, who comments every day at exactly 2:02 in the afternoon. He doesn’t know anything about her aside from the occasional deep philosophical messaging on why pizza tastes so delicious, but as stupid as it sounds, he might be falling for her. So when they finally agree to meet in real life, West’s hope for romance seems more and more in reach. But that all changes as soon as he arrives at their meeting spot and sees Cat walking toward him, wearing the same “I &amp;lt;3 Sam Green” T-shirt Harper promised she'd have on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To his alarm, West realizes he is falling in love with the best friend who has always been a sister to him.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Allison Rushby's &lt;em&gt;Heiresses,&lt;/em&gt; three triplets--estranged since birth--are thrust together in glittering 1926 London to fight for their inheritance, only to learn they can’t trust anyone--least of all each other.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When three teenage girls, Thalia, Erato and Clio, are summoned to the excitement of fast-paced London--a frivolous, heady city full of bright young things--by Hestia, an aunt they never knew they had, they are shocked to learn they are triplets and the rightful heiresses to their deceased mother's fortune. All they need to do is find a way to claim the fortune from their greedy half-brother, Charles. But with the odds stacked against them, coming together as sisters may be harder than they think.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Molly Montgomery never planned on becoming famous. Molly's band, The Hormones, was just supposed to be about mucking around with her best mates, Jane and Tara, and having fun. But when the deliciously dangerous Dean and his friend T join the band, things start happening fast. Soon The Hormones are front-page news, and their debut album is rocketing up the charts. Molly is the force behind the band, but the hazards of fame, first love, screaming fans, and sleazy managers are forcing the newly crowned teen queen of grrl angst close to the edge. Fame never comes for free, and Molly's about to find out what it costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It’s all been leading to this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jolie Benoit has become a skilled agent of the Underlight, relying on her savvy to complete assignments while Sergeant Wesley Haukon was out of commission. But an unexpected clue to the Order of Ananke’s diabolical scheme rattles Jolie, and she turns to Hauk for comfort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been years since Hauk took comfort from the touch of another person, though his love for Jolie is deep and powerful. Uncomfortable in his skin, scarred by a terrible fire, he is unable to give in to the pleasures that Jolie so desperately wants to grant him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the Order is lurking in the shadows—and when they strike, the blow is swift and terrible. Hauk and Jolie scramble to fight for their community, but with the future of the Underlight threatened, no one is safe. And Hauk will never be the same…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;73,000 words</description>

  <description>Jolie Benoit left her old life behind to become an agent of the Underlight. Training under Sergeant Wesley Haukon, she’s honing her combat skills, all the while coping with the intense sexual attraction she feels for Hauk. She keeps their friendship casual, but when his high school sweetheart transfers into their division, Jolie finds herself grappling with jealousy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Underlight gave Hauk a purpose, but he can’t escape his past completely. The physical and emotional scars from the fire that killed seven fellow Army Rangers will mark him forever. Jolie sends his protective instincts into overdrive, but he’s convinced he’ll never be worthy of her love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hauk is determined to keep Jolie from harm. But when the Order of Ananke ambushes them with a new weapon that neutralizes Hauk, making him vulnerable, it’s Jolie who must tap into her hidden strengths to rescue him—or risk losing him forever…</description>

  <description>On Manhattan's Upper East Side a woman lies dead at the bottom of the stairs, stripped of all her valuables. Most cops might call it a mugging gone wrong, but Lieutenant Eve Dallas knows better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A well-off accountant and a beloved wife and mother, Marta Dickenson doesn't seem the type to be on anyone's hit list. But when Eve and her partner, Peabody, find blood inside the building, the lieutenant knows Marta's murder was the work of a killer who's trained, but not professional or smart enough to remove all the evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when someone steals the files out of Marta's office, Eve must immerse herself in her billionaire husband Roarke's world of big business to figure out who's cruel and callous enough to hire a hit on an innocent woman. And as the killer's violent streak begins to escalate, Eve knows she has to draw him out, even if it means using herself as bait. . . .</description>

  <description>A dangerous infatuation with a rough and ready man…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erin Coffey has been a nurse for years, but nothing’s prepared her for the physical and emotional demands of her new position. Needing to move closer to her dysfunctional family, she takes a dangerous job at Larkhaven Psychiatric Hospital, where she quickly learns that she needs protection—and she meets the strong, over-confident coworker who’s more than willing to provide it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelly Robak is the type of guy that Erin has sworn she’d never get involved with. She’s seen firsthand, via her mess of a sister, what chaos guys like him can bring into a woman’s life. But she finds herself drawn to him anyway, even when he shows up at her door, not eager to take no for an answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Erin finds even more shocking than Kelly’s indecent proposal is how much she enjoys submitting to his every command. But he can’t play the tough guy indefinitely. If they want to have more than just an affair, both will have to open up and reveal what they truly need.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor&lt;/em&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Park&lt;/em&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds—smart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;  bestselling author David Levithan tells the based-on-true-events story of Harry and Craig, two 17-year-olds who are about to take part in a 32-hour marathon of kissing to set a new Guinness World Record—all of which is narrated by a Greek Chorus of the generation of gay men lost to AIDS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the two increasingly dehydrated and sleep-deprived boys are locking lips, they become a focal point in the lives of other teen boys dealing with languishing long-term relationships, coming out, navigating gender identity, and falling deeper into the digital rabbit hole of gay hookup sites—all while the kissing former couple tries to figure out their own feelings for each other.</description>

      <![CDATA[Support the themes/statement wholeheartedly, but was unfortunately less than enthused by the way the story was styled and structured. The Greek chorus of dead men method of narrating the story has got to be one of my least favorite storytelling devices ever.<br /><br />Oh, well.]]>

  <description>We, the Martin family, were like inverse superheroes, marked by our defects. Dad was addicted to beer and bootlegs. Gully had "social difficulties" that manifested in his wearing a pig snout mask 24-7. I was surface clean but underneath a weird hormonal stew was simmering...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's summer in St Kilda. Fifteen-year-old Sky is looking forward to great records and nefarious activities with Nancy, her older, wilder friend. Her brother – Super Agent Gully – is on a mission to unmask the degenerate who bricked the shop window. Bill the Patriarch seems content to drink while the shop slides into bankruptcy. A poster of a mysterious girl and her connection to Luke, the tragi-hot new employee sends Sky on an exploration into the dark heart of the suburb. Love is strange. Family Rules. In between there are teenage messes, rock star spawn, violent fangirls, creepy old guys and accidents waiting to happen. If the world truly is going to hell in a hand-basket then at least the soundtrack is kicking. Sky Martin is Girl Defective: funny, real and dark at the edges.</description>

  <description>From the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Bared to You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years ago, Evangeline Hollis spent a blistering night with a darkly seductive man she can’t forget. But that evening of addictive pleasure has become a disaster of biblical proportions: She’s been branded with the Mark of Cain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrust into a world where sinners are marked and drafted to kill demons, Eve’s former one-night stand, Cain, is now her mentor—and his equally sexy brother Abel is her new boss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Eve has become the latest point of contention in the oldest case of sibling rivalry in history...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed by God, hunted by demons, desired by Cain and Abel... All in a day's work.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Imogen has always believed that her black belt in Tae Kwon Do made her stronger than everyone else--more responsible, more capable. But when she witnesses a holdup in a diner, she freezes. The gunman is shot and killed by the police. And it's all her fault.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she's got to rebuild her life without the talent that made her special and the beliefs that made her strong. If only she could prove herself in a fight--a real fight--she might be able to let go of the guilt and shock. She's drawn to Ricky, another witness to the holdup, both romantically and because she believes he might be able to give her the fight she’s been waiting for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when it comes down to it, a fight won’t answer Imogen's big questions: What does it really mean to be stronger than other people? Is there such a thing as a fair fight? And can someone who's beaten and bruised fall in love?</description>

      <![CDATA[Hm, I feel alone in a sea of glowing 4s and 5s on this one. <br /><br />This is such an interesting subject, and there were times when Imogene's PTSD flashbacks were definitely troubling. But I had a serious problem connecting with most of the characters, and I was never really convinced by most of the main...]]>

  <description>Torn between two worlds.&lt;br&gt;Torn between two lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;McKenzie Lewis’s ability to read the shadows has put her—and …those she loves—in harm’s way again and again. The violence must end, but will the cost of peace be more devastating than anyone ever imagined?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ten years of turmoil, the life McKenzie has always longed for may finally be within her grasp. No one is swinging a sword at her head or asking her to track the fae, and she finally has a regular—albeit boring—job. But when a ruthless enemy strikes against her friends, McKenzie abandons her attempt at normalcy and rushes back to the Realm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the fae she loves and the fae she’s tied to pulling her in different directions, McKenzie must uncover the truth behind the war and accept the painful sacrifices that must be made to end it. Armed with dangerous secrets and with powerful allies at her side, her actions will either rip the Realm apart—or save it.</description>

  <description>From the outside, Brendan Chase seems to have it pretty easy. He’s a star wrestler, a video game aficionado, and a loving boyfriend to his seemingly perfect match, Vanessa. But on the inside, Brendan struggles to understand why his body feels so wrong—why he sometimes fantasizes having long hair, soft skin, and gentle curves. Is there even a name for guys like him? Guys who sometimes want to be girls? Or is Brendan just a freak?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Freakboy's razor-sharp verse, Kristin Clark folds three narratives into one powerful story: Brendan trying to understand his sexual identity, Vanessa fighting to keep her and Brendan’s relationship alive, and Angel struggling to confront her demons.</description>

  <description>Stolen as a child from her large and loving family, and on the run with her mom for more than ten years, Callie has only the barest idea of what normal life might be like. She's never had a home, never gone to school, and has gotten most of her meals from laundromat vending machines. Her dreams are haunted by memories she’d like to forget completely. But when Callie’s mom is finally arrested for kidnapping her, and Callie’s real dad whisks her back to what would have been her life, in a small town in Florida, Callie must find a way to leave the past behind. She must learn to be part of a family. And she must believe that love--even with someone who seems an improbable choice--is more than just a possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trish Doller writes incredibly real teens, and this searing story of love, betrayal, and how not to lose your mind will resonate with readers who want their stories gritty and utterly true.</description>

  <description>On Internment, the floating island in the clouds where 16-year-old Morgan Stockhour lives, getting too close to the edge can lead to madness. Even though Morgan's older brother, Lex, was a Jumper, Morgan vows never to end up like him. She tries her best not to mind that her life is orderly and boring, and if she ever wonders about the ground, and why it is forbidden, she takes solace in best friend Pen and her betrothed, Basil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a murder, the first in a generation, rocks the city. With whispers swirling and fear on the wind, Morgan can no longer stop herself from investigating, especially when she meets Judas. He is the boy being blamed for the murder — betrothed to the victim — but Morgan is convinced of his innocence. Secrets lay at the heart of Internment, but nothing can prepare Morgan for what she will find — or who she will lose.</description>

  <description>Sophie Winters nearly died. Twice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first time, she's fourteen, and escapes a near-fatal car accident with scars, a bum leg, and an addiction to Oxy that'll take years to kick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second time, she's seventeen, and it's no accident. Sophie and her best friend Mina are confronted by a masked man in the woods. Sophie survives, but Mina is not so lucky. When the cops deem Mina's murder a drug deal gone wrong, casting partial blame on Sophie, no one will believe the truth: Sophie has been clean for months, and it was Mina who led her into the woods that night for a meeting shrouded in mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a forced stint in rehab, Sophie returns home to a chilly new reality. Mina's brother won't speak to her, her parents fear she'll relapse, old friends have become enemies, and Sophie has to learn how to live without her other half. To make matters worse, no one is looking in the right places and Sophie must search for Mina's murderer on her own. But with every step, Sophie comes closer to revealing all: about herself, about Mina and about the secret they shared</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two teenage zombies search for brains, love, and answers in this surprisingly romantic and laugh-out-loud funny debut novel with guts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Stephens was always an average, fly-under-the-radar guy. The kind of guy who would never catch the attention of an insanely popular girl like Amanda Blake-or a psychic teenage government agent like Cass. But one day during lunch, Jake's whole life changed. He and Amanda suddenly locked eyes across the cafeteria, and at the exact same instant, they turned into zombies and devoured half their senior class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Jake definitely has Amanda's attention-as well as Cass's, since she's been sent on a top-secret mission to hunt them down. As Jake and Amanda deal with the existential guilt of eating their best friends, Cass struggles with a growing psychic dilemma of her own-one that will lead the three of them on an epic journey across the country and make them question what it means to truly be alive. Or undead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eat, Brains, Love is a heartwarming and bloody blend of romance, deadpan humor, and suspense that fans of Isaac Marion's Warm Bodies will devour. With its irresistibly dry and authentic teen voice, as well as a zombie apocalypse worthy of AMC's The Walking Dead, this irreverent paperback original will leave readers dying for the sequel that's coming in Summer 2014.</description>

  <description>At the end of the sixteenth century, religious upheaval brings fear, superstition, and doubt to the lives of mortals. Yet unbeknownst to them, another world lies just beyond the Veil: the realm of the Sithe, a fierce and beautiful people for whom a full-mortal life is but the blink of an eye. The Veil protects and hides their world…but it is fraying at the edges, and not all think it should be repaired. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discarded by his mother and ignored by his father, sixteen-year-old Seth MacGregor has grown up half wild in his father’s fortress, with only his idolized older brother, Conal, for family. When Conal quarrels with the Sithe queen and is forced into exile in the full-mortal world, Seth volunteers to go with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life beyond the Veil is even more dangerous than they expected, and Seth and Conal soon find themselves embroiled in a witch-hunt—in which they are the quarry. Trapped between the queen’s machinations at home and the superstitious violence of the otherworld, Seth must act before both of them are fed to the witch-hunters’ fires…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brimming with intrigue and rebellion, &lt;em&gt;Firebrand&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in the Rebel Angels series by Gillian Philip, the Carnegie Medal–nominated author of &lt;em&gt;Crossing the Line&lt;/em&gt; and multi-award-nominated &lt;em&gt;Bad Faith&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole.  &lt;br&gt;Seriously. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he’s got his reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.  What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work.  His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. &lt;br&gt;So he slipped far, far from it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with.  If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? &lt;br&gt;Wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila.  &lt;br&gt;Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart.  He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense.  Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows that.  And he’s working on it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is that enough to make her stay?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Your mother hollers that you’re going to miss the bus. She can see it coming down the street. You don’t stop and hug her and tell her you love her. You don’t thank her for being a good, kind, patient mother. Of course not—you hurdle down the stairs and make a run for the corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only, if it’s the last time you’ll ever see your mother, you sort of start to wish you’d stopped and did those things. Maybe even missed the bus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the bus was barreling down our street, so I ran.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourteen kids. One superstore. A million things that go wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Emmy Laybourne’s action-packed debut novel, six high school kids (some popular, some not), two eighth graders (one a tech genius), and six little kids trapped together in a chain superstore build a refuge for themselves inside. While outside, a series of escalating disasters, beginning with a monster hailstorm and ending with a chemical weapons spill, seems to be tearing the world—as they know it—apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the depths of a valley rises the city of Mahala.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a city built upwards, not across—where streets are built upon streets, buildings upon buildings. A city that the Ministry rules from the sunlit summit, and where the forsaken lurk in the darkness of Under.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rojan Dizon doesn’t mind staying in the shadows, because he’s got things to hide. Things like being a pain-mage, with the forbidden power to draw magic from pain. But he can’t hide for ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because when Rojan stumbles upon the secrets lurking in the depths of the Pit, the fate of Mahala will depend on him using his magic. And unlucky for Rojan—this is going to hurt.</description>

  <description>Things I know about Reece Malcolm:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. She graduated from New York University.&lt;br&gt;2. She lives in or near Los Angeles.&lt;br&gt;3. Since her first novel was released, she’s been on the New York Times bestseller list every week.&lt;br&gt;4. She likes strong coffee and bourbon.&lt;br&gt;5. She’s my mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devan knows very little about Reece Malcolm, until the day her father dies and she’s shipped off to live with the mother she’s never met. All she has is a list of notebook entries that doesn’t add up to much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L.A. offers a whole new world to Devan—a performing arts school allows her to pursue her passion for show choir and musicals, a new circle of friends helps to draw her out of her shell, and an intriguing boy opens up possibilities for her first love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then the Reece Malcolm list gets a surprising new entry. Now that Devan is so close to having it all, can she handle the possibility of losing everything?</description>

  <description>I’m Gwen Frost, a second-year warrior-in-training at Mythos Acad­emy, and I have no idea how I’m going to sur­vive the rest of the semes­ter. One day, I’m get­ting schooled in sword­play by the guy who broke my heart—the drop-dead gor­geous Logan who slays me every time. Then, an invis­i­ble archer in the Library of Antiq­ui­ties decides to use me for tar­get prac­tice. And now, I find out that some­one at the acad­emy is really a Reaper bad guy who wants me dead. I’m afraid if I don’t learn how to live by the sword—with Logan’s help—I just might die by the sword...</description>

  <description>My name is Gwen Frost, and I go to Mythos Academy; a school of myths, magic and warrior whiz kids, where even the lowliest geek knows how to chop off somebody's head with a sword and Logan Quinn, the hottest Spartan guy in school, also happens to be the deadliest. But lately, things have been weird, even for Mythos. First, mean girl Jasmine Ashton was murdered in the Library of Antiquities. Then, someone stole the Bowl of Tears, a magical artifact that can be used to bring about the second Chaos War. You know, death, destruction and lots of other bad, bad things. Freaky stuff like this goes on all the time at Mythos, but I'm determined to find out who killed Jasmine and why; especially since I should have been the one who died...</description>

  <description>I am Gwen Frost, and I have a Gypsy gift.  It's called psychometry - that's a fancy way of saying that I see images in my head and get flashes of other people's memories off almost everything I touch, even guys.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My gift makes me kind of nosy. Okay, okay, maybe a lot nosy--to the point of obsession sometimes. I want to know everything about everyone around me. But even I don't want to know the secrets my friend Paige is hiding or the terrible loss that will send me to a new school - Mythos Academy, where the teachers aren't preparing us for the SATs, but to battle Reapers of Chaos.  Now I have no friends and no idea how my gift fits in with all these warrior whiz kids.  The only thing I do know is that my life is never, ever going to be the same.  .  .</description>

  <description>The first book in an exciting YA trilogy, this is the story of two best friends on the verge of a terrifying divide when they begin to encounter a cast of strange and mythical characters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against the lush, magical backdrop of the Pacific Northwest, two inseparable best friends who have grown up like sisters—the charismatic, mercurial, and beautiful Aurora and the devoted, soulful, watchful narrator—find their bond challenged for the first time ever when a mysterious and gifted musician named Jack comes between them. Suddenly, each girl must decide what matters most: friendship, or love. What both girls don’t know is that the stakes are even higher than either of them could have imagined. They’re not the only ones who have noticed Jack’s gift; his music has awakened an ancient evil—and a world both above and below which may not be mythical at all.  The real and the mystical; the romantic and the heartbreaking all begin to swirl together, carrying the two on journey that is both enthralling and terrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it’s up to the narrator to protect the people she loves—if she can.</description>

  <description>In The Boyfriend App by Katie Sise, super-smart, somewhat geeky Audrey McCarthy can’t wait to get out of high school. Her father’s death and the transformation of her one-time BFF, Blake Dawkins, into her worst nightmare have her longing for the new start college will bring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But college takes money. So Audrey decides she has to win the competition for the best app designed by a high schooler—and the $200,000 that comes with it. She develops something she calls the Boyfriend App, and suddenly she’s the talk of the school and getting kissed by the hottest boys around. But can the Boyfriend App bring Audrey true love?</description>

  <description>What if a killer took control of you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vee Bell’s gift (or curse) of “sliding”—slipping into the mind of another person and experiencing life, briefly, through his or her eyes—has been somewhat under control since she unwillingly witnessed the horrific deaths of her classmates six months ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just as things are getting back to normal, Vee has a very bizarre experience: she loses consciousness and finds herself in a deserted area, at the edge of a cliff, with the broken body of the boy who took advantage of her on the rocks below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Vee finds herself in stranger and stranger situations with no memory of getting there, she begins to suspect that someone she knows has the ability to slide—and that this “slider” is using Vee to exact revenge on his or her enemies.</description>

  <description>Mike Welles had everything under control. He was a good student, an outfielder on the baseball team, a good son, a loyal friend. But that was before. Now things are rough at home, and they’re getting confusing at school. He’s losing his sense of direction, and he feels like a mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there’s a voice in his head. A friend, trying to help him regain control. More than that: The voice can guide him to be better and stronger than he was before, to rid his life of everything holding him back. To figure out who he is again. If only Mike will listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writing with devastating power and precision, acclaimed author Lois Metzger gives us the story of one young man’s battle with his own shadows—a spare, stark, and vital tale of the way in which the things we build to protect ourselves can threaten to destroy us.</description>

  <description>Twelve year-old Basil knows he’s special—he’s been associating numbers with colors since he was a kid. His gift (or curse) has turned him into somewhat of a loner, but his world begins to change when he meets Tenzie, the new girl in school who has similar freakisms. She, too, has synesthesia (a condition in which one type of stimulation evokes the sensation of another). At first, Basil is somewhat annoyed with Tenzie’s pushiness, but after Basil’s estranged mother returns, his life is turned upside down . . . and Tenzie may be the only person to help him put it back together again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again, MJ Auch has written a thoughtful coming-of-age novel that explores friendship, family, and fitting in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Her eyes saved his life.&lt;br&gt;Her dreams released his darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After four years of sleeplessness, high school junior Parker Chipp can't take much more. Every night, instead of sleeping, he enters the dreams of the last person he's made eye contact with. If he doesn't sleep soon, Parker will die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he meets Mia. Her dreams, calm and beautifully uncomplicated, allow him blissful rest that is utterly addictive. But what starts out as a chance meeting turns into an obsession; Parker's furious desire for what he needs pushes him to extremes he never thought he'd go. And when someone begins to terrorizing Mia with twisted death threats, Parker's memory blackouts leave him doubting his own innocence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Love blossoms by the lake in this sweet summer romance, in the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Seventeeth Summer&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sixteenth Summer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chelsea isn’t looking forward to her summer at the lake. It’s the first time her family has been there since her grandmother died, and she can’t break out of her funk. But her summer takes a turn for the better when she meets a boy who works in the bookstore. Josh is cute, sweet, funny…and best of all, seems to like her as much as she likes him. As the days pass by in a blur of boat rides, picnics, and stolen kisses, she can’t believe how lucky she is. No one has ever made her feel so special, or so beautiful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Chelsea knows her days with Josh are numbered. She’ll be heading home at the end of the summer—and he’ll be staying behind. Will this be Chelsea’s summer of love? Or will it be the summer of her broken heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nothing is as it seems in this darkly romantic tale of infatuation and possession, inspired by Daphne du Maurier’s &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becca was the perfect girlfriend: smart, gorgeous, and loved by everyone at New England’s premier boarding school, Thorn Abbey. But Becca’s dead. And her boyfriend, Max, can’t get over his loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Tess transfers to Thorn Abbey. She’s shy, insecure, and ordinary—everything that Becca wasn’t. And despite her roommate’s warnings, she falls for brooding Max.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Max finally has a reason to move on. Except it won’t be easy. Because Becca may be gone, but she’s not quite ready to let him go…</description>

  <description>When Mallory’s boyfriend, Jeremy, cheats on her with an online girlfriend, Mallory decides the best way to de-Jeremy her life is to de-modernize things too. Inspired by a list of goals her grandmother made in1962, Mallory swears off technology and returns to a simpler time (when boyfriends couldn’t cheat with computer avatars). The List:&lt;br&gt;1. Run for pep club secretary&lt;br&gt;2. Host a fancy dinner party/soiree&lt;br&gt;3. Sew a dress for Homecoming&lt;br&gt;4. Find a steady&lt;br&gt;5. Do something dangerous&lt;br&gt;But simple proves to be crazy-complicated, and the details of the past begin to change Mallory’s present. Add in a too-busy grandmother, a sassy sister, and the cute pep-club president–who just happens to be her ex’s cousin–and soon Mallory begins to wonder if going vintage is going too far.</description>

  <description>Annie Phillips is thrilled to leave her past behind and begin a shiny new life on Belvedere Island, as a nanny for the picture-perfect Cohen family. In no time at all, she falls in love with the Cohens, especially with Libby, the beautiful young matriarch of the family. Life is better than she ever imagined. She even finds romance with the boy next door. &lt;br&gt;All too soon cracks appear in Annie's seemingly perfect world. She's blamed for mistakes she doesn't remember making. Her bedroom door comes unhinged, and she feels like she's always being watched. Libby, who once felt like a big sister, is suddenly cold and unforgiving. As she struggles to keep up with the demands of her new life, Annie's fear gives way to frightening hallucinations. Is she tumbling into madness, or is something sinister at play? &lt;br&gt;"The Ruining "is a complex ride through first love, chilling manipulation, and the terrifying depths of insanity.</description>

  <description>A gift?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A curse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A moment that changes everything. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught in an unexpected spring squall, Corrine's first instinct is to protect her little sister Sophie after a nasty fall. But when Corrine reaches out to comfort her sister, the exact opposite occurs. Her touch--charged with an otherworldly force and bursting with blinding indigo color--surges violently from Corrine to her sister. In an instant, Sophie is dead. From that moment on, Corrine convinces herself that everyone would be better off if she simply withdrew from life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her family abruptly moves to New Orleans, Corrine's withdrawal is made all the easier. No friends. No connections. No chance of hurting anyone. But strange things continue to happen around her in this haunting,  mystical city. And she realizes that her power cannot be ignored, especially when Rennick, a talented local artist with a bad-boy past, suggests another possibility: Corrine might have the touch. An ability to heal those around her. But knowing what happened to her sister, can Corrine trust her gift?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>2.5 stars</strong> This was... fine. But pretty predictable and not altogether all that memorable, from characters to plot to romance to writing. It almost got bumped up to a 3 at the end, because I thought something really interesting was going to happen--but that punch ended up getting pulled, too. Oh,...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A searing and gripping read that explores the depths of desperation true love can inspire, from the author of Being Friends with Boys.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nikki’s life is far from perfect, but at least she has Dee. Her friends tell her that Dee is no good, but Nikki can’t imagine herself without him. He’s hot, he’s dangerous, he has her initials tattooed over his heart, and she loves him more than anything. There’s nothing Nikki wouldn’t do for Dee. Absolutely nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Dee pulls Nikki into a crime—a crime that ends in murder—Nikki tells herself that it’s all for true love. Nothing can break them apart. Not the police. Not the arrest that lands Nikki in jail. Not even the investigators who want her to testify against him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what if Dee had motives that Nikki knew nothing about? Nikki’s love for Dee is supposed to be unconditional…but even true love has a limit. And Nikki just might have reached hers.</description>

  <description>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. The young King Nash clings to his throne while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. The mountains and forests are filled with spies and thieves and lawless men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is where Fire lives. With a wild, irresistible appearance and hair the color of flame, Fire is the last remaining human monster. Equally hated and adored, she had the unique ability to control minds, but she guards her power, unwilling to steal the secrets of innocent people. Especially when she has so many of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Prince Brigan comes to bring her to King City, The royal family needs her help to uncover the plot against the king. Far away from home, Fire begins to realize there's more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only she weren't afraid of becoming the monster her father was.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;An empty mind is a safe mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Yulia's father always taught her to hide her thoughts and control her emotions to survive the harsh realities of Soviet Russia. But when she's captured by the KGB and forced to work as a psychic spy with a mission to undermine the U.S. space program, she's thrust into a world of suspicion, deceit, and horrifying power. Yulia quickly realizes she can trust no one--not her KGB superiors or the other operatives vying for her attention--and must rely on her own wits and skills to survive in this world where no SEKRET can stay hidden for long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Pretty Girl-13 is a disturbing and powerful psychological thriller about a girl who must piece together the story of her kidnapping and captivity and then piece together her own identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When thirteen-year-old Angela Gracie Chapman looks in the mirror, someone else looks back--a thin, pale stranger, a sixteen-year-old with haunted eyes.  Angie has no memory of the past three years, years in which she was lost to the authorities, lost to her family and friends, lost even to herself.  Where has she been, who has been living her life, and what is hiding behind the terrible blankness? There are secrets you can’t even tell yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a tremendous amount of courage and support from unexpected friends, Angie embarks on a journey into the darkest corners of her mind. As she unearths more and more about her past, she discovers a terrifying secret and must decide: when you remember things you wish you could forget, do you destroy the people responsible, or is there another way to feel whole again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liz Coley’s alarming and fascinating psychological mystery is a disturbing—and ultimately empowering—page turner about accepting our whole selves, and the healing power of courage, hope, and love.</description>

  <description>A meth dealer. A prostitute. A serial killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anywhere else, they’d be vermin. At the Mandel Academy, they’re called prodigies. The most exclusive school in New York City has been training young criminals for over a century. Only the most ruthless students are allowed to graduate. The rest disappear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flick, a teenage pickpocket, has risen to the top of his class. But then Mandel recruits a fierce new competitor who also happens to be Flick’s old flame. They’ve been told only one of them will make it out of the Mandel Academy. Will they find a way to save each other—or will the school destroy them both?</description>

      <![CDATA[I liked the first part of this book when Flick was still living on the streets, but once he entered the Academy, I was much less engaged by the story, and in fact had to push myself to finish it. I just didn't really care that much about the prison-like alpha dog dynamics, nor about the majority...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something Edward didn't want me to know. Something Jacob wouldn't have kept from me...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was never going to end, was it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob - knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf.

  <description>Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We’d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...</description>

  <description>Addy Hanlon has always been Beth Cassidy's best friend and trusted lieutenant. Beth calls the shots and Addy carries them out, a long-established order of things that has brought them to the pinnacle of their high-school careers. Now they're seniors who rule the intensely competitive cheer squad, feared and followed by the other girls -- until the young new coach arrives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cool and commanding, an emissary from the adult world just beyond their reach, Coach Colette French draws Addy and the other cheerleaders into her life. Only Beth, unsettled by the new regime, remains outside Coach's golden circle, waging a subtle but vicious campaign to regain her position as "top girl" -- both with the team and with Addy herself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a suicide focuses a police investigation on Coach and her squad. After the first wave of shock and grief, Addy tries to uncover the truth behind the death -- and learns that the boundary between loyalty and love can be dangerous terrain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The raw passions of girlhood are brought to life in this taut, unflinching exploration of friendship, ambition, and power. Award-winning novelist Megan Abbott, writing with what Tom Perrotta has hailed as "total authority and an almost desperate intensity," provides a harrowing glimpse into the dark heart of the all-American girl.</description>

  <description>Hockey-obsessed tomboy Eleanor Westley has never been the object of a guy's affection before. So when the hottest boy she's ever seen moves in across the street and starts treating her like she's the center of his universe, naturally she's going to be a little skeptical. But everything starts to make sense when girls who look just like Ellie start dying all around the city. Obviously the new guy is the killer, and of course he only likes her because he wants to slice her into tiny pieces. Right? The more Ellie gets to know Seth the more she's convinced he's a psychopathic killer. Problem is, he's the sweetest psychopathic killer she's ever met. Not to mention he's brutally hot. No matter how hard she tries, she can't help but fall for him. Will Ellie find true love, or will her summer of firsts turn out to be a summer of lasts?</description>

  <description>When thirty-year-old English teacher Anna Emerson is offered a job tutoring T.J. Callahan at his family's summer rental in the Maldives, she accepts without hesitation; a working vacation on a tropical island trumps the library any day. T.J. Callahan has no desire to leave town, not that anyone asked him. He's almost seventeen and if having cancer wasn't bad enough, now he has to spend his first summer in remission with his family - and a stack of overdue assignments - instead of his friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna and T.J. are en route to join T.J.'s family in the Maldives when the pilot of their seaplane suffers a fatal heart attack and crash-lands in the Indian Ocean. Adrift in shark-infested waters, their life jackets keep them afloat until they make it to the shore of an uninhabited island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Anna and T.J. just want to survive and they must work together to obtain water, food, fire, and shelter. Their basic needs might be met but as the days turn to weeks, and then months, the castaways encounter plenty of other obstacles, including violent tropical storms, the many dangers lurking in the sea, and the possibility that T.J.'s cancer could return. As T.J. celebrates yet another birthday on the island, Anna begins to wonder if the biggest challenge of all might be living with a boy who is gradually becoming a man.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/em&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything starts somewhere. For elite military cop Jack Reacher, that somewhere was Carter Crossing, Mississippi, way back in 1997. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A lonely railroad track. A crime scene. A cover-up. A young woman is dead, and solid evidence points to a soldier at a nearby military base. But that soldier has powerful friends in Washington. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reacher is ordered undercover&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to find out everything he can and then to vanish. But when he gets to Carter Crossing, Reacher meets local sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux, who has a thirst for justice&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and an appetite for secrets. Uncertain they can trust each other, they reluctantly join forces. Finding unexpected layers to the case, Reacher works to uncover the truth, while others try to bury it forever. The conspiracy threatens to shatter his faith in his mission—and turn him into a man to be feared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t miss Lee Child’s short story “Second Son” and a sneak peek of his new novel, &lt;em&gt;A Wanted Man, &lt;/em&gt;in the back of the book.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This is my least favorite Reacher book to date, and I think it's the only one I've rated less than 4 stars. For the first time, some of the writing felt formulaic to me--really, "Reacher said nothing" loses its impact when its repeated so many times, and when the phrase is used with other charact...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The start of an original new urban fantasy series starring human chameleon Ciel Halligan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snagging a marriage proposal for her client while on an all-expenses-paid vacation should be a simple job for Ciel Halligan, aura adaptor extraordinaire. A kind of human chameleon, she’s able to take on her clients’ appearances and slip seamlessly into their lives, solving any sticky problems they don’t want to deal with themselves. No fuss, no muss. Big paycheck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This particular assignment is pretty enjoyable... that is, until Ciel’s island resort bungalow is blown to smithereens and her client’s about-to-be-fiancé is snatched by modern-day Vikings. For some reason, Ciel begins to suspect that getting the ring is going to be a tad more difficult than originally anticipated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going from romance to rescue requires some serious gear-shifting, as well as a little backup. Her best friend, Billy, and Mark, the CIA agent she’s been crushing on for years—both skilled adaptors—step in to help, but their priority is, annoyingly, keeping her safe. Before long, Ciel is dedicating more energy to escaping their watchful eyes than she is to saving her client’s intended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, facing down a horde of Vikings feels like the least of her problems.</description>

  <description>He’s a fallen angel. She’s a rockabilly reporter. Together they must solve a deadly string of murders plaguing the mortal and the immortal worlds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Griffin Shaw used to be a PI, but that was over fifty years ago when gumshoes hoofed the streets . . . and he was still alive. Now he’s a Centurion, an angel who assists other murdered souls through their journey to the afterlife. But while Shaw might be an angel … he’s no saint. Haunted by the mysterious events surrounding his own death, he seizes a chance to wreak some vengeance when he witnesses a deadly attack on journalist Katherine “Kit” Craig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joining forces, the unlikely avengers take to the streets, hunting a killer whose trail of bodies stretches across Las Vegas and into an immortal netherworld. It is a dangerous trek that lead them into the darkest corners of Sin City and into the heart of an evil conspiracy extending beyond the lights of the Strip that could destory them both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But destruction isn’t the only threat Griffin faces. The closer he gets to Kit, the more he finds himself bewitched by her mortal charms. Can he resist falling under her spell? And does he want to?</description>

  <description>When a ruthless crime syndicate wants social worker Nina Christie to disappear, her only chance to survive is with Alex Aaro.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secrets Never Die&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Aaro has spent most of his life on the run from his ruthless, toxic family. But when he learns that crazy Aunt Tonya, the only relative who ever gave a damn about him, is dying, he risks returning home to say goodbye. He's prepared for anything except the call from his friend, Bruno Ranieri, that sends him on a wild and dangerous ride with a mysterious woman who holds a deadly secret and a white hot passion tht binds them together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social worker Nina Christie has no idea how much trouble she's in when her Aunt Helga shows up bleeding at her shelter, babbling in Ukrainian--and with one inexplicable act thrusts Nina into the heart of a nightmare. Now a ruthless crime syndicate will stop at nothing to make Nina disappear, and only Alex Aaro, that inscrutable six-foot-four rock hard slab of lean muscle, stands between her and certain death. Now Nina and Alex are in a race against time, death, and their desire for one another. . .</description>

  <description>Ashleigh's boyfriend, Kaleb, is about to leave for college, and Ashleigh is worried that he'll forget about her while he's away. So at a legendary end-of-summer pool party, Ashleigh's friends suggest she text him a picture of herself -- sans swimsuit -- to take with him. Before she can talk herself out of it, Ashleigh strides off to the bathroom, snaps a photo in the full-length mirror, and hits "send."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But when Kaleb and Ashleigh go through a bad breakup, Kaleb takes revenge by forwarding the text to his baseball team. Soon the photo has gone viral, attracting the attention of the school board, the local police, and the media. As her friends and family try to distance themselves from the scandal, Ashleigh feels completely alone -- until she meets Mack while serving her court-ordered community service. Not only does Mack offer a fresh chance at friendship, but he's the one person in town who received the text of Ashleigh's photo -- and didn't look. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Acclaimed author Jennifer Brown brings readers a gripping novel about honesty and betrayal, redemption and friendship, attraction and integrity, as Ashleigh finds that while a picture may be worth a thousand words . . . it doesn't always tell the whole story.</description>

  <description>When Maude Pichon runs away from provincial Brittany to Paris, her romantic dreams vanish as quickly as her savings. Desperate for work, she answers an unusual ad. The Durandeau Agency provides its clients with a unique service—the beauty foil. Hire a plain friend and become instantly more attractive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monsieur Durandeau has made a fortune from wealthy socialites, and when the Countess Dubern needs a companion for her headstrong daughter, Isabelle, Maude is deemed the perfect foil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Isabelle has no idea her new "friend" is the hired help, and Maude's very existence among the aristocracy hinges on her keeping the truth a secret. Yet the more she learns about Isabelle, the more her loyalty is tested. And the longer her deception continues, the more she has to lose.</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring.... until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Bluebeard fairy tale retold. . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When seventeen-year-old Sophia Petheram’s beloved father dies, she receives an unexpected letter. An invitation—on fine ivory paper, in bold black handwriting—from the mysterious Monsieur Bernard de Cressac, her godfather. With no money and fewer options, Sophie accepts, leaving her humble childhood home for the astonishingly lavish Wyndriven Abbey, in the heart of Mississippi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie has always longed for a comfortable life, and she finds herself both attracted to and shocked by the charm and easy manners of her overgenerous guardian. But as she begins to piece together the mystery of his past, it’s as if, thread by thread, a silken net is tightening around her. And as she gathers stories and catches whispers of his former wives—all with hair as red as her own—in the forgotten corners of the abbey, Sophie knows she’s trapped in the passion and danger of de Cressac’s intoxicating world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glowing strands of romance, mystery, and suspense are woven into this breathtaking debut—a thrilling retelling of the “Bluebeard” fairy tale.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Knowing the outcome doesn’t always make a choice easier . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison Coleman’s life is one big “What if?” As a Searcher, whenever Addie is faced with a choice, she can look into the future and see both outcomes. It’s the ultimate insurance plan against disaster. Or so she thought. When Addie’s parents ambush her with the news of their divorce, she has to pick who she wants to live with—her father, who is leaving the paranormal compound to live among the “Norms,” or her mother, who is staying in the life Addie has always known. Addie loves her life just as it is, so her answer should be easy. One Search six weeks into the future proves it’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one potential future, Addie is adjusting to life outside the Compound as the new girl in a Norm high school where she meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive artist who understands her. In the other path, Addie is being pursued by the hottest guy in school—but she never wanted to be a quarterback’s girlfriend. When Addie’s father is asked to consult on a murder in the Compound, she’s unwittingly drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything she holds dear. With love and loss in both lives, it all comes down to which reality she’s willing to live through . . . and who she can’t live without.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Marcia Brady, eldest daughter on television's &lt;em&gt;The Brady Bunch&lt;/em&gt;, had it all—style, looks, boys, brains, and talent. No wonder her younger sister Jan was jealous! For countless adolescents across America who came of age in the early 1970s, Marcia was the ideal American teenager. Girls wanted to be her. Boys wanted to date her. But what viewers didn't know about the always-sunny, perfect Marcia was that offscreen, her real-life counterpart, Maureen McCormick, the young actress who portrayed her, was living a very different—and not-so-wonderful—life. Now, for the very first time, Maureen tells the shocking and inspirational true story of the beloved teen generations have invited into their living rooms—and the woman she became.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Here's the Story&lt;/em&gt;, Maureen takes us behind the scenes of America's favorite television family, the Bradys. With poignancy and candor, she reveals the lifelong friendships, the hurtful jealousies, the offscreen romance, the loving support her television family provided during a life-or-death moment, and the inconsolable loss of a man who had been a second father. But &lt;em&gt;The Brady Bunch&lt;/em&gt; was only the beginning. Haunted by the perfection of her television alter ego, Maureen landed on the dark side, caught up in a fast-paced, drug-fueled, star-studded Hollywood existence that ultimately led to the biggest battle of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving from drug dens on Wonderland Avenue to wild parties at the Playboy mansion and exotic escapades on the beaches of Hawaii, this candid, hard-hitting memoir exposes a side of a beloved pop-culture icon the paparazzi missed. Yet it is also a story of remarkable success. After kicking her drug habit, Maureen battled depression, reconnected with her mother, whom she nursed through the end of her life, and then found herself in a pitched battle for her family in which she ultimately triumphed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no question: Maureen McCormick is a survivor. After fifty years, she has finally learned what it means to love the person you are, insight that has brought her peace in a happy marriage and as a mother. &lt;em&gt;Here's the Story&lt;/em&gt; is the empowering, engaging, shocking, and emotional tale of Maureen McCormick's courageous struggle over adversity and her lifelong battle to come to terms with the idea of perfection—and herself.</description>

  <description>Death hasn't visited Rowan Rose since it took her mother when Rowan was only a little girl. But that changes one bleak morning, when five horses and their riders thunder into her village and through the forest, disappearing into the hills. Days later, the riders' bodies are found, and though no one can say for certain what happened in their final hours, their remains prove that whatever it was must have been brutal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowan's village was once a tranquil place, but now things have changed. Something has followed the path those riders made and has come down from the hills, through the forest, and into the village. Beast or man, it has brought death to Rowan's door once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only this time, its appetite is insatiable.</description>

  <description>Ananna of the Tanarau abandons ship when her parents try to marry her off to another pirate clan. But that only prompts the scorned clan to send an assassin after her. When Ananna faces him down one night, armed with magic she doesn't really know how to use, she accidentally activates a curse binding them together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To break the spell, Ananna and the assassin must complete three impossible tasks--all while grappling with evil wizards, floating islands, haughty manticores, runaway nobility, strange magic...and the growing romantic tension between them.</description>

  <description>Evan Lennox is going nowhere fast. She's living with her grandparents after her parents bailed on her, she got kicked out of her posh private school, her ex-boyfriend proved to be the biggest sleaze imaginable, her former best friend is a back-stabber, and her current best friend is stuck in backwoods NJ. To top it all off, one teeny, tiny fire she lit to burn some memories of her ex goes a little out of control and winds up igniting a good piece of a very powerful family's pecan orchard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan lands her pampered behind in court and gets sentenced to community service. Which she knows she deserves. But the hard labor and humiliation may be her undoing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she meets Winchester Youngblood on the site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything about him is tricky, confusing, not at all what it seems, and so sexy, Evan can't resist pulling closer. But every step she takes to get to know him gives her more of a reason to back up and put him as far out of life as she possibly can. Because Winch is one hundred percent complicated, and Evan isn't looking for that. At all. She needs to meet a nice, responsible guy, not share searing kisses with the charming hustler she met after they both got sentenced in court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Winch is so much more than what he seems, and Evan finds out that she's falling hard for the guy everyone underestimates and writes off. And Winch realizes that Evan is the one person who's ever challenged him to ask for more out of his life, and her courage inspires him to try to be the person she sees when she looks at him. With every single odd stacked against them, Evan and Winch need to find out whether they have what it takes to fall for each other.</description>

  <description>Courtesy of watching his mom’s relationships, Sebastian Hawkins knows what girls need to do to get a guy. He has what he considers a PHD in hooking up. When he needs extra cash for a car, Sebastian starts up an online venture as The Hook-up Doctor, to anonymously help girls land the guy of their dreams. Of course, his services don’t offer a happily-ever-after guarantee. He’s seen firsthand getting together never means staying together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he falls in love… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the last girl he would expect…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Totally not in his game plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Sebastian finds himself muddled in the game he’s always prided himself on. He can’t even pick up girls at parties anymore! Why would anyone want to be in love when it turns you into a stuttering, screwed-up, mess with really lame stalker tendencies? Stalking? Totally not his gig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Hook-up Doctor won’t let himself go down easily. He’s always known how to give a girl what she wants and now it’s time to figure out what a boy wants… and he definitely plans on getting it.</description>

  <description>Tana lives in a world where walled cities called Coldtowns exist. In them, quarantined monsters and humans mingle in a decadently bloody mix of predator and prey. The only problem is, once you pass through Coldtown’s gates, you can never leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One morning, after a perfectly ordinary party, Tana wakes up surrounded by corpses. The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Coldest Girl in Coldtown&lt;/em&gt; is a wholly original story of rage and revenge, of guilt and horror, and of love and loathing from bestselling and acclaimed author Holly Black.</description>

      <![CDATA[Well, this started off pretty promising, but ended up not working for me after all. On merit, it's 3 stars, but on feeling, it's really closer to 2.5 for me. <br /><br />I'll add a few more notes at some point...I guess. ]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Regret was for people with nothing to defend, people who had no water.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lynn knows every threat to her pond: drought, a snowless winter, coyotes, and, most importantly, people looking for a drink. She makes sure anyone who comes near the pond leaves thirsty, or doesn't leave at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confident in her own abilities, Lynn has no use for the world beyond the nearby fields and forest. Having a life means dedicating it to survival, and the constant work of gathering wood and water. Having a pond requires the fortitude to protect it, something Mother taught her well during their quiet hours on the rooftop, rifles in hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wisps of smoke on the horizon mean one thing: strangers. The mysterious footprints by the pond, nighttime threats, and gunshots make it all too clear Lynn has exactly what they want, and they won’t stop until they get it….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With evocative, spare language and incredible drama, danger, and romance, debut author Mindy McGinnis depicts one girl’s journey in a barren world not so different than our own.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I knew we were both in mortal danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in that instant I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella ever could have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...</description>

  <description>"This picture book reads like an instant classic.... Oh, yes!" raved &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; in a starred review.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young children will delight in repeating the refrain "OH, NO!" as one animal after another falls into a deep, deep hole in this lively read-aloud. This simple and irresistible picture book by hugely popular picture book creators—Candace Fleming and Caldecott medalist Eric Rohmann—feels like a classic-in-the-making. Fans of Rohmann's Caldecott Medal­-winning &lt;em&gt;My Friend Rabbit,&lt;/em&gt; will be thrilled to see a new book created in the same expressive and comical style.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is definitely a picture book more suited for very young children, as the story is very simple and the language is sing-songy, with many repetitive phrases and rhymes and very few surprises. I think it'd be a nice book to read aloud for story time, complete with prompts for high-pitched sound...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A soaring bedsheet carries a young boy on three incredible adventures in this compelling debut by acclaimed film director Gary Ross.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bartholomew Biddle’s life has always been pretty ordinary, but when a huge wind blows past his window one night, he feels the call of adventure — and he can’t resist the urge to grab his bedsheet and catch a ride. Soon he’s soaring far above his little town, heading wherever the wind takes him! After spending time on an island full of pleasure-seeking pirates and at a prep school that boasts a hundred shades of gray, Bart finds himself in a mysterious cove where the wind doesn’t blow. Stuck, Bart is forced to face the fact that his flying days might be over. Will he ever get home again?</description>

The ever-lovable Daniel Pinkwater spins a funny and sweetly offbeat story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One morning, the bear finds something just outside his cave. It is orange and long and pointy and has bushy green leaves at one end. And it’s sweet and crunchy! Where did it come from? Did someone leave it for him? Then there are two more of the sweet crunchy things the next morning! The bear knows that someone nice is leaving him these treats. If only he could discover who it is! Should he leave something tasty in return? With the help of Will Hillenbrand’s endearing illustrations, the inimitable Daniel Pinkwater spins a charming little mystery about unexpected kindnesses and finding that extra-special someone.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A summer of firsts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Eliza Miller has never made a phone call, never tried on a pair of jeans, never sat in a darkened theater waiting for a movie to start. She’s never even talked to someone her age who isn’t Amish, like her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A summer of good-byes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she leaves her close-knit family to spend the summer as a nanny in suburban Chicago, a part of her can’t wait to leave behind everything she knows. She can’t imagine the secrets she will uncover, the friends she will make, the surprises and temptations of a way of life so different from her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A summer of impossible choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every minute Eliza spends with her new friend Josh feels as good as listening to music for the first time, and she wonders whether there might be a place for her in his world. But as summer wanes, she misses the people she has left behind, and the plain life she once took for granted. Eliza will have to decide for herself where she belongs. Whichever choice she makes, she knows she will lose someone she loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;And girl created boy…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the beginning, there was an apple—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there was a car crash, a horrible injury, and a hospital. But before Evening Spiker’s head clears a strange boy named Solo is rushing her to her mother’s research facility. There, under the best care available, Eve is left alone to heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Eve thinks she will die—not from her injuries, but from boredom—her mother gives her a special project: Create the perfect boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using an amazingly detailed simulation, Eve starts building a boy from the ground up. Eve is creating Adam. And he will be just perfect... won’t he?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Find your voice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hopeless. Freak. Elephant. Pitiful. These are the words of Skinny, the vicious voice that lives inside fifteen-year-old Ever Davies’s head. Skinny tells Ever all the dark thoughts her classmates have about her. Ever knows she weighs over three hundred pounds, knows she’ll probably never be loved, and Skinny makes sure she never forgets it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is another voice: Ever’s singing voice, which is beautiful but has been silenced by Skinny. Partly in the hopes of trying out for the school musical—and partly to try and save her own life—Ever decides to undergo a risky surgery that may help her lose weight and start over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the support of her best friend, Ever begins the uphill battle toward change. But demons, she finds, are not so easy to shake, not even as she sheds pounds. Because Skinny is still around. And Ever will have to confront that voice before she can truly find her own.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;An inspiring, bittersweet love story about making every day count.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bryce remembers it like it was yesterday. The scent of chlorine. The blinding crack and flash of pain. Blood in the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she wakes up in the hospital, all Bryce can think of is her disastrous Olympic diving trial. But everything is different now. Bryce still feels seventeen, so how can her little sister be seventeen, too? Life went on without her while Bryce lay in a coma for five years. Her best friend and boyfriend have just graduated from college. Her parents barely speak. And everything she once dreamed of doing—winning a gold medal, traveling the world, falling in love—seems beyond her reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bryce has changed too, in seemingly impossible ways.  She knows things she shouldn’t. Things that happened while she was asleep. Things that haven’t even happened yet. During one luminous summer, as she comes to understand that her dreams have changed forever, Bryce learns to see life for what it truly is: extraordinary.</description>

  <description>I'm going to be totally honest. This is not the kind of book that can help you. It's not a "how-to, " a "when-to, " or a "what-to-expect." Let's compare: Those "know-it-all" books tell you how to have a happy, healthy pregnancy. My book mentions a squirrel. Those books tell you how to care for a newborn child. My book describes how tired I am. Those books give you essential information you can use in a life-threatening emergency. My book has some very amusing anecdotes about poop. So really, it's up to you. If you want to be prepared and well-informed, I understand. But if you enjoy seeing the words "pterodactyl" and "uterus" in the same book, you've come to the right place.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A haunted house, a buried mystery, and a very angry ghost make this one unforgettable thriller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade loves the house she's just moved into with her family. She doesn't even mind being the new girl at the high school: It's a fresh start, and there's that one guy with the dreamy blue eyes. . . . But then things begin happening. Strange, otherworldly things. Jade's little brother claims to see a glimmering girl in his room. Jade's jewelry gets moved around, as if by an invisible hand. Kids at school whisper behind her back like they know something she doesn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Jade must face an impossible fact: that her perfect house is haunted. Haunted by a ghost who's seeking not just vengeance, but the truth. The ghost of a girl who ruled Jade's school — until her untimely death last year. It's up to Jade to put the pieces together before her own life is at stake. As Jade investigates the mystery, she discovers that her new friends in town have more than a few deep, dark secrets. But is one of them a murderer?</description>

  <description>For the second time in his short life, Teddy Clock has survived a massacre. Two years ago, he barely escaped when his entire family was slaughtered. Now, at fourteen, in a hideous echo of the past, Teddy is the lone survivor of his foster family’s mass murder. Orphaned once more, the traumatized teenager has nowhere to turn—until the Boston PD puts detective Jane Rizzoli on the case. Determined to protect this young man, Jane discovers that what seemed like a coincidence is instead just one horrifying part of a relentless killer’s merciless mission.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Jane spirits Teddy to the exclusive Evensong boarding school, a sanctuary where young victims of violent crime learn the secrets and skills of survival in a dangerous world. But even behind locked gates, and surrounded by acres of sheltering Maine wilderness, Jane fears that Evensong’s mysterious benefactors aren’t the only ones watching. When strange blood-splattered dolls are found dangling from a tree, Jane knows that her instincts are dead on. And when she meets Will Yablonski and Claire Ward, students whose tragic pasts bear a shocking resemblance to Teddy’s, it becomes chillingly clear that a circling predator has more than one victim in mind.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Joining forces with her trusted partner, medical examiner Maura Isles, Jane is determined to keep these orphans safe from harm. But an unspeakable secret dooms the children’s fate—unless Jane and Maura can finally put an end to an obsessed killer’s twisted quest.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He must find redemption in the most unlikely bedchamber...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Victorian England vice of every kind can be purchased, and Matthew, the Earl of Wallingford, makes certain he avails himself of every possible pleasure. Bored and jaded, he is as well-known for his coldness as for his licentious affairs with beautiful women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While these numerous dalliances fulfill Matthew's every physical need, they secretly leave him numb and emotionally void. Until one night when he finds himself beaten, eyes bandaged and in the care of a nurse with the voice of an angel - and a gentle touch that soothes the darkness in him and makes him yearn for more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Jane Rankin is a lowly nurse, considered shy and plain by most. There is no place for her amongst the lords and ladies of the aristocracy - despite Matthew's growing craving for the fire that burns behind her earnest facade. And then there is Matthew's secret. A secret so humiliating and scandalous is could destroy everyone he loves. A sin, he fears, not even the love of a good woman can take away...</description>

  <description>Karin Slaughter's new novel is an epic tale of love, loyalty, and murder that encompasses forty years, two chillingly similar murder cases, and a good man's deepest secrets. &lt;br&gt; Will Trent is a brilliant agent with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Newly in love, he is beginning to put a difficult past behind him. Then a local college student goes missing, and Will is inexplicably kept off the case by his supervisor and mentor, deputy director Amanda Wagner. Will cannot fathom Amanda's motivation until the two of them literally collide in an abandoned orphanage they have both been drawn to for different reasons. Decades before--when Will's father was imprisoned for murder--this was his home. . . . &lt;br&gt; Flash back nearly forty years. In the summer Will Trent was born, Amanda Wagner is going to college, making Sunday dinners for her father, taking her first steps in the boys' club that is the Atlanta Police Department. One of her first cases is to investigate a brutal crime in one of the city's worst neighborhoods. Amanda and her partner, Evelyn, are the only ones who seem to care if an arrest is ever made. &lt;br&gt; Now the case that launched Amanda's career has suddenly come back to life, intertwined with the long-held mystery of Will's birth and parentage. And these two dauntless investigators will each need to face down demons from the past if they are to prevent an even greater terror from being unleashed. &lt;br&gt; A masterpiece of character, atmosphere, and riveting suspense, "Criminal" is the most powerful and moving novel yet from one of our most gifted storytellers at work today. &lt;br&gt;Advance praise for "Criminal" &lt;br&gt;"Karin Slaughter's best yet by far: All her signature strengths are amplified a hundredfold by the past explaining the present. Reading this book was like watching a great athlete having a career year."--Lee Child &lt;br&gt;"Fascinating . . . Slaughter delivers another riveting, pulse-pounding crime novel."--"Booklist "(starred review)</description>

  <description>Following the unexpected death of her father, 18-year-old Layken is forced to be the rock for both her mother and younger brother. Outwardly, she appears resilient and tenacious, but inwardly, she's losing hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Will Cooper: The attractive, 21-year-old new neighbor with an intriguing passion for slam poetry and a unique sense of humor. Within days of their introduction, Will and Layken form an intense emotional connection, leaving Layken with a renewed sense of hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not long after an intense, heart-stopping first date, they are slammed to the core when a shocking revelation forces their new relationship to a sudden halt. Daily interactions become impossibly painful as they struggle to find a balance between the feelings that pull them together, and the secret that keeps them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Filled with humor, raw emotion, a strong voice, and a brilliant dog named Sandy Koufax, &lt;/em&gt;When You Were Here&lt;em&gt; explores the two most powerful forces known to man-death and love. Daisy Whitney brings her characters to life with a deft touch and resonating authenticity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danny's mother lost her five-year battle with cancer three weeks before his graduation-the one day that she was hanging on to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Danny is left alone, with only his memories, his dog, and his heart-breaking ex-girlfriend for company. He doesn't know how to figure out what to do with her estate, what to say for his Valedictorian speech, let alone how to live or be happy anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he gets a letter from his mom's property manager in Tokyo, where she had been going for treatment, it shows a side of a side of his mother he never knew. So, with no other sense of direction, Danny travels to Tokyo to connect with his mother's memory and make sense of her final months, which seemed filled with more joy than Danny ever knew. There, among the cherry blossoms, temples, and crowds, and with the help of an almost-but-definitely-not Harajuku girl, he begins to see how it may not have been ancient magic or mystical treatment that kept his mother going. Perhaps, the secret of how to live lies in how she died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Within the walls of Baalboden, beneath the shadow of the city’s brutal leader, Rachel Adams has a secret. While other girls sew dresses, host dinner parties, and obey their male Protectors, Rachel knows how to survive in the wilderness and deftly wield a sword. When her father, Jared, fails to return from a courier mission and is declared dead, the Commander assigns Rachel a new Protector, her father’s apprentice, Logan—the same boy Rachel declared her love for two years ago, and the same boy who handed her heart right back to her. Left with nothing but fierce belief in her father’s survival, Rachel decides to escape and find him herself. But treason against the Commander carries a heavy price, and what awaits her in the Wasteland could destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At nineteen, Logan McEntire is many things. Orphan. Outcast. Inventor. As apprentice to the city’s top courier, Logan is focused on learning his trade so he can escape the tyranny of Baalboden. But his plan never included being responsible for his mentor’s impulsive daughter. Logan is determined to protect her, but when his escape plan goes wrong and Rachel pays the price, he realizes he has more at stake than disappointing Jared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Rachel and Logan battle their way through the Wasteland, stalked by a monster that can’t be killed and an army of assassins out for blood, they discover romance, heartbreak, and a truth that will incite a war decades in the making.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>2.5 stars</strong> This was...fine. But felt like an urban fantasy set in a fantasy/dystopian world, and I didn't really care that much about the characters.<br /><br />I did like the way some of the action scenes were written, and the [spoilers removed] was genuinely shocking.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The final book in The Ghost and the Goth Trilogy!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ghost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been trapped in the body of Lily “Ally” Turner for a month now. Talk about a fashion crisis on an epic scale. What worries me more, though, is sometimes I catch Will looking at me like he thinks I’m Lily...or that he wishes I were. Without the good looks of my former self, I don’t know who I am, or if who that is is good enough. I need out of this mess. Now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will and I have been looking for a solution, one that would separate me from Lily without killing her. But it’s not going well. Then, when it seems like things couldn’t get any worse, we run into Misty, my former best friend and boyfriend-stealer extraordinaire, who claims she’s being haunted...by me. Seriously?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m determined to get to the bottom of who’s pretending to be the spirit of Alona Dare (while I’m pretending to be someone else) and then get the heck out of this body. Or die trying...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ll admit it. It’s really weird to look at Alona but see Lily. I do know the difference, though, contrary to what Alona might be saying. And Alona is more than a pretty face to me, not that she would believe that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our one lead for some help in this messed up situation might be a page torn from the yellow pages-—the “Psychics” section-—I found in my dad’s stuff. One of the “fakes” seems a bit more real-—and odd-—than the others. Before I can investigate further, though, Alona is off and chasing a ghost that’s probably nothing more than a figment of Misty’s guilty imagination. Now Lily’s family is freaking out because she didn’t come home, my mom is ordering me to stay out of it, and something is definitely wrong with the person formerly known as Lily “Ally” Turner...</description>

  <description>Fed up with her wild behavior, sixteen-year-old Lex's parents ship her off to upstate New York to live with her Uncle Mort for the summer, hoping that a few months of dirty farm work will whip her back into shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But Uncle Mort's true occupation is much dirtier than shoveling manure. He's a Grim Reaper. And he's going to teach Lex the family business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She quickly assimilates into the peculiar world of Croak, a town populated by reapers who deliver souls from this life to the next. But Lex can't stop her desire for justice - or is it vengeance? - whenever she encounters a murder victim, craving to stop the attackers before they can strike again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she ditch Croak and go rogue with her reaper skills?</description>

It took about 20% for me to really get into the book (the narrative voice and humor seemed a little unusual to me at first), but once the story got going it was pretty cute and a very entertaining read. Good for those occasions when you want something a little more lighthearted...b...]]>

  <description>Summer scatters three friends, ties them back together, and makes them question who they have been and who they want to be in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna expected to soak up the knowledge of great Irish writers at her summer workshop in Dublin. But there are some things even the best books can't teach you, and a passionate new friend and an old familiar full of surprises challenge Brenna to follow her heart. By the time she's back in the States, she can't wait to throw herself back into Jake's arms and tell him exactly what he means to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She puts the brakes on that plan when it becomes clear that Jake may not be ready to shoulder any more. He visits his family's palatial home in the mountains of New York, and is exposed to all the possibilities a life surrounded by his pampered relatives and washed in money would hold for him. But is it possible to accept so much and not change who you are? Jake has to face the reality that changing sometimes means losing things...but how much is he willing to put on the line?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saxon has been thrust into a life of drudgery and indentured service he never dreamed of after a brush with the law puts him on family-enforced probation. Who would have thought Sussex County's resident bad-ass layabout would fall head-over-heels in love with a girl, an elderly aunt, and a shot at a whole new life. The problem is, he's a Maclean to his marrow, and it's in his blood to be a selfish screw-up. Isn't it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna, Jake, and Saxon spend one summer growing up, working things out, and doing their best to weather the changes that get thrown their way. But can the love and friendships of one amazing summer last through the ups and downs of the coming years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slow Twitch is book number three in the Brenna Blixen series. Book one is Double Clutch, and book two is Junk Miles. All books in this series are YA Mature. Slow Twitch contains sex, drug references, alcohol consumption, and swearing. It is intended for mature or older readers.</description>

      <![CDATA[Briefly: I enjoyed this, even though the story meandered quite a bit. I was surprised by how smooth the transitions were between Brenna, Saxon's, and Jake's POVs, and it was kind of fun to be in the boys' heads for once. I wasn't so crazy about all the "Brenna is so hot" comments again and again...]]>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Popularity is the best revenge. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final weeks of eighth grade, Lauren Wood made a choice. She betrayed her best friend, Helen, in a manner so publicly humiliating that Helen had to move to a new town just to save face. Ditching Helen was worth it, though, because Lauren started high school as one of the It Girls--and now, at the start of her senior year, she's the cheerleading captain, the quarterback's girlfriend, and the undisputed queen bee. Lauren has everything she's ever wanted, and she has forgotten all about her ex-best friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Helen could never forget Lauren. After three years of obsessing, she's moving back to her old town. She has a new name and a new look, but she hasn’t dropped her old grudges. She has a detailed plan to bring down her former BFF by taking away everything that's ever been important to Lauren—starting with her boyfriend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch out, Lauren Wood. Things are about to get bitchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Life's a beach . . . and then you're undead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this must-have collection, five of today's hottest writers—Libba Bray (A Great and Terrible Beauty), Cassandra Clare (City of Bones), Claudia Gray (Evernight), Maureen Johnson (13 Little Blue Envelopes), and Sarah Mlynowski (Bras &amp;amp; Broomsticks)—tell supernatural tales of vacations gone awry. Lost luggage is only mildly unpleasant compared to bunking with a witch who holds a grudge. And a sunburn might be embarrassing and painful, but it doesn't last as long as a curse. Of course, even in the most hellish of situations, love can thrive. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From light and funny to dark and creepy, these stories have something for everyone. You definitely won't want to leave this collection at home!</description>

  <description>Kami Glass loves someone she’s never met . . . a boy she’s talked to in her head ever since she was born. She wasn’t silent about her imaginary friend during her childhood, and is thus a bit of an outsider in her sleepy English town of Sorry-in-the-Vale. Still, Kami hasn’t suffered too much from not fitting in. She has a best friend, runs the school newspaper, and is only occasionally caught talking to herself. Her life is in order, just the way she likes it, despite the voice in her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that changes when the Lynburns return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lynburn family has owned the spectacular and sinister manor that overlooks Sorry-in-the-Vale for centuries. The mysterious twin sisters who abandoned their ancestral home a generation ago are back, along with their teenage sons, Jared and Ash, one of whom is eerily familiar to Kami. Kami is not one to shy away from the unknown—in fact, she’s determined to find answers for all the questions Sorry-in-the-Vale is suddenly posing. Who is responsible for the bloody deeds in the depths of the woods? What is her own mother hiding? And now that her imaginary friend has become a real boy, does she still love him? Does she hate him? Can she trust him?</description>

  <description>Audrey Whitticomb has nothing to fear. Her mother is the superhero Morning Star, the most deadly crime-fighter in the Twin Cities, so it's hard for Audrey not to feel safe. That is, until she's lured into the sweet night air by something human and not human--something with talons and teeth, and a wide, scarlet smile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Audrey knows the truth: her mom doesn't fight crime at night. She fights Harrowers--livid, merciless beings who were trapped Beneath eons ago. Yet some have managed to escape. And they want Audrey dead, just because of who she is: one of the Kin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To survive, Audrey will need to sharpen the powers she has always had. When she gets close to someone, dark corners of the person's memories become her own, and she sometimes even glimpses the future. If Audrey could only get close to Patrick Tigue, a powerful Harrower masquerading as human, she could use her Knowing to discover the Harrowers' next move. But Leon, her mother's bossy, infuriatingly attractive sidekick, has other ideas. Lately, he won't let Audrey out of his sight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an unthinkable betrayal puts Minneapolis in terrible danger, Audrey discovers a wild, untamed power within herself. It may be the key to saving her herself, her family, and her city. Or it may be the force that destroys everything--and everyone--she loves.</description>

  <description>Pia has grown up in a secret laboratory hidden deep in the Amazon rain forest. She was raised by a team of scientists who have created her to be the start of a new immortal race. But on the night of her seventeenth birthday, Pia discovers a hole in the electric fence that surrounds her sterile home―and sneaks outside the compound for the first time in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Free in the jungle, Pia meets Eio, a boy from a nearby village. Together, they embark on a race against time to discover the truth about Pia's origin―a truth with deadly consequences that will change their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Origin&lt;/em&gt; is a beautifully told, shocking new way to look at an age-old desire: to live forever, no matter the cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;To survive in a ruined world, she must embrace the darkness…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allison Sekemoto survives in the Fringe, the outermost circle of a walled-in city. By day, she and her crew scavenge for food. By night, any one of them could be eaten. Some days, all that drives Allie is her hatred of&lt;em&gt; them&lt;/em&gt;—the vampires who keep humans as blood cattle. Until the night Allie herself dies and becomes one of the monsters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to flee her city, Allie must pass for human as she joins a ragged group of pilgrims seeking a legend—a place that might have a cure for the disease that killed off most of civilization and created the rabids, the bloodthirsty creatures who threaten human and vampire alike. And soon Allie will have to decide what and who is worth dying for… again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Julie Kagawa's dark and twisted world as an unforgettable journey begins.</description>

  <description>If you hang around with dead people, life can get pretty complicated. Take it from Charley Davidson, part-time private investigator and full-time Grim Reaper. &lt;em&gt;Complicated&lt;/em&gt; is her middle name. The deceased find her very sparkly. Demons find her irresistible. And one entity in particular wants to seduce her in every way possible.&lt;p&gt;When Charley and Cookie (her best friend/receptionist) have to track down a missing woman, the case is not quite as open and shut as they anticipate. Cookie's friend Mimi disappeared five days earlier. Mimi then sends Cookie a cryptic message telling Cookie to meet her at an nearby coffee shop. The coffee is brewing, but Mimi's still missing. There is, however, a clue Mimi left on the bathroom wall: a woman's name. Mimi's husband explains to them that his wife had been acting strange since she found out an old high school friend had been murdered. The same woman whose name Mimi had scribbled on the bathroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Reyes Alexander Farrow (otherwise known as the Son of Satan. Yes. Literally) has left his corporeal body and is haunting Charley. He's left his body because he's being tortured by demons who want to lure Charley closer. But Reyes can't let that happen. Because if the demons get to Charley, they'll have a portal to heaven...well, let's just say it wouldn't be pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Charley handle hot nights with Reyes and even hotter days tracking down a missing woman? Can she keep those she loves out of harm's way? And is there enough coffee and chocolate in the world to fuel her as she does?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is your signpost for the most hilarious read of the year: &lt;em&gt;Second Grave on the Left&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It all begins with a stupid question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a Global Vagabond?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, but 18-year-old Bria Sandoval wants to be. In a quest for independence, her neglected art, and no-strings-attached hookups, she signs up for a guided tour of Central America—the wrong one. Middle-aged tourists with fanny packs are hardly the key to self-rediscovery. When Bria meets Rowan, devoted backpacker and dive instructor, and his outspokenly humanitarian sister Starling, she seizes the chance to ditch her group and join them off the beaten path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bria's a good girl trying to go bad. Rowan's a bad boy trying to stay good. As they travel across a panorama of Mayan villages, remote Belizean islands, and hostels plagued with jungle beasties, they discover what they've got in common: both seek to leave behind the old versions of themselves. And the secret to escaping the past, Rowan’s found, is to keep moving forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bria comes to realize she can't run forever, no matter what Rowan says. If she ever wants the courage to fall for someone worthwhile, she has to start looking back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirsten Hubbard lends her artistry to this ultimate backpacker novel, weaving her drawings into the text. Her career as a travel writer and her experiences as a real-life vagabond backpacking Central America are deeply seeded in this inspiring story.</description>

  <description>Thirteen-year-old Lacey wakes to a beautiful summer morning excited to begin her new job at the library, just as her mother is supposed to start work at the grocery store. Lacey hopes that her mother's ghosts have finally been laid to rest; after all, she &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; so much better these days, and they really do need the money. But as the hours tick by and memories come flooding back, a day full of hope spins terrifyingly out of control...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now this award-winning YA author brings us an equally gripping story of a girl who loves her mother, but must face the truth of what life with that mother means for both of them.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> This is a pretty intriguing novel, especially because the events mostly unfold over the course of one day and the story went in directions I didn't quite expect. 14-year-old Lacey has a lot on her plate for someone who's so young; she's trying to pretend everything is normal to the outs...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The third compulsively readable book in the smart and witty series about a high school for gifted students. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Miranda Bloom has scored an adorable, lacrosse-playing boyfriend, Dex McConnell, and an awesomely easy summer job looking after a ten year old mini-genius, Amelia. This summer is going to be sweet...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then reality puts the brakes on everything. Though Dex and Miranda are official, she feels like he's keeping secrets-secrets that may have to do with his fashion model ex-girlfriend. Meanwhile, Amelia is harder to figure out than advanced trigonometry. How can they bond if all she does is practice the piano? Plus Miranda's mom just invited her to live in London with her. Living across the pond would be great, but can she really leave Geek High &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Dex?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Looks like Miranda has a secret of her own...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Looking for love in all the wrong countries…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miranda Bloom�s life has never been better. She finally has an almost-quasi-boyfriend, Dex McConnell, the star lacrosse player of Orange Cove High. But when holiday break rolls around, she jets off to visit her mother in London, and Dex suddenly seems to lose all interest in her. Then there�s Henry, the very cute and very available British guy who complicates matters by making it clear that he�s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; interested in Miranda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Things don�t get easier for her when classes start back up at Geek High. Between the dreaded Math Team competitions, an annoyingly love-struck best friend, and a stepmother who seems to delight in making Miranda miserable, it doesn�t take a genius to see that the semester ahead is going to be tough.</description>

  <description>A pesar de su brevedad y de su sencillez, o tal vez gracias a estos mismos rasgos, pocos relatos han gozado&lt;br&gt;de tal popularidad a lo largo de la historia de Occidente como este conjunto de fábulas atribuidas a Esopo (620 - 560 a.&lt;br&gt;C.). Aunque diversos autores reescribieron el corpus esópico durante la Antigüedad clásica, la Edad Media, el&lt;br&gt;Renacimiento y el siglo XVIII, fue quien fijó la estructura más perdurable de este tipo de relatos, poblados por&lt;br&gt;animales de rasgos humanos como el mono vanidoso, el asno torpe o el astuto zorro. Y aunque hoy en día el legado de&lt;br&gt;Esopo sigue siendo lectura obligada para la educación moral de los niños, el uso escolar no debe desmerecer esta&lt;br&gt;selección clásica realizada a partir de las mejores críticas del repertorio del fabulista.</description>

  <description>Ally Ryan would rather be in Maryland. She would rather be anywhere, in fact, than Orchard Hill, site of her downfall. Well, not hers exactly—but when your father’s hedge fund goes south and all your friends lose their trust funds, things don’t look so sunny for you. Her mother moved her to Maryland to flee the shame, but now they’re moving back. Back to the country-club, new-car-every-year, my-family-came-over-on-the-Mayflower lifestyle that Ally has outgrown. One bright spot, however, is gorgeous, intense Jake Graydon. But it won’t be easy for the two of them to be together—not if his friends (her former friends) have anything to say about it. Is Ally ready to get thrown back into the drama of the life she left behind?</description>

  <description>Jane Eliot wears an iron mask. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the only way to contain the fey curse that scars her cheek. The Great War is five years gone, but its scattered victims remain—the ironskin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a carefully worded listing appears for a governess to assist with a "delicate situation"—a child born during the Great War—Jane is certain the child is fey-cursed, and that she can help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teaching the unruly Dorie to suppress her curse is hard enough; she certainly didn’t expect to fall for the girl’s father, the enigmatic artist Edward Rochart. But her blossoming crush is stifled by her own scars, and by his parade of women. Ugly women, who enter his closed studio...and come out as beautiful as the fey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane knows Rochart cannot love her, just as she knows that she must wear iron for the rest of her life. But what if neither of these things is true? Step by step Jane unlocks the secrets of her new life—and discovers just how far she will go to become whole again.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the end of the world. Six students have taken cover in Cortege High but shelter is little comfort when the dead outside won’t stop pounding on the doors. One bite is all it takes to kill a person and bring them back as a monstrous version of their former self. To Sloane Price, that doesn’t sound so bad. Six months ago, &lt;em&gt;her &lt;/em&gt;world collapsed and since then, she’s failed to find a reason to keep going. Now seems like the perfect time to give up. As Sloane eagerly waits for the barricades to fall, she’s forced to witness the apocalypse through the eyes of five people who actually &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to live. But as the days crawl by, the motivations for survival change in startling ways and soon the group’s fate is determined less and less by what’s happening outside and more and more by the unpredictable and violent bids for life—&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;death—inside. When everything is gone, what do &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;hold on to?</description>

  <description>At this school, everyone's a geek. And Miranda Bloom &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; can't fit in...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Miranda is a math genius with divorced parents, an evil stepmother, and no boyfriend in sight. She can't even fit in with the other geeks at the Nottingham Independent School for high-IQ students, because &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; actually have useful talents. Miranda, on the other hand, is known as "The Human Calculator," which doesn't amount to much when people have, you know, their own calculators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then Miranda gets stuck planning the school's Snowflake Gala. And as she struggles to find a date and drum up some school spirit at Nottingham-aka "Geek High"-she finds that who you are means more than where you fit in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;There are stories where the girl gets her prince, and they live happily ever after. (This is not one of those stories.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenna Lord’s first sixteen years were not exactly a fairytale. Her father is a controlling psycho and her mother is a drunk. She used to count on her older brother—until he shipped off to Afghanistan. And then, of course, there was the time she almost died in a fire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are stories where the monster gets the girl, and we all shed tears for his innocent victim. (This is not one of those stories either.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Anderson is many things: A dedicated teacher and coach. A caring husband. A man with a certain... magnetism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And there are stories where it’s hard to be sure who’s a prince and who’s a monster, who is a victim and who should live happily ever after. (These are the most interesting stories of all.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drowning Instinct&lt;/em&gt; is a novel of pain, deception, desperation, and love against the odds—and the rules.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> This is a compelling read, and I appreciate the complexity/moral ambiguity that the author was trying to portray. <br /><br />I felt very detached from these characters overall, however, and it doesn't help that I found the story to be predictable up until the very end. I can see why this one has s...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The follow-up to &lt;em&gt;A Mermaid's Kiss&lt;/em&gt;-from a national bestselling author who "stands out in a genre known for its out-of-the-ordinary love play."(&lt;em&gt;The Romance Studio&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Mina is the daughter of an unholy union-a mermaid taken by one of the malevolent Dark Ones. While helping to rescue Prime Legion Commander Jonah, she exposed herself as a potentially dangerous weapon, susceptible to the darkness in her own blood. Now, for the general good, Jonah has angels watching over her...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Though Mina is resistant to being protected, her attitude begins to change when David, the human-born angel, is awarded the duty. Looking into his eyes, she can sense that he too knows what it means to fight the darkness within. But-as their passion threatens to take over-will it lead them to Heaven or Hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Once the flames are ignited . . .&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miranda Ellis is a woman tormented. Plagued since birth by a strange and powerful gift, she has spent her entire life struggling to control her exceptional abilities. Yet one innocent but irreversible mistake has left her family's fortune decimated and forced her to wed London's most nefarious nobleman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They will burn for eternity . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Benjamin Archer is no ordinary man. Doomed to hide his disfigured face behind masks, Archer knows it's selfish to take Miranda as his bride. Yet he can't help being drawn to the flame-haired beauty whose touch sparks a passion he hasn't felt in a lifetime. When Archer is accused of a series of gruesome murders, he gives in to the beastly nature he has fought so hard to hide from the world. But the curse that haunts him cannot be denied. Now, to save his soul, Miranda will enter a world of dark magic and darker intrigue. For only she can see the man hiding behind the mask.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 stars</strong> I liked this one. It has an intriguing premise, it's set in Victorian London (which I love!), and it's overall very well-written. I would like to have seen a bit more of the supernatural elements as well as character development, however, and for some reason I was never really as drawn...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Planet Thieves&lt;/em&gt; is the first thrilling installment of a new middle-grade series by Dan Krokos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two weeks ago, thirteen-year-old Mason Stark and seventeen of his fellow cadets from the Academy for Earth Space Command boarded the &lt;em&gt;SS Egypt&lt;/em&gt;. The trip was supposed to be a short routine voyage to log their required spacetime for summer quarter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But routine goes out the airlock when they’re attacked by the Tremist, an alien race who have been at war with humanity for the last sixty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the captain and crew dead, injured, or taken prisoner, Mason and the cadets are all that’s left to warn the ESC. And soon they find out exactly why the Tremist chose this ship to attack: the &lt;em&gt;Egypt&lt;/em&gt; is carrying a weapon that could change the war forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Mason will have to lead the cadets in a daring assault to take back the ship, rescue the survivors, and recover the weapon. Before there isn’t a war left to fight.</description>

  <description>"Your mother hollers that you're going to miss the bus. She can see it coming down the street. You don't stop and hug her and tell her you love her. You don't thank her for being a good, kind, patient mother. Of course not--you launch yourself down the stairs and make a run for the corner. &lt;br&gt;""Only, if it's the last time you'll ever see your mother, you sort of start to wish you'd stopped and did those things. Maybe even missed the bus. &lt;br&gt;""But the bus was barreling down our street, so I ran. &lt;br&gt;"Fourteen kids. One superstore. A million things that go wrong. &lt;br&gt;In Emmy Laybourne's action-packed debut novel, six high school kids (some popular, some not), two eighth graders (one a tech genius), and six little kids trapped together in a chain superstore build a refuge for themselves inside. While outside, a series of escalating disasters, beginning with a monster hailstorm and ending with a chemical weapons spill, seems to be tearing the world--as they know it--apart.</description>

When she meets her stepmother, Lisette, Nore is shocked by her youth and beauty that gives her chills- and a hint of something sinister. There's hope of becoming friends with her stepbrother and sister, until Nore realizes they're hiding something. When she begins to feel like the target of a deadly plan, Nore starts digging into her stepfamily's past. The skeletons in their closet are more real than she ever imagined. Can Nore expose her stepmother's dark secret before an old and evil magic swallows her up?</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Dusty Everhart breaks into houses late at night, but not because she’s a criminal. No, she’s a Nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being the only Nightmare at Arkwell Academy, a boarding school for magickind, and living in the shadow of her mother’s infamy, is hard enough. But when Dusty sneaks into Eli Booker’s house, things get a whole lot more complicated. He’s hot, which means sitting on his chest and invading his dreams couldn’t get much more embarrassing. But it does. Eli is dreaming of a murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Eli’s dream comes true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Dusty has to follow the clues—both within Eli’s dreams and out of them—to stop the killer before more people turn up dead. And before the killer learns what she’s up to and marks her as the next target.</description>

Reading the synopsis about this girl who feeds off bad dreams (based on mythical mares in folklore), I didn't expect to find that this story would have a more lighthearted tone.

  <description>They hear the most silent of footsteps.&lt;br&gt;They are faster than anything you've ever seen.&lt;br&gt;And They won't stop chasing you...until you are dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amy is watching TV when it happens, when the world is attacked by Them. These vile creatures are rapidly devouring mankind. Most of the population is overtaken, but Amy manages to escape—and even rescue “Baby,” a toddler left behind in the chaos. Marooned in Amy’s house, the girls do everything they can to survive—and avoid Them at all costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of hiding, they are miraculously rescued and taken to New Hope, a colony of survivors living in a former government research compound. While at first the colony seems like a dream with plenty of food, safety, and shelter, New Hope slowly reveals that it is far from ideal. And Amy soon realizes that unless things change, she’ll lose Baby—and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebellious, courageous, and tender, this unforgettable duo will have you on the edge of your seat as you tear through the pulse-pounding narrow escapes and horrifying twists of fate in this thrilling debut from author Demitria Lunetta.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A dark and tender post-apocalyptic love story set in the aftermath of a bloody war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a city where humans and Darklings are now separated by a high wall and tensions between the two races still simmer after a terrible war, sixteen-year-old Ash Fisher, a half-blood Darkling, and Natalie Buchanan, a human and the daughter of the Emissary, meet and do the unthinkable—they fall in love. Bonded by a mysterious connection that causes Ash’s long-dormant heart to beat, Ash and Natalie first deny and then struggle to fight their forbidden feelings for each other, knowing if they’re caught, they’ll be executed—but their feelings are too strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ash and Natalie then find themselves at the center of a deadly conspiracy that threatens to pull the humans and Darklings back into war, they must make hard choices that could result in both their deaths.</description>

  <description>This stunning debut captures the grotesque madness of a mystical under-land, as well as a girl’s pangs of first love and independence. Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers—precisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll’s &lt;em&gt;Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now.&lt;br&gt; When her mother’s mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice’s tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice’s mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;HER WORLD IS CHANGED FOREVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie lost her parents when the Spore Wars wiped out everyone between the ages of twenty and sixty. She and her little brother, Tyler, go on the run, living as squatters with their friend Michael and fighting off renegades who would kill them for a cookie. Callie's only hope is Prime Destinations, a disturbing place in Beverly Hills run by a mysterious figure known as the Old Man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He hires teens to rent their bodies to Enders—seniors who want to be young again. Callie, desperate for the money that will keep her, Tyler, and Michael alive, agrees to be a donor. But the neurochip they place in Callie's head malfunctions and she wakes up in the life of her renter, living in her mansion, driving her cars, and going out with a senator's grandson. It feels almost like a fairy tale, until Callie discovers that her renter intends to do more than party—and that Prime Destinations' plans are more evil than Callie could ever have imagined. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A lady does not smoke cheroot. She does not ride astride. She does not fence or attend duels. She does not fire a pistol, and she never gambles at a gentlemen's club.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Calpurnia Hartwell has always followed the rules, rules that have left her unmarried—and more than a little unsatisfied. And so she's vowed to break the rules and live the life of pleasure she's been missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to dance every dance, to steal a midnight kiss—to do those things, Callie will need a willing partner. Someone who knows everything about rule-breaking. Someone like Gabriel St. John, the Marquess of Ralston—charming and devastatingly handsome, his wicked reputation matched only by his sinful smile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she's not careful, she'll break the most important rule of all—the one that says that pleasure-seekers should never fall hopelessly, desperately in love.</description>

  <description>Elise is a normal seventeen-year-old girl until the day she wakes up in a desert park, with no idea who she is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After that episode, her life takes a bizarre turn. She’s experiencing unexpected flashes of insight into people’s lives—people she’s never met before. Strangers frighten her with warnings about the approaching Shadows. And although Elise has never had a boyfriend, she suddenly finds herself torn between two handsome but very different young men: Abe, the charming bad boy whose effect on her both seduces and frightens her, and the mysterious Harlin, who’s new to town but with whom Elise feels an urgent, elemental connection—almost as if they are soul mates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Elise begins to question everything about her life. Why do these guys both want her so desperately? What are the Shadows? Why does the name Charlotte inspire a terrifying familiarity? And who is Elise, really?</description>

I liked the introduction of the Shadows and the subplot with Elise's sister, and I'm interested enough to keep reading. But oh, how I wish the romance was written in a less predictab...]]>

  <description>In this gripping exploration of a futuristic afterlife, a teen discovers that death is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since her untimely death the day before her eighteenth birthday, Felicia Ward has been trapped in Level 2, a stark white afterlife located between our world and the next. Along with her fellow drones, Felicia passes the endless hours reliving memories of her time on Earth and mourning what she’s lost-family, friends, and Neil, the boy she loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a girl in a neighboring chamber is found dead, and nobody but Felicia recalls that she existed in the first place. When Julian-a dangerously charming guy Felicia knew in life-comes to offer Felicia a way out, Felicia learns the truth: If she joins the rebellion to overthrow the Morati, the angel guardians of Level 2, she can be with Neil again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suspended between Heaven and Earth, Felicia finds herself at the center of an age-old struggle between good and evil. As memories from her life come back to haunt her, and as the Morati hunt her down, Felicia will discover it’s not just her own redemption at stake… but the salvation of all mankind.</description>

      <![CDATA[I like the concept behind this story so much, but I'm afraid I had more mixed reactions to the characters, which makes it difficult to get engaged with the book; I just didn't like either boy, and I didn't fall in love with Felicia either.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Read a Sneak Peek below!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It starts with an itch you just can't shake.  Then comes a fever and a tickle in your throat.  A few days later, you'll be blabbing your secrets and chatting with strangers like they’re old friends.  Three more, and the paranoid hallucinations kick in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then you're dead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sixteen-year-old Kaelyn lets her best friend leave for school without saying goodbye, she never dreams that she might not see him again.  But then a strange virus begins to sweep through her small island community, infecting young and old alike.  As the dead pile up, the government quarantines the island: no one can leave, and no one can come back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those still healthy must fight for the island’s dwindling supplies, or lose all chance of survival. As everything familiar comes crashing down, Kaelyn joins forces with a former rival and discovers a new love in the midst of heartbreak. When the virus starts to rob her of friends and family, she clings to the belief that there must be a way to save the people she holds dearest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because how will she go on if there isn't?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poignant and dizzying, The Way We Fall is the heart-wrenching story of one girl's bravery and unbeatable spirit as she challenges not just her fears, but her sense of what makes life worth living.</description>

  <description>Nothing but a big mess of trouble and weeds..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's what Jackson Jones thinks of the garden plot his mother gives him for his tenth birthday. What happened to the basketball he's hoped and prayed for all year?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jackson comes up with a moneymaking scheme for the garden, it doesn't seem so bad after all. He even cuts his friends in on the action. But before long, Jackson finds out that friends and business don't always mix. When the neighborhood bully calls him "Bouquet Jones," Jackson is ready to give up. Maybe gardens don't belong in cities after all....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner of the first annual Marguerite de Angeli Prize.</description>

  <description>In finely crafted prose and lush detail, Donna Boyd weaves a spell-binding tapestry of romance and suspense set against richly imagined landscapes of sensuousness. An intense saga of love and betrayal, &lt;em&gt;The Passion&lt;/em&gt; is a story of those who walk the fine line between man beast.On the eve of a brutal murder in contemporary Manhattan, Alexander Devoncroix finally reveals to his son and heir a tightly guarded chapter in the family history, which is know to no outsiders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world in which a superior race of werewolved holds the positions of power, human and werewolf segregation had become the norm. But for the first time, the leaders of the pack have accepted a human. In dazzling nineteenth century Paris, we meet three pivotal players: the young human Tessa LeGuerre, who falls under the spell of a very powerful, very sensual werewolf; Alexander Devoncroix, the charismatic werewolf who adores humans too well, but whose ultimate loyalty is to the pack; and Elise, the imperial pack leader who lays claim to Alexander. Beloved "pet" of select members of the pack, Tessa naively embraces all things werewolf--an ambition that results in unspeakable tragedy.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Picking up where &lt;em&gt;The First Days&lt;/em&gt; ends, &lt;em&gt;Fighting to Survive&lt;/em&gt; features the further zombie-killing, civilization-saving adventures of a pair of sexy, kick butt heroines and the men who love them. A hundred or so survivors of the zombie plague have found tenuous safety in the walled off center of a small Texas town. Now the hard work of survival begins—finding enough food; creating safe, weather-resistant shelter; establishing laws; and fighting off both the undead who want to eat them and the living bandits who want to rob and kill them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fighting to Survive&lt;/em&gt; won the Dead Letter Award for Best Novel from Mail Order Zombie. The first book in the As the World Dies trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The First Days&lt;/em&gt; also won the Dead Letter Award and was named one of the Best Zombie Books of the Decade by the &lt;em&gt;Harrisburg Book Examiner&lt;/em&gt;. Tor Books began bringing this series to a wider audience with the Spring 2011 publication of &lt;em&gt;The First Days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It started with a bus crash.&lt;br&gt;Daisy Appleby was a little girl when it happened, and she barely remembers the accident or being brought back to life. At that moment, though, she became one of the first subjects in a covert government program that tests a drug called Revive.&lt;br&gt;Now fifteen, Daisy has died and been Revived five times. Each death means a new name, a new city, a new identity. The only constant in Daisy's life is constant change.&lt;br&gt;Then Daisy meets Matt and Audrey McKean, charismatic siblings who quickly become her first real friends. But if she's ever to have a normal life, Daisy must escape from an experiment that's much larger--and more sinister--than she ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;From its striking first chapter to its emotionally charged ending, Cat Patrick's &lt;em&gt;Revived&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting story about what happens when life and death collide.</description>

  <description>Jamie Carpenter's life will never be the same. His father is dead, his mother is missing, and he was just rescued by an enormous man named Frankenstein. Jamie is brought to Department 19, where he is pulled into a secret organization responsible for policing the supernatural, founded more than a century ago by Abraham Van Helsing and the other survivors of Dracula. Aided by Frankenstein's monster, a beautiful vampire girl with her own agenda, and the members of the agency, Jamie must attempt to save his mother from a terrifyingly powerful vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Department 19&lt;/em&gt; takes us through history, across Europe, and beyond - from the cobbled streets of Victorian London to prohibition-era New York, from the icy wastes of Arctic Russia to the treacherous mountains of Transylvania. Part modern thriller, part classic horror, it's packed with mystery, mayhem, and a level of suspense that makes a Darren Shan novel look like a romantic comedy.</description>

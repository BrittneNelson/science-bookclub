  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war raging between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Possessed by a deadly beast, Rhage is the most dangerous of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within the brotherhood, Rhage is the vampire with the strongest appetites. He's the best fighter, the quickest to act on his impulses, and the most voracious lover-for inside him burns a ferocious curse cast by the Scribe Virgin. Owned by this dark side, Rhage fears the time when his inner dragon is unleashed, making him a danger to everyone around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary Luce, a survivor of many hardships is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. With a life-threatening curse of her own, Mary is not looking for love. She lost her faith in miracles years ago. But when Rhage's intense animal attraction turns into something more emotional, he knows that he must make Mary his alone. And while their enemies close in, Mary fights desperately to gain life eternal with the one she loves...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there’s a deadly war raging between vampires and their slayers.

Of these, Zsadist is the most terrifying member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A former blood slave, the vampire Zsadist still bears the scars from a past filled with suffering and humiliation.

Anger is his only companion, and terror is his only passion—until he rescues a beautiful aristocrat from the evil Lessening Society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bella is instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses. But even as their desire for one another begins to overtake them both, Zsadist’s thirst for vengeance against Bella’s tormentors drives him to the brink of madness. Now, Bella must help her lover overcome the wounds of his tortured past, and find a future with her…</description>

  <description>In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war going on between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Yet none of them relishes killing more than Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only purebred vampire left on earth, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who murdered his parents centuries ago. But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed-leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate-Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead-a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.</description>

  <description>Hannah can't wait to sneak off for a romantic weekend with her boyfriend, Colin. He's leaving for college soon, and Hannah wants their trip to the lake house to be one they'll never forget. &lt;p&gt;But once Hannah and Colin get there, things start to seem a bit...off. They can't find the town on any map. The house they are staying in looks as if someone's been living there, even though it's been deserted for years. And Colin doesn't seem quite himself. As he grows more unstable, Hannah worries about Colin's dark side, and her own safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is as perfect as it seems, and what lies beneath may haunt her forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This novel opens on the first day of Hannah's senior year, but the story really starts on the last day of her junior year. That's when Hannah not only gets dumped by her boyfriend, Ryan, but she also finds out her best friend, Ava, is going to be gone for the entire summer. But Ava's boyfriend, Noah, is definitely around--and such a good guy that he snags Hannah a job at the diner where he works. Hannah and Noah move from coworkers, to friends....and one night, to something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it's back to school, where Hannah will see Ryan, Ava, and Noah all in one place. Over the course of the day secrets and betrayals are revealed, and alliances are broken and reformed. In the end, Hannah will learn a lot about love, friendship...and herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Be careful what you wish for....&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On her thirty-fourth birthday, Daisy Minor decides to make over her entire life. The small-town librarian has had it with her boring clothes, her ordinary looks, and nearly a decade without so much as a date. It's time to get a life—and a sex life. The perennial good girl, Daisy transforms herself into a party girl extraordinaire—dancing the night away at clubs, laughing and flirting with abandon—and she's declared open season for manhunting.  But her free-spirited fun turns to shattering danger when she witnesses something she shouldn't—and becomes the target of a killer. Now, before she can meet the one man who can share her life, first she may need him to save it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Seamlessly blending heart-pounding romance and breathless intrigue, Linda Howard delivers a stylish and provocative novel that absolutely defies readers to put it down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What would make the perfect man?&lt;/em&gt; That's the delicious topic heating up the proceedings at a certain table of professional women at their favorite restaurant, Ernie's, tonight: Mr. Perfect. What qualities would he have? Would he be tall, dark, and handsome? Caring and warmhearted -- or will just muscular do? Jaine Bright and her three girlfriends start off with the basics -- he'd be faithful and reliable, the responsible type, with a great sense of humor. But as the conversation picks up momentum, so do the quartet's requirements for Mr. Perfect -- and they write down a tongue-in-cheek checklist that's both funny and racy. The next thing they know, the List, as it has come to be called, spreads like wildfire throughout their company and sizzles along e-mail lines. And it doesn't stop there: the List becomes an overnight sensation, grabbing the interest of local newspapers and television coverage. No one expected this avalanche of attention for something that began as a joke among friends. And the joke turns deadly serious when one of the four women is murdered...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prime suspect in the case is the victim's boyfriend, who was one of a number of men who found the List sexist and offensive. But an impenetrable alibi gets him off the hook. Now, with the help of Jaine's neighbor, an unpredictable police detective, the puzzle must be solved -- and time is running out as a deadly stalker targets the three remaining friends. Now, knowing whom to trust and whom to love is a matter of survival -- as the dream of Mr. Perfect becomes a chilling nightmare.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WHO DO YOU LOVE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; One question, a split-second decision, and Brian Darby lies dead on the kitchen floor. His wife, state police trooper Tessa Leoni, claims to have shot him in self-defense, and bears the bruises to back up her tale. For veteran detective D. D. Warren it should be an open-and-shut case. But where is their six-year-old daughter?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; AND HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; As the homicide investigation ratchets into a frantic statewide search for a missing child, D. D. Warren must partner with former lover Bobby Dodge to break through the blue wall of police brotherhood, seeking to understand the inner workings of a trooper’s mind while also unearthing family secrets. Would a trained police officer truly shoot her own husband? And would a mother harm her own child?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; . . . TO SAVE HER?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; For Tessa Leoni, the worst has not yet happened. She is walking a tightrope, with nowhere to turn, no one to trust, as the clock ticks down to a terrifying deadline. She has one goal in sight, and she will use every ounce of her training, every trick at her disposal, to do what must be done. No sacrifice is too great, no action unthinkable. A mother knows who she loves. And all others will be made to pay.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt; Love you more . . .&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>A savage crime has rocked a working-class neighbourhood of Boston; four members of a family have been brutally murdered. The father is lying in an intensive care unit, his survival in doubt. He is the principal suspect. Female police detective D.D. Warren, however, is not one to take things at face value. At the same time, Danielle Burton is about to have her life thrown into turmoil; a nurse whose life is at the service of her profession, she has tentatively recovered from a devastating family tragedy of decades before – and the investigation by Warren and her partner is about to throw Danielle’s life into chaos once again. There is one more angle to the triangle: the devotion of a mother, Victoria Oliver, to her disturbed son is about to be tested to the limit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Gardner Interviews Detective D.D. Warren&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Gardner:&lt;/strong&gt; D.D.--What do you find most fascinating/frustrating about working with the new guy, crime scene expert Alex Wilson?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Alex seems sharp.  Knows his blood spatter--I respect that in a guy.  ‘Course, he’s been teaching at the Academy, which is one thing, while we’re now standing in a Dorchester home with five dead and carnage in every room.  I don’t want lectures, I want results.  This was a family--according the neighbors, even a nice family who seemed to actually like one another.  Until, of course, the father snapped and killed them all.  Or did he?  These are the kinds of questions I gotta ask, and Prof Alex better be ready to answer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; When did you know you were going to have your own novel?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; First time I walked on scene in &lt;em&gt;Alone&lt;/em&gt;.  Please, I’m five times tougher than fellow detective Bobby Dodge and twenty times smarter.  Plus, I look damn good in Jimmy Choos.  Let’s see the former sniper do my job in my heels, then we’ll talk.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; What's the most difficult case you've ever had to handle?  Why? &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; These past two family homicides.  For one thing, any crime involving kids wrecks you a little.  For another...I don’t believe in coincidence.  Here are two families, totally different neighborhoods, socioeconomics, lifestyles, etc., yet they both wind up the same way, dead.  Now, what are the odds of two totally different fathers going whacko in exactly the same way?  I don’t believe it, but my boss isn’t into gut feel.  All comes down to evidence.  I would like some.  Really, it would be nice right about now.  Yo, Alex...&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the thing you love most about being a Boston P.D. Sergeant?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Being in charge, calling all the shots, being the boss.  Did I mention being in charge?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; What's on your nightstand?  What's in the drawer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; On my nightstand--back issue of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin I keep meaning to read.  In the drawer--emergency stash of chocolate, couple of condoms (don’t I wish), and a Kindle loaded up with the latest J.R. Ward steamy hot, seriously action-packed vampire novel.  Tell anyone, and they will never find your body. &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; Favorite food?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve always been partial to Italian.  Which my squadmate Phil, told Alex all about.  Now, Alex claims to be a serious Italian cook--apparently his mother is a Capozzoli and they know their Bolognese.   A little wine, a little homemade pasta, a little tiramisu.  All I gotta do is pick up the phone, tell him a time and date...one phone call.  How hard can that be?  One little call.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; You drive that butch police car all day.  What's your idea of a dream ride?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Walking on a beach.  No car, no pager, no shoes.  Just me, the wind, the waves and the cry of the gulls.  I’d probably go nuts within minutes, but it would be nice to give peace a chance.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; Can you ever see yourself partnering successfully with another cop?  Or are you the quintessential lone wolf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Excuse me, I love my squad and my squad loves me.  Neil is one of the finest detectives around, plus better him than me viewing all the autopsies.  And Phil--hey, family man, great wife, four kids, works in homicide to escape the violence.  Gotta love Phil.  They have my back and I have theirs.  Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; I'm a woman traveling alone, staying in a hotel.  What are your top three tips to keep me safe from psychos?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Most hotel crimes have to do with property theft.  Unfortunately, a guest walking in on a burglary, or a thief breaking in assuming the room’s vacant only to find a guest present, can lead to violence.  Thus, your best defense is to always use the deadbolt, and always advertise when you’re “home,” so to speak.  	&lt;/p&gt;   Bolt all locks anytime you’re in the room and hang out the Do Not Disturb Sign   	  Double-check door is closed and latched (failures happen more than you think)   	  Try to avoid staying in rooms closest to the elevators and/or stairs--these rooms are more frequently targeted by thieves as the location allows for quick getaways.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you have any scars?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe, but you should see the other guy.  Give as good as you get, that’s always been my motto.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; What's the most you've ever spent on a pair of shoes?  Describe! &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Silver sequined Jimmy Choos, on sale $500.  Should never have bought them, but they’re really pretty and when I wear them, I don’t look like a cop, walk like a cop, or think like a cop.  How does that commercial go...?  Oh yeah, priceless.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; If you had to: dog or cat? &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; No!  Never!  Don’t even think it!&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; Tell me something I don't know about you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I like mobiles.  Don’t ask me why.  But there’s something cool about looking up and watching the various shapes and colors slowly twist around.  Sometimes, after a really bad day, I go home, close my eyes and create mobiles in my head--maybe one with bright origami animals, or another with silver geometric shapes.  I let them go round and round, til finally I can sleep.  Then when I wake up, I’ll know something critical about the crime--a piece of the puzzle I missed the day before, a clue I’d overlooked.  I think it’s from focusing on patterns.  That’s what crimes are, really--very violent patterns that a good detective must deconstruct, then rebuild in her head.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; Worst crime scene?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; The mummified remains of six girls on the grounds of the abandoned mental institute in Mattapan.  Never saw anything like it, never want to again.  Funny, that was Bobby Dodge’s first case as a detective (&lt;em&gt;Hide&lt;/em&gt;)--got him a wife, and now a baby girl.  But he never talks about it, and neither do I.  Sometimes, finding justice for the victims isn’t enough, but it’s all we got.  So a good detective walls it up, puts a Do Not Disturb Sign on that section of memory and walks away.  Gotta in this job, or you’ll go mad.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LG:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you wish you knew five years ago?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Can a working woman have it all?  Five years ago, I sweated my job.  I worried I wasn’t working smart enough, closing cases fast enough.  Now, I sweat my entire life.  Am I working too hard?  Missing out on other parts of life?  Maybe I should take Alex up on his offer of homemade alfredo, except can I really be the detective I need to be, while trying to be the girlfriend I’d like to be?  Can’t figure it out.  So I wish that I’d realized five years ago, how good I had it.  That focusing only on my policing career was a luxury I’d never have again.  Spoken like a true workaholic, huh?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  From a master of suspense comes a chilling new novel that explores the dangers lurking closer than you think. Because even in the perfect family, you never know what is going on behind closed doors...&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This is what happened...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was a case guaranteed to spark a media feeding frenzy--a young mother, blond and pretty, disappears without a trace from her South Boston home, leaving behind her four-year-old daughter as the only witness and her handsome, secretive husband as the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;In the last six hours...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But from the moment Detective Sergeant D. D. Warren arrives at the Joneses’ snug little bungalow, she senses something off about the picture of wholesome normality the couple worked so hard to create. On the surface, Jason and Sandra Jones are like any other hardworking young couple raising a four-year-old child. But it is just under the surface that things grew murky.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Of the world as I knew it...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;With the clock ticking on the life of a missing woman and the media firestorm building, Jason Jones seems more intent on destroying evidence and isolating his daughter than on searching for his “beloved” wife. Is the perfect husband trying to hide his guilt--or just trying to hide? And will the only witness to the crime be the killer’s next victim?  &lt;/p&gt;       
  &lt;strong&gt;Amazon Exclusive: Lisa Gardner on the Making of &lt;em&gt;The Neighbor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380738117/3117366.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;         A dozen suspense novels later, it still amazes me how little control I have over the writing process.  I’m a plotter.  That means each time I start a novel, I feel compelled to map out the road ahead.  I’m going to write a very scary book where lots of people die, and this is how I’m gonna do it.  Sounds good.  And yet, each and every time, by page five or so, that plan is blown out of the water.  The plot veers off in a different direction.  A character throws me for a loop.  I don’t know.  You go to write a book and apparently, things happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;My latest release, &lt;em&gt;The Neighbor&lt;/em&gt; is no exception.  I started the book with a simple premise:  I wanted a love interest for one of my favorite characters, hard-nosed Boston detective, D.D. Warren.  How much fun would it be, I wondered, if D.D. fell for a guy suspected of murdering his own wife?  Better yet, I’ll make the guy a father of a four-year-old girl, because surely workaholic Sergeant Warren deserves a sexy, dark-haired man who also knows how to fashion pigtails and make Mickey Mouse pancakes.  Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Of course, I wanted a twisted storyline with lots of shocking turns.  Not a problem.  Most of my novels have been inspired by true crimes, and let’s face it, there are no shortages of husbands currently resolving their marital woes by killing off their wives.  Research cases were numerous and easy to find.  If I now sleep with one eye open, well that’s what happens when you spend six months immersed in the study of spousal homicide.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Next, I needed some other suspects to stir the pot.  What about a registered sex offender living on the same block as the missing woman?  And what if the missing woman happens to also be a beautiful blonde schoolteacher, perhaps a natural favorite with her male students?  See, now we’re having some fun.  Add half a dozen deep dark secrets and we’re off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This also led to more interesting research.  I thought I knew what I needed to know about sex offenders.  As wife and mother, I’ve been very comfortable with the notion of shooting first and questioning later.  I’ve also had zero respect for female schoolteachers who engage in sexual relations with their students.  A sex offender is a sex offender, even the ones who are pretty and female.  Then again, sometimes during the research phase, I learn things that totally change the course of the novel.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I started &lt;em&gt;The Neighbor&lt;/em&gt; with a plan, and quickly ended up with a puzzle.  At a certain point, I was writing the book simply so I could find out what was going to happen next.  Did Jason Jones actually kill his wife?  What was he doing on the computer night after night?  And what about poor four-year old Ree, the last known person to have seen her mother alive?&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;I thought D.D. Warren needed to a love interest.  But maybe, what she really needs is to save a scared little girl, caught in the middle of a deadly game.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;It’s possible there’s a bit more to the story than I’ve mentioned so far.  Some other key characters that appear along the way, some rather unexpected developments.  Because when you go to write a book, apparently, things happen.    &lt;em&gt;--Lisa Gardner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(Photo © John Earle)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Vampire hunter Elena Deveraux knows she is the best- but she does not know if even she is good enough for this job. Hired by the dangerously beautiful archangel Raphael, a being so lethal that no mortal wants his attention, Elena knows failure is not an option—even if the task is impossible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because this time, it's not a wayward vamp she has to track. It's an archangel gone bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The job will put Elena in the midst of a killing spree like no other—and pull her to the razor's edge of passion. Even if the hunt does not destroy her, succumbing to Raphael’s seductive touch just might. For when archangels play, mortals break.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;THE HOT NEW NAME IN PARANORMAL ROMANCE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nalini Singh dives into a world torn apart by a powerful race with phenomenal powers of the mind-and none of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world that denies emotions, where the ruling Psy punish any sign of desire, Sascha Duncan must conceal the feelings that brand her as flawed. To reveal them would be to sentence herself to the horror of "rehabilitation" - the complete psychic erasure of everything she ever was... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both human and animal, Lucas Hunter is a changeling hungry for the very sensations the Psy disdain. After centuries of uneasy coexistence, these two races are now on the verge of war over the brutal murders of several changeling women. Lucas is determined to find the Psy killer who butchered his packmate, and Sascha is his ticket into their closely guarded society. But he soon discovers that this ice-cold Psy is very capable of passion - and that the animal in him is fascinated by her. Caught between their conflicting worlds, Lucas and Sascha must remain bound to their identities - or sacrifice everything for a taste of darkest temptation...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It is a Dark Era, one when a lusty lass will do what she must to survive. Even if it means bartering flesh for a palmful of coins…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to watch her mother burned at the stake and separated from her siblings in the aftermath, Jessie Taskill is similarly gifted, ripe with a powerful magic that must stay hidden. Until one night when she's accused by a rival, and Jessie finds herself behind prison walls with a roguish priest unlike any man of the cloth she has known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In reality, Gregor Ramsay is as far from holy as the devil himself, but his promise of freedom in return for her services may be her salvation. Locked into a dubious agreement, Jessie resents his plan to have her seduce and ruin his lifelong enemy. But toying with Gregor’s lust for her is enjoyable, and she agrees to be his pawn while secretly intending to use him just as he is using her.</description>

      <![CDATA[This was the first time I've read this author and I was pretty entertained by this book. I liked the heroine and her use of magic, and the steamy stuff was not bad, even though some of the language made me giggle sometimes.  It's probably more wordy and detailed than it needs to be for a book like...]]>

  <description>This "New York Times" Notable Book begins on a rainy winter night. It takes hours for a black woman known as "Mad Annie" to die in the gutter.

  <description>Today's crafters are no longer interested in simply cross-stitching samplers or painting floral scrolls on china. Instead,the contemporary craft movement embraces emerging artists, crafters, and designers working in traditional and nontraditional media. Jenny Hart's Sublime Stitching has revolutionized the embroidery industry. Each year Nikki McClure sells thousands of her cut-paper wall calendars. Emily Kircher recycles vintage materials into purses. Stephanie Syjuco manufactures clothing under the tag line "Because Sweatshops Suck." These are just some of the fascinating makers united in the new wave of craft capturing the attention of the nation, the Handmade Nation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faythe Levine traveled 19,000 miles to document what has emerged as a marriage between historical technique, punk culture, and the D.I.Y. ethos. For &lt;em&gt;Handmade Nation&lt;/em&gt; (along with the documentary film of the same name, coming in 2009) she and Cortney Heimerl have selected 24 makers and 5 essayists who work within different media and have different methodologies to provide a microcosm of the crafting community. Participants in this community share ideas and encouragement through websites, blogs, boutiques, galleries, and craft fairs. Together they have forged a new economy and lifestyle based on creativity, determination, and networking. Twenty-four artists from Olympia, Washington, to Providence, Rhode Island, and everywhere in between show their work and discuss their lives. Texts by Andrew Wagner of &lt;em&gt;American Craft Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, Garth Johnson of Extremecraft.com, Callie Janoff of the Church of Craft, Betsy Greer of Craftivism.com, and Susan Beal, author of &lt;em&gt;Super Crafty&lt;/em&gt;, supply a critical view of the tight-knit community where ethics can overlap with creativity and art with community. &lt;em&gt;Handmade Nation&lt;/em&gt; features photographs of the makers, their work environment, their process, their work, and discussions of how they got their start and what motivates them. &lt;em&gt;Handmade Nation&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating book for those who are a part of the emerging movement or just interested in sampling its wares.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;WICKED above her hipbone, GIRL across her heart&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words are like a road map to reporter Camille Preaker’s troubled past. Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, Camille’s first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;NASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her family’s Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;HARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its taut, crafted writing, &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/em&gt; is addictive, haunting, and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>And now a new clue has surfaced...a doll that is the spitting image of Claire Doucett's missing child, right down to the tiny birthmark on the girl's left arm. A chance sighting of the eerily lifelike doll in a French Quarter collectibles shop leaves Claire shaken to her core...and more determined than ever to find out what happened to her beloved Ruby. When the doll is snatched and the store's owner turns up dead, Claire knows the only person she can turn to is ex-husband Dave Creasy, a former cop who has spent the past seven years imprisoned by his own guilt and despair. He let Claire down once when she needed him the most. Can she make him believe the doll really exists? She'll have to if they're to survive an encounter with a brutal psychopath-- the dollmaker--who stole their future to feed an obsession that will never die.</description>

  <description>Seven months ago on a rainy March night, Willow's parents drank too much wine at dinner and asked her to drive them home. But they never made it--Willow lost control of the car, and both of her parents were killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now seventeen, Willow is living with her older brother, who can barely speak to her. She has left behind her old home, friends, and school. But Willow has found a way to survive, to numb the new reality of her life: She is secretly cutting herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then she meets Guy, a boy as sensitive and complicated as she is. When Guy discovers Willow's secret, he pulls her out of the solitary world she's created for herself, and into a difficult, intense, and potentially life-changing relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia Hoban has created an unflinching story about cutting, grieving, and starting anew. But above all, she has written an unforgettable tale of first love.</description>

  <description>Hayley Jo Zimmerman is gone. Taken. And the people of small-town Twisted Tree must come to terms with this terrible event—their loss, their place in it, and the secrets they all carry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this brilliantly written novel, one girl’s story unfolds through the stories of those who knew her. A supermarket clerk recalls an encounter with a disturbingly thin Hayley Jo. Sophie, Twisted Tree’s resident but secretly not-so-altruistic saint, is shaken by a single, passing moment during Hayley Jo’s adolescence. Dark memories paralyze Richard Mattingly as he as he struggles to help his son, Clay, cope with their new loss. An ex-priest remembers baptizing Hayley Jo and seeing her with her best friend, Laura, whose mother the priest once loved. And Laura berates herself for all the running they did, how it fed her friend’s withdrawal, and how there were so many secrets she didn’t see. And so, Hayley Jo’s absence recasts the lives of others and connects them, her death rooting itself into the community in astonishingly violent and tender ways. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twisted Tree&lt;/em&gt; is a tribute to the powerful effect one person's life can have on everyone she knew. Solidly in the company of Aryn Kyle, Kent Haruf, and Peter Matthiessen, Kent Meyers is one of the best contemporary writers on the American West. Here he also takes us into the complexity of community regardless of landscape. Readers will be entranced by&lt;em&gt; Twisted Tree.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Ruth Reichl examines her mother's life, giving voice to the universal unarticulated truth that we are grateful not to be our mothers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Not Becoming My Mother&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Ruth Reichl embarks on a clear-eyed, openhearted investigation of her mother's life, piecing together the journey of a woman she comes to realize she never really knew. Looking to her mother's letters and diaries, Reichl confronts the painful transition her mother made from a hopeful young woman to an increasingly unhappy older one and realizes the tremendous sacrifices she made to make sure her daughter's life would not be as disappointing as her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Growing up in Cleveland, Miriam Brudno dreamed of becoming a doctor, like her father. But when she announced this, her parents said, "You're no beauty, and it's too bad you're such an intellectual. But if you become a doctor, no man will ever marry you." Instead, at twenty, Miriam opened a bookstore, a profession everyone agreed was suitably ladylike. She corresponded with authors all over the world, including philosophers such as Bertrand Russell, political figures such as Max Eastman, and novelists such as Christopher Marlowe. It was the happiest time of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nearly thirty when she finally married, she fulfilled expectations, settled down, left her bookstore behind, and started a family. But conformity came at a tremendous cost. With labor-saving devices to aid in household chores, there was simply not enough to do to fill the days. Miriam-and most of her friends-were smart, educated women who were often bored, miserable, and silently rebellious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On what would have been Miriam's one hundredth birthday Reichl opens up her mother's diaries for the first time and encounters a whole new woman. This is a person she had never known. In this intimate study Reichl comes to understand the lessons of rebellion, independence, and self-acceptance that her mother-though unable to guide herself-succeeded in teaching her daughter.</description>

The book is a nice aside for readers of Reichl's previous (and splendid) memoirs, but this 112 page book (hardcover, 3/4 the size of a regular book, double spaced) will occupy no more than an hour's time. While engaging and relatable, particularly in discussions...]]>

  <description>Growing up in the suburbs of post-war Japan, it seemed to Hajime that everyone but him had brothers and sisters. His sole companion was Shimamoto, also an only child. Together they spent long afternoons listening to her father's record collection. But when his family moved away, the two lost touch. Now Hajime is in his thirties. After a decade of drifting he has found happiness with his loving wife and two daughters, and success running a jazz bar. Then Shimamoto reappears. She is beautiful, intense, enveloped in mystery. Hajime is catapulted into the past, putting at risk all he has in the present.</description>

  <description>The unscrupulous new Council chair has charged Jace, Marc and me with trespassing, kidnapping, murder and treason. Yeah, we've been busy. But now it's time to take justice into our own hands. We must avenge my brother's death and carve out the rot at the heart of the Council.It's not going to be easy, and loss seems unavoidable, but I have promised to protect my Pride, no matter what. With a target on my back and Marc at my side, I'm heading for a final showdown that can--that will--change everything forever. A showdown I'm not sure I'm ready for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life never waits until you're ready.</description>

  <description>I'm on trial for my life. Falsely accused of infecting my human ex-boyfriend--and killing him to cover up the crime. Infecting a human is one of three capital offenses recognized by the Pride--along with murder and disclosure of our existence to a human.I'm two for three. A goner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now we've discovered a rogue stray terrorizing the mountainside, hunting a wild teenage tabbycat. It's up to us to find and stop him before a human discovers us. With my lover Marc's help, I "think" I can protect the vulnerable girl from both the ambitious rogue and the scheming of the territorial council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If" I survive my own trial...</description>

  <description>On the busiest shopping day of the year, a group of idealistic college students believe they're about to carry out an elaborate media stunt at the largest mall in America. They think the equipment in their backpacks will disrupt stores' computer systems, causing delays and chaos, disrupting capitalism, if only for a moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they don't realize is that instead of jamming devices, their backpacks contain explosives. And they're about to become unwitting suicide bombers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FBI profiler Maggie O'Dell must put her own political troubles aside to work with Nick Morrelli and figure out who's behind this terrorist plot--a massacre that's all the more frightening when a tip reveals that Maggie's brother is one of the doomed protesters.</description>

  <description>On Solange’s sixteenth birthday, she is going to wake up dead. As if that’s not bad enough, she also has to outwit her seven overprotective older brothers, avoid the politics involved with being the only daughter born to an ancient vampire dynasty, and elude Kieran Black—agent of an anti-vampire league who is searching for his father’s killer and is intent on staking Solange and her entire family. Luckily she has her own secret weapon—her human best friend Lucy—who is willing to defend Solange’s right to a normal life, whether she’s being smothered by her well-intentioned brothers or abducted by a power-hungry queen. Two unlikely alliances are formed in a race to save Solange’s eternal life—Lucy and Solange’s brother Nicholas, and Solange and Kieran Black—in a dual romance that is guaranteed to jump start any romance-lover’s heart.Even fans of the genre who’ve seen it all will find a fresh read with kick-butt characters and family dynamics that ring true for all brothers and sisters—vampire or otherwise.</description>

  <description>Named for a flower whose blood-red sap possesses the power both to heal and poison, &lt;em&gt;Bloodroot &lt;/em&gt;is a stunning fiction debut about the legacies—of magic and madness, faith and secrets, passion and loss—that haunt one family across the generations, from the Great Depression to today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novel is told in a kaleidoscope of seamlessly woven voices and centers around an incendiary romance that consumes everyone in its path: Myra Lamb, a wild young girl with mysterious, haint blue eyes who grows up on remote Bloodroot Mountain; her grandmother Byrdie Lamb, who protects Myra fiercely and passes down “the touch” that bewitches people and animals alike; the neighbor boy who longs for Myra yet is destined never to have her; the twin children Myra is forced to abandon but who never forget their mother’s deep love; and John Odom, the man who tries to tame Myra and meets with shocking, violent disaster. Against the backdrop of a beautiful but often unforgiving country, these lives come together—only to be torn apart—as a dark, riveting mystery unfolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With grace and unflinching verisimilitude, Amy Greene brings her native Appalachia—and the faith and fury of its people—to rich and vivid life. Here is a spellbinding tour de force that announces a dazzlingly fresh, natural-born storyteller in our midst.</description>

  <description>Suburbia. Shady, tree-lined streets, well-tended lawns and cozy homes. A nice, quiet place to grow up. Unless you are teenage Meg or her crippled sister, Susan. On a dead-end street, in the dark, damp basement of the Chandler house, Meg and Susan are left captive to the savage whims and rages of a distant aunt who is rapidly descending into madness. It is a madness that infects all three of her sons and finally the entire neighborhood. Only one troubled boy stands hesitantly between Meg and Susan and their cruel, torturous deaths. A boy with a very adult decision to make.</description>

  <description>Restless and impulsive, Bruno Ranieri has the temperament to fit right in with the McClouds. And just like the McCloud brothers, Bruno has a dangerous past to contend with - one that's about to come crashing back into his life...Bruno Ranieri has always lived at a chaotic pace, and that goes double lately. Since his uncle's untimely demise, Bruno is working himself to the bone, trying to keep his nose clean and save the family business. Not easy when the nightmares that plagued his childhood are hi-jacking what little rest he gets. So when exotically beautiful Lily Parr sashays into his all-night restaurant, claiming to be on the run from mysterious assassins, Bruno starts to wonder if sleep deprivation is finally getting to him. Especially when Lily implies that Bruno is involved. But the violence that accompanies her arrival is no illusion. Nor is the blisteringly hot, completely inconvenient desire that explodes between them. Lily Parr has been a fugitive ever since her father's death a month ago in a mental hospital. Officials claimed it was suicide, but Lily's gut - and the savage murder attempt she barely escaped afterwards - say different. Snippets of information led Lily to Bruno's door...and his magnetic charisma compelled her right into his bed. But there are cold-blooded killers on her heels, with resources as limitless as their cruelty.</description>

  <description>For Dr. David Beck, the loss was shattering. And every day for the past eight years, he has relived the horror of what happened. The gleaming lake. The pale moonlight. The piercing screams. The night his wife was taken. The last night he saw her alive. &lt;br&gt;Everyone tells him it' s time to move on, to forget the past once and for all. But for David Beck, there can be no closure. A message has appeared on his computer, a phrase only he and his dead wife know. Suddenly Beck is taunted with the impossible- that somewhere, somehow, Elizabeth is alive. &lt;br&gt;Beck has been warned to tell no one. And he doesn' t. Instead, he runs from the people he trusts the most, plunging headlong into a search for the shadowy figure whose messages hold out a desperate hope. &lt;br&gt;But already Beck is being hunted down. He' s headed straight into the heart of a dark and deadly secret- and someone intends to stop him before he gets there.</description>

  <description>When Mitchell McDeere qualified third in his class at Harvard, offers poured in from every law firm in America. The firm he chose was small, but-well respected. They were prepared to match, and then exceed Mitch's wildest dreams: eighty thousand a year, a BMW and a low-interest mortgage. Now the house, the car and the job are his. Then the nightmares begin: the secret files, the bugs in the new bedroom, the mysterious deaths of colleagues, and the millions of dollars of mob money pouring through the office into the Cayman Islands, dollars that the FBI would do anything to trace. Now Mitch is in the place where dreams end and nightmares begin...</description>

  <description>Two sisters—as different as the sun and the rain. For one, getting into the Blood Coven is to die for. But for the other, getting out could be lethal...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sunny McDonald gets dragged to Club Fang by her twin sister Rayne, she doesn't expect to find anything besides a bunch of Goth kids playing at being vampires. But when some guy mistakes Sunny for her dark-side-loving sister and bites her on the neck, she finds out that his fangs are real—and deadly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Sunny has less than a week to figure out how to reverse the bite, or else she's going to end up as the perpetually undead. And not only will she be a vampire, she'll also be bonded to Magnus—the bloodsucker who bit her—forever. And forever is a really long time...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Some days, a girl just can't catch a break...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Georgina Kincaid, a shape-shifting succubus who gets her energy from seducing men, can't have sex with her gorgeous bestselling author boyfriend Seth Mortensen--in case she inadvertently kills him. Second, Georgina's under demonic orders to mentor the new (and surprisingly inept) succubus on the block. Third, someone's manipulating her dreams, draining her energy and supplying eerie visions of her future. Georgina seeks answers from Dante, a dream interpreter with ties to the underworld, but his flirtatious charm only leaves her more confused--especially as the situation with Seth reaches a crisis point. Georgina needs to rein in her out-of-control love life and go toe-to-toe with an enemy capable of wreaking serious havoc among mankind. Otherwise, Georgina, and the entire mortal world, may never sleep easy again...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Introducing an exciting new series! Steeped in Victorian atmosphere and intrigue, this diverting mystery trails a feisty heroine as she takes on a precarious secret assignment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rescued from the gallows in 1850s London, young orphan (and thief) Mary Quinn is surprised to be offered a singular education, instruction in fine manners — and an unusual vocation. Miss Scrimshaw’s Academy for Girls is a cover for an all-female investigative unit called The Agency, and at seventeen, Mary is about to put her training to the test. Assuming the guise of a lady’s companion, she must infiltrate a rich merchant’s home in hopes of tracing his missing cargo ships. But the household is full of dangerous deceptions, and there is no one to trust — or is there? Packed with action and suspense, banter and romance, and evoking the gritty backstreets of Victorian London, this breezy mystery debuts a daring young detective who lives by her wits while uncovering secrets — including those of her own past.</description>

      <![CDATA[I really, really wanted to like this book. I'm a fan of novels set during the Victorian era, as I've always been very interested in how thinking, reasoning people-especially women--manage to survive in such a repressive society. It's the same reason I like Jane Austen novels, because the yearning...]]>

  <description>It starts off simply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Draw a circle... place a dead leaf in the center... sprinkle some salt... recite a little Latin... add a drop of blood...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe that last part isn’t exactly simple. Yet somehow it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; right to Silla Kennicott. And nothing in her life has felt remotely right since her parents’ horrific deaths. She’s willing to do anything to uncover the truth about her family—even try a few spells from the mysterious book that arrived on her doorstep ... and spill some blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book isn’t the only recent arrival in Silla’s life. There’s Nick Pardee, the new guy next door who may have seen Silla casting a spell. She’s not sure what he saw and is afraid to find out. But as they spend more time together, Silla realizes this may not be Nick’s first encounter with Blood Magic. Brought together by a combination of fate and chemistry, Silla and Nick can’t deny their attraction. And they can’t ignore the dark presence lurking nearby—waiting to reclaim the book and all its power.</description>

  <description>It happens at the start of every November: the Scorpio Races. Riders attempt to keep hold of their water horses long enough to make it to the finish line. Some riders live. Others die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At age nineteen, Sean Kendrick is the returning champion. He is a young man of few words, and if he has any fears, he keeps them buried deep, where no one else can see them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puck Connolly is different. She never meant to ride in the Scorpio Races. But fate hasn’t given her much of a chance. So she enters the competition — the first girl ever to do so. She is in no way prepared for what is going to happen.</description>

  <description>For as long as Esmerine can remember, she has longed to join her older sister, Dosinia, as a siren--the highest calling a mermaid can have. When Dosinia runs away to the mainland, Esmerine is sent to retrieve her. Using magic to transform her tail into legs, she makes her way unsteadily to the capital city. There she comes upon a friend she hasn't seen since childhood--a dashing young man named Alander, who belongs to a winged race of people. As Esmerine and Alander band together to search for Dosinia, they rekindle a friendship . . . and ignite the emotions for a love so great, it cannot be bound by sea, land, or air.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;What if your worst enemy turned out to be the best friend you ever had?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Brooke: Popular, powerful and hating every minute of it, she’s the “It” girl at Douglas High in Lake Champion, Minnesota. Her real ambition? Using her operatic mezzo as a ticket back to NYC, where her family lived before her dad ran off with an up and coming male movie star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now meet Kathryn: An overachieving soprano with an underachieving savings account, she’s been a leper ever since Brooke punched her at a party junior year. For Kath, music is the key to a much-needed college scholarship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stage is set for a high-stakes duet between the two seniors as they prepare for the prestigious Blackmore competition. Brooke and Kathryn work toward the Blackmore with eyes not just on first prize but on one another, each still stinging from a past that started with friendship and ended in betrayal. With competition day nearing, Brooke dreams of escaping the in-crowd for life as a professional singer, but her scheming BFF Chloe has other plans. And when Kathryn gets an unlikely invitation to Homecoming, she suspects Brooke of trying to sabotage her with one last public humiliation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As pressures mount, Brooke starts to sense that the person she hates most might just be the best friend she ever had. But Kathryn has a decision to make. Can she forgive? Or are some rivalries for life?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>2.5 stars</strong> I liked the first half of this book quite a lot. Kathryn and Brooke used to be best friends until something drove them apart--but what was it?

  <description>In seventeenth-century Scotland, saying the wrong thing can lead to banishment—or worse. Accused of being a witch, sixteen-year-old Maggie Blair is sentenced to be hanged. She escapes, but instead of finding shelter with her principled, patriotic uncle, she brings disaster to his door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Betrayed by one of her own accusers, Maggie must try to save her uncle and his family from the king’s men, even if she has to risk her own life in the process. Originally published in the UK, this book has a powerful blend of heart-stopping action and thought-provoking themes.</description>

      <![CDATA[Firstly: although Maggie Blair is accused of being a witch, readers should know that this is a work of historical fiction and it has no supernatural elements whatsoever. The book's description and cover art could probably use a bit of adjusting to make the focus of the book a little more apparent...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;As he continued to stare, I wanted to point to my cheek and remind him, But you were the one who wanted this, remember? You're the one who asked-and I repeat-&lt;/em&gt;Why not fix your face? &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's hard not to notice Terra Cooper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She's tall, blond, and has an enviable body. But with one turn of her cheek, all people notice is her unmistakably "flawed" face. Terra secretly plans to leave her stifling small town in the Northwest and escape to an East Coast college, but gets pushed off-course by her controlling father. When an unexpected collision puts Terra directly in Jacob's path, the handsome but quirky Goth boy immediately challenges her assumptions about herself and her life, and she is forced in yet another direction. With her carefully laid plans disrupted, will Terra be able to find her true path?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in lively, artful prose, award-winning author Justina Chen Headley has woven together a powerful novel about a fractured family, falling in love, travel, and the meaning of true beauty.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I know your secret...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stacey's junior year at boarding school isn't easy. She's not the most popular girl at school, or the smartest, or the prettiest. She's got a crush on her best friend's boyfriend, and an even darker secret that threatens to ruin her friendships for good. And now she's having nightmares again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not just any nightmares – these dreams are too real to ignore, like she did three years ago. The last time she ignored them, a little girl died. This time they're about Drea, her best friend who's become the target of one seriously psycho stalker. It started with weird e-mails and freaky phone calls. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now someone's leaving Drea white lilies – the same death lilies that have been showing up in Stacey's dreams. Everybody thinks it's just a twisted game . . . until another girl at school is brutally murdered. There are no witnesses. Worst of all, no one has a perfect alibi. With everyone as a potential suspect, Stacey turns to the one secret weapon she can trust – the folk magic taught to her by her grandmother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Stacey's magic be strong enough to expose the true killer, or will the killer make her darkest nightmares come true?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this Deluxe Spellbook Edition you'll find:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spells created by You and other keepers of secrets-poems, spells and meditations contributed by fans of this popular series. Extras also include an interview with the author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Included in Amazon.com's "Best Books of the Month for Young Readers: January 2011."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; Other Words for Love “honestly confronts the pain associated with coming of age and first heartbreak. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; ”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;~Publishers Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the mid-1980s, and Ari Mitchell feels invisible at her Brooklyn high school. Her hair is too flat, her style too preppy, and her personality too quiet. And outside school, Ari feels outshined by her beautiful, confident best friend, Summer. Their friendship is as complex and confusing as Ari’s relationship with her troubled older sister, Evelyn, a former teenage mom whose handsome firefighter husband fills Ari’s head with guilty fantasies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an unexpected inheritance enables Ari to transfer to an elite Manhattan prep school, she makes a wealthy new friend, Leigh. Leigh introduces Ari to the glamorous side of New York—and to her gorgeous cousin, Blake. Ari doesn't think she stands a chance, but amazingly, Blake asks her out. As their romance heats up, they find themselves involved in an intense, consuming relationship. Ari's family worries that she is losing touch with the important things in life, like family, hard work, and planning for the future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When misfortune befalls Blake's family, he pulls away, and Ari's world drains of color. As she struggles to get over the breakup, Ari must finally ask herself: were their feelings true love . . . or something else?</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoy a great romance novel now and again, and I like it when there are relationships in most of the YA books that I read. But the key word for me is <em>romance</em>, not just hormones and sex. I felt like Ari, who is too good to be true in many aspects, was a little too fixated on boys in this book be...]]>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Nick and his brother, Alan, are always ready to run. Their father is dead, and their mother is crazy—she screams if Nick gets near her. She’s no help in protecting any of them from the deadly magicians who use demons to work their magic. The magicians want a charm that Nick’s mother stole—and they want it badly enough to kill. Alan is Nick’s partner in demon slaying and the only person he trusts in the world. So things get very scary and very complicated when Nick begins to suspect that everything Alan has told him about their father, their mother, their past, and what they are doing is a complete lie. . . .</description>

Fierce and independent, she travels from city to city with her mother's rock band until an ominous attack forces Kaye back to her childhood home. There, amid the industrial, blue-collar New Jersey backdrop, Kaye soon finds herself an unwilling pawn in an ancient power struggle between two rival faerie kingdoms - a struggle that could very well mean her death.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Unbeknownst to mortals&lt;/em&gt;, a power struggle is unfolding in a world of shadows and danger. After centuries of stability, the balance among the Faery Courts has altered, and Irial, ruler of the Dark Court, is battling to hold his rebellious and newly vulnerable fey together. If he fails, bloodshed and brutality will follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Leslie knows nothing of faeries or their intrigues. When she is attracted to an eerily beautiful tattoo of eyes and wings, all she knows is that she has to have it, convinced it is a tangible symbol of changes she desperately craves for her own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tattoo &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; bring changes - not the kind Leslie has dreamed of, but sinister, compelling changes that are more than symbolic. Those changes will bind Leslie and Irial together, drawing Leslie deeper and deeper into the faery world, unable to resist its allures, and helpless to withstand its perils....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melissa Marr continues her tales of Faerie in a dark, ravishing story of temptation and consequences, and of heroism when least expected.</description>

  <description>Seth never expected he would want to settle down with anyone - but that was before Aislinn. She is everything he'd ever dreamed of, and he wants to be with her forever. Forever takes on new meaning, though, when your girlfriend is an immortal faery queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislinn never expected to rule the very creatures who'd always terrified her - but that was before Keenan. He stole her mortality to make her a monarch, and now she faces challenges and enticements beyond any she'd ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Melissa Marr's third mesmerizing tale of Faerie, Seth and Aislinn struggle to stay true to themselves and each other in a milieu of shadowy rules and shifting allegiances, where old friends become new enemies and one wrong move could plunge the Earth into chaos.</description>

  <description>Hunger for nourishment.Hunger for touch.Hunger to belong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half-human and half-faery, Ani is driven by her hungers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those same appetites also attract powerful enemies and uncertain allies, including Devlin. He was created as an assassin and is brother to the faeries' coolly logical High Queen and to her chaotic twin, the embodiment of War. Devlin wants to keep Ani safe from his sisters, knowing that if he fails, he will be the instrument of Ani's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ani isn't one to be guarded while others fight battles for her, though. She has the courage to protect herself and the ability to alter Devlin's plans--and his life. The two are drawn together, each with reason to fear the other and to fear for one another. But as they grow closer, a larger threat imperils the whole of Faerie. Will saving the faery realm mean losing each other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alluring romance, heart-stopping danger, and sinister intrigue combine in the penultimate volume of Melissa Marr's New York Times bestselling Wicked Lovely series.</description>

  <description>In the City of Lights, two star-crossed lovers battle a fate that is destined to tear them apart again and again for eternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kate Mercier's parents die in a tragic car accident, she leaves her life--and memories--behind to live with her grandparents in Paris. For Kate, the only way to survive her pain is escaping into the world of books and Parisian art. Until she meets Vincent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious, charming, and devastatingly handsome, Vincent threatens to melt the ice around Kate's guarded heart with just his smile. As she begins to fall in love with Vincent, Kate discovers that he's a revenant--an undead being whose fate forces him to sacrifice himself over and over again to save the lives of others. Vincent and those like him are bound in a centuries-old war against a group of evil revenants who exist only to murder and betray. Kate soon realizes that if she follows her heart, she may never be safe again.</description>

  <description>"I mark this day most especially with a White Stone."&lt;br&gt;---Lewis Carroll, &lt;em&gt;The Diaries of Lewis Carroll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edmund Whitty, a London newspaper correspondent who can usually be counted upon for crisp and lurid copy, has fallen upon lean times. After his triumphant exposé of a notorious serial killer, he has inexplicably lost his knack for sensational reporting. Broke and desperate, he seizes upon a generous offer from a mysterious American to discredit a quack psychic. But how, he ends up wondering uneasily, does the psychic know so much about a scandal involving Whitty's late brother?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the psychic is brutally murdered, Whitty finds himself accused of the crime and thrown into Milbank prison, the most bizarre institution of its kind in England. Help comes unexpectedly from "the Captain," a gangster not known for charity work. To save his own skin, Whitty must find the men responsible for the disappearance of the Captain's young niece, Eliza.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whitty's search takes him to Oxford, where he meets the brilliant and eccentric Reverend William Boltbyn, a renowned children's author who delights in playing croquet, devising elaborate stories, and taking artistic photographs of little girls. There he uncovers a looking-glass world, the dark side of Victoriana, and the murder of innocence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John MacLachlan Gray, who evoked "the mean streets and byways of 1852 London with a skill worthy of Dickens" (&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;) in &lt;em&gt;The Fiend in Human,&lt;/em&gt; spins an even more irresistible tale of dark secrets behind the facade of Victorian respectability.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The spell was simple...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruentus Protectum&lt;/em&gt; (Defend the Blood)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what do you do if your blood is your enemy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victoria Warrick has always known she was different. An outcast at school, she is no stranger to adversity. But when she receives an old journal for her seventeenth birthday, nothing prepares her for the dark secrets it holds -- much less one that reveals she's a witch with unimaginable power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's more, when she meets the dazzling but enigmatic Christian Devereux, she has no idea how much her life is about to change. Enemies will hunt her. Friends will turn on her. The terrible curse that makes her blood run black will stop at nothing to control her. And Christian has a sinister secret of his own...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without knowing whom to trust, can Victoria survive her blood's deadly desires? Or will she lose everything, including herself?</description>

  <description>Like the thrillers of Thomas Harris and Philip Kerr, Mo Hayder's riveting new novel animates the dark corners of modern history. The solitary Englishwoman Grey comes to Japan looking for a rare piece of footage that is said to document a particularly monstrous episode of the 1937 Nanking Massacre. Her quest will take her to a reclusive scholar and a wheelchair-bound gangster who clings to life with the aid of a mysterious elixir, and to a handsome American whose interest in Grey may be more sinister than romantic. The result is a work of spine-chilling suspense, masterful historical detail, and otherworldly beauty.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Cassel comes from a family of Curse Workers - people who have the power to change your emotions, your memories, your luck, by the slightest touch of their hands. And since curse work is illegal, they're all criminals. Many become mobsters and con artists. But not Cassel. He hasn't got magic, so he's an outsider, the straight kid in a crooked family. You just have to ignore one small detail - he killed his best friend, Lila, three years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassel has carefully built up a facade of normalcy, blending into the crowd. But his facade starts to crumble when he finds himself sleepwalking, propelled into the night by terrifying dreams about a white cat that wants to tell him something. He's noticing other disturbing things too, including the strange behavior of his two brothers. They are keeping secrets from him. As Cassel begins to suspect he's part of a huge con game, he must unravel his past and his memories. To find out the truth, Cassel will have to out-con the conmen.</description>

  <description>Nothing has been the same since Caleb Becker left a party drunk, got behind the wheel, and hit Maggie Armstrong. Even after months of painful physical therapy, Maggie walks with a limp. Her social life is nil and a scholarship to study abroad—her chance to escape everyone and their pitying stares—has been canceled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a year in juvenile jail, Caleb’s free . . . if freedom means endless nagging from a transition coach and the prying eyes of the entire town. Coming home should feel good, but his family and ex-girlfriend seem like strangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caleb and Maggie are outsiders, pigeon-holed as "criminal" and "freak." Then the truth emerges about what really happened the night of the accident and, once again, everything changes. It’s a bleak and tortuous journey for Caleb and Maggie, yet they end up finding comfort and strength from a surprising source: each other.</description>

  <description>Are you predator or prey? &lt;br&gt;CLASSIFIED ADS: RESTAURANTS&lt;br&gt;SANGUINI'S: A VERY RARE RESTAURANT IS HIRING A CHEF DE CUISINE. DINNERS ONLY.&lt;br&gt;APPLY IN PERSON BETWEEN 2:00 AND 4:00 PM. &lt;br&gt;Quincie Morris has never felt more alone. Her parents are dead, and her hybrid-werewolf first love is threatening to embark on a rite of passage that will separate them forever. Then, as she and her uncle are about to unveil their hot vampire-themed restaurant, a brutal murder leaves them scrambling for a chef. Can Quincie transform their new hire into a culinary Dark Lord before opening night? Can he wow the crowd in his fake fangs, cheap cape, and red contact lenses -- or is there more to this earnest face than meets the eye? As human and preternatural forces clash, a deadly love triangle forms, and the line between predator and prey begins to blur. Who's playing whom? And how long can Quincie play along before she loses everything? TANTALIZE marks Cynthia Leitich Smith's delicious debut as a preeminent author of dark fantasy.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Can imaginative Emily make her biggest dream come true&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?Spunky Emily Bartlett lives in an old farmhouse in Pitchfork, Oregon'at a time when automobiles are brand-new inventions and libraries are a luxury few small towns can afford. Her runaway imagination leads her to bleach a horse, hold a very scary sleepover, and feed the hogs an unusual treat. But can she use her lively mind to help bring a library to Pitchfork?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adventure is pretty scarce in Pitchfork, Oregon. So why shouldn't Emily bleach Dad's old plow horse or try some of her other ideas?

  <description>At a time when society conforms to the strictest rules and most proper etiquette, sixteen-year-old Camille Kennecott and her guardian, Dr. Bennett, live a most unconventional life. They hunt werewolves.When unwitting victim, Nathaniel Strider, wanders into one of their full moon pursuits, Camille and Dr. Bennett believe they have found a specimen for their study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding a scientific key to unlocking the mystery of lycanthropy would end their late night excursions. Yet beneath the irresistible exterior, Nathaniel is transforming into a flesh-tearing monster, and as each experiment fails, Camille loses another inch of her soul to him. In a month’s time, she must face the prospect of destroying the boy who has stolen her heart.</description>

  <description>To be normal, sixteen-year-old Julia Parker would shed her empathic gift in a second. Life has been difficult since her mother's mysterious disappearance ten years earlier - an event she witnessed, but can't remember. Julia's situation becomes more complicated after a near death experience from a blood thirsty stalker. As high school students go missing it is clear there is a connection to her own experience--past and present. Someone has to stop the madness and a chance encounter with a creepy psychic foretells that only Julia is the key to stopping the madness, but it may require the life of the one she loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created 'perfect' life is about to unravel before her eyes. She's forced to be lab partners with Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the other side of town, and he is about to threaten everything she's worked so hard for: her flawless reputation, her relationship with her boyfriend, and the secret that her home life is anything but perfect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex is a bad boy and he knows it. So when he makes a bet with his friends to lure Brittany into his life, he thinks nothing of it. But soon Alex realizes Brittany is a real person with real problems, and suddenly the bet he made in arrogance turns into something much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a passionate story about looking beneath the surface, Simone Elkeles breaks through the stereotypes and barriers that threaten to keep Brittany and Alex apart.</description>

  <description>Encyclopedia of the Exquisite is a lifestyle guide for the Francophile and the Anglomaniac, the gourmet and the style maven, the armchair traveler and the art lover. It’s an homage to the esoteric world of glamour that doesn’t require much spending but makes us feel rich.&lt;br&gt;Taking a cue from the exotic encyclopedias of the sixteenth century, which brimmed with mysterious artifacts, Jessica Kerwin Jenkins’s Encyclopedia of the Exquisite focuses on the elegant, the rare, the commonplace, and the delightful. A com­pendium of style, it merges whimsy and practicality, traipsing through the fine arts and the worlds of fashion, food, travel, home, garden, and beauty.&lt;br&gt;Each entry features several engaging anecdotes, illuminating the curious past of each enduring source of beauty. Subjects covered include the explosive history of champagne; the art of lounging on a divan; the emergence of “frillies,” the first lacy, racy lingerie; the ancient uses of sweet-smelling saffron; the wild riot incited by the appearance of London’s first top hat; Julia Child’s tip for cooking the perfect omelet; the polarizing practice of wearing red lipstick during World War II; Louis XIV’s fondness for the luscious Bartlett pear; the Indian origin of badminton; Parliament’s 1650 attempt to suppress Europe’s beauty mark fad; the evolution of the Japanese kimono; the pil­grimage of Central Park’s Egyptian obelisk; and the fanciful thrill of dining alfresco.&lt;br&gt;Cleverly illustrated, Encyclopedia of the Exquisite is an ode to life’s plenty, from the extravagant to the eccentric. It is a cele­bration of luxury that doesn’t necessarily require money.</description>

  <description>An Otto Penzler Book &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Walking a lonely forested valley on a spring morning in upstate New York, having been hired by a developer to dowse the land, Cassandra Brooks comes upon the shocking vision of a young girl hanged from a tree. When she returns with authorities to the site, the body has vanished, leaving in question Cassandra’s credibility if not her sanity. The next day, on a return visit with the sheriff to have another look, a dazed, mute missing girl emerges from the woods, alive and the very picture of Cassandra’s hanged girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is the narrative of ever-deepening and increasingly bizarre divinations that will lead this gifted young woman, the struggling single mother of twin boys, hurtling toward a past she’d long since thought was behind her. The Diviner’s Tale is at once a journey of self-discovery and an unorthodox murder mystery, a tale of the fantastic and a family chronicle told by an otherwise ordinary woman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Cassandra’s dark forebodings take on tangible form, she is forced to confront a life spiraling out of control. And soon she is locked in a mortal chess match with a real-life killer who has haunted her since before she can remember.</description>

  <description>Madeleine and Rogan are first cousins, best friends, twinned souls, each other’s first love. Even within their large, disorderly family—all descendants of a famous actress—their intensity and passion for theater sets them apart. It makes them a little dangerous. When they are cast in their school’s production of Twelfth Night, they are forced to face their separate talents and futures, and their future together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This stunning short novel, winner of the World Fantasy Award, is the perfect introduction to Elizabeth Hand’s singular voice. Her many novels offer a window into what it means to create art, to experience it, to feel passionately about the world. &lt;em&gt;Illyria&lt;/em&gt; throws her talent into high relief—it is magic on paper.</description>

      <![CDATA[Well. A lot of reviews are describing this book as "gorgeous," and while I concede that it is well-written, I wasn't swept up enough in the writing that I was transported by this very slight, strange book. Both style and subject are odd for YA literature, and regardless of where it's shelved, I h...]]>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Demon Trapper's Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is the first novel in Jana Oliver's Demon Trappers—a spellbinding young adult fantasy series. Riley Blackthorne just needs a chance to prove herself—and that's exactly what the demons are counting on…&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Riley, the only daughter of legendary Demon Trapper Paul Blackthorne, has always dreamed of following in her father's footsteps. The good news is, with human society seriously disrupted by economic upheaval and Lucifer increasing the number of demons in all major cities, Atlanta's local Trappers' Guild needs all the help they can get—even from a girl. When she's not keeping up with her homework or trying to manage her growing crush on fellow apprentice, Simon, Riley's out saving distressed citizens from foul-mouthed little devils—Grade One Hellspawn only, of course, per the strict rules of the Guild. Life's about as normal as can be for the average demon-trapping teen.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;But then a Grade Five Geo-Fiend crashes Riley's routine assignment at a library, jeopardizing her life and her chosen livelihood.  And, as if that wasn't bad enough, sudden tragedy strikes the Trappers' Guild, spinning Riley down a more dangerous path than she ever could have imagined. As her whole world crashes down around her, who can Riley trust with her heart—and her life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Caspia Chastain, art student and barista, is gifted (or plagued, if you ask her) with the ability to draw the future, usually at the worst possible times. Her parents are four years dead; everyday she watches her brother Logan fight his cancer diagnosis. Things get worse for Caspia the day she draws an angry stranger framed by planes of light and violent, bloody images. That exact same stranger walks up to her out of nowhere mere hours later knowing things he shouldn't, like her name, her brother's illness, and her strange ability. That's when Caspia discovers her hometown is a refuge for supernatural beings both Light and Dark, and she and her brother find themselves caught up in a war between the two that predates their very birth. In order to protect herself and her brother, she turns to the one who seems to have started it all: the man who walked out of her sketchbook calling himself Ethan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Ethan has his own agenda, Logan's getting sicker fast, and Caspia finds that drawing the future isn't the only strange thing she can do. Meanwhile, someone really wants all of them dead. In a town where Dark doesn't equal Evil and Light isn't always Good, Caspia and Ethan find themselves making strange alliances and even stranger sacrifices in order to protect those they love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;First there are nightmares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every night Ellie is haunted by terrifying dreams of monstrous creatures that are hunting her, killing her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then come the memories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ellie meets Will, she feels on the verge of remembering something just beyond her grasp.  His attention is intense and romantic, and Ellie feels like her soul has known him for centuries.  On her seventeenth birthday, on a dark street at midnight, Will awakens Ellie's power, and she knows that she can fight the creatures that stalk her in the grim darkness.  Only Will holds the key to Ellie's memories, whole lifetimes of them, and when she looks at him, she can no longer pretend anything was just a dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now she must hunt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellie has power that no one can match, and her role is to hunt and kill the reapers that prey on human souls.  But in order to survive the dangerous and ancient battle of the angels and the Fallen, she must also hunt for the secrets of her past lives and truths that may be too frightening to remember.</description>

      <![CDATA[Aside from occasionally amusing asides (Ell names her white car "Marshmallow"), this book is all over the place. The plot is both simplistic and confused, none of the characters are unique or compelling, and there is a disturbing laxness in parenting (not her father, who's supposed to be unlikeab...]]>

  <description>Destiny awaits Bianca and Lucas . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca and Lucas have always believed they could endure anything to be together. When a twist of fate not only transforms Bianca into a wraith but also turns Lucas into a vampire--the very creature he spent his life hunting--they are left reeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by his powerful need to kill, Lucas can turn to only one place for help . . . Evernight Academy. Bianca is determined to remain with him. But with the vampire leader of Evernight waging a war against wraiths, her former home has become the most dangerous place she could be, despite the new powers her ghostly transformation has given her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A battle between wraiths and vampires looms, and Bianca and Lucas face a terrifying new reality. They've overcome every obstacle life has thrown at them, but is their love strong enough to survive the challenges after life?</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Tithe&lt;/em&gt;, sixteen-year-old Kaye is a modern nomad. Fierce and independent, she drifts from place to place with her mother’s rock band until an ominous attack forces Kaye back to her childhood home. There, amid the blue-collar New Jersey backdrop, Kaye finds herself an unwilling pawn in an ancient and violent power struggle between two rival faerie kingdoms—a struggle that could very well mean her death. &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Valiant&lt;/em&gt;, the companion to &lt;em&gt;Tithe&lt;/em&gt;, seventeen-year-old Valerie runs away to New York City, trying to escape a life that has utterly betrayed her. Sporting a new identity, she takes up with a gang of squatters who live in the city’s labyrinthine subway system. But there’s something eerily beguiling about Val’s new friends. When one talks Val into tracking down the lair of a mysterious creature, Val finds herself torn between her affection for an honorable monster and her fear of what her new friends are becoming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Ironside&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Tithe&lt;/em&gt;, the time has come for Roiben’s coronation. Uneasy in the midst of the malevolent Unseelie Court, pixie Kaye is sure of only one thing—her love for Roiben. But when Kaye drunkenly declares herself to Roiben, he sends her on a seemingly impossible quest to find a faerie who can tell a lie. Unable to see Roiben until she has fulfilled his quest, Kaye finds herself in the center of the battle of wits and weapons being waged over his throne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This omnibus combines all three books into one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>I had a life anyone would kill for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then someone did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part of being dead is that there's nothing left to live for. No more kisses. No more secrets. No more gossip. It's enough to kill a girl all over again. But I'm about to get something no one else does--an encore performance, thanks to Emma, the long-lost twin sister I never even got to meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Emma's desperate to know what happened to me. And the only way to figure it out is to be me--to slip into my old life and piece it all together. But can she laugh at inside jokes with my best friends? Convince my boyfriend she's the girl he fell in love with? Pretend to be a happy, care-free daughter when she hugs my parents goodnight? And can she keep up the charade, even after she realizes my murderer is watching her every move?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Sara Shepard, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Pretty Little Liars books, comes a riveting new series about secrets, lies, and killer consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the lying game begin.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Send the messengers for the Faery Courts. This is the end.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Summer King is missing; the Dark Court is bleeding; and a stranger walks the streets of Huntsdale, his presence signifying the deaths of powerful fey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislinn tends to the Summer Court, searching for her absent king and yearning for Seth. Torn between his new queen and his old love, Keenan works from afar to strengthen his court against the coming war. Donia longs for fiery passion even as she coolly readies the Winter Court for battle. And Seth, sworn brother of the Dark King and heir to the High Queen, is about to make a mistake that could cost his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love, despair, and betrayal ignite the Faery Courts, and in the final conflict, some will win...and some will lose &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thrilling conclusion to Melissa Marr's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Wicked Lovely series will leave readers breathless.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The apprenticeship is over—now the real test has begun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When word that Yelena is a Soulfinder—able to capture and release souls—spreads like wildfire, people grow uneasy. Already Yelena's unusual abilities and past have set her apart. As the Council debates Yelena's fate, she receives a disturbing message: a plot is rising against her homeland, led by a murderous sorcerer she has defeated before....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honor sets Yelena on a path that will test the limits of her skills, and the hope of reuniting with her beloved spurs her onward. Her journey is fraught with allies, enemies, lovers and would-be assassins, each of questionable loyalty. Yelena will have but one chance to prove herself—and save the land she holds dear.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;YOU KNOW YOUR LIFE IS BAD WHEN YOU MISS YOUR DAYS AS A POISON TASTER...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her greatest enemy dead, and on her way to be reunited with the family she'd been stolen from long ago, Yelena should be pleased.  But though she has gained her freedom, she can't help feeling isolated in Sitia.  Her Ixian background has changed her in many ways—and her newfound friends and relatives don't think it's for the better....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the turmoil, she's eager to start her magic training—especially as she's been given one year to harness her power or be put to death.  But her plans take a radical turn when she becomes involved with a plot to reclaim Ixia's throne for a lost prince—and gets entangled in powerful rivalries with her fellow magicians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that wasn't bad enough, it appears her brother would love to see her dead.  Luckily, Yelena has some old friends to help her with all her new enemies....</description>

  <description>For Zack Thomson, life in the Nicholls Ward wasn't so bad. After his parents died, he developed strange allergies, and the mental institution was the only place where he could be properly looked after. As strange as it was, it was home. But that all changes the night a stranger on a Harley crashes through the front doors and tells him to &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;. Along with his best friend Charlie and a girl he may or may not be falling in love with, Zack does just that: &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;. Under the cover of night, hiding amongst the shadows, he races for the truth.</description>

  <description>Mackie Doyle is not one of us. Though he lives in the small town of Gentry, he comes from a world of tunnels and black murky water, a world of living dead girls ruled by a little tattooed princess. He is a Replacement, left in the crib of a human baby sixteen years ago. Now, because of fatal allergies to iron, blood, and consecrated ground, Mackie is fighting to survive in the human world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mackie would give anything to live among us, to practice on his bass or spend time with his crush, Tate. But when Tate's baby sister goes missing, Mackie is drawn irrevocably into the underworld of Gentry, known as Mayhem. He must face the dark creatures of the Slag Heaps and find his rightful place, in our world, or theirs.</description>

  <description>Kate Folan comes from a family of werewolves. She'll only become fully 'wolf herself when she mates with a male werewolf. But she vows that will never happen. The last thing she wants is to give in to her evil heritage.&lt;br&gt; Then she meets Tom Anderson. Tom is a wereling-a werewolf who retains his humanity even in his wolf form. He was "turned" by Kate's mother, who chose wisely.&lt;br&gt; Tom and Kate can't help falling for each other. But if they give in to their feelings, Kate will become the thing she hates most. Unless they can find a cure. . . .</description>

  <description>Incarceron -- a futuristic prison, sealed from view, where the descendants of the original prisoners live in a dark world torn by rivalry and savagery. It is a terrifying mix of high technology -- a living building which pervades the novel as an ever-watchful, ever-vengeful character, and a typical medieval torture chamber -- chains, great halls, dungeons. A young prisoner, Finn, has haunting visions of an earlier life, and cannot believe he was born here and has always been here. In the outer world, Claudia, daughter of the Warden of Incarceron, is trapped in her own form of prison -- a futuristic world constructed beautifully to look like a past era, an imminent marriage she dreads. She knows nothing of Incarceron, except that it exists. But there comes a moment when Finn, inside Incarceron, and Claudia, outside, simultaneously find a device -- a crystal key, through which they can talk to each other. And so the plan for Finn's escape is born ...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meghan Chase has a secret destiny; one she could never have imagined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something has always felt slightly off in Meghan's life, ever since her father disappeared before her eyes when she was six. She has never quite fit in at school or at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a dark stranger begins watching her from afar, and her prankster best friend becomes strangely protective of her, Meghan senses that everything she's known is about to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she could never have guessed the truth - that she is the daughter of a mythical faery king and is a pawn in a deadly war. Now Meghan will learn just how far she'll go to save someone she cares about, to stop a mysterious evil, no faery creature dare face; and to find love with a young prince who might rather see her dead than let her touch his icy heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The dramatic story of the real-life murder that inspired the birth of modern detective fiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June of 1860 three-year-old Saville Kent was found at the bottom of an outdoor privy with his throat slit. The crime horrified all England and led to a national obsession with detection, ironically destroying, in the process, the career of perhaps the greatest detective in the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the detective was a relatively new invention; there were only eight detectives in all of England and rarely were they called out of London, but this crime was so shocking, as Kate Summerscale relates in her scintillating new book, that Scotland Yard sent its best man to investigate, Inspector Jonathan Whicher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whicher quickly believed the unbelievable—that someone within the family was responsible for the murder of young Saville Kent. Without sufficient evidence or a confession, though, his case was circumstantial and he returned to London a broken man. Though he would be vindicated five years later, the real legacy of Jonathan Whicher lives on in fiction: the tough, quirky, knowing, and all-seeing detective that we know and love today…from the cryptic Sgt. Cuff in Wilkie Collins’s &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone &lt;/em&gt;to Dashiell Hammett’s Sam Spade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher &lt;/em&gt;is a provocative work of nonfiction that reads like a Victorian thriller, and in it Kate Summerscale has fashioned a brilliant, multilayered narrative that is as cleverly constructed as it is beautifully written.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Gabry lives a quiet life. As safe a life as is possible in a town trapped between a forest and the ocean, in a world teeming with the dead, who constantly hunger for those still living. She's content on her side of the Barrier, happy to let her friends dream of the Dark City up the coast while she watches from the top of her lighthouse. But there are threats the Barrier cannot hold back. Threats like the secrets Gabry's mother thought she left behind when she escaped from the Sisterhood and the Forest of Hands and Teeth. Like the cult of religious zealots who worship the dead. Like the stranger from the forest who seems to know Gabry. And suddenly, everything is changing. One reckless moment, and half of Gabry's generation is dead, the other half imprisoned. Now Gabry only knows one thing: she must face the forest of her mother's past in order to save herself and the one she loves.</description>

  <description>More than just a pair of days, a weekend is also a state of mind—a feeling of relaxation and freedom to immerse ourselves fully in a favorite activity. In &lt;em&gt;Weekend Sewing, &lt;/em&gt;designer Heather Ross presents creative projects for clothing, accessories, and home items that can be made in a weekend or less. Some, like the Quick Garden Gloves and Ruby’s Bloomers, take a few hours; others, like the Weekend-Away Travel Bag and Trapeze Sundress, require a day or two—but all of them capture that weekend feeling.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; And because weekends are often the most fun when they’re social, Ross features ideas that encourage us to share our stitching and our time, such as a recipe for soup to simmer while sewing, then serve to guests later in the day, and tips for transporting a sewing machine to a friend’s house for an afternoon of social stitching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sewing instructions are beautifully illustrated, and patterns for the projects are included on pullout sheets.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Of all the contenders for the title of The Great American Novel, none has a better claim than &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&lt;/em&gt; Intended at first as a simple story of a boy's adventures in the Mississippi Valley - a sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&lt;/em&gt; - the book grew and matured under Twain's hand into a work of immeasurable richness and complexity. More than a century after its publication, the critical debate over the symbolic significance of Huck's and Jim's voyage is still fresh, and it remains a major work that can be enjoyed at many levels: as an incomparable adventure story and as a classic of American humor.</description>

  <description>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, &lt;em&gt;Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings.  "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"  Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</description>

She's determined to make everyone see what she sees in him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie defies her parents by leaving the island with Tristan. But when his ugly habits rear their head, Callie realizes maybe she's the one who's wrong about him. He's beyond her help. But it's too late for her to walk away.

  <description>The first night after Caroline moves into her fantastic new San Francisco apartment, she realizes she's gaining an intimate knowledge of her new neighbor's nocturnal adventures. Thanks to paper-thin walls and the guy's athletic prowess, she can hear not just his bed banging against the wall but the ecstatic response of what seems (as loud night after loud night goes by) like an endless parade of women. And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed. Suddenly, Caroline is finding she may have discovered a whole new definition of neighborly...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a delicious mix of silly and steamy, Alice Clayton dishes out a hot and hilarious tale of exasperation at first sight...</description>

Forgiveness proves elusive, and trouble finds her anyway when she discovers a secret club at school connected to the death of her best friend. She learns that swim team members participate in a “Fantasy Slut League,” scoring points for their sexual acts with unsuspecting girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke, wracked with guilt over her friend’s death, decides to infiltrate the league by becoming one of the “unsuspecting girls,” and exact revenge on the boys who stole away her best friend.

It contains graphic sex and language and a description of sexual violence.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>At the tender age of fourteen, Sarah Clark is seduced by her thirty-eight-year-old English teacher, Daniel Carr, and becomes entangled in an illegal, erotic, passionate, and dangerous affair—a vicious meeting of minds and bodies that ends badly. Devastated by grief and longing, Sarah embarks upon a series of meaningless self-abasing sexual encounters, hoping to reclaim the intensity of that first relationship. Then, seven years later, Carr unexpectedly returns and Sarah is drawn again into a destructive coupling. Now that she is no longer an innocent young girl, is she strong enough to finally tame the beast within her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A modern Lolita, &lt;em&gt;Taming the Beast&lt;/em&gt; is an emotionally unflinching and alluring tale that introduces a powerful new writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Karen Marie Moning comes the first book in her hotly anticipated new urban paranormal trilogy, set in the world of her blockbuster Fever series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1 AWC—After the Wall Crash. The Fae are free and hunting us. It’s a war zone out there, and no two days are alike. I’m Dani O’Malley, the chaos-filled streets of Dublin are my home, and there’s no place I’d rather be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dani “Mega” O’Malley plays by her own set of rules—and in a world overrun by Dark Fae, her biggest rule is: Do what it takes to survive. Possessing rare talents and the all-powerful Sword of Light, Dani is more than equipped for the task. In fact, she’s one of the rare humans who can defend themselves against the Unseelie. But now, amid the pandemonium, her greatest gifts have turned into serious liabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dani’s ex–best friend, MacKayla Lane, wants her dead, the terrifying Unseelie princes have put a price on her head, and Inspector Jayne, the head of the police force, is after her sword and will stop at nothing to get it. What’s more, people are being mysteriously frozen to death all over the city, encased on the spot in sub-zero, icy tableaux. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dublin’s most seductive nightclub gets blanketed in hoarfrost, Dani finds herself at the mercy of Ryodan, the club’s ruthless, immortal owner. He needs her quick wit and exceptional skill to figure out what’s freezing Fae and humans dead in their tracks—and Ryodan will do anything to ensure her compliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dodging bullets, fangs, and fists, Dani must strike treacherous bargains and make desperate alliances to save her beloved Dublin—before everything and everyone in it gets iced.</description>

  <description>When the human and the vampire worlds collide, there will be hell to pay. &lt;br&gt;Luca Ambrus is a rare breed: vampire from birth, begotten by vampire parents, blood born. He is also an agent of the Council--the centuries-old cabal that governs vampirekind, preserving their secrecy and destroying those who betray them. &lt;br&gt;When a cryptic summons leads him to the scene of the brutal killing of a powerful Council member, Luca begins the hunt for an assassin among his own people. But instead of a lone killer he discovers a sinister conspiracy of rogue vampires bent on subjugating the mortal world. &lt;br&gt;All that stands in their way are the conduits, humans able to channel spirit warriors into the physical world to protect mankind. Chloe Fallon is a conduit--and a target of the vampire assassin who's killing them. When Luca saves her life, an irresistible bond of trust--along with more passionate feelings--is forged between them. As more victims fall, Chloe and Luca have only each other to depend on to save the world from the reign of monsters--and salvage their own future together.</description>

  <description>Lizette Henry wakes up one morning and makes a terrifying discovery: She doesn’t recognize the face she sees in the mirror. She remembers what she looks like, but her reflection is someone else’s. To add to the shock, two years seem to have disappeared from her life. Someone has gone to great and inexplicable lengths to keep those missing years hidden forever. But the past always finds a way to return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strange memories soon begin to surface and, along with them, some unusual skills and talents that Lizette hasn’t a clue about acquiring. Sensing that she’s being monitored, Lizette suddenly knows how to search for bugs in her house and tracking devices in her car. What’s more, she can elude surveillance—like a trained agent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter a mysterious and seductive stranger named Xavier, who claims he wants to help—but who triggers disturbing images of an unspeakable crime of which Lizette may or may not be the perpetrator. With memories returning, she suddenly becomes a target of anonymous assassins. On the run with nowhere to hide, Lizette has no choice but to rely on Xavier, a strong and magnetic man she doesn’t trust, with a powerful attraction she cannot resist. As murky waters become clear, Lizette confronts a conspiracy that is treacherous and far-reaching and a truth that, once revealed, may silence her and Xavier once and for all.</description>

  <description>Marina Phillips has spent her entire life as her father’s victim. But enough is enough. All it took was one moment of realization to send her fleeing across the country into the unknown of New York City with no plans and no money. A new life without the constant torture is all she wants, but what she finds waiting is something she never expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fitz is New York’s premiere playboy artist. Sexy, tattooed, and coveted by women and men alike, his performances are heralded as the coming of a new god of modern art. But when Marina wanders into his show, she becomes the inadvertent piece he’s always waited for – a girl to sculpt, to change, and to craft in his own image.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She never expects to fall head over heels into the world of parties, drag queens, agents, and artists craving for her and her benefactor. She didn’t even expect to begin falling in love with someone like Fitz, the sexy, pretentious man of her nightmares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, Marina never expects her father to stage a cross-country mission to paint her as a kidnapped girl taken by a psychopath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her life on the line, Marina has no choice but to accept Fitz’s proposal – change everything she is, inside and out, for the chance to start anew. But Marina has plans of her own. Plans that will rock her world forever.</description>

  <description>*** Please note: This is a New Adult Romance novel involving two siblings who struggle with their emotions. This is not a work of erotica.***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heart cares not what society forbids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily nurtures a secret love for a flawless man—the one who is her soul mate. Donovan is gorgeous, charismatic, and delights in all of Lily’s talents and quirks. Their innate knowledge of each other is almost telepathic. Together they interlock like fine threads creating luxurious silk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But society dictates this picture-perfect adoration is the ghastliest of all possibilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lily embarks on a quest for the romance the heavens intended, her suitor turns reluctant. Desperate to uncover why Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hiding decayed from a tender-hearted gentleman into a ferociously self-serving, cocky bastard, Lily is prepared for battle when it comes to the salvation of her soul mate. However, Donovan traps Lily in a mental game of chess, leaving her to question his sanity. When Lily’s revelations about Donovan’s destructive alter ego lead to an inconceivable truth, can she help Donovan survive fate’s cruel joke?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impassioned, witty, and deeply moving, Love’s Forbidden Flower is filled with stunning controversies that will forever haunt your heart.</description>

  <description>Olivia Kaspen has just discovered that her ex-boyfriend, Caleb Drake, has lost his memory. With an already lousy reputation for taking advantage of situations, Olivia must decide how far she is willing to go to get Caleb back. Wrestling to keep her true identity and their sordid past under wraps, Olivia’s greatest obstacle is Caleb’s wicked, new girlfriend; Leah Smith. It is a race to the finish as these two vipers engage in a vicious tug of war to possess a man who no longer remembers them. But, soon enough Olivia must face the consequences of her lies, and in the process discover that sometimes love falls short of redemption.</description>

  <description>Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, it’s his cousin Beau who catches Ashton’s eye. Beau is the sexiest guy she’s ever seen, and even though he’s dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on Sawyer’s girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. That’s why he does his best to keep his distance, even though he’s been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in Sawyer’s absence, Beau knows he should say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashton and Beau don’t want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. It’s getting way too hard to resist....</description>

  <description>HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO?  &lt;p&gt; All Meg has ever wanted is to get away. Away from high school. Away from her backwater town. Away from her parents who seem determined to keep her imprisoned in their dead-end lives. But one crazy evening involving a dare and forbidden railroad tracks, she goes way too far...and almost doesn't make it back.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John made a choice to stay. To enforce the rules. To serve and protect. He has nothing but contempt for what he sees as childish rebellion, and he wants to teach Meg a lesson she won't soon forget. But Meg pushes him to the limit by questioning everything he learned at the police academy. And when he pushes back, demanding to know why she won't be tied down, they will drive each other to the edge -- and over....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[This was such a weird book to me. It didn't feel like a YA book except that the main character was so immature, selfish, and self-centered, and nothing gets explored in very much depth. I just didn't get this book, right from the very beginning. You know Meg is supposedly reactionary for a reason...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She could save the world—or destroy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Evangeline "Evie" Greene leads a charmed life, until she begins experiencing horrifying hallucinations. When an apocalyptic event decimates her Louisiana hometown, Evie realizes her hallucinations were actually visions of the future—and they're still happening. Fighting for her life and desperate for answers, she must turn to her wrong-side-of-the-bayou classmate: Jack Deveaux.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But she can't do either alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his mile-long rap sheet, wicked grin, and bad attitude, Jack is like no boy Evie has ever known. Even though he once scorned her and everything she represented, he agrees to protect Evie on her quest. She knows she can't totally depend on Jack. If he ever cast that wicked grin her way, could she possibly resist him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can Evie trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jack and Evie race to find the source of her visions, they meet others who have gotten the same call. An ancient prophesy is being played out, and Evie is not the only one with special powers. A group of twenty-two teens has been chosen to reenact the ultimate battle between good and evil. But it's not always clear who is on which side.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;ONE OF THE BOYS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What girl doesn't want to be surrounded by gorgeous jocks day in and day out? Jordan Woods isn't just surrounded by hot guys, though-she leads them as the captain and quarterback of her high school football team. They all see her as one of the guys and that's just fine. As long as she gets her athletic scholarship to a powerhouse university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But everything she's ever worked for is threatened when Ty Green moves to her school. Not only is he an amazing QB, but he's also amazingly hot. And for the first time, Jordan's feeling vulnerable. Can she keep her head in the game while her heart's on the line?</description>

  <description>Adam and Sophie Dean's good-enough marriage could easily have lasted forever. But Adam succumbs to pressure from his mistress to leave Sophie, and in the course of his carefully prepared farewell speech, Sophie has a revelation: unless &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; leaves &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; in the family home in the role of primary caregiver, he'll have a severely diminished role in the lives of their two sons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So while Adam continues to live in the suburban house he despises-with his two children and his angry mistress, who'd never planned for &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; turn of events-Sophie sets out alone into an alluring new life nearby, close enough to see her sons every day, but far removed from her former life of domestic drudgery. As she and Adam grow into their new roles, they discover what it actually means to act in their children's best interests, and that the end of a marriage can be a beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  &lt;em&gt;He's my teacher. I shouldn't be alone with him. But I can't help that he's irresistible.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I let the door silently close at my back. He stared at me, and a taut quiet stretched between us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I like hearing you play," I said, moving toward him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He turned, in sync with my slow approach. He looked up at me but didn't say anything. I rested my clammy hand on the cold, slick body of the baby grand. "May I?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The muscles in his throat shifted, then he swallowed. "Eden."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My knees weakened, like a soft tickling kiss had just been blown against the backs of them. "Is it okay?" I asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His gaze held mine like two hands joined. He understood what I was really asking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Let me stay," I said. "Please."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"You're going to get me in trouble," he said.</description>

  <description>Sadie White's summer job isn't going to be on the beach life-guarding or working at rental booths like most kids her age. With her single mother's increasing pregnancy and refusal to work, Sadie has to take over her mother's job as a domestic servant for one of the wealthy summer families on a nearby island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the family arrives at their summer getaway, Sadie is surprised to learn that the owner of the house is Jax Stone, one of the hottest teen rockers in the world. If Sadie hadn't spent her life raising her mother and taking care of the house she might have been normal enough to be excited about working for a rock star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Sadie isn't impressed by Jax's fame, he is drawn to her. Everything about Sadie fascinates Jax but he fights his attraction. Relationships never work in his world and as badly as he wants Sadie, he believes she deserves more. By the end of the summer, Jax discovers he can't breathe without Sadie.</description>

  <description>In a futuristic world nearly destroyed by religious extremists, Justin March lives in exile after failing in his job as an investigator of religious groups and supernatural claims. But Justin is given a second chance when Mae Koskinen comes to bring him back to the Republic of United North America (RUNA). Raised in an aristocratic caste, Mae is now a member of the military’s most elite and terrifying tier, a soldier with enhanced reflexes and skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Justin and Mae are assigned to work together to solve a string of ritualistic murders, they soon realize that their discoveries have exposed them to terrible danger. As their investigation races forward, unknown enemies and powers greater than they can imagine are gathering in the shadows, ready to reclaim the world in which humans are merely game pieces on their board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gameboard of the Gods&lt;/em&gt;, the first installment of Richelle Mead’s &lt;em&gt;Age of X&lt;/em&gt; series, will have all the elements that have made her YA &lt;em&gt;Vampire Academy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bloodlines&lt;/em&gt; series such megasuccesses: sexy, irresistible characters; romantic and mythological intrigue; and relentless action and suspense.</description>

  <description>Willa’s secret plan seems all too simple: take from the rich kids at Valley Prep and give to the poor ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Willa’s turn as Robin Hood at her ultra-exclusive high school is anything but. Bilking her “friends”-known to everyone as the Glitterati-without them suspecting a thing, is far from easy. Learning how to pick pockets and break into lockers is as difficult as she’d thought it’d be. Delivering care packages to the scholarship girls, who are ostracized just for being from the “wrong” side of town, is way more fun than she’d expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The complication Willa didn’t expect, though, is Aidan Murphy, Valley Prep’s most notorious (and gorgeous) ace-degenerate. His mere existence is distracting Willa from what matters most to her-evening the social playing field between the have and have-nots. There’s no time for crushes and flirting with boys, especially conceited and obnoxious trust-funders like Aidan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the cops start investigating the string of burglaries at Valley Prep and the Glitterati begin to seek revenge, could he wind up being the person that Willa trusts most?</description>

      <![CDATA[This first half of this book was pretty entertaining. Willa moves to new town, tries to fit in with the wealthy crowd now that her mom's made it big, meets new friends and cute boys. I was enjoying it for the brain candy kind of a book it was and I thought the concept of her somehow playing Robin...]]>

  <description>For thirty-five girls, the Selection is the chance of a lifetime. The opportunity to escape the life laid out for them since birth. To be swept up in a world of glittering gowns and priceless jewels. To live in a palace and compete for the heart of gorgeous Prince Maxon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for America Singer, being Selected is a nightmare. It means turning her back on her secret love with Aspen, who is a caste below her. Leaving her home to enter a fierce competition for a crown she doesn't want. Living in a palace that is constantly threatened by violent rebel attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then America meets Prince Maxon. Gradually, she starts to question all the plans she's made for herself--and realizes that the life she's always dreamed of may not compare to a future she never imagined.</description>

  <description>Savannah Colbert has never known why she's so hated by the kids of the Clann. Nor can she deny her instinct to get close to Clann golden boy Tristan Coleman. Especially when she recovers from a strange illness and the attraction becomes nearly irresistible. It's as if he's a magnet, pulling her gaze, her thoughts, even her dreams. Her family has warned her to have nothing to do with him, or any members of the Clann. But when Tristan is suddenly everywhere she goes, Savannah fears she's destined to fail.&lt;p&gt;For years, Tristan has been forbidden to even speak to Savannah Colbert. Then Savannah disappears from school for a week and comes back different, and suddenly he can't stay away. Boys seem intoxicated just from looking at her. His own family becomes stricter than ever. And Tristan has to fight his own urge to protect her, to be near her no matter the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>After an unexpected transfer to the States for her senior year, Suranne's new friends give her just one instruction: stay away from Kane Richards. According to everyone, he's a heartless playboy concerned only for himself. With one glance, it's easy to see why he gets away with it. But things aren't always what they seem- especially when he sets his sights on her and whispers that she's different. Despite all the red flags, Suranne considers whether or not his intentions are genuine or if she's simply another name on his list. In the process, she may just uncover the real Kane Richards. But, when it comes down to it, the real Kane Richards may not want to be found. Filled with raw emotion, Kane Richards Must Die explores relationships, trust, love, and what can happen when life takes an unexpected turn.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this captivating novel of romantic suspense, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Linda Howard brings us deep into the wild, where a smart and sexy outdoor guide and her ruggedly handsome competitor must join forces to survive—and avoid becoming what they never expected to be:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Thirty-two-year-old Angie Powell has always spoken her mind, but in the presence of Dare Callahan she nurses a simmering rage. After all, why give Dare the satisfaction of knowing he can push her buttons &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; push her to the edge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, Dare returned home to rural western Montana and opened a hunting business to rival Angie’s. Complicating matters is the fact that Dare has asked Angie out (not once but twice) and has given her a gift of butterflies in the process. Angie has no patience for butterflies. They only lead to foolish decisions. And now the infuriatingly handsome Iraq war vet has siphoned away Angie’s livelihood, forcing her to close up shop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before Angie is to leave town, she organizes one last trip into the wilderness with a client and his guest, who wants to bag a black bear. But the adrenaline-fueled adventure turns deadly when Angie witnesses a cold-blooded murder and finds herself on the wrong side of a loaded gun. Before the killer can tie up this attractive loose end, a bear comes crashing through the woods—changing the dark game completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily, Dare is camping nearby and hears the shots. Forced together for their very survival, Angie and Dare must confront hard feelings, a blinding storm, and a growing attraction—while being stalked by a desperate killer and a ferocious five-hundred-pound beast. And neither will stop until they reach their prey.</description>

  <description>If there’s an upside to having your heart broken, it’s this: A broken heart makes you brave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first day of sophomore year doesn’t go the way Lucy planned. After a summer apart from her boyfriend, she’s ready to greet him with a special surprise and instead gets a shocking one in return: He’s breaking up with her. Beyond devastated, Lucy has no idea how she’s going to make it through homeroom, let alone the rest of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter three stunning girls with the unnatural ability to attract boys and an offer Lucy can’t refuse: They can heal her heart in an instant. And then she’ll be one of them—a member of a sisterhood that is impervious to heartbreak and has access to magic distilled from the tears of brokenhearted boys. But to gain their power, Lucy must get a guy to fall in love with her the old-fashioned way, and then break his heart in the next seven days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the sisterhood may need another Heartbreaker, Lucy’s only desire is to get her ex back. But how far is she willing to go, and who is she willing to cross to get what she wants?</description>

  <description>Lexi is cursed with a dark secret. The water calls to her, draws her in, forces her to sing her deadly song to unsuspecting victims. If she succumbs, she kills.  If she doesn't, the pain is unbearable. To keep herself and those she cares about safe, she shuts herself off, refusing to make friends or fall in love - again. Because the last time she fell in love with a boy, he ended up dead.&lt;p&gt;Then Lexi finds herself torn. Against her better judgement, she's opening up again, falling in love with someone new when she knows she shouldn't. But when she's offered the chance to finally live a normal life, she learns that the price she must pay to be free of her curse is giving him up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Prepare to Swoon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn from her native New York City and dumped in the land of cookie-cutter preps, Candice is resigned to accept her posh, dull fate. Nothing ever happens in Swoon, Connecticut...until Dice's perfect, privileged cousin Penelope nearly dies in a fall from an old tree, and her spirit intertwines with that of a ghost. His name? Sinclair Youngblood Powers. His mission? Revenge. And while Pen is oblivious to the possession, Dice is all too aware of Sin. She's intensely drawn to him—but not at all crazy about the havoc he's wreaking. Determined to exorcise the demon, Dice accidentally sets Sin loose, gives him flesh, makes him formidable. Now she must destroy an even more potent—and irresistible—adversary, before the whole town succumbs to Sin's will. Only trouble is, she's in love with him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you do when the boy of your dreams is too bad to be true?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I noticed his eyes. They were blue, sharp and intense. Despite the youthful glows of his suntanned face, his eyes were cold and unfriendly, suggesting he had great experience in the world and was now expecting the worst.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her seventeenth year, Princess Alera of Hytanica faces one duty: to marry the man who will be king. But her father's choice of suitor fills her with despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the palace guard captures an intruder— a boy her age with steel-blue eyes, hailing from her kingdom's greatest enemy— Alera is alarmed… and intrigued. But she could not have guessed that their clandestine meetings would unveil the dark legacy shadowing both their lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this mystical world of court conspiracies and blood magic, loyalties will be tested. Courage won't be enough. And as the battle begins for everything Alera holds dear, love may be the downfall of a kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jael Thompson has never really fit in. She’s changed schools too many times to count. The only family she’s ever known is her father, a bitter ex-priest who never lets her date and insists she attend the strictest Catholic school in Seattle. And her mother—well, she was a five thousand year old demon. That doesn’t exactly help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on her sixteenth birthday, her father gives her a present that brings about some unexpected changes. Some of the changes, like strange and wonderful powers and the cute skater boy with a knack for science, are awesome. But others, like the homicidal demon seeking revenge on her family? Not so much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steeped in mythology, this is an epic tale of a heroine who balances old world with new, science with magic, and the terrifying depths of the underworld with the ordinary halls of high school.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Who was Abby then? Who is Abby now? An unsettling psychological thriller, seen through a lost girl's eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows only Sam, a mysterious teenage boy. He is her sole companion; her whole life. She was born, already a teenager, lying outside a burning building in soot-stained clothes, remembering nothing, not even her name. He showed her the necklace she had on, the one that named her: Abby. Sam brought her to live in his cavepalace, where he gives her everything she needs. He loves her. He protects her from the world outside, from everyone who wants to hurt them, like the denizens of Circle Nine, Dante's deepest circle of hell. But even in a charmed, brand-new life like Abby's, change will come. Sam falls ill. A new girl comes to stay, and Abby begins to question Sam's devotion. With doubt comes emotional turmoil, changes in perception, and glimpses of her past identity. In this courageous psychological thriller, Abby tells the story of living her new life and discovering her old one, while grappling with an ever-changing reality.</description>

But now that Dru has bloomed into a full-fledged &lt;em&gt;svetocha&lt;/em&gt; - rare, beautiful, and toxic to all vampires - the worst is yet to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because getting out alive is going to cost more than she's ever imagined. And in the end, is survival really worth the sacrifice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DRU ANDERSON'S NOT AFRAID OF THE DARK.&lt;br&gt;BUT SHE SHOULD BE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Every flame begins with a spark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashline Wilde is having a rough sophomore year. She's struggling to find her place as the only Polynesian girl in school, her boyfriend just cheated on her, and now her runaway sister, Eve, has decided to barge back into her life. When Eve's violent behavior escalates and she does the unthinkable, Ash transfers to a remote private school nestled in California's redwoods, hoping to put the tragedy behind her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her fresh start at Blackwood Academy doesn't go as planned. Just as Ash is beginning to enjoy the perks of her new school - being captain of the tennis team, a steamy romance with a hot, local park ranger - Ash discovers that a group of gods and goddesses have mysteriously enrolled at Blackwood, and she's one of them. To make matters worse, Eve has resurfaced to haunt Ash, and she's got some strange abilities of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a war between the gods looming over campus, Ash must master the new fire smoldering within before she clashes with her sister one more time...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when warm and cold fronts collide, there's guaranteed to be a storm.</description>

  <description>Okay, so cats don't always land on their feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that better than most. Since rejoining the Pride, I've made big decisions and even bigger mistakes: the kind paid for with innocent lives. As the first and only female enforcer, I have plenty to prove to my father, the Pride, and myself. And with murdered toms turning up in our territory, I'm working harder than ever, though I always find the energy for a little after-hours recreation with Marc, my partner both on- and off-duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not all of my mistakes are behind me. We're beginning to suspect that the dead are connected to a rash of missing human women and that they can all be laid at my feet--two or four, take your pick. And one horrible indiscretion may yet cost me more than I can bear...</description>

  <description>A childhood accident left Emmaline vulnerable to disturbing fugue states that last only minutes, but feel like an eternity. The blackouts are unsettling but manageable…until she meets Johnny Dellasandro. &lt;p&gt;The reclusive painter gained notoriety in the '70s for his debauched lifestyle and raunchy art films. His naked body has achieved cult status, especially in Emm's mind—she's obsessed with the man, who's grown even sexier with age. Today Johnny shuns the spotlight and Emm in particular…until she falls into a fugue on his doorstep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that moment she's transported back thirty years, crashing a party at Johnny's place in his wild-man heyday— the night is a blur of flesh and heat that lingers on her skin long after she's woken to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It happens again and again, each time-slip another mind-blowing orgy, and soon Emm can't stop, though every episode leaves her weaker and weaker. She's frightened by what's happening to her, but she's even more terrified of losing this portal to the Johnny she wants so badly. The one who wants her, too, and takes her—every chance he gets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On June 9, 1865, while traveling by train to London with his secret mistress, 53-year-old Charles Dickens--at the height of his powers and popularity, the most famous and successful novelist in the world and perhaps in the history of the world--hurtled into a disaster that changed his life forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did Dickens begin living a dark double life after the accident? Were his nightly forays into the worst slums ofLondon and his deepening obsession with corpses, crypts, murder, opium dens, the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies, and a hidden subterranean London mere research . . . or something more terrifying?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as he did in The Terror, Dan Simmons draws impeccably from history to create a gloriously engaging and terrifying narrative. Based on the historical details of Charles Dickens's life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens's friend, frequent collaborator, and Salieri-style secret rival), DROOD explores the still-unsolved mysteries of the famous author's last years and may provide the key to Dickens's final, unfinished work: The Mystery of Edwin Drood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chilling, haunting, and utterly original, DROOD is Dan Simmons at his powerful best.</description>

  <description>Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Lady Glynis Wright ever wanted was the freedom to live life as she pleased, despite her aristocratic parents' wishes for her to marry into wealth. But her fate is far more terrible than an arranged marriage when her family becomes prisoners to one of the most fearsome and powerful vampires of all time, Count Vlad Dracula. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imprisoned in the decrepit castle in the Carpathian Mountains, Glynis’s new life as a Bride of Dracula is filled with bloody feasts, cruel beatings, and sexual violence. There is no hope for escape. Vlad Dracula has elaborate plans to use her familial connections in England and she has become his favored pawn. Even more terrible is the bond of blood between them that keeps Glynis tethered to his side despite her deep hatred of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s only when Vlad Dracula takes Glynis to the picturesque city of Buda on the Danube River and she meets a mysterious vampire in the darkened city streets, does she dare hope to find love and freedom.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-year-old Enid's carefully constructed life in Vermont is beginning to crumble. She has come to accept that, after bonding together for years in "twin studies," her friends have betrayed her. And now she finds out that her dad has betrayed her mom. It's not easy, but at least she's got her boyfriend, Wick, to help her through this tough time. Solid, funny, gorgeous Wick. Enid's loved him since she was six, and their relationship is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, until Wick suddenly announces he thinks they should take a break, an unclear status that Enid can't accept. As Wick abandons Enid for a trip to Ocean City, Maryland, with those same friends who betrayed her, she lets her wildest fears take over. More than five hundred miles later, Enid realized she's acting desperate as she spies on Wick, his twin, her twin, and all the boys from twin studies. That doesn't stop her from following them aboard a yacht and hiding in the bathroom. But then the boys take the yacht out into a storm-a storm which leaves everyone adrift in the ocean without food or water-and Enid discovers a new definition of &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sharks circling and no help in sight, Enid and the rest of the twins must find a way to trust one another in order to survive-and face the fact that they might not make it home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An extraordinary debut novel of love that survives the fires of hell and transcends the boundaries of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The narrator of &lt;em&gt;The Gargoyle&lt;/em&gt; is a very contemporary cynic, physically beautiful and sexually adept, who dwells in the moral vacuum that is modern life. As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide — for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life — and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete — and her time on earth will be finished.</description>

  <description>""My love, speak to me. Tell me everything." Neferet went to Kalona, kneeling before him, stroking the soft, dark wings that unfurled loosely around the immortal. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""What would you have me say?" He didn't meet her eyes. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" "Zoey lives." Neferet's voice was flat, cold, lifeless."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""She does.""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""Then you owe me the subservience of your immortal soul." She started to walk away from him."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""Where are you going? What will happen next?""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" "It is quite simple. I will ensure Zoey is drawn back to Oklahoma. There, on my own terms, I will complete the task you failed.""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exonerated by the Vampyre High Council and returned to her position of High Priestess at Tulsa's House of Night, Neferet has sworn vengeance on Zoey. Dominion over Kalona is only one of the weapons she plans to use against Z. But Zoey has found sanctuary on the Isle of Skye and is being groomed by Queen Sgiach to take over for her there. Being Queen would be cool, wouldn't it? Why should she return to Tulsa? After losing her human consort, Heath, she will never be the same - and her relationship with her super-hot-warrior, Stark, may never be the same either...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what about Stevie Rae and Rephaim? The Raven Mocker refuses to be used against Stevie Rae, but what choice does he have when no one in the entire world, including Zoey, would be okay with their relationship? Does he betray his father or his heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the pulse-pounding 8th book in the bestselling House of Night series, how far will the bonds of friendship stretch and how strong are the ties that bind one girl's heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Y’all need to get yourselves together. Here’s a newsflash from the only High Priestess you have left at this dang school: Zoey isn’t dead. And believe me, I know dead. I’ve been there, done that and got the fricken tee-shirt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoey Redbird is the youngest High Priestess in House of Night history and is the only person—vamp or fledgling—that can stop the evil Neferet from raising all kinds of immortal trouble. And she might just have a chance if she wasn’t so busy being dead.Well, dead is too strong a word. Stevie Rae knows she can bring her BFF back from her unscheduled va-cay in the Otherworld. But it’s going to take a lot more than hoping to bring Zoey back. Stevie Rae will have to give up a few secrets of her own...</description>

  <description>Zoey needs a break after some serious excitement. Sadly, the House of Night school for vampyres doesn’t feature breaks on its curriculum—even for a High Priestess in training and her gang. Plus juggling three guys is no stress reliever, especially when one is a sexy Warrior so into protecting Zoey that he’s sensing her emotions. Wider stresses lurk too, and the dark force in Tulsa’s tunnels is spreading. Could Stevie Rae be responsible for more than a group of misfit fledglings? And Aphrodite’s visions warn Zoey to stay away from the immortal Kalona and his dark allure—but they also show that only Zoey can stop him. She’s not exactly keen to meet up, but if Zoey doesn’t go to Kalona he’ll exact a fiery vengeance on those closest to her. She just has to find the courage to do what’s necessary, or everything that’s important to her will be destroyed.</description>

  <description>What if the hottest guy in the world was hiding a nameless evil, and all he wanted was you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the start of this heart-pounding new installment of the bestselling House of Night series, Zoey's friends have her back again and Stevie Rae and the red fledglings aren't Neferet's secrets any longer. But an unexpected danger has emerged. Neferet guards her powerful new consort, Kalona, and no one at the House of Night seems to understand the threat he poses. Kalona looks gorgeous, and he has the House of Night under his spell. A past life holds the key to breaking his rapidly spreading influence, but what if this past life shows Zoey secrets she doesn't want to hear and truths she can't face?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the run and holed up in Tulsa's Prohibition-era tunnels, Zoey and her gang must discover a way to deal with something that might bring them all down. Meanwhile, Zoey has a few other little problems. The red fledglings have cleaned up well - they've even managed to make the dark, creepy tunnels feel more like home - but are they really as friendly as they seem? On the boyfriend front, Zoey has a chance to make things right with super-hot ex-, Erik, but she can't stop thinking about Stark, the archer who died in her arms after one unforgettable night, and she is driven to try to save him from Neferet's sinister influence at all costs. Will anyone believe the power evil has to hide among us?</description>

  <description>Life sucks when your friends are pissed at you. Just ask Zoey Redbird - she's become an expert on suckiness. In one week she has gone from having three boyfriends to having none, and from having a close group of friends who trusted and supported her, to being an outcast. Speaking of friends, the only two Zoey has left are undead and unMarked. And Neferet has declared war on humans, which Zoey knows in her heart is wrong. But will anyone listen to her? Zoey's adventures at vampyre finishing school take a wild and dangerous turn as loyalties are tested, shocking true intentions come to light, and an ancient evil is awakened in PC and Kristin Cast's spellbinding fourth House of Night novel. (""Recommended for readers age 13 and older"")</description>

  <description>Dark forces are at work at the House of Night and fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird’s adventures at the school take a mysterious turn.  Those who appear to be friends are turning out to be enemies.  And oddly enough, sworn enemies are also turning into friends.  So begins the gripping third installment of this “highly addictive series” (&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;), in which Zoey’s mettle will be tested like never before.  Her best friend, Stevie Rae, is undead and struggling to maintain a grip on her humanity. Zoey doesn’t have a clue how to help her, but she does know that anything she and Stevie Rae discover must be kept secret from everyone else at the House of Night, where trust has become a rare commodity.  Speaking of rare: Zoey finds herself in the very unexpected and rare position of having &lt;em&gt;three &lt;/em&gt;boyfriends. Mix a little bloodlust into the equation and the situation has the potential to spell social disaster.  Just when it seems things couldn’t get any tougher, vampyres start turning up dead. Really dead. It looks like the People of Faith, and Zoey’s horrid step-father in particular, are tired of living side-by-side with vampyres.  But, as Zoey and her friends so often find out, how things appear rarely reflects the truth…</description>

  <description>Fledging vampyre Zoey Redbird has managed to settle in at the House of Night finishing school. She finally feels like she belongs, even gets chosen as the Leader of the Dark Daughters. Best of all, she actually has a boyfriend... or two. Then the unthinkable happens: Human teenagers are being killed, and all the evidence points to the House of Night. While danger stalks the humans from Zoey’s old life, she begins to realize that the very powers that make her so unique might also threaten those she loves. Then, when she needs her new friends the most, death strikes the House of Night, and Zoey must find the courage to face a betrayal that could break her heart, her soul, and jeopardize the very fabric of her world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes sorry isn't enough....&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s winter break in Ascension, Maine. The snow is falling and everything looks pristine and peaceful. But not all is as it seems...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between cozy traditions and parties with her friends, Emily loves the holidays. And this year’s even better—the guy she’s been into for months is finally noticing her. But Em knows if she starts things with him, there’s no turning back. Because his girlfriend is Em’s best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other side of town, Chase is having problems of his own. The stress of his home life is starting to take its toll, and his social life is unraveling. But that’s nothing compared to what’s really haunting him. Chase has done something cruel...something the perfect guy he pretends to be would never do. And it’s only a matter of time before he’s exposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Ascension, mistakes can be deadly. And three girls—three beautiful, mysterious girls—are here to choose who will pay. Em and Chase have been chosen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>1.5 stars</strong> The pitch for this book is fabulous, and it's easy to see why it got the green light: a group of beautiful girls, loosely based on the Greek Furies, punishes teenagers for their indiscretions. Add to that an insanely gorgeous cover using a model with glorious red hair in a flowing dress...]]>

  <description>What happens to the girls nobody sees—the ones who are ignored, mistreated, hidden away? The girls nobody hears when they cry for help?&lt;br&gt;Fourteen-year-old Luce is one of those lost girls. After her father vanishes in a storm at sea, she is stuck in a grim, gray Alaskan fishing village with her alcoholic uncle. When her uncle crosses an unspeakable line, Luce reaches the depths of despair. Abandoned on the cliffs near her home, she expects to die when she tumbles to the icy, churning waves below. Instead, she undergoes an astonishing transformation and becomes a mermaid. &lt;br&gt;A tribe of mermaids finds Luce and welcomes her in—all of them, like her, lost girls who surrendered their humanity in the darkest moments of their lives. The mermaids are beautiful, free, and ageless, and Luce is thrilled with her new life until she discovers the catch: they feel an uncontrollable desire to drown seafarers, using their enchanted voices to lure ships into the rocks.&lt;br&gt;Luce’s own talent at singing captures the attention of the tribe’s queen, the fierce and elegant Catarina, and Luce soon finds herself pressured to join in committing mass murder. Luce’s struggle to retain her inner humanity puts her at odds with her friends; even worse, Catarina seems to regard Luce as a potential rival. But the appearance of a devious new mermaid brings a real threat to Catarina’s leadership and endangers the very existence of the tribe. Can Luce find the courage to challenge the newcomer, even at the risk of becoming rejected and alone once again?&lt;br&gt;Lost Voices is a captivating and wildly original tale about finding a voice, the healing power of friendship, and the strength it takes to forgive.</description>

      <![CDATA[I don't like it when mermaids are mean.<br /><br />This book has beautiful imagery of shimmering fins and tails and mesmerizing siren songs, as well as exciting near-misses with giant orcas.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;What's a girl to do when meeting The One means she's cursed to die a horrible death?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life hasn't been easy on sixteen-year-old Emma Connor, so a new start in New York may be just the change she needs. But the posh Upper East Side prep school she has to attend? Not so much. Friendly faces are few and far between, except for one that she's irresistibly drawn to— Brendan Salinger, the guy with the rock-star good looks and the richest kid in school, who might just be her very own white knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even when Brendan inexplicably turns cold, Emma can't stop staring. Ever since she laid eyes on him, strange things have been happening. Streetlamps go out wherever she walks, and Emma's been having the oddest dreams: visions of herself in past lives— visions that warn her to stay away from Brendan. Or else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[The beginning of this book is pretty good. There's a little bit of set up that explains Emma's nervousness over attending an exclusive school in a new city, plus some funny one-liners that make her seem pretty likable. But on page 15, Emma meets Brendan and everything goes downhill from there, be...]]>

  <description>R. A. Nelson takes us on a supernatural thrill ride, a modern-day vampire story set on a NASA base and filled with space-and-science intrigue. Seventeen-year-old Emma feels cursed by her epilepsy—until the lost night. She's shocked to wake up in the hospital one morning, weak from blood loss. When her memories begin to return, she pieces together that it was a man—a monster—who attacked her: a vampire named Wirtz. And it was her very condition that saved her: a grand mal seizure interrupted Wirtz and left Emma with all the amazing powers of a vampire—heightened senses, rapid speed—but no need to drink blood. Is Emma now a half-vampire girl? One thing soon becomes clear: the vampire Wirtz is fierce and merciless, feared even by his own kind, and won't leave a job undone.</description>

  <description>Forced to drop out of an esteemed East Coast college after the sudden death of her parents, Jane Moore takes a nanny job at Thornfield Park, the estate of Nico Rathburn, a world-famous rock star on the brink of a huge comeback. Practical and independent, Jane reluctantly becomes entranced by her magnetic and brooding employer and finds herself in the midst of a forbidden romance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's a mystery at Thornfield, and Jane's much-envied relationship with Nico is soon tested by an agonizing secret from his past. Torn between her feelings for Nico and his fateful secret, Jane must decide: Does being true to herself mean giving up on true love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An irresistible romance interwoven with a darkly engrossing mystery, this contemporary retelling of the beloved classic &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre &lt;/em&gt;promises to enchant a new generation of readers.</description>

  <description>The first in a trilogy. Get out your tape recorders, crystals, and extra batteries-- you're about to go where our world meets the spirit world. &lt;br&gt;Psychic Kids, Paranormal State, Haunting Evidence--these and countless other television shows are making believers out of millions of people: Ghosts exist, and they're living right beside us. For centuries, individuals have been trying to prove the existence of ghosts. But without hard evidence, it's been difficult to make the case. But now as science and technology have progressed, ghost hunters have been able to use scientific means, along with more traditional psychic tools, to make their case. Photographs, video recordings, and sound recordings are all producing some amazing results.&lt;br&gt;In this new series, Ghost Huntress, meet Kendall Moorehead, a seemingly typical teen. When her family moves from Chicago to the small historical town of Radisson, Georgia, her psychic abilities awaken. She's hearing, feeling, and seeing things that seem unbelievable at first, but with the help of the town psychic, Kendall is able to come to terms with her newly emerging gift. So, together with her new BFF, Celia, Kendall forms a ghost hunting team. They've got all the latest technology. They've got Kendall for their psychic. Now they're going to clean up Radisson of its less savory spirits.&lt;br&gt;The story is fiction. The science is real. Welcome to a new reality.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An angel is sent to Earth on a mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But falling in love is not part of the plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three angels – Gabriel, the warrior; Ivy, the healer; and Bethany, the youngest and most human – are sent by Heaven to bring good to a world falling under the influence of darkness. They work hard to conceal their luminous glow, superhuman powers, and, most dangerous of all, their wings, all the while avoiding all human attachments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Bethany meets Xavier Woods, and neither of them is able to resist the attraction between them. Gabriel and Ivy do everything in their power to intervene, but the bond between Xavier and Bethany seems too strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The angel’s mission is urgent, and dark forces are threatening. Will love ruin Bethany or save her?</description>

  <description>Frannie Cavanaugh is a good Catholic girl with a bit of a wicked streak. She has spent years keeping everyone at a distance---even her closest friends---and it seems as if her senior year is going to be more of the same . . . until Luc Cain enrolls in her class. No one knows where he came from, but Frannie can't seem to stay away from him. &lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that Luc is on a mission. He's been sent from Hell itself to claim Frannie's soul. It should be easy---all he has to do is get her to sin, and Luc is as tempting as they come. Frannie doesn't stand a chance. But he has to work fast, because if the infernals are after her, the celestials can't be far behind. And sure enough, it's not long before the angel Gabriel shows up, willing to do anything to keep Luc from getting what he came for. It isn't long before they find themselves fighting for more than just Frannie's soul. &lt;br&gt;But if Luc fails, there will be Hell to pay . . . for all of them.</description>

When she's forced to choose between hanging onto hope or letting go to serve her Amadis purposes, she faces a decision with inconceivable sacrifices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexis runs to the one place she thinks will provide answers, only to find herself at the center of another battle of good versus evil, not only with the Daemoni, not only within herself...but also against the worst opponent imaginable. But even if she wins, what will she lose?</description>

  <description>For seventeen-year-old Janie, getting sucked into other people's dreams is getting old. Especially the falling dreams, the naked-but-nobody-notices dreams, and the sex-crazed dreams. Janie's seen enough fantasy booty to last her a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;She can't tell anybody about what she does they'd never believe her, or worse, they'd think she's a freak. So Janie lives on the fringe, cursed with an ability she doesn't want and can’t control.&lt;br&gt;Then she falls into a gruesome nightmare, one that chills her to the bone. For the first time, Janie is more than a witness to someone else's twisted psyche. She is a participant.</description>

  <description>Vivian Gandillon relishes the change, the sweet, fierce ache that carries her from girl to wolf. At sixteen, she is beautiful and strong, and all the young wolves are on her tail. But Vivian still grieves for her dead father; her pack remains leaderless and in disarray, and she feels lost in the suburbs of Maryland. She longs for a normal life. But what is normal for a werewolf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Vivian falls in love with a human, a meat-boy. Aiden is kind and gentle, a welcome relief from the squabbling pack. He’s fascinated by magic, and Vivian longs to reveal herself to him. Surely he would understand her and delight in the wonder of her dual nature, not fear her as an ordinary human would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivian’s divided loyalties are strained further when a brutal murder threatens to expose the pack. Moving between two worlds, she does not seem to belong in either. What is she really—human or beast? Which tastes sweeter—blood or chocolate?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When rejection comes back to bite you...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jordan's life sucks. Her boyfriend, Michael, dumped her, slept his way through half the student body, and then killed himself. But now, somehow, he appears at her window every night, begging her to let him in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jordan can't understand why he wants her, but she feels her resistance wearing down. After all, her life -- once a broken record of boring parties, meaningless hookups, and friends she couldn't relate to -- now consists of her drinking alone in her room as she waits for the sun to go down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Michael needs to be invited in before he can enter. All Jordan has to do is say the words....</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A love like no other...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Abbey's best friend, Kristen, vanishes at the bridge near Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, everyone else is all too quick to accept that Kristen is dead...and rumors fly that her death was no accident. Abbey goes through the motions of mourning her best friend, but privately, she refuses to believe that Kristen is really gone. Then she meets Caspian, the gorgeous and mysterious boy who shows up out of nowhere at Kristen's funeral and keeps reappearing in Abbey's life. Caspian clearly has secrets of his own, but he's the only person who makes Abbey feel normal again...but also special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Abbey starts to feel that she might survive all this, she learns a secret that makes her question everything she thought she knew about her best friend. How could Kristen have kept silent about so much? And could this secret have led to her death? As Abbey struggles to understand Kristen's betrayal, she uncovers a frightening truth that nearly unravels her - one that will challenge her emerging love for Caspian, as well as her own sanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first book in Alyson Noël's extraordinary new Immortals series. Enter an enchanting new world, where true love never dies...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a horrible accident claims the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever Bloom can see people's auras, hear their thoughts, and know someone's entire life story by touching them. Going out of her way to avoid human contact to suppress her abilities, she has been branded a freak at her new high school — but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damen is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy. He's the only one who can silence the noise and random energy in her head - wielding a magic so intense, it's as though he can peer straight into her soul. As Ever is drawn deeper into his enticing world of secrets and mystery, she's left with more questions than answers. And she has no idea just who he really is - or &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; he is. The only thing she knows to be true is that she's falling deeply and helplessly in love with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;With over 500,000 in print, this best-selling series about a teen witch has cast a spell upon young adults across the world! In commemoration of this remarkable success, each volume—&lt;em&gt;Blue is for Nightmares, White is for Magic, Silver is for Secrets&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Red is for Remembrance&lt;/em&gt;—has been updated with a new cover. Also sporting a fresh design is &lt;em&gt;The Blue is for Nightmares Collection&lt;/em&gt;, a handsome boxed set of all four of these new editions—plus a unique book of spells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engaging heroine of this popular suspense series is Stacey Brown. A typical teenager, Stacey has the usual worries, but she is also a hereditary witch who is blessed—or cursed—with a gift for prophetic dreams. Breathtaking bouts with killers and heart-wrenching near misses with death will keep you on the edge of your seat!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awards and Praise for &lt;em&gt;Blue is for Nightmares&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;- A YALSA Popular Paperback (2007)&lt;br&gt;- A YALSA Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers (2005)&lt;br&gt;- A YALSA Teens' Top Ten nominee (2004)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A good choice for libraries where witchcraft is an eternal favorite." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;em&gt;VOYA&lt;/em&gt; (Voice of Youth Advocates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Beautiful Malice&lt;/strong&gt; unfolds a haunting story in which people, motives, and circumstances are never what they seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who is Katherine Patterson? It is a question she hopes no one can answer. To erase her past, Katherine has moved to a new city, enrolled in a new school, and even changed her name. She’s done the next best thing to disappearing altogether. Now, wary and alone, she seeks nothing more than anonymity. What she finds instead is the last thing she expected: a friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more unlikely, Katherine’s new friend is the most popular and magnetic girl in school. Extroverted, gorgeous, flirtatious, and unpredictable, she is everything that Katherine is not and doesn’t want to be: the center of attention. Yet Alice’s enthusiasm is infectious, her candor sometimes unsettling, and Katherine, in spite of her guarded caution, finds herself drawn into Alice’s private circle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Alice has secrets, too—darker than anyone can begin to imagine. And when she lets her guard down at last, Katherine discovers the darkest of them all. For there will be no escaping the past for Katherine Patterson—only a descent into a trap far more sinister . . . and infinitely more seductive.</description>

  <description>On the morning of her sixteenth birthday, Renée Winters was still an ordinary girl. She spent her summers at the beach, had the perfect best friend, and had just started dating the cutest guy at school. No one she'd ever known had died. But all that changes when she finds her parents dead in the Redwood Forest, in what appears to be a strange double murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the funeral Renée’s wealthy grandfather sends her to Gottfried Academy, a remote and mysterious boarding school in Maine, where she finds herself studying subjects like Philosophy, Latin, and the “Crude Sciences.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s there that she meets Dante Berlin, a handsome and elusive boy to whom she feels inexplicably drawn. As they grow closer, unexplainable things begin to happen, but Renée can’t stop herself from falling in love. It’s only when she discovers a dark tragedy in Gottfried’s past that she begins to wonder if the Academy is everything it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little does she know, Dante is the one hiding a dangerous secret, one that has him fearing for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; is both a compelling romance and thought-provoking read, bringing shocking new meaning to life, death, love, and the nature of the soul.</description>

  <description>The House of Night series is set in a world very much like our own, except in 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres have always existed.  In this first book in the series, Zoey enters the House of Night, a school where, after having undergone the Change, she will train to become an adult vampire -- that is, if she makes it through the Change.  Not all of those who are chosen do.  It's tough to begin a new life, away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.  She has been Marked as special by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx.  But she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers.  When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite club, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends.</description>

  <description>There’s something achingly familiar about Daniel Grigori.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious and aloof, he captures Luce Price’s attention from the moment she sees him on her first day at the Sword &amp;amp; Cross boarding school in sultry Savannah. He’s the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce – he goes out of his way to make that very clear. But she can’t let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, Luce has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret...even if it kills her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dangerously exciting and darkly romantic, FALLEN is a page-turning thriller and the ultimate love story.</description>

  <description>Nora Grey's life is still far from perfect. Surviving an attempt on her life wasn't pleasant, but at least she got a guardian angel out of it. A mysterious, magnetic, gorgeous guardian angel. But despite his role in her life, Patch has been acting anything but angelic. He's more elusive than ever (if that's possible) and what's worse, he seems to be spending time with Nora's archenemy, Marcie Millar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nora would have hardly noticed Scott Parnell, an old family friend who has moved back to town, if Patch hadn't been acting so distant. Even with Scott's totally infuriating attitude, Nora finds herself drawn to him - despite her lingering feelings that he is hiding something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If that weren't enough, Nora is haunted by images of her murdered father, and comes to question whether her Nephilim bloodline has anything to do with his death. Desperate to figure out what happened, she puts herself in increasingly dangerous situations to get the answer. But maybe some things are better left buried, because the truth could destroy everything - and everyone - she trusts.</description>

  <description>To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough...not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, ROOM is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.</description>

In all the tragedies that I've read about, manmade or otherwise, no act of violence has ever made my heart wrench more than the prolonged imprisonment of a human being for sexual purposes. It's also the crime...]]>

  <description>When you wake up in the morning and your eyes take in the first hints of light that shine through your window, the dust motes catching and reflecting the sun’s rays like little diamonds, the shimmering hues of yellow and orangey gold breaking through into your room, the first thing you think about usually isn’t how you’re going to make it through the worst day of your life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for Grace Shelley, that’s exactly what she’s facing as she ponders what to do now that she’s going to be starting out her last year in high school without her best friend. She’s not exactly the most popular girl in school - well, not the most popular girl in school to like, anyway - and everything seems to be hinting at another status quo year for her until she bumps into a stranger who leaves her stumbling for words and chasing after her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new guy in school is different. Robert doesn’t care about the rumors he’s heard about her or that no one else seems to see her the same way that he does; he only wants to be her friend. That’s when things get complicated. When Grace learns that he’s not your typical high school boy and that he’s actually a wingless angel who’s looking for someone to trust, she’s thrust into his world where not all angels are meant to protect human beings, and where the changes she brings into his life changes everything in hers.</description>

  <description>Violet Ambrose is grappling with two major issues: Jay Heaton and her morbid secret ability. While the sixteen-year-old is confused by her new feelings for her best friend since childhood, she is more disturbed by her "power" to sense dead bodies—or at least those that have been murdered. Since she was a little girl, she has felt the echoes that the dead leave behind in the world... and the imprints that attach to their killers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet has never considered her strange talent to be a gift; it mostly just led her to find the dead birds her cat had tired of playing with. But now that a serial killer has begun terrorizing her small town, and the echoes of the local girls he's claimed haunt her daily, she realizes she might be the only person who can stop him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his fierce protectiveness over her, Jay reluctantly agrees to help Violet on her quest to find the murderer—and Violet is unnerved to find herself hoping that Jay's intentions are much more than friendly. But even as she's falling intensely in love, Violet is getting closer and closer to discovering a killer... and becoming his prey herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A SACRED OATH&lt;br&gt;A FALLEN ANGEL&lt;br&gt;A FORBIDDEN LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romance was not part of Nora Grey's plan. She's never been particularly attracted to the boys at her school, no matter how hard her best friend, Vee, pushes them at her. Not until Patch comes along. With his easy smile and eyes that seem to see inside her, Patch draws Nora to him against her better judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after a series of terrifying encounters, Nora's not sure whom to trust. Patch seems to be everywhere she is and seems to know more about her than her closest friends. She can't decide whether she should fall into his arms or run and hide. And when she tries to seek some answers, she finds herself near a truth that is way more unsettling than anything Patch makes her feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For she is right in the middle of an ancient battle between the immortal and those that have fallen - and, when it comes to choosing sides, the wrong choice will cost Nora her life.</description>

  <description>I am a beast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beast. Not quite wolf or bear, gorilla or dog but a horrible new creature who walks upright--a creature with fangs and claws and hair springing from every pore. I am a monster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You think I'm talking fairy tales? No way. The place is New York City. The time is now. It's no deformity, no disease. And I'll stay this way forever--ruined--unless I can break the spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, the spell, the one the witch in my English class cast on me. Why did she turn me into a beast who hides by day and prowls by night? I'll tell you. I'll tell you how I used to be Kyle Kingsbury, the guy you wished you were, with money, perfect looks, and the perfect life. And then, I'll tell you how I became perfectly . . . beastly.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Sister's Keeper&lt;/em&gt; examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in &lt;em&gt;My Sister's Keeper,&lt;/em&gt; Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For readers of Amy Tan's bestselling novel, &lt;em&gt;The Valley of Amazement&lt;/em&gt;, revisit her classic tale of mothers and daughters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Four mothers, four daughters, four families whose histories shift with the four winds depending on who's "saying" the stories. In 1949 four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, begin meeting to eat dim sum, play mahjong, and talk. United in shared unspeakable loss and hope, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Rather than sink into tragedy, they choose to gather to raise their spirits and money. "To despair was to wish back for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable." Forty years later the stories and history continue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery.</description>

  <description>The pulse-pounding sequel to Proxy! Inspired by The Whipping Boy and Feed, this adrenaline-fueled thriller will appeal to fans of The Hunger Games and Divergent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the new world led by the Rebooters, former Proxy Syd is the figurehead of the Revolution, beloved by some and hated by others. Liam, a seventeen-year-old Rebooter, is Syd’s bodyguard and must protect him with his life. But armed Machinists aren’t the only danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People are falling ill—their veins show through their skin, they find it hard to speak, and sores erupt all over their bodies. Guardians, the violent enforcers of the old system, are hit first, and the government does nothing to help. The old elites fall next, and in the face of an indifferent government, Syd decides it’s up to him to find a cure . . . and what he discovers leaves him stunned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This heart-stopping thriller is packed with action, adventure, and heroics. Guardian will leave you breathless until the final page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fast-paced, thrill-ride of novel full of non-stop action, heart-hammering suspense and true friendship—just as moving as it is exhilarating. Fans of Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series, James Dashner's Maze Runner, Patrick Ness's Chaos Walking series, and Marie Lu's Legend trilogy will be swept away by this story.</description>

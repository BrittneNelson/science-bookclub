  <description>New York Times-bestselling author Anne Lamott writes about the three simple prayers essential to coming through tough times, difficult days and the hardships of daily life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers of all ages have followed and cherished Anne Lamott’s funny and perceptive writing about her own faith through decades of trial and error. And in her new book, Help, Thanks, Wow, she has coalesced everything she knows about prayer to these fundamentals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is these three prayers – asking for assistance from a higher power, appreciating what we have that is good, and feeling awe at the world around us – that can get us through the day and can show us the way forward. In Help, Thanks, Wow, Lamott recounts how she came to these insights, explains what they mean to her and how they have helped, and explores how others have embraced these same ideas.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.  Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it.  District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>"The Resurrectionist" is a wild ride into a territory where nothing is as it appears. Part classic noir thriller, part fabulist fable, it is the story of Sweeney and his comatose son, Danny. Hoping for a miracle, Sweeney has brought Danny to the fortresslike Peck Clinic, whose doctors claim to have "resurrected" patients who were similarly lost in the void. but the real cure for his son's condition may lie in Limbo, a comic book world beloved by Danny before he slipped into a coma. &lt;br&gt;O'Connell has crafted a spellbinding novel about stories and what they can do for and "to" those who create them and those who consume them. About the nature of consciousness and the power of the unknown. And, ultimately, about forgiveness and the depth of our need to extend it and receive it.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Midnight Sun&lt;/em&gt; is the much anticipated retelling of &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; from Edward Cullen's perspective. An unedited partial draft was illegally leaked onto the internet in 2008; consequently, author Stephenie Meyer put the project on indefinite hold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly afterward, she posted a letter to her fans on her website including a link to the entire partial draft of the book so that those who wanted to read it could do so legally and with her consent; see URL for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;  Do not add a cover.  Do not add translations.  Do not add any other editions.</description>

  <description>Lisey Landon lost her husband Scott two years ago, after a twenty-five-year marriage of profound, sometimes frightening intimacy. Scott was a celebrated, award-winning, novelist. And a complex man. Lisey knew there was a dark place where her husband ventured to face his demons. Boo'ya Moon is what Scott called it; a realm that both terrified and healed him, that could eat him alive or give him the ideas he needed to write and live. Now, it's Lisey's turn to face her husband's demons. And what begins as a widow's effort to sort through her husband's effects, becomes a perilous journey into the heart of darkness</description>

  <description>Stoker, Bram "Dracula" in the revolutionary Bed Book Landscape Reading Format - a new approach to reading in bed as well as other places people enjoy reading while lying down, such as the beach, or on a grassy lawn in the park. Bed Books provide the freedom to lie in any comfortable position without being obligated to sit up in order to read. They can be an essential aid for readers who may be prone to back and neck strain when assuming the contorted body positions normally required for reading while lying down, and for those who have previously found it difficult or impossible to read books in bed, such as the elderly and the disabled. Bed Books can also be read sitting up as easily as with a conventional book. See the current Bed Book Catalog at: &lt;a href="http://www.bedbooks.NET" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.bedbooks.NET&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.readinginbed.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.readinginbed.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I knew we were both in mortal danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in that instant I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella ever could have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...</description>

  <description>A mysterious island. An abandoned orphanage. A strange collection of very curious photographs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It all waits to be discovered in Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, an unforgettable novel that mixes fiction and photography in a thrilling reading experience. As our story opens, a horrific family tragedy sets sixteen-year-old Jacob journeying to a remote island off the coast of Wales, where he discovers the crumbling ruins of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores its abandoned bedrooms and hallways, it becomes clear that the children were more than just peculiar. They may have been dangerous. They may have been quarantined on a deserted island for good reason. And somehow—impossible though it seems—they may still be alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spine-tingling fantasy illustrated with haunting vintage photography, Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children will delight adults, teens, and anyone who relishes an adventure in the shadows.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The groundbreaking work that poses one of the most provocative questions of a generation: what is happening to the selves of adolescent girls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As a therapist, Mary Pipher was becoming frustrated with the growing problems among adolescent girls. Why were so many of them turning to therapy in the first place? Why had these lovely and promising human beings fallen prey to depression, eating disorders, suicide attempts, and crushingly low self-esteem? The answer hit a nerve with Pipher, with parents, and with the girls themselves. Crashing and burning in a �developmental Bermuda Triangle,” they were coming of age in a media-saturated culture preoccupied with unrealistic ideals of beauty and images of dehumanized sex, a culture rife with addictions and sexually transmitted diseases. They were losing their resiliency and optimism in a �girl-poisoning” culture that propagated values at odds with those necessary to survive.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Told in the brave, fearless, and honest voices of the girls themselves who are emerging from the chaos of adolescence, &lt;em&gt;Reviving Ophelia&lt;/em&gt; is a call to arms, offering important tactics, empathy, and strength, and urging a change where young hearts can flourish again, and rediscover and reengage their sense of self.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I wrote this book for the average person who has a job, makes a living and still can�t seem to get ahead.  I wrote it for the person who dreams of being rich but can�t quite seem to turn his dreams into reality.  I wrote this book for the person who is ready to turn his life around and finally have financial freedom. I wrote this book for the person who is covered in debt and can�t seem to stop living paycheck to paycheck.  I wrote this for the person who spends more than they make and can�t figure out how to stop doing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Larry Winget &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If this describes you, you are not alone. Over 40% of families are feeling the pressure, spending more than they earn, and risking retiring financially dependent on the government, family, or charity.  Larry Winget knows�he�s been where you are now. He grew up poor, then made and lost a fortune when a business in which he�d invested went bankrupt. But he worked his way back from rock-bottom to become a multi- millionaire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now he gets paid to help people in financial crisis on A&amp;amp;E�s reality series, &lt;em&gt;Big Spender&lt;/em&gt;. On the show, he coaches people who have jobs, maybe even high-paying jobs, but are nevertheless in debt or living hand-to-mouth. His blunt take on their situations? &lt;em&gt;They�re broke because they want to be&lt;/em&gt;. They all say they want stability, savings, and financial freedom, but their actions too often contradict their words. Larry helps them to see the contradiction, get back on track, and out of debt, step-by-step. He can help you, too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Whether your aim is to get out of debt, save for a house, or simply stop kidding yourself when it comes to savings (for retirement, for your kids� college, whatever your goal) this book encourages you, through easy-to-complete worksheets and Larry�s bullying yet wise counsel, to &lt;em&gt;make it happen&lt;/em&gt;. Larry�s motivating message:  &lt;em&gt;If you want to be rich, you can&lt;/em&gt;. But first, you have to stop being broke, and start getting ahead. And he�ll walk you through not only the necessary attitude adjustment, but the practical choices and actions that will get you there. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Using a mix of personal anecdotes and perceptive social analysis, acclaimed cultural critic David J. Skal examines the amazing phenomenon of Halloween, exploring its dark Celtic history and illuminating why it has evolved-in the course of a few short generations-from a quaint, small-scale celebration into the largest seasonal marketing event outside of Christmas. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Ekhart Tolle's message is simple: living in the now is the truest path to happiness and enlightenment. And while this message may not seem stunningly original or fresh, Tolle's clear writing, supportive voice and enthusiasm make this an excellent manual for anyone who's ever wondered what exactly "living in the now" means. Foremost, Tolle is a world-class teacher, able to explain complicated concepts in concrete language. More importantly, within a chapter of reading this book, readers are already holding the world in a different container--more conscious of how thoughts and emotions get in the way of their ability to live in genuine peace and happiness.&lt;p&gt;Tolle packs a lot of information and inspirational ideas into &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt;. (Topics include the source of Chi, enlightened relationships, creative use of the mind, impermanence and the cycle of life.) Thankfully, he's added markers that symbolise "break time". This is when readers should close the book and mull over what they just read. As a result, &lt;em&gt;The Power of Now&lt;/em&gt; reads like the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;A Course in Miracles&lt;/em&gt;--a spiritual guidebook that has the potential to inspire just as many study groups and change just as many lives for the better. --&lt;em&gt;Gail Hudson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On a grey winter day in December 1958, one of the deadliest fires in American history took the lives of ninety-two children and three nuns at a Catholic elementary school on Chicago's West Side. The blaze at Our Lady of the Angels School shocked the nation. It left many families physically and psychologically scarred for life, destroyed a close-knit working-class neighborhood, and sowed popular suspicion of the church hierarchy and city fathers. No one was ever prosecuted for setting the fire; to this day it remains an officially unsolved mystery. In To Sleep with the Angels, two veteran journalists tell the moving story of the fire and its consequences. David Cowan and John Kuenster have worked for years, talking with hundreds of sources and ferreting our documents to reconstruct a minute-by-minute narrative of the tragedy and the sorrows of its aftermath. It is a story of ordinary people caught up in a mind-numbing disaster. In gripping detail, the authors describe the fear, desperation, and panic that prevailed among children, teachers, firefighters, and parents in and around the stricken school building on that cold Monday afternoon. Beyond the flames, the story of the fire at Our Lady of the Angels became an enigma whose mystery has deepened with time: its cause was never officially explained despite evidence that it had been intentionally set by a troubled student at the school. The authors reveal for the first time this youngster's "confession" and the decision by a local judge not to pursue the case against him. The Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago also refused to press an investigation, preferring to label the fire a terrible "accident."</description>

  <description>In this searing novel, two young hoods, Harry and Tyrone, and a girlfriend fantasize about scoring a pound of uncut heroin and getting rich. But their habit gets the better of them, consumes them and destroys their dreams. "Selby's place is in the front rank of American novelists. His work has the power, the intimacy with suffering and morality, the honesty and moral urgency of Dostoevsky's....To understand Selby's work is to understand the anguish of America." -- The New York Times Book Review</description>

  <description>Stephen King returns to the characters and territory of one of his most popular novels ever, &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt;, in this instantly riveting novel about the now middle-aged Dan Torrance (the boy protagonist of &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt;) and the very special twelve-year-old girl he must save from a tribe of murderous paranormals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On highways across America, a tribe of people called The True Knot travel in search of sustenance. They look harmless—mostly old, lots of polyester, and married to their RVs. But as Dan Torrance knows, and spunky twelve-year-old Abra Stone learns, The True Knot are quasi-immortal, living off the “steam” that children with the “shining” produce when they are slowly tortured to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by the inhabitants of the Overlook Hotel where he spent one horrific childhood year, Dan has been drifting for decades, desperate to shed his father’s legacy of despair, alcoholism, and violence. Finally, he settles in a New Hampshire town, an AA community that sustains him, and a job at a nursing home where his remnant “shining” power provides the crucial final comfort to the dying. Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes “Doctor Sleep.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Dan meets the evanescent Abra Stone, and it is her spectacular gift, the brightest shining ever seen, that reignites Dan’s own demons and summons him to a battle for Abra’s soul and survival. This is an epic war between good and evil, a gory, glorious story that will thrill the millions of devoted readers of &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt; and satisfy anyone new to the territory of this icon in the King canon.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A heartfelt portrait of a bygone age.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; William Sheppard had never ventured beyond his Chicago neighborhood until, at thirteen, he was sent away to the Swope Ranch Boys’ Reformatory, hundreds of miles from home, for stabbing his abusive father in the chest with a pocketknife. Buried deep in the Colorado mountains, Swope is shrouded in legend and defined by one prevailing rumor: that the boys who go in never come out the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the lack of fences or gates, the boundaries are clear: prisoners are days from civilization, there exists only one accessible road—except in the wintertime, when it’s buried under feet upon feet of snow, and anyone attempting escape will be shot down without hesitation in the shadow of the peaks. At 13,000 feet above sea level, the mountains aren’t forgiving, and neither are the guards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With twenty-four months of hard time ahead of him, Will quickly learns to distinguish his allies from his enemies. He also learns about the high price of a childhood lost. At Swope, herds of mustangs are trucked in to be broken by a select group of inmates. Once the horses are gentled, they are sold to ranchers and landowners across the Southwest. Horses come and go, delinquent boys come and go. The boys break the horses, Swope Reformatory breaks the boys. Throughout this ordeal, Will discovers three others who bring him into their inner circle. They are life preservers in a sea of violence and corruption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if the boys are to withstand the ranch, they must first overcome tragedy and death—a feat that could haunt them for years to come.&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Cassel comes from a family of Curse Workers - people who have the power to change your emotions, your memories, your luck, by the slightest touch of their hands. And since curse work is illegal, they're all criminals. Many become mobsters and con artists. But not Cassel. He hasn't got magic, so he's an outsider, the straight kid in a crooked family. You just have to ignore one small detail - he killed his best friend, Lila, three years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassel has carefully built up a facade of normalcy, blending into the crowd. But his facade starts to crumble when he finds himself sleepwalking, propelled into the night by terrifying dreams about a white cat that wants to tell him something. He's noticing other disturbing things too, including the strange behavior of his two brothers. They are keeping secrets from him. As Cassel begins to suspect he's part of a huge con game, he must unravel his past and his memories. To find out the truth, Cassel will have to out-con the conmen.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WE DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS BOOK.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it. Nevertheless, you need to know something, so we will just say this: It is extremely funny, but the African beach scene is horrific. The story starts there, but the book doesn't. And it's what happens afterward that is most important. Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds.</description>

  <description>Writer Lisa Jones went to Wyoming for a four-day magazine assignment and came home four years later with a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a dusty corral on the Wind River Indian Reservation, she met Stanford Addison, a Northern Arapaho who seemed to transform everything around him. He gentled horses rather than breaking them by force. It was said that he could heal people of everything from cancer toÊbipolar disorder. He did all this from a wheelchair; he had been a quadriplegic for more than twenty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intrigued, Lisa sat at Stanford's kitchen table and watched. She saw neighbors from the reservation and visitors from as far away as Holland bump up the dirt road to his battered modular home, seeking guidance and healing for what had broken in their lives. She followed him into the sweat lodge -- a framework of willow limbs covered with quilts -- where he used prayer and heat to shrink tumors and soothe agitated souls. Standing on his sun-blasted porch, pit bulls padding past her, she felt the vibration from thundering bands of Arabian horses that Stanford's young nephews brought to the ring to train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she listened to his story. Stanford spent his teenage years busting broncs, seducing girls, and dealing drugs. At twenty, he left the house for another night of partying. By morning, a violent accident had robbed him of his physical prowess and left in its place unwelcome spiritual powers -- an exchange so shocking that Stanford spent several years trying to kill himself. But eventually he surrendered to his new life and mysterious gifts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the years Lisa was a frequent visitor to Stanford's place, the reservation and its people worked on her, exposing and healing the places where she, too, was broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broken&lt;/em&gt; entwines her story with Stanford's, exploring powerful spirits, material poverty, spiritual wealth, friendship, violence, confusion, death, and above all else,"a love that comes before and after and above and below romantic love."</description>

  <description>In this highly-anticipated new novel, Diana Gabaldon brings back one of her most compelling characters: the unforgettable Lord John Grey - soldier, gentleman, and no mean hand with a blade. Set in the heart of the eighteenth century, Lord John's world is one of mystery and menace. Diana Gabaldon brilliantly weaves together the strands of Lord John's secret and public lives. Capturing the lonely, tormented, and courageous career of a man who fights for his crown, his honor, and his own secrets, Diana Gabaldon delivers breathtaking human drama, proving once again that she can bring history to life in a way few novelists ever have.</description>

  <description>The illustrations for this series were created by Scott McKowen, who, with his wife Christina Poddubiuk, operates Punch &amp;amp; Judy Inc., a company specializing in design and illustration for theater and performing arts. Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scott created these drawings in scratchboard ­ an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in India, the unattractive and willful Mary Lennox has remained in the care of servants for as long as she can remember. But the girl’s life changes when her mother and father die and she travels to Yorkshire to live with her uncle. Dark, dreary Misselthwaite Manor seems full of mysteries, including a very special garden, locked tight for 10 years. With the help of Dickon, a local boy, Mary intends to uncover its secrets.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Eddie is a wounded war veteran, an old man who has lived, in his mind, an uninspired life. His job is fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, a tragic accident kills him as he tries to save a little girl from a falling cart. He awakes in the afterlife, where he learns that heaven is not a destination, but an answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In heaven, five people explain your life to you. Some you knew, others may have been strangers. One by one, from childhood to soldier to old age, Eddie's five people revisit their connections to him on earth, illuminating the mysteries of his "meaningless" life, and revealing the haunting secret behind the eternal question: "Why was I here?"</description>

  <description>"Every family is a ghost story . . ."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Albom mesmerized readers around the world with his number one &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers, &lt;em&gt;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tuesdays with Morrie&lt;/em&gt;. Now he returns with a beautiful, haunting novel about the family we love and the chances we miss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;For One More Day&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a mother and a son, and a relationship that covers a lifetime and beyond. It explores the question: What would you do if you could spend one more day with a lost loved one? &lt;p&gt;As a child, Charley "Chick" Benetto was told by his father, "You can be a mama's boy or a daddy's boy, but you can't be both." So he chooses his father, only to see the man disappear when Charley is on the verge of adolescence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decades later, Charley is a broken man. His life has been crumbled by alcohol and regret. He loses his job. He leaves his family. He hits bottom after discovering his only daughter has shut him out of her wedding. And he decides to take his own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He makes a midnight ride to his small hometown, with plans to do himself in. But upon failing even to do that, he staggers back to his old house, only to make an astonishing discovery. His mother�who died eight years earlier�is still living there, and welcomes him home as if nothing ever happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is the one "ordinary" day so many of us yearn for, a chance to make good with a lost parent, to explain the family secrets, and to seek forgiveness. Somewhere between this life and the next, Charley learns the astonishing things he never knew about his mother and her sacrifices. And he tries, with her tender guidance, to put the crumbled pieces of his life back together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through Albom's inspiring characters and masterful storytelling, readers will newly appreciate those whom they love�and may have thought they'd lost�in their own lives. &lt;em&gt;For One More Day&lt;/em&gt; is a book for anyone in a family, and will be cherished by Albom's millions of fans worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The extraordinary author of &lt;em&gt;Cold Mountain &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Moons&lt;/em&gt; returns with a dazzling new novel of suspense and love set in small-town North Carolina in the early 1960s.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charles Frazier puts his remarkable gifts in the service of a lean, taut narrative while losing none of the transcendent prose, virtuosic storytelling, and insight into human nature that have made him one of the most beloved and celebrated authors in the world. Now, with his brilliant portrait of Luce, a young woman who inherits her murdered sister’s troubled twins, Frazier has created his most memorable heroine. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Before the children, Luce was content with the reimbursements of the rich Appalachian landscape, choosing to live apart from the small community around her. But the coming of the children changes everything, cracking open her solitary life in difficult, hopeful, dangerous ways. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Charles Frazier is known for his historical literary odysseys, and for making figures in the past come vividly to life. Set in the twentieth century, &lt;em&gt;Nightwoods&lt;/em&gt; resonates with the timelessness of a great work of art.</description>

  <description>One New Year’s Day, Noelle Oxenhandler took stock of her life and found that she was alone after a long marriage, seemingly doomed to perpetual house rental and separated from the spiritual community that once had sustained her. With little left to lose, she launched a year’s experiment in desire, forcing herself to take the plunge and try the path of Putting It Out There. It wasn’t easy. A skeptic at heart, and a practicing Buddhist as well, Oxenhandler had grown up with a strong aversion to mixing spiritual and earthly matters. Still, she suspended her doubts and went for it all: a new love, a healed soul, and the 2RBD/1.5 BA of her dreams. Thus began her initiation into the art of wishing brazenly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this charming, compelling, and ultimately joyful book, Oxenhandler records a journey that is at once comic and poignant, light and dark, earthy and spiritual. Along the way she wonders: Does wishing have power? Is there danger in wishing? Are some wishes more worthy than others? And what about the ancient link between suffering and desire? To answer her questions, she delves into the history of wishing, from the rain dance and deer song of primeval magic to modern beliefs about mind over matter, prosperity consciousness, and the law of attraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the months go by, Oxenhandler is humbled to discover the courage it takes to make a wish and thus open oneself to the unknown. She is surprised when her experiment expands to include other people and other places in ways she never imagined. But most of all, she is amazed to find that there is, indeed, both power and danger in the act of wishing. For soon her wishes begin to come true–in ways that meet, subvert, and overflow her expectations. And what started as a year’s dare turns into a way of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A delightfully candid memoir, unfettered, poetic, and ripe with discovery, Oxenhandler’s journey into the art and soul of wishing will inspire even the most skeptical reader to search the skies for the next shooting star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for THE WISHING YEAR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is a wonderful book, full of wisdom gleaned from a year of Noelle Oxenhandler's daring to embrace what she had previously denied herself--her own personal wishes.  I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;The Wishing Year &lt;/em&gt;for anyone wanting to learn more about what life has to offer when we pay attention to our heart's desires." &lt;br&gt;–&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Susanka, author of &lt;em&gt;The Not So Big Life&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Do you want to know how wishes come true? Then read &lt;em&gt;The Wishing Year&lt;/em&gt;.  It's a book that beautifully illuminates the art and mystery of wishing--and it does so in a way that is inspiring, funny, serious, honest, heartfelt, and irresistibly readable."&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;–Jack Kornfield, author of &lt;em&gt;After the Ecstasy, the Laundry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The Wishing Year&lt;/em&gt; is an elegant exploration of the way thought shapes reality.  Writing with great personal honesty and candor, Noelle Oxenhandler's exhilarating prose takes us deep into the pain and glory of being human." &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;–Mark Epstein, M.D., author of &lt;em&gt;Open to Desire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Oxenhandler's new book makes it okay to be a smart, sophisticated grow-up who also believes in magic.  She dives beneath the new age veneer and deconstructs how wishes really come true.”                   &lt;strong&gt;–Susan Piver, author of &lt;em&gt;How Not to Be Afraid of Your Own Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Just when you thought doomsday was over...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centuries ago Acheron saved the human race by imprisoning an ancient evil bent on absolute destruction. Now that evil has been unleashed and it is out for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the twin to Acheron, Styxx hasn’t always been on his brother’s side. They’ve spent more centuries going at each other’s throats than protecting their backs. Now Styxx has a chance to prove his loyalty to his brother, but only if he’s willing to trade his life and future for Acheron’s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Atlantean goddess of Wrath and Misery, Bethany was born to right wrongs. But it was never a task she relished. Until now. She owes Acheron a debt that she vows to repay, no matter what it takes. He will join their fellow gods in hell and nothing is going to stop her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things are never what they seem, and Acheron is no longer the last of his line. Styxx and Acheron must put aside their past and learn to trust each other or more will suffer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet it’s hard to risk your own life for someone who once tried to take yours, even when it's your own twin, and when loyalties are skewed and no one can be trusted, not even yourself, how do you find a way back from the darkness that wants to consume the entire world? One that wants to start by devouring your very soul?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/styxx/SherrilynKenyon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/styxx/Sherril...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>A stunning successor to his best selling novel &lt;em&gt;Peace Like a River&lt;/em&gt;, Leif Enger’s new work is a rugged and nimble story about an aging train robber on a quest to reconcile the claims of love and judgment on his life, and the failed writer who goes with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1915 Minnesota, novelist Monte Becket has lost his sense of purpose. His only success long behind him, Monte lives simply with his wife and son. But when he befriends outlaw Glendon Hale, a new world of opportunity and experience presents itself. Glendon has spent years in obscurity, but the guilt he harbors for abandoning his wife, Blue, over two decades ago, has lured him from hiding. As the modern age marches swiftly forward, Glendon aims to travel back to his past--heading to California to seek Blue’s forgiveness. Beguiled and inspired, Monte soon finds himself leaving behind his own family to embark for the unruly West with his fugitive guide. As they desperately flee from the relentless Charles Siringo, an ex-Pinkerton who’s been hunting Glendon for years, Monte falls ever further from his family and the law, to be tempered by a fiery adventure from which he may never get home.</description>

  <description>Leif Enger's rhapsodic novel about a father raising his three children in 1960s Minnesota is a breathtaking celebration of family, faith, and America's pioneering spirit. Through the voice of eleven-year-old Reuben, an asthmatic boy obsessed with cowboy stories, Peace Like a River tells of the Land family's cross-country search for Reuben's outlaw older brother, who has been controversially charged with murder. Sprinkled with playful and warmhearted nods to biblical tales, classic American novels such as Huckleberry Finn, the adventure stories of Robert Louis Stevenson, and the Westerns of Zane Grey, Peace Like a River brilliantly incorporates the best elements of all these genres and ultimately earns its own prominent and enduring place on the shelf among them. Reuben Land was born with no air in his lungs, and it was only when his father, Jeremiah, picked him up and commanded him to breathe that his lungs filled. Reuben struggles with debilitating asthma thenceforth, but he is a boy who knows firsthand that life is a gift, and also one who suspects that his father can overturn the laws of nature. When Reuben's older brother, Davy, kills two marauders who have come to harm the family, the town is divided between those who see him as a hero and those who see him as a cold-blooded murderer. On the morning of the trial, Davy escapes from his cell, and when his family finds out they decide to go forth into the unknown in search of him. With Jeremiah -- whose faith is the stuff of legend -- at the helm, the family covers territory far more glorious than even the Badlands, where they search for Davy from their Airstream trailer. By the time the journey is over, they will have traversed boundaries of a different nature entirely. Marked by a soul-expanding sense of place and a love of storytelling, Peace Like a River is at once a heroic quest, a tragedy, a romance, and a heartfelt meditation on the possibility of magic in the everyday world.</description>

  <description>Polymer clay has grown and grown and grown in popularity since the publication of Donna Kato's best-selling&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Polymer Clay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in 1997. And there have been so many technical advances, too. Now poly-diva Donna Kato presents an all-new look at one of crafters' all-time favorite mediums. &lt;em&gt;The Art Of Polymer Clay Surface Effects&lt;/em&gt; begins with the essentials of polymer clay, including its working properties, plus tools, curing, safety recommendations, and color blending (with full information on the now-indispensable Skinner Blend). Photo-packed chapters focus on exciting projects—beads, bracelets, pins, pendants, and boxes–and showcase new techniques, including image transfers, surface treatments such as stencils, stamps, paints, and inks, sculpting, inclusions, special effects, and finishing. Finished pieces by some of the biggest names in polymer clay, including Kathleen Dustin, Pier Voulkos, and Nan Roche, plus Donna Kato herself, offer ideas and inspiration.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;With more than 300,000 copies sold, Chuck Palahniuk's brilliant first novel and cult classic is being reissued with a new Introduction by the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An underground classic since its first publication in 1996, &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt; is widely recognized as one of the most original and provocative novels of the last decade. Now the author adds his own voice to the critical debate he generated. In a new Introduction, he discusses the various interpretations in the popular media of &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt; and the movie it inspired, as well as his personal reactions to the work's reception and the influence that the &lt;em&gt;Fight Club &lt;/em&gt;phenomenon has already had on our culture. &lt;br&gt;Chuck Palahniuk's darkly funny first novel tells the story of a disenfranchised young man frustrated with his bureacratic job and superficial relationships and disillusioned with the consumer culture's prepackaged pleasures. Relief for him and his peers comes in the form of Tyler Durden, the intensely charismatic inventor of Fight Club. Waiters, clerks, and middlemen seek out the visceral satisfaction of secret after-hours boxing matches in the basements of bars, thinking they have found a way to live beyond their confining and stultifying lives. But in Tyler's world there are no rules, no limits, no brakes.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Now available for the first time in trade paperback, the bestselling account of America's worst naval disaster--and of the heroism of the men who, against all odds, survived&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On July 30, 1945, the &lt;em&gt;USS Indianapolis&lt;/em&gt; was torpedoed in the South Pacific by a Japanese submarine. An estimated three hundred men were killed upon impact; close to nine hundred sailors were cast into the Pacific Ocean, where they struggled to stay alive, battered by a savage sea and fighting off sharks, hypothermia, and dementia. By the time help arrived--nearly four days and nights later--all but 317 men had died. How did the navy fail to realize the Indianapolis was missing? Why was the cruiser traveling unescorted in enemy waters? And how did these 317 men manage to survive? Interweaving the stories of three survivors--the captain, the ship's doctor, and a young marine--journalist Doug Stanton has brought this astonishing human drama to life in a narrative that is at once immediate and timeless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The definitive account of this harrowing chapter of World War II history--already a bestseller in its hardcover and mass market editions--&lt;em&gt;In Harm's Way&lt;/em&gt; is a classic tale of war, survival, and extraordinary courage.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Featuring a new preface by the author on how parents can make a difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With author appearances on Good Morning America, The Today Show, 20 /20 and NPR's Fresh Air, and featuring articles in Newsweek, Time, and The New York Times, Real Boys is one of the most talked-about and influential books published this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on William Pollack's groundbreaking research at Harvard Medical School over two decades, Real Boys explores why many boys are sad, lonely, and confused although they may appear tough, cheerful, and confident. Pollack challenges conventional expectations about manhood and masculinity that encourage parents to treat boys as little men, raising them through a toughening process that drives their true emotions underground. Only when we understand what boys are really like, says Pollack, can we help them develop more self-confidence and the emotional savvy they need to deal with issues such as depression, love and sexuality, drugs and alcohol, divorce, and violence.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>Lucy is seventeen when she discovers that she is the latest recipient of a generations-old family curse that requires her to complete three seemingly impossible tasks or risk falling into madness and passing the curse on to the next generation. Unlike her ancestors, though, Lucy has family, friends, and other modern resources to help her out. But will it be enough to conquer this age-old evil? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautifully wrought modern fairy tale from master storyteller and award-winning author Nancy Werlin. Inspired by the classic folk ballad "Scarborough Fair," this is a wonderfully riveting and haunting novel of suspense, romance, and fantasy.</description>

  <description>Big Bad Gator Claude will do anything to have a taste of Petite Rouge...even if it means putting on a duck bill, flippers, and frilly underwear. He presents no match for the spunky heroine and her quick-thinking cat TeJean, though, as they use some strong Cajun hot sauce to teach Claude a lesson he will never forget! The combination of hilarious rhyme and exaggerated art creates a highly original retelling of the classic fairy tale. A pronunciation guide/glossary accompanies a tempting dialect that begs to be read aloud or acted out again and again. This is Little Red Riding Hood as she's never been seen before: Cajun&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt; ducky.</description>

  <description>The hero of Charles Frazier's first novel is Inman, a disillusioned Confederate  soldier who has failed to die as expected after being seriously wounded in battle during the last days of the Civil War. Rather than waiting to be redeployed to the front, the soul-sick Inman deserts, and embarks on a dangerous and lonely odyssey through the devastated  South, heading home to North Carolina and seeking only to be reunited with his beloved, Ada, who has herself been struggling to maintain the  family farm she inherited. &lt;em&gt;Cold Mountain&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply-imagined addition to the literature of one of the most transformational periods in American history.</description>

  <description>The Dursleys were so mean and hideous that summer that all Harry Potter wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he's packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange, impish creature named Dobby who says that if Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And strike it does. For in Harry's second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor, Gilderoy Lockheart, a spirit named Moaning Myrtle who haunts the girl's bathroom, and the unwanted attentions of Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But each of these seem minor annoyances when the real trouble beings, and someone--or something--starts turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects...Harry Potter himself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Are You Being Gaslighted?&lt;br&gt;Check for these telltale signs: &lt;br&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;You constantly second-guess yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;You wonder, “Am I being too sensitive?” a dozen times a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. &lt;/strong&gt;You wonder frequently if you are a “good enough” girlfriend/wife/employee/friend/daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. &lt;/strong&gt;You have trouble making simple decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;/strong&gt;You think twice before bringing up innocent topics of conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;/strong&gt;You frequently make excuses for your partner’s behavior to friends and family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;. Before your partner comes home from work, you run through a checklist in your head to anticipate anything you might have done wrong that day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. &lt;/strong&gt;You buy clothes for yourself, furnishings for your apartment, or other personal purchases thinking about what your partner would like instead of what would make you feel great. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. &lt;/strong&gt;You actually start to enjoy the constant criticism, because you think, “What doesn’t kill me will make me stronger.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. &lt;/strong&gt;You start speaking to your husband through his secretary so you don’t have to tell him things you’re afraid might upset him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. &lt;/strong&gt;You start lying to avoid the put-downs and reality twists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. &lt;/strong&gt;You feel as though you can’t do anything right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. &lt;/strong&gt;You frequently wonder if you’re good enough for your lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. &lt;/strong&gt;Your kids start trying to protect you from being humiliated by your partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. &lt;/strong&gt;You feel hopeless and joyless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your husband crosses the line in his flirtations with another woman at a dinner party. When you confront him, he asks you to stop being insecure and controlling. After a long argument, you apologize for giving him a hard time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your boss backed you on a project when you met privately in his office, and you went full steam ahead. But at a large gathering of staff—including yours—he suddenly changes his tune and publicly criticizes your poor judgment. When you tell him your concerns for how this will affect your authority, he tells you that the project was ill-conceived and you’ll have to be more careful in the future. You begin to question your competence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your mother belittles your clothes, your job, your friends, and your boyfriend. But instead of fighting back as your friends encourage you to do, you tell them that your mother is often right and that a mature person should be able to take a little criticism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you think things like this can’t happen to you, think again. Gaslighting is when someone wants you to do what you know you shouldn’t and to believe the unbelieveable. It can happen to you and it probably already has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do we know? If you consider answering “yes” to even one of the following questions, you’ve probably been gaslighted:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Does your opinion of yourself change according to approval or disapproval from your spouse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your boss praises you, do you feel as if you could conquer the world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Do you dread having small things go wrong at home—buying the wrong brand of toothpaste, not having dinner ready on time, a mistaken appointment written on the calendar? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaslighting is an insidious form of emotional abuse and manipulation that is difficult to recognize and even harder to break free from. That’s because it plays into one of our worst fears—of being abandoned—and many of our deepest needs: to be understood, appreciated, and loved. In this groundbreaking guide, the prominent therapist Dr. Robin Stern shows how the Gaslight Effect works and tells you how to:&lt;br&gt;Turn up your Gaslight Radar, so you know when a relationship is headed for trouble&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determine whether you are enabling a gaslighter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognize the Three Stages of Gaslighting: Disbelief, Defense, and Depression&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refuse to be gaslighted by using the Five Rules for Turning Off the Gas &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Develop your own “Gaslight Barometer” so you can decide which relationships can be saved—and which you have to walk away from &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn how to Gasproof Your Life so that you’ll never again choose another gaslighting relationship</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you really ready to change? Take this quiz and find out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every New Year’s Day, my list of resolutions is: &lt;br&gt;Ambitious. I aim for everything from losing weight to saving more money for my retirement. &lt;br&gt;Realistic. I just try to bump my good behavior up a notch--be a better friend, give more money to charity---without giving myself any strict deadlines or goals.&lt;br&gt;Precise. I decide exactly how many men I will ask for a date, or how many new jobs I will apply for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever I decide to change something, it’s usually because:&lt;br&gt;My doctor has put the fear of God into me.&lt;br&gt;I read a magazine article about why making this change is important.&lt;br&gt;I start daydreaming about how great life will be after I make the change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True or False: When you want to make a big change in your life, timing is crucial.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Failure is:&lt;br&gt;Impossible.&lt;br&gt;Inevitable. &lt;br&gt;Not in my vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The answers are on the inside back flap.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn the secret to making changes that stick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every so often people get inspired (again!) to lose weight, get organized, start saving, or stop worrying –but a few months later they give up, frustrated. It doesn’t have to be that way. In &lt;em&gt;This Year I Wil . . .l, &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author M.J. Ryan offers breakthrough wisdom and coaching to help readers make &lt;em&gt;this time&lt;/em&gt; the time that change becomes permanent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do people find it so hard to change? The secret is that everyone has their own formula for making changes that stick, but most people don’t know what theirs is. They think there is one way to lose five pounds, and another way to stay on top of their e-mail, but they don’t realize that for all changes, there is one system that works best for each individual. &lt;em&gt;This Year I Will&lt;/em&gt; . . . helps you lock on to your unique formula for planning, implementing, and seeing a life change through, so you can use it again and again to tackle anything else you’d like to do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For anyone who has broken a New Year’s resolution, fallen off a diet, or given up on fulfilling a dream, the ingenious strategies, inspiring stories, and sheer motivational energy of &lt;em&gt;This Year I Will . . .  &lt;/em&gt;help you make a promise to yourself that you can actually keep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answers to the jacket quiz: c, c, false, b.

  <description>It’s been ten years since Mitch Albom first shared the wisdom of Morrie Schwartz with the world. Now–twelve million copies later–in a new afterword, Mitch Albom reflects again on the meaning of Morrie’s life lessons and the gentle, irrevocable impact of their Tuesday sessions all those years ago. . . &lt;br&gt;_____&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final “class”: lessons in how to live.</description>

  <description>A millennia-old prophecy was given when the Forbidden Ones were driven from Achar. And now, the Acharites witness its manifestation: Achar is under attack by an evil lord from the North, Gorgreal-his ice demons strike from the sky and kill hundreds of brave warriors in the blink of an eye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Acharites believe the end is near.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One young woman, Faraday, betrothed of Duke Borneheld, learns that all she has been told about her people's history is untrue. While fleeing to safety from the dangerous land, Faraday, rides with Axis, legendary leader of the Axe-Wielders-and hated half-brother of Borneheld-and a man Faraday secretly loves although it would be death to admit it. She embarks on a journey, which will change her life forever, in search of the true nature of her people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This grand and heroic story tells the tale of one woman's plight to learn the truth of her people and change their hearts and their minds forever. She fights against oppressive forces to share this reality and will not desist until everyone knows. . . . . The truth of the Star Gate&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Axis is the StarMan of prophecy and legend, destined to lead the three races of his world to unite as one people. The people of his world all know the Prophecy of the Destroyer, despite the failed attempts of the Seneschal to suppress it in the name of the god Artor the Ploughman, and it predicts and dictates Axis's path through war and destruction to the creation of Tencendor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Prophecy foretold that Axis would defeat his half-brother and lay claim to the land that Tencendor will be created upon. The Prophecy told of the traitor in Axis's camp-Faraday's champion, Timozel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the Prophecy foretold many a choice that Axis must make in order to fulfill his destiny . . . but neglected to mention the choice between the beautiful and courageous Faraday, his late half-brother's wife, and the feisty and hauntingly enchanting Azhure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Faraday, he had pledged his love and a place by his side as ruler of Tencendor; to Azhure, he had given his children, his time, and his devotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His love for both women is what the last twist of the Prophecy relies on. While Azhure explores her newfound powers as an Icarii Enchantress, and Faraday replants the ancient forests of the Mother, the evil Gorgrael is plotting Axis's downfall, invading the sky with ice and terror and the flesh-hungry Gryphons. His most daring move is to follow prophecy, to taunt Axis with the pain of his beloved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But which beloved woman will Gorgrael choose . . . and will she be the one whose death will distract Axis from saving the world?&lt;br&gt;

  <description>For countless millennia the Star Dance and the TimeKeeper Demons have battled their way across the universe, destroying innumerable planets, laying waste to civilizations across the cosmos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choosing the land of Tencendor as their last battleground, the demons break through the Star Gate. The Gate destroyed, all magic in the world is gone and the three races of Tencendor are plunged into a vortex of chaos, madness, and death. &lt;br&gt;Caelum SunSoar, son of the near-immortal Starman Axis and beloved ruler of all the land's peoples, is dead. Leaderless, those not killed outright or driven mad flee to the one place left to them, Sanctuary, a magical place created ages past to shield all who are good from the wrath of the demons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;There is for some one hope left: DragonStar, Axis's other son. Many believe he is the true StarSon, the only being that can save their world. Others are just as convinced that he is in league with the demons and will be their doom. Only DragonStar knows the truth and as he and his companions go forth to do battle he prays that he may convince all that his motives are pure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he does not know is that there is a traitor who plans to hand Sanctuary over to the Demons. A betrayer whose actions could force DragonStar to make a sacrifice so bloody and horrific that it could mean the destruction of everything that he holds dear in this life or the next. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And if he fails, he could doom Tecendor to an eternal hell.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Explore (if you dare) the true history of the Fallen Ones — and follow the fate of a 1920s investigator lured by a beauty with violet eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before the term vampire was born, long before Bram Stoker fictionalized this being’s ways, blood-drinking demons were banished to Earth by Michael’s host of Angels, or so the Bible describes. Now this rich, mesmerizing resource, written in 1900, sheds light on what happened hence to the three vampire bloodlines — especially the tortured souls known as the Belial. Interspersed are booklets, flaps, and letters between a young paranormal researcher who discovered the book in the 1920s and an oddly alluring woman who seeks his help. Among the phenomena explored are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* vampires’ genealogical origins, attributes, and range&lt;br&gt;* myths about the making of vampires&lt;br&gt;* secrets of vampires’ powers and shape-shifting skills&lt;br&gt;* tips for spotting vampires, protecting oneself, and fighting back&lt;br&gt;* case studies of famous vampires — and vampire hunters — through history&lt;br&gt;* a shocking overview of vampires "living" among us&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Arrogance and innocence, hubris and hope--twenty-four haunting voices of the Titanic tragedy, as well as the iceberg itself, are evoked in a stunning tour de force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millionaire John Jacob Astor hopes to bring home his pregnant teen bride with a minimum of media scandal. A beautiful Lebanese refugee, on her way to family in Florida, discovers the first stirrings of love. And an ancient iceberg glides south, anticipating its fateful encounter. The voices in this remarkable re-creation of the Titanic disaster span classes and stations, from Margaret ("the unsinkable Molly") Brown to the captain who went down with his ship; from the lookout and wireless men to a young boy in search of dragons and a gambler in search of marks. Slipping in telegraphs, undertaker’s reports, and other records, poet Allan Wolf offers a breathtaking, intimate glimpse at the lives behind the tragedy, told with clear-eyed compassion and astounding emotional power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extensive back matter includes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author’s note&lt;br&gt;Morse code with messages to decipher&lt;br&gt;Titanic miscellany&lt;br&gt;Bibliography, articles, periodicals, government documents, discography</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For true believers only, a lavishly illustrated reproduction of a legendary volume by the world’s most distinguished dragonologist. Don’t let it fall into the wrong hands!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you believe in dragons? Now, for the first time, the long-lost research of renowned nineteenth century dragonologist Dr. Ernest Drake is presented in all its eccentric glory, happily bridging the gap between dragon legend and fact. The meticulous Dr. Drake assigns Latin names to various dragon species, ruminates on why dragons are able to speak, speculates on how they could fly, and explains the true purpose of their notorious hoarding habits. Here are just a few of DRAGONOLOGY'S fascinating features:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; — Novelty item on every spread, including tactile samples of dragon wings, dragon scales, and dragon skin&lt;br&gt; — Booklet of dragon riddles (indispensable to the burgeoning dragonologist)&lt;br&gt; — Sealed envelope containing a powerful dragon-calling spell&lt;br&gt; — Embossed faux leather cover with silver foil, encrusted with three dragon gems&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his afterword, Dr. Drake reveals that one of the crucial goals of dragonologists is to preserve the magnificent creatures of their study wherever possible - a goal this tongue-in-cheek volume most affectionately achieves. An incomparable gift for secret dragonologists everywhere!</description>

  <description>Take Your First Step Toward True Evolution&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever wonder why you repeat the same negative thoughts in your head? Why you keep coming back for more from hurtful family members, friends, or significant others? Why you keep falling into the same detrimental habits or limiting attitudes--even when you know that they are going to make you feel bad?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Joe Dispenza has spent decades studying the human mind--how it works, how it stores information, and why it perpetuates the same behavioral patterns over and over. In the acclaimed film What the Bleep Do We Know!? he began to explain how the brain evolves--by learning new skills, developing the ability to concentrate in the midst of chaos, and even healing the body and the psyche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evolve Your Brain presents this information in depth, while helping you take control of your mind, explaining how thoughts can create chemical reactions that keep you addicted to patterns and feelings--including ones that make you unhappy. And when you know how these bad habits are created, it's possible to not only break these patterns, but also reprogram and evolve your brain, so that new, positive, and beneficial habits can take over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is something you can start to do right now. You and only you have the power to change your mind and evolve your brain for a better life--for good.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;*SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STARRING REESE WITHERSPOON AND COLIN FIRTH *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The West Memphis Three. Accused, convicted&amp;amp;#8230;and set free. Do you know their story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2011, one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in American legal history was set right when Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley were released after eighteen years in prison. Award-winning journalist Mara Leveritt&amp;amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Devil&amp;amp;#8217;s Knot&lt;/em&gt; remains the most comprehensive, insightful reporting ever done on the investigation, trials, and convictions of three teenage boys who became known as the West Memphis Three.&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For weeks in 1993, after the murders of three eight-year-old boys, police in West Memphis, Arkansas seemed stymied. Then suddenly, detectives charged three teenagers&amp;amp;#8212;alleged members of a satanic cult&amp;amp;#8212;with the killings. Despite the witch-hunt atmosphere of the trials, and a case which included stunning investigative blunders, a confession riddled with errors, and an absence of physical evidence linking any of the accused to the crime, the teenagers were convicted. Jurors sentenced Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley to life in prison and Damien Echols, the accused ringleader, to death. The guilty verdicts were popular in their home state&amp;amp;#8212;even upheld on appeal&amp;amp;#8212;and all three remained in prison until their unprecedented release in August 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With close-up views of its key participants, this award-winning account unravels the many tangled knots of this endlessly shocking case, one which will shape the American legal landscape for years to come.</description>

  <description>Don't miss the classic tale from King of Horror and #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King, described by Publishers Weekly as "the most frightening novel Stephen King has ever written."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Creeds move into a beautiful old house in rural Maine, it all seems too good to be true: physician father, beautiful wife, charming little daughter, adorable infant son—and now an idyllic home. As a family, they've got it all...right down to the friendly car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the nearby woods hide a blood-chilling truth—more terrifying than death itself—and hideously more powerful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Creeds are going to learn that sometimes dead is better.</description>

  <description>Biographer Margaret Lea returns one night to her apartment above her father’s antiquarian bookshop. On her steps she finds a letter. It is a hand-written request from one of Britain’s most prolific and well-loved novelists. Vida Winter, gravely ill, wants to recount her life story before it is too late, and she wants Margaret to be the one to capture her history. The request takes Margaret by surprise — she doesn’t know the author, nor has she read any of Miss Winter’s dozens of novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late one night while pondering whether to accept the task of recording Miss Winter’s personal story, Margaret begins to read her father’s rare copy of Miss Winter’s &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Tales of Change and Desperation&lt;/em&gt;. She is spellbound by the stories and confused when she realizes the book only contains twelve stories. Where is the thirteenth tale? Intrigued, Margaret agrees to meet Miss Winter and act as her biographer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Vida Winter unfolds her story, she shares with Margaret the dark family secrets that she has long kept hidden as she remembers her days at Angelfield, the now burnt-out estate that was her childhood home. Margaret carefully records Miss Winter’s account and finds herself more and more deeply immersed in the strange and troubling story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both women will have to confront their pasts and the weight of family secrets... and the ghosts that haunt them still.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt; is a remarkable memoir of resilience and redemption, and a revelatory look into a family at once deeply dysfunctional and uniquely vibrant. When sober, Jeannette's brilliant and charismatic father captured his children's imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and how to embrace life fearlessly. But when he drank, he was dishonest and destructive. Her mother was a free spirit who abhorred the idea of domesticity and didn't want the responsibility of raising a family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Walls children learned to take care of themselves. They fed, clothed, and protected one another, and eventually found their way to New York. Their parents followed them, choosing to be homeless even as their children prospered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt; is truly astonishing--a memoir permeated by the intense love of a peculiar but loyal family.</description>

  <description>Art is a tool for living, a spiritual calling that all of us must eventually answer. Just as athletes aren't the only ones who need exercise, artists aren't the only ones who need creativity. All of us must exercise creativity on a regular basis to keep our spirit and joy from being diminished. In this age of remote controls, convenience food, and prepackaged everything, our souls are crying out for the spiritual replenishment only offered through a creative practice. Art and Soul takes readers on a year-long journey into their creative souls, offering a map for finding and expressing the art that dwells there. It encourages readers to recapture their authentic self that many abandoned long ago with their Crayola crayons. Even those who swear they can't paint, write, compose, or build can express creativity in everyday activities that revitalize and nourish their spiritual well-being. Art and Soul is divided into 52 weekly chapters, each containing an inspirational message; a creative assignment, and three or four suggestions for fun projects that encourage us to stretch our creative wings. Here are just a few: Go to a thrift store and buy the most outrageous outfit you can.Learn three little-known facts about Martin Luther King Jr..Make sugar cookies shaped like body parts. Come up with the title of your own autobiography.The ideas range from the practical to the ridiculous, but all are easy and fun to complete. This book will show readers that they don't need fancy art supplies or lessons to be creative, and that getting in touch with our creative selves is just as easy as do-re-me. Finally, the perfect book for women who have had it with feeling like the dynamic pulse of life hasfaded and who are looking to recharge their existence. The draining stress and hubbub of the modern world can sometimes make a woman feel like she's just a shell of the fun-loving, vivacious person she once was. To solve this common problem, author Amy Hall presents Getting Your Groove Back, a sassy and hip collection of tips and exercises for women who are eager to reinvigorate life by recapturing their lost but innate Grooviness-the spunk and special aura that used to set them apart from the crowd. This book covers everything a woman needs to know in order to get her career, relationships, and sense of self back on track by standing up to the evil forces of numbness and mediocrity that have taken root! Hall dishes out tough love, provoking insights and advice with a biting humor that just doesn't stop. At the office . . . A tried-but-true confidence builder moves from the bedroom to the office place. Wear really sexy underwear not only on third dates, but also to any dreaded presentation you must give.In relationships . . . Save the money you set aside for the obligatory birthday gift for the friend with whom you are no longer close. Spend it on yourself instead. Go buy a decadent box of chocolate-dipped strawberries from those fine Godiva folks and scarf them under a tree, celebrating your ability to sever the old and seek out the new. That relationship had a place in your past, and guess what, we call it the past for a reason-move on. Besides, the hussy never returned that favorite belt of yours she borrowed; hence, it's time to trot toward evolution.Within the inner self . . . Stop beating yourself up because you're not what you said you'd become when you were a little girl. Okay,so you didn't get an Olympic gold medal or become an ambassador to the UN. It's true our lives don't always deal us the cards we need to get the grandiose life, but get real, you're a born couch potato and you detest politics. Why should you feel guilty any longer for not doing something that doesn't fit your personality anyway? There's nothing wrong with not being a famous athlete or political figure. There's lots of us out here, and we're okay people. Join us. Love us. Become one with us.Getting Your Groove Back is the ultimate book for those who are tired of fluff and want fun self-help with an attitude!</description>

  <description>Valerius isn't a popular Dark-Hunter-he's a Roman, which means that the largely Greek Hunters have a major grudge against him and his civilization for superceding them. To make things worse, he's very conscious of his aristocratic background and breeding. So it serves him right when he runs into Tabitha Devereaux. She's sassy, sexy, and completely unwilling to take him seriously. (Not to mention that she's the twin sister of the wife of former Dark-Hunter Kyrian-Val's mortal enemy.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Tabitha does take seriously is hunting and killing vampires-and soon she and Val have to grapple with the deadliest of all Daimons-one who's managed to come back from the dead, and one who holds a serious grudge against both of them. To win against evil, Val will have to loosen up, learn to trust, and put everything on the line to protect a man he hates and a woman who drives him nuts.</description>

  <description>Harvard professor Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call while on business in Paris: the elderly curator of the Louvre, Jacques Sauniere, has been brutally murdered inside the museum. Alongside the body, police have found a series of baffling codes. As Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, begin to sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Leonardo Da Vinci - and suggests the answer to a mystery that stretches deep into the vault of history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Langdon suspects the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion - a centuries old secret society - and has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory's most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic hidden for centuries. But it now appears that Opus Dei, a clandestine sect that has long plotted to seize the Prirory's secret, has now made its move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, the Priory's secret - and a stunning historical truth - will be lost forever...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Breaking the mould of traditional suspense novels, The Da Vinci Code is simultaneously lightning-paced, intelligent and intricately layered with remarkable research and detail. And in this exclusive edition Dan Brown allows the reader behind the scenes of the novel which now incorporates over 150 photographs and illustrations throughout the text showing the rich historical tapestry from which he drew his inspiration. The visual sources which provide both the backdrop and the stimulus for the novel's action are revealed for the first time and uniquely complement the reading experience.</description>

Fortunately, she encounters the rats of NIMH, an extraordinary breed of highly intelligent creatures, who come up with a brilliant solution to her dilemma.</description>

  <description>From Kay Redfield Jamison--an international authority on manic-depressive illness, &amp;amp; one of the few women who are full professors of medicine at American Universities--a remarkable personal testimony: the revelation of her own struggle since adolescence with manic depression, &amp;amp; how it shaped her life.  With vivid prose &amp;amp; wit, she takes us into the fascinating &amp;amp; dangerous territory of this form of madness--a world in which one pole can be the alluring dark land ruled by what Byron called the "melancholy star of the imagination," &amp;amp; the other a desert of depression &amp;amp;, all too frequently, death.</description>

  <description>In 1967, after a session with a psychiatrist she'd never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital.  She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele -- Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles -- as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a "parallel universe" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. &lt;em&gt;Girl, Interrupted&lt;/em&gt; is a clear-sighted, unflinching document that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane, mental illness and recovery.</description>

  <description>Ssh . . . Listen to the woods. In this elegant edition, Victoria Wirth and Scott Banfill reveal for us the secret lives of woodland trees. Wirth's sparse, honest text narrates the eternal cycle of nature--birth, growth, death, and joyous rebirth--through the events that occur to a generation of trees. Beautifully detailed and passionately dramatic, Banfill's breathtaking paintings imbue the trees with character and personality. Full color.</description>

What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization--- the Illuminati. Desperate to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and mysterious scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on the earth... the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.</description>

  <description>What had happened to my beautiful boy? To our family?What did I do wrong? Those are the wrenching questions that haunted every moment of David Sheff ’s journey through his son Nic’s addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery. Before Nic Sheff became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy, joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets.David Sheff traces the first subtle warning signs: the denial, the 3 A.M. phone calls (is it Nic? the police? the hospital?), the rehabs.His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself, and the obsessive worry and stress took a tremendous toll. But as a journalist, he instinctively researched every avenue of treatment that might save his son and refused to give up on Nic.&lt;br&gt;Beautiful Boy is a fiercely candid memoir that brings immediacy to the emotional rollercoaster of loving a child who seems beyond help.</description>

  <description>'His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.' With these words "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" draws to a close. And here, in this seventh and final book, Harry discovers what fate truly has in store for him as he inexorably makes his way to that final meeting with Voldemort. In this thrilling climax to the phenomenally bestselling series, J.K. Rowling will reveal all to her eagerly waiting readers.</description>

  <description>Will Graham stands in a silent, empty house communing with a killer. An FBI instructor with a gift for hunting madmen, Graham knows what his murderer looks like, how he thinks, and what he did to his victims after they died. Now Graham must try to catch him. But to do it, he must feel the heat of a killer's brain, draw on the macabre advice of a dangerous mental patient, Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and follow a trail of microscopic clues to the place where another family has already been chosen to die--and where an innocent woman has found the Dragon first.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The delicious and erotically charged sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty&lt;/em&gt;, the first of Anne Rice's (writing as A.N. Roquelaure) elegantly written volumes of erotica, continues her explicit, teasing exploration of the psychology of human desire. Now Beauty, having indulged in a secret and forbidden infatuation with the rebellious slave Prince Tristan, is sent away from the Satyricon-like world of the Castle. Sold at auction, she will soon experience the tantalizing punishments of "the village," as her education in love, cruelty, dominance, submission, and tenderness is turned over to the brazenly handsome Captain of the Guard. And once again Rice's fabulous tale of pleasure and pain dares to explore the most primal and well-hidden desires of the human heart. Preceding the visceral eroticism of E.L. James’ &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; and Sylvia Day's &lt;em&gt;Bared to You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and even more haunting than her own novel &lt;em&gt;Belinda&lt;/em&gt;, this second installment is not to be missed.</description>

  <description>From bestselling author Anne Rice, writing as A.N. Roquleaure. In the traditional folktale of 'Sleeping Beauty,' the spell cast upon the lovely young princess and everyone in her castle can only be broken by the kiss of a Prince. It is an ancient story, one that originally emerged from and still deeply disturbs the mind's unconscious. Now Anne Rice's retelling of the Beauty story probes the unspoken implications of this lush, suggestive tale by exploring its undeniable connection to sexual desire. Here the Prince reawakens Beauty, not with a kiss, but with sexual initiation. His reward for ending the hundred years of enchantment is Beauty's complete and total enslavement to him as Anne Rice explores the world of erotic yearning and fantasy in a classic that becomes, with her skillful pen, a compelling experience.</description>

  <description>Now a modern classic, Animal Farm is a caustic and horrifying adult fairy tale. A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, the animals endeavor to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality and the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned. Animal Farm records the progression from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. Written more than fifty years ago, this is a timeless tale with a message equally as enduring.</description>

  <description>Anne Rice casts her lurid gaze upon the the traditional tale of "Sleeping Beauty" under the pen name of A.N. Roquelaure.  Her re-telling of the Beauty story probes the unspoken implications of this lush, suggestive tale by exploring its undeniable connection to sexual desire.  Reminiscent of the charged erotica of her novel Belinda.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Last Unicorn&lt;/em&gt; is one of the true classics of fantasy, ranking with Tolkien's &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt;, Le Guin's Earthsea Trilogy, and Lewis Carroll's &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Beagle writes a shimmering prose-poetry, the voice of fairy tales and childhood:&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The unicorn lived in a lilac wood, and she lived all alone. She was very old, though she did not know it, and she was no longer the careless color of sea foam but rather the color of snow falling on a moonlit night. But her eyes were still clear and unwearied, and she still moved like a shadow on the sea.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unicorn discovers that she is the last unicorn in the world, and sets off to find the others. She meets Schmendrick the Magician--whose magic seldom works, and never as he intended--when he rescues her from Mommy Fortuna's Midnight Carnival, where only some of the mythical beasts displayed are illusions. They are joined by Molly Grue, who believes in legends despite her experiences with a Robin Hood wannabe and his unmerry men. Ahead wait King Haggard and his Red Bull, who banished unicorns from the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is a book no fantasy reader should miss; Beagle argues brilliantly the need for magic in our lives and the folly of forgetting to dream. &lt;em&gt;--Nona Vero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Paul Sheldon. He's a bestselling novelist who has finally met his biggest fan. Her name is Annie Wilkes and she is more than a rabid reader—she is Paul's nurse, tending his shattered body after an automobile accident. But she is also his captor, keeping him prisoner in her isolated house. Now Annie wants Paul to write his greatest work—just for her. She has a lot of ways to spur him on. One is a needle. Another is an ax. And if they don't work, she can get really nasty...</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;"YOU'RE THE CARETAKER, SIR. YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE CARETAKER. I SHOULD KNOW, SIR. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN HERE...."&lt;p&gt; -- DELBERT GRADY OF THE OVERLOOK HOTEL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE SHINING&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First published in 1977, &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt; quickly became a benchmark in the literary career of Stephen King. This tale of a troubled man hired to care for a remote mountain resort over the winter, his loyal wife, and their uniquely gifted son slowly but steadily unfolds as secrets from the Overlook Hotel's past are revealed, and the hotel itself attempts to claim the very souls of the Torrence family. Adapted into a cinematic masterpiece of horror by legendary Stanley Kubrick -- featuring an unforgettable performance by a demonic Jack Nicholson -- &lt;em&gt;The Shining&lt;/em&gt; stands as a cultural icon of modern horror, a searing study of a family torn apart, and a nightmarish glimpse into the dark recesses of human weakness and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On January 15, 1947, the torture-ravished body of a beautiful young woman is found in a Los Angeles vacant lot. The victim makes headlines as the Black Dahlia-and so begins the greatest manhunt in California history.Caught up in the investigation are Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard: Warrants Squad cops, friends, and rivals in love with the same woman. But both are obsessed with the Dahlia-driven by dark needs to know everything about her past, to capture her killer, to possess the woman even in death. Their quest will take them on a hellish journey through the underbelly of postwar Hollywood, to the core of the dead girl's twisted life, past the extremes of their own psyches-into a region of total madness.</description>

  <description>For generations, treasure hunters have tried to unlock the deadly puzzle known as the Water Pit: a labyrinth of shafts and tunnels that honeycombs the heart of a small island off the coast of Maine. Reputed to be the hiding place of pirate treasure, the Water Pit possesses an inexplicable ability to kill those who venture into it, from professionals to innocent explorers. But now one man has made a startling discovery: The Water Pit is actually a carefully designed fortress, conceived for pirates by a renowned seventeenth-century architect who hid his plans in code. Unlocking the code will break the curse of the Water Pit. Or will it? The most comprehensive, high-tech expedition ever assembled has come to Maine and to Dr. Malin Hatch, owner of the island. While the treasure hunters have their reasons for mounting this assault--$2 billion in gold--Hatch has his own motives to join them. For Hatch, whose brother died on Ragged Island thirty years before, the only escape from the curse is through the black swirling waters and bloodstained chambers of the Pit. With more computing power than a small university, the recovery team slowly chips away at the mystery. But as the seekers try to conquer the Pit, men begin to die. Hatch is confronted with his childhood memories of the tragedy even as he is drawn into a complex relationship with a beautiful French diver. All the while, the last, secret chamber of the Pit waits to unleash the most lethal mystery of all. . . .A thriller of the highest order, Riptide is an extraordinary novel of obsession, courage, and adventure. With each nerve-racking page we are swept into the mystery and the challenge of Ragged Island and forced to face the haunting question: Is the Water Pit a gateway to limitless treasure--or to hell itself?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil, Gay Unicorns, and Jesus Christ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They're all tattooed on someone's ass. Or face, or whatever. Remember that time you were wasted and thought it would be a good idea to get a tattoo on your leg of Maury Povich shaking hands with Sasquatch, but your friends talked you out of it at the last second? Well, some people don't have any friends...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aviva Yael and P. M. Chen spent a year going to tattoo conventions and tattoo studios all over the country, chasing, stalking, e-mailing, calling, interviewing, ambushing, and hunting down whomever they could in order to find the most insane tattoos out there. What started out as a joke in a bar became a year-long tattoo safari that's presented here in all its full color, balls-to-the-wall, train-wreck/beauty-pageant glory.</description>

  <description>After the death of his half brother, Stefan, at the hands of Vlad Tsepesh--also known as Dracula--and after the destruction of his vampire father, Arkady, also at the hands of Vlad, Abraham van Helsing has traveled the world slaying many vampires. With every vampire he destroys, Bram becomes stronger and Vlad weaker, and soon Bram hopes he will be able to finally kill the fearsome vampire who has kept the Tsepesh family enslaved through a centuries-old blood ritual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a desperate Vlad and his vampire great-niece, Zsuzanna, summon help from the most powerful, brutal, and beautiful vampire of all--Countess Elizabeth of Bathory. Bram learns of their plot to destroy him, and makes his own move to strike out at Vlad before Vlad can put him to death. He teams up with a courageous band of humans as he hunts Vlad--including Mina Harker and John Seward--and they finally succeed in killing the head of the Tsepesh clan, just as Bram Stoker foretold in &lt;em&gt;Dracula.&lt;/em&gt; But the terror does not end with the death of Vlad, for there is another force that drives Vlad, Zsuzanna, Elizabeth and all the vampires, an ancient entity more evil than anything Bram has ever encountered: the Lord of the Vampires. And for Bram to defeat this dark lord, he must once again risk losing his very soul, to save not only his family, but humanity as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her final book in &lt;em&gt;The Diaries of the Family Dracul&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, Jeanne Kalogridis brilliantly melds her own fascinating story of the Tsepesh family with that of Bram Stoker's classic, &lt;em&gt;Dracula.&lt;/em&gt; Told in diary form like the first two books and Stoker's own chilling tale, LORD OF THE VAMPIRES reveals the dark, startling truths behind the original &lt;em&gt;Dracula.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It is Amsterdam, 1871, twenty-five years before the start of Stoker's novel, and twenty-five years following Arkady Tsepesh's flight from his family's ancestral castle with his wife and young son, Stefan, after learning that he and his family are bound by an ancient covenant to serve their ancestor, Prince Vlad Tsepesh, who is also known as Dracula. For Vlad is a vampire, and the fated firstborn sons in every generation must bring him the victims he needs to survive. Arkady had tried to break the covenant and failed. He is now a vampire, separated from his beloved wife and son, with one all-consuming desire - to destroy Vlad before he draws Stefan into eternal service through the blood ritual. But Arkady has come too late to Amsterdam. Vlad kidnaps Stefan, and spirits him away to the castle in Transylvania to undergo the blood ritual. Arkady enlists the help of Stefan's stepbrother, Abraham Van Helsing, in his thrilling battle against Vlad, as he seeks to free his family and put an end to the age-old blood covenant - even if it means he must destroy his own son.</description>

  <description>A sensual, terrifying, incredibly accomplished first novel, this fascinating prequel to the classic and most popular horror novel of all time, &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt;, focuses on Dracula's great-nephew, who inherits the job of managing his great-uncle's estate...and his appetite. Written in diary form as &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt; is, this compulsively readable book has revelations that will shock and delight readers of the original. More erotic than Anne Rice, Kalogridis is a major new voice in vampire fiction. The first chilling tale in an exciting new trilogy is a rich and terrifying historical novel set fifty years before the opening of Bram Stoker's &lt;em&gt;Dracula&lt;/em&gt;. At the castle of Prince Vlad Tsepesh, also known as Dracula, Vald's great-nephew Arkady is honored to care for his beloved though strange great-uncle...until he beings to realize what is expected of him in his new role. It seems that either he provides his great-uncle with unsuspecting victims to satisfy his needs, or Vlad will kill those Arkady loves. He is trapped into becoming party to murder and sadistic torture. And it is in his blood. When Arkady learns that his newborn son is being groomed one day to follow in his footsteps, he knows that he must fight Dracula, even if it means death.</description>

  <description>High Hopes-&lt;br&gt;House of Horrors&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville, New York - affectionately named "High Hopes" by its owners ... soon to become known to millions around the world as the site of the Amityville horror.&lt;br&gt;On the morning of November 13, 1974, six members of a prosperous Italian family would be found dead there, shot to death by a .35 caliber Marlin rifle. On that morning, Ronnie DeFeo, twenty-three, would get up, shave, shower, dress and go to work, apparently oblivious to the carnage behind him.&lt;br&gt;This is the story of waht happened in that house and the court case that followed - a model of investigation and prosecution to rival Helter Skelter ... a true story more chilling and macabre than any account of ghosts or hoauntings could ever be.</description>

  <description>The war against Voldemort is not going well; even Muggle governments are noticing. Ron scans the obituary pages of the &lt;em&gt;Daily Prophet&lt;/em&gt;, looking for familiar names. Dumbledore is absent from Hogwarts for long stretches of time, and the Order of the Phoenix has already suffered losses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet... &lt;br&gt;As in all wars, life goes on. Sixth-year students learn to Apparate — and lose a few eyebrows in the process. The Weasley twins expand their business. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Classes are never straightforward, though Harry receives some extraordinary help from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it's the home front that takes center stage in the multilayered sixth installment of the story of Harry Potter. Here are Hogwarts, Harry will search for the full and complex story of the boy who became Lord Voldemort — and thereby find what may be his only vulnerability.</description>

  <description>The summer holidays are dragging on and Harry Potter can't wait for the start of the school year. It is his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and there are spells to be learnt, potions to be brewed and Divination lessons (sigh) to be attended. Harry is expecting these: however, other quite unexpected events are already on the march ...</description>

  <description>For most children, summer vacation is something to look forward to.  But  not for our 13-year-old hero, who's forced to spend his summers with an aunt, uncle,  and cousin who detest him. The third book in J.K. Rowling's Harry  Potter series catapults into action when the young wizard "accidentally" causes the Dursleys' dreadful visitor Aunt Marge to inflate like a monstrous balloon and drift up to the ceiling. Fearing punishment from Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon (and from officials at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry who strictly forbid students to cast spells in the nonmagic world of Muggles), Harry lunges out into the darkness with his heavy trunk and his owl Hedwig. &lt;p&gt;  As it turns out, Harry isn't punished at all for his errant wizardry. Instead he is mysteriously rescued from his Muggle neighborhood and whisked off in a triple-decker, violently purple bus to spend the remaining weeks of summer in a friendly inn called the Leaky Cauldron. What Harry has to face  as he begins his third year at Hogwarts explains why the officials let him off easily. It seems that Sirius Black--an escaped convict from the prison of Azkaban--is on the loose. Not only that, but he's after Harry Potter. But why? And why do the Dementors, the guards hired to protect him, chill Harry's very heart when others are unaffected? Once again, Rowling has created a mystery that will have children and adults cheering, not to mention standing in line for her next book. Fortunately, there are four more in the works. (Ages 9 and older) &lt;em&gt;--Karin Snelson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Joey W. Hill’s Vampire Queen novels keep the pages turning, your imagination running, [and] your dreams carnally vivid” (&lt;em&gt;Bitten by Books&lt;/em&gt;). In her newest installment, a servant sentenced to death is sent into hiding and finds a passion she never expected in her new protector…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Groomed from birth to be an Inherited Servant and serve only the most powerful vampire Masters, Alanna never resented her destiny. Then she did the unthinkable: she betrayed her Master to the Vampire Council. Now death is her future, but until her Master is captured, she must be protected. The Vampire Council assigns her to Evan, a vampire whose wandering lifestyle makes him the perfect guardian…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Alanna’s training was for a vampire of power and ambition, not for someone like Evan who lives in mountainside shacks and caves. Even his servant, Niall, is rough mannered. But these two men are about to teach Alanna something her rigorous training never did: how to feel, how to desire …perhaps even how to love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then the Council captures her Master, and Alanna has no choice but to accept her destiny. But Evan and Niall are no strangers to defying fate—and they will stop at nothing to make Alanna theirs forever…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Experience Joey W. Hill’s scintillating blend of modern-day witchcraft, ancient evil, and the magical tricks men and women play in the name of love…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All witch and part succubus, savvy businesswoman Raina has converted a Southern plantation house into an extremely profitable old-fashioned bordello. Because of her abilities as a witch, the demons under Raina’s protection can feed off the sexual energy of their clients without killing them—definitely a good thing for repeat business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a rogue incubus shows up on Raina’s doorstep begging for asylum, the witch’s well-run business is put in jeopardy. The incubus has stolen an object of great power from Lucifer, and Underworld Dark Guardian Mikhael will do anything to get it back—even if it means incinerating the incubus on Raina’s porch to get the answers he seeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not to be trifled with, Raina enters a dangerous match of wits with Mikhael to achieve their mutual goals—only to discover that the reluctant attraction between them is the most hazardous game of all…</description>

  <description>Vampire hunter Gideon Green never intended to become a vampire's servant. But when Anwyn, a woman with whom he shared an unforgettable night, is turned by a vampire pack, Gideon is forced into an uneasy alliance with one of the most terrifying vampires he's ever encountered: the mysterious Daegan Rei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Daegan has a vested interest in Anwyn. As Gideon and Daegan shepherd Anwyn through her dangerous validation with the Vampire Council, it's clear they must learn to trust each other. But as boundaries erode, Gideon realizes he has become irreversibly changed-by a bond with the two people in his life he can't survive without: vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

Still, she has to fight for what she wants-especially since what she wants is to depose a brutal territory overlord. For that she'll need the help of Devlin, a handsome, brave human who inflames her desire far more than any man or beast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Even though she could easily lay her claim and take Dev on as a fully marked servant, she resists the urge-especially since Dev is still tormented by something in his past. But when her enemy makes an unexpected appearance, Dev surprises them both by yielding completely to his feelings for Danny and showing her the devotion of a true servant-until she decides to take his freedom without asking...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

While helping to rescue Prime Legion Commander Jonah, she exposed herself as a potentially dangerous weapon, susceptible to the darkness in her own blood. Now, for the general good, Jonah has angels watching over her...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Though Mina is resistant to being protected, her attitude begins to change when David, the human-born angel, is awarded the duty. Looking into his eyes, she can sense that he too knows what it means to fight the darkness within. But-as their passion threatens to take over-will it lead them to Heaven or Hell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Lady Elyssa Yamato Amaterasu Wentworth is a centuries-old vampire who's been given a new servant - Jacob, a total alpha male unaccustomed to submitting to any woman's wishes. What really binds Jacob to her are not her sensual midnight hungers, but something far more provocative. It stirs her blood, renews her life, and awakens her soul like only true love can. The passion between Elyssa and Jacob yields something else unexpected - a shared history that reaches back through the centuries and is fated to challenge their destiny like nothing ever will again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now updated with new material that brings the killer's picture into clearer focus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the fall of 1888, all of London was held in the grip of unspeakable terror.  An elusive madman calling himself Jack the Ripper was brutally butchering women in the slums of London’s East End.  Police seemed powerless to stop the killer, who delighted in taunting them and whose crimes were clearly escalating in violence from victim to victim.  And then the Ripper’s violent spree seemingly ended as abruptly as it had begun.  He had struck out of nowhere and then vanished from the scene.  Decades passed, then fifty years, then a hundred, and the Ripper’s bloody sexual crimes became anemic and impotent fodder for puzzles, mystery weekends, crime conventions, and so-called “Ripper Walks” that end with pints of ale in the pubs of Whitechapel.  But to number-one &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novelist Patricia Cornwell, the Ripper murders are not cute little mysteries to be transformed into parlor games or movies but rather a series of terrible crimes that no one should get away with, even after death.  Now Cornwell applies her trademark skills for meticulous research and scientific expertise to dig deeper into the Ripper case than any detective before her—and reveal the true identity of this fabled Victorian killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In&lt;em&gt; Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper, Case Closed&lt;/em&gt;, Cornwell combines the rigorous discipline of twenty-first century police investigation with forensic techniques undreamed of during the late Victorian era to solve one of the most infamous and difficult serial murder cases in history.  Drawing on unparalleled access to original Ripper evidence, documents, and records, as well as archival, academic, and law-enforcement resources, FBI profilers, and top forensic scientists, Cornwell reveals that Jack the Ripper was none other than a respected painter of his day, an artist now collected by some of the world’s finest museums: Walter Richard Sickert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been said of Cornwell that no one depicts the human capability for evil better than she.   Adding layer after layer of circumstantial evidence to the physical evidence discovered by modern forensic science and expert minds, Cornwell shows that Sickert, who died peacefully in his bed in 1942, at the age of 81, was not only one of Great Britain’s greatest painters but also a serial killer, a damaged diabolical man driven by megalomania and hate.  She exposes Sickert as the author of the infamous Ripper letters that were written to the Metropolitan Police and the press.  Her detailed analysis of his paintings shows that his art continually depicted his horrific mutilation of his victims, and her examination of this man’s birth defects, the consequent genital surgical interventions, and their effects on his upbringing present a casebook example of how a psychopathic killer is created.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New information and startling revelations detailed in &lt;em&gt;Portrait of a Killer&lt;/em&gt; include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- How a year-long battery of more than 100 DNA tests—on samples drawn by Cornwell’s forensics team in September 2001 from original Ripper letters and Sickert documents—yielded the first shadows of the 75- to 114 year-old genetic evid...</description>

  <description>A chilling, mesmerizing novel that combines the best of modern forensic thrillers with the detail and drama of historical fiction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In medieval Cambridge, England, four children have been murdered. The crimes are immediately blamed on the town's Jewish community, taken as evidence that Jews sacrifice Christian children in blasphemous ceremonies. To save them from the rioting mob, the king places the Cambridge Jews under his protection and hides them in a castle fortress. King Henry II is no friend of the Jews-or anyone, really-but he is invested in their fate. Without the taxes received from Jewish merchants, his treasuries would go bankrupt. Hoping scientific investigation will exonerate the Jews, Henry calls on his cousin the King of Sicily-whose subjects include the best medical experts in Europe-and asks for his finest "master of the art of death," an early version of the medical examiner. The Italian doctor chosen for the task is a young prodigy from the University of Salerno. But her name is Adelia-the king has been sent a mistress of the art of death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adelia and her companions-Simon, a Jew, and Mansur, a Moor-travel to England to unravel the mystery of the Cambridge murders, which turn out to be the work of a serial killer, most likely one who has been on Crusade with the king. In a backward and superstitious country like England, Adelia must conceal her true identity as a doctor in order to avoid accusations of witchcraft. Along the way, she is assisted by Sir Rowley Picot, one of the king's tax collectors, a man with a personal stake in the investigation. Rowley may be a needed friend, or the fiend for whom they are searching. As Adelia's investigation takes her into Cambridge's shadowy river paths and behind the closed doors of its churches and nunneries, the hunt intensifies and the killer prepares to strike again . .</description>

  <description>The frank and unvarnished memoir of a life spent stalking death in the Deep South. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Baton Rouge is a little town with big-city problems. Rich with Creole history, colorful locals, and a strong sense of community, it's also the home of Napoleonic codes, stubborn cops, and a sometimes-troubled leadership. Baton Rouge-which literally means "Red Stick"-lives up to its bloody namesake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And after more than ten years as a deputy coroner and then as its chief coroner, Louis Cataldie has seen his fair share of unusual and disturbing cases. They range from the bizarre to the heartbreaking: an LSU professor killed by a barn door; the bones of a young woman found scattered in a churchyard; and as many as three serial killers loose at one time under Cataldie's watch. He has worked the scene of one of the Malvo/ Muhammad Beltway Sniper shootings and had a hand in bringing to justice serial killer Derrick Todd Lee in a controversial investigation that was featured in an ABC Prime Time special with Diane Sawyer and Patricia Cornwell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coroner's Journal&lt;/em&gt; is an unflinching look at a world that television dramas such as &lt;em&gt;CSI&lt;/em&gt; can only begin to show us.</description>

  <description>A behind-the-scenes tour of the fabled tattoo industry on the arm of a swashbuckling insider and natural-born storyteller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the eighteen years he’s been a tattoo artist, Jeff Johnson has worked on everyone from nervous young coeds who turn green at the sight of his needle (chudders) to cocky would-be artists with fancy design degrees and weak constitutions (night hogs). As the proprietor of the legendary Sea Tramp Tattoo Company, he’s inked gangbangers, age-defying moms, and sociopaths; he’s defused brawls, tended delicate egos, learned to spot and avoid bunnies, and made it his mission to perpetrate ingenious and awful practical jokes on his fellow Trojans. He’s a true swamp panther: He knows all the tricks of the trade and, more important, he knows how to keep his legendary shop in Portland, Oregon, from becoming the scene of a nightly bloodbath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;strong&gt;Tattoo Machine&lt;/strong&gt;, Johnson lifts the curtain on an art form that has undergone rebirth and illuminates a world where art, drama, and commerce come together in highly entertaining theater. A tattoo shop is no longer a den of social outcasts and degenerates–it’s a workshop where committed and schooled artists who paint on living canvases develop close bonds and bitter rivalries, where tattoo legends and innovators are equally revered, and where the potential for disaster lurks in every corner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussing everything from his days as an apprentice to some of the greatest inkers in the trade to the incredibly vivid nightly spectacular over which he presides, Jeff Johnson has written a sometimes riotous, sometimes harrowing, and always riveting memoir about what it means to be on the front lines of a global art revolution.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An extraordinary debut novel of love that survives the fires of hell and transcends the boundaries of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The narrator of &lt;em&gt;The Gargoyle&lt;/em&gt; is a very contemporary cynic, physically beautiful and sexually adept, who dwells in the moral vacuum that is modern life. As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide — for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life — and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete — and her time on earth will be finished.</description>

  <description>Famed Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon answers an unexpected summons to appear at the U.S. Capitol Building. His planned lecture is interrupted when a disturbing object—artfully encoded with five symbols—is discovered in the building. Langdon recognizes in the find an ancient invitation into a lost world of esoteric, potentially dangerous wisdom. When his mentor Peter Solomon—a longstanding Mason and beloved philanthropist—is kidnapped, Langdon realizes that the only way to save Solomon is to accept the mystical invitation and plunge headlong into a clandestine world of Masonic secrets, hidden history, and one inconceivable truth . . . all under the watchful eye of Dan Brown's most terrifying villain to date. Set within the hidden chambers, tunnels, and temples of Washington, D.C., The Lost Symbol is an intelligent, lightning-paced story with surprises at every turn--Brown's most exciting novel yet.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting first-hand account of a catastrophic expedition up  Mount Everest. In March 1996, Outside magazine sent veteran journalist and seasoned climber  Jon Krakauer on an expedition led by celebrated Everest guide Rob Hall. Despite the expertise of  Hall and the other leaders, by the end of summit day eight people were dead. Krakauer's book is  at once the story of the ill-fated adventure and an analysis of the factors leading up to its tragic  end. Written within months of the events it chronicles, &lt;em&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/em&gt; clearly evokes the  majestic Everest landscape. As the journey up the mountain progresses, Krakauer puts it in  context by recalling the triumphs and perils of other Everest trips throughout history. The author's  own anguish over what happened on the mountain is palpable as he leads readers to ponder  timeless questions.</description>

  <description>In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a party of moose hunters.  How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir.  In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his  cash.  He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.  Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away.  Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.</description>

  <description>Jamie Fraser, former Jacobite and reluctant rebel, is already certain of three things about the American rebellion: The Americans will win, fighting on the side of victory is no guarantee of survival, and he'd rather die than have to face his illegitimate son--a young lieutenant in the British Army--across the barrel of a gun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Randall knows that the Americans will win, too, but not what the ultimate price may be. That price won't include Jamie's life or his happiness, though--not if she has anything to say about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, in the relative safety of the twentieth century, Jamie and Claire's daughter, Brianna, and her husband, Roger MacKenzie, have resettled in a historic Scottish home where, across a chasm of two centuries, the unfolding drama of Brianna's parents' story comes to life through Claire's letters. The fragile pages reveal Claire's love for battle-scarred Jamie Fraser and their flight from North Carolina to the high seas, where they encounter privateers and ocean battles--as Brianna and Roger search for clues not only to Claire's fate but to their own. Because the future of the MacKenzie family in the Highlands is mysteriously, irrevocably, and intimately entwined with life and death in war-torn colonial America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With stunning cameos of historical characters from Benedict Arnold to Benjamin Franklin, &lt;em&gt;An Echo in the Bone&lt;/em&gt; is a soaring masterpiece of imagination, insight, character, and adventure--a novel that echoes in the mind long after the last page is turned.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;strong&gt;Company of Liars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; hailed as “a jewel of a medieval mystery”* and “an atmospheric tale of treachery and magic,”** comes a magnificent new novel of an embattled village and a group of courageous women who are set on a collision course—in an unforgettable storm of secrets, lust, and rage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;England, 1321. The tiny village of Ulewic teeters between survival and destruction, faith and doubt, God and demons. For shadowing the villagers’ lives are men cloaked in masks and secrecy, ruling with violence, intimidation, and terrifying fiery rites: the Owl Masters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But another force is touching Ulewic—a newly formed community built and served only by women. Called a &lt;em&gt;beguinage,&lt;/em&gt; it is a safe harbor of service and faith in defiance of the all-powerful Church. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behind the walls of this sanctuary, women have gathered from all walks of life: a skilled physician, a towering former prostitute, a cook, a local convert. But life in Ulewic is growing more dangerous with each passing day. The women are the subject of rumors, envy, scorn, and fury…until the daughter of Ulewic’s most powerful man is cast out of her home and accepted into the beguinage—and battle lines are drawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Into this drama are swept innocents and conspirators: a parish priest trying to save himself from his own sins…a village teenager, pregnant and terrified…a woman once on the verge of sainthood, now cast out of the Church.…With Ulewic ravaged by flood and disease, and with villagers driven by fear, a secret inside the beguinage will draw the desperate and the depraved—until masks are dropped, faith is tested…and every lie is exposed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;br&gt;**Marie Claire&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Breath of Snow and Ashes&lt;/strong&gt; continues the extraordinary story of 18th-century Scotsman Jamie Fraser and his 20th-century wife, Claire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1772, and on the eve of the American Revolution, the long fuse of rebellion has already been lit. Men lie dead in the streets of Boston, and in the backwoods of North Carolina, isolated cabins burn in the forest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With chaos brewing, the governor calls upon Jamie Fraser to unite the backcountry and safeguard the colony for King and Crown. But from his wife Jamie knows that three years hence the shot heard round the world will be fired, and the result will be independence — with those loyal to the King either dead or in exile. And there is also the matter of a tiny clipping from &lt;em&gt;The Wilmington Gazette&lt;/em&gt;, dated 1776, which reports Jamie’s death, along with his kin. For once, he hopes, his time-traveling family may be wrong about the future.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;strong&gt;Outlander&lt;/strong&gt;... a magnificent epic that once again sweeps us back in time to the drama and passion of 18th-century Scotland...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty years Claire Randall has kept her secrets. But now she is returning with her grown daughter to Scotland's majestic mist-shrouded hills. Here Claire plans to reveal a truth as stunning as the events that gave it birth: about the mystery of an ancient circle of standing stones...about a love that transcends the boundaries of time...and about James Fraser, a Scottish warrior whose gallantry once drew a young Claire from the security of her century to the dangers of his ....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a legacy of blood and desire will test her beautiful copper-haired daughter, Brianna, as Claire's spellbinding journey of self-discovery continues in the intrigue-ridden Paris court of Charles Stuart ...in a race to thwart a doomed Highlands uprising...and in a desperate fight to save both the child and the man she loves....</description>

  <description>The year is 1771, and war is coming. Jamie Fraser’s wife tells him so. Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful prophecy — a time-traveler’s certain knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in the year of Our Lord 1918, Claire Randall served England as a nurse on the battlefields of World War II, and in the aftermath of peace found fresh conflicts when she walked through a cleftstone on the Scottish Highlands and found herself an outlander, an English lady in a place where no lady should be, in a time — 1743 — when the only English in Scotland were the officers and men of King George’s army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now wife, mother, and surgeon, Claire is still an outlander, out of place, and out of time, but now, by choice, linked by love to her only anchor — Jamie Fraser. Her unique view of the future has brought him both danger and deliverance in the past; her knowledge of the oncoming revolution is a flickering torch that may light his way through the perilous years ahead — or ignite a conflagration that will leave their lives in ashes....</description>

  <description>In her long awaited new novel,&lt;strong&gt; Drums of Autumn&lt;/strong&gt;, Diana Gabaldon continues the remarkable story of Claire and Jamie Fraser that began with the classic &lt;strong&gt;Outlander&lt;/strong&gt;, and its bestselling sequels,&lt;strong&gt; Dragonfly in Amber&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Voyager.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cast ashore in the American colonies, the Frasers are faced with a bleak choice: return to a Scotland fallen into famine and poverty, or seize the risky chance of a new life in the New World—menaced by Claire's certain knowledge of the coming Revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, a highlander is born to risk—and so is a time-traveler. Their daughter, Brianna, is safe—they think—on the other side of a dangerous future; their lives are their own to venture as they will. With faith in themselves and in each other, they seek a new beginning among the exiled Scottish Highlanders of the Cape Fear, in the fertile river valleys of the Colony of North Carolina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even in the New World, though, the Frasers find their hope of peace threatened from without and within; by the British Crown and by Jamie's aunt, Jocasta MacKenzie, last of the MacKenzies of Leoch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hunger for freedom drives Jamie to a Highlander's only true refuge: the mountains. And here at last, with no challenge to their peace—save wild animals, Indians, and the threat of starvation—the Frasers establish a precarious foothold in the wilderness, secure in the knowledge that even war cannot invade their mountain sanctuary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But history spares no one, and when Brianna follows her mother into the past, not even the mountains can shelter a Highlander. For Brianna too has an urgent quest: not only to find the mother she has lost and the father she has never met, but to save them both from a future that only she can see.</description>

  <description>One boy . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One dragon . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world of adventure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he thinks it is the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy; perhaps it will buy his family meat for the winter. But when the stone brings a dragon hatchling, Eragon soon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overnight his simple life is shattered, and he is thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic, and power. With only an ancient sword and the advice of an old storyteller for guidance, Eragon and the fledgling dragon must navigate the dangerous terrain and dark enemies of an Empire ruled by a king whose evil knows no bounds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders? The fate of the Empire may rest in his hands.</description>

  <description>Many hundreds of years ago, the city of Ember was created by the Builders to contain everything needed for human survival. It worked…but now the storerooms are almost out of food, crops are blighted, corruption is spreading through the city and worst of all—the lights are failing. Soon Ember could be engulfed by darkness….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when two children, Lina and Doon, discover fragments of an ancient parchment, they begin to wonder if there could be a way out of Ember. Can they decipher the words from long ago and find a new future for everyone? Will the people of Ember listen to them?</description>

  <description>In the more than twenty-five years since she co-founded Omega Institute - now the world's largest center for spiritual retreat and personal growth -Elizabeth Lesser has been an intimate witness to the ways in which people weather change and transition. In a beautifully crafted blend of moving stories, humorous insights, practical guidance, and personal memoir, she offers tools to help us make the choice we all face in times of challenge: Will we be broken down and defeated, or broken open and transformed? Lesser shares tales of ordinary people who have risen from the ashes of illness, divorce, loss of a job or a loved one - stronger, wiser, and more in touch with their purpose and passion. And she draws on the world's great spiritual and psychological traditions to support us as we too learn to break open and blossom into who we were meant to be.</description>

  <description>The time is 1981, and Sibyl Danforth has been a dedicated midwife in the rural community of Reddington, Vermont, for fifteen years. But one treacherous winter night, in a house isolated by icy roads and failed telephone lines, Sibyl takes desperate measures to save a baby's life. She performs an emergency Caesarean section on its mother, who appears to have died in labor. But what if—as Sibyl's assistant later charges—the patient wasn't already dead, and it was Sibyl who inadvertently killed her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As recounted by Sibyl's precocious fourteen-year-old daughter, Connie, the ensuing trial bears the earmarks of a witch hunt except for the fact that all its participants are acting from the highest motives—and the defendant increasingly appears to be guilty. As Sibyl Danforth faces the antagonism of the law, the hostility of traditional doctors, and the accusations of her own conscience, &lt;strong&gt;Midwives&lt;/strong&gt; engages, moves, and transfixes us as only the very best novels ever do.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five-year-old Julie Jacobs is heartbroken over the death of her beloved Aunt Rose. But the shock goes even deeper when she learns that the woman who has been like a mother to her has left her entire estate to Julie’s twin sister. The only thing Julie receives is a key—one carried by her mother on the day she herself died—to a safety-deposit box in Siena, Italy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This key sends Julie on a journey that will change her life forever—a journey into the troubled past of her ancestor Giulietta Tolomei. In 1340, still reeling from the slaughter of her parents, Giulietta was smuggled into Siena, where she met a young man named Romeo. Their ill-fated love turned medieval Siena upside-down and went on to inspire generations of poets and artists, the story reaching its pinnacle in Shakespeare’s famous tragedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But six centuries have a way of catching up to the present, and Julie gradually begins to discover that here, in this ancient city, the past and present are hard to tell apart. The deeper she delves into the history of Romeo and Giulietta, and the closer she gets to the treasure they allegedly left behind, the greater the danger surrounding her—superstitions, ancient hostilities, and personal vendettas. As Julie crosses paths with the descendants of the families involved in the unforgettable blood feud, she begins to fear that the notorious curse—“A plague on both your houses!”—is still at work, and that she is destined to be its next target. Only someone like Romeo, it seems, could save her from this dreaded fate, but his story ended long ago. Or did it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Anne Fortier comes a sweeping, beautifully written novel of intrigue and identity, of love and legacy, as a young woman discovers that her own fate is irrevocably tied—for better or worse—to literature’s greatest star-crossed lovers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There's an alternate cover edition &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16164863-seabiscuit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seabiscuit was one of the most electrifying and popular attractions in sports history and the single biggest newsmaker in the world in 1938, receiving more coverage than FDR, Hitler, or Mussolini.  But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail.  Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire.  When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains.  Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Laura Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Monty Roberts is a real-life horse whisperer -- an American original whose gentle training methods reveal the depth of communication possible between man and animal. He can take a wild, high-strung horse who has never before been handled and persuade that horse to accept a bridle, saddle, and rider in 30 minutes. His powers may seem like magic, but his amazing 'horse sense' is based on a lifetime of experience. Roberts started riding at the age of two, and at the age of 13 he went alone into the high deserts of Nevada to study mustangs in the wild. What he learned there changed his life forever. In "The Man Who Listens to Horses," he tells about his early days as a rodeo rider in California, his violent horse-trainer father, who was unwilling to accept Monty's unconventional training methods, his friendship with James Dean, his struggle to be accepted in the professional horse-training community, and the invitation that changed his life -- to demonstrate his method of "join-up" to the Queen of England. From his groundbreaking work with horses, Roberts has acquired an unprecedented understanding of nonverbal communication, an understanding that applies to human relationships as well. He has shown that between parent and child, employee and employer (he's worked with over 250 corporations, including General Motors, IBM, Disney, and Merrill Lynch), and abuser and abused, there are forms of communication far stronger than the spoken word and that they are accessible to all who will learn to listen.</description>

  <description>Superb...Wonder-filled."&lt;br&gt;-- "The Washington Post Book World" &lt;br&gt;It was no ordinary life for a young girl: living among scholars in the hallowed halls of Jordan College and tearing unsupervised through Oxford's motley streets on mad quests for adventure. But Lyra's greatest adventure would begin closer to home, the day she heard hushed talk of an extraordinary particle. Microscopic in size, the magical dust--found only in the vast Arctic expanse of the North--was rumored to possess profound properties that could unite whole universes. But there were those who feared the particle and would stop at nothing to destroy it.&lt;br&gt;Catapulted into the heart of a terrible struggle, Lyra was forced to seek aid from witches, gypsies, and formidable armored bears. And as she journeyed into unbelievable danger, she had not the faintest clue that she alone was destined to win, or to lose, this more-than-mortal battle . . .&lt;br&gt;"Very grand indeed...Scene after scene of power and beauty."&lt;br&gt;-- "The New York Times" &lt;br&gt;"A rousing, page-turning adventure that promises to please fantasy readers of all ages."&lt;br&gt;-- "Library Journal" (starred review)&lt;br&gt;"Powerful...sparkles with childlike wonder."&lt;br&gt;-- "The Boston Sunday Globe</description>

  <description>Here are the confessions of a vampire. Hypnotic, shocking, and chillingly erotic, this is a novel of mesmerizing beauty and astonishing force–a story of danger and flight, of love and loss, of suspense and resolution, and of the extraordinary power of the senses. It is a novel only Anne Rice could write.</description>

  <description>When &lt;em&gt;Desert Solitaire&lt;/em&gt; was first published in 1968, it became the focus of a nationwide cult. Rude and sensitive. Thought-provoking and mystical. Angry and loving. Both Abbey and this book are all of these and more. Here, the legendary author of &lt;em&gt;The Monkey Wrench Gang, Abbey's Road&lt;/em&gt; and many other critically acclaimed books vividly captures the essence of his life during three seasons as a park ranger in southeastern Utah. This is a rare view of a quest to experience nature in its purest form -- the silence, the struggle, the overwhelming beauty. But this is also the gripping, anguished cry of a man of character who challenges the growing exploitation of the wilderness by oil and mining interests, as well as by the tourist industry.&lt;p&gt;Abbey's observations and challenges remain as relevant now as the day he wrote them. Today, &lt;em&gt;Desert Solitaire&lt;/em&gt; asks if any of our incalculable natural treasures can be saved before the bulldozers strike again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A beautiful first novel about a young woman growing up the hard way, this is a powerful story of mothers and daughters, their ambiguous alliances, and the search for love and identity.&lt;br&gt;Astrid has been raised by her mother, who is a beautiful, headstrong poet, in a loving but isolated relationship. The two are inseparable until Ingrid murders a former lover and is imprisoned for life. Astrid becomes one of the thousands of foster children in Los Angeles. As she navigates this new reality -- a series of homes, each its own universe, each with its own limits and dangers -- she finds strength in her unshakable certainty of her own worth and her unfettered sense of the absurd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her fierce determination to find an authentic self and a place to stand in the world makes her a lovable and unforgettable figure in this brilliantly written debut.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim.  Upsetting, you say?  Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school.  Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed.  But what the reader knows, her family does not.  Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some.  But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.  To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bella Swan moves to the gloomy town of Forks and meets Edward Cullen, her life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. With his porcelain skin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now, he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Bella doesn't realize is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And it might be too late to turn back...</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be immortal? To journey through the night stalking the evil that preys on humans? To have unlimited wealth, unlimited power? That is my existence, and it is dark and dangerous. I play hero to thousands, but am known to none. And I love every minutes of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so I thought until one night when I woke up handcuffed to my worst nightmare: a conservative woman in a button-down shirt. Or in Amanda's case, one buttoned all the way up to her chin. She's smart, sexy, witty, and wants nothing to do with the paranormal--in other words, me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My attraction to Amanda Devereaux goes against everything I stand for. Not to mention the last time I fell in love it cost me not only my human life, but also my very soul. Yet every time I look at her, I find myself wanting to try again. Wanting to believe that love and loyalty do exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more disturbing, I find myself wondering if there's any way a woman like Amanda can love a man whose battle scars run deep, and whose heart was damaged by a betrayal so savage that he's not sure it will ever beat again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Kyrian of Thrace&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being trapped in a bedroom with a woman is a grand thing. Being trapped in hundreds of bedrooms over two thousand years isn't. And being cursed into a book as a love-slave for eternity can ruin even a Spartan warrior's day.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a love-slave, I know everything about women. How to touch them, how to savor them, and most of all, how to pleasure them. But when I was summoned to fulfill Grace Alexander's sexual fantasies, I found the first woman in history who saw me as a man with a tormented past. She alone bothered to take me out of the bedroom and onto the world.  She taught me to love again.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But I was not born to love. I was cursed to walk eternity alone. As a general, I had long ago accepted my sentence. Yet now I have found Grace--the one thing my wounded heart cannot survive without. Sure, love can heal all wounds, but can it break a two-thousand-year-old curse?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Julian of Macedon&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See original cover edition: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5597761-fantasy-lover"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Zarek's Point of View:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark-Hunter: A soulless guardian who stands between mankind and those who would see mankind destroyed. Yeah, right. The only part of that Code of Honor I got was eternity and solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insanity: A condition many say I suffer from after being alone for so long. But I don't suffer from my insanity-I enjoy every minute of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trust: I can't trust anyone...not even myself. The only thing I trust in is my ability to do the wrong thing in any situation and to hurt anyone who gets in my way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truth: I endured a lifetime as a Roman slave, and 900 years as an exiled Dark-Hunter. Now I'm tired of enduring. I want the truth about what happened the night I was exiled-I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astrid (Greek, meaning star): An exceptional woman who can see straight to the truth. Brave and strong, she is a point of light in the darkness. She touches me and I tremble. She smiles and my cold heart shatters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zarek: They say even the most damned man can be forgiven. I never believed that until the night Astrid opened her door to me and made this feral beast want to be human again. Made me want to love and be loved. But how can an ex-slave whose soul is owned by a Greek goddess ever dream of touching, let alone holding, a fiery star?</description>

  <description>The land Tencendor has been united for more than forty years. The Starman Axis defeated the dreaded monster Gorgrael and by fulfilling his destiny he has brought peace finally to the three races of this land: the Icarii bird people, the Avar tree people, and the humans who for generations controlled (and oppressed) the other two races. Attaining god-like powers, Axis chose to retire to the ethereal sphere in the heavens with his beautiful consort Azhure and ceded his authority to his son Caelum SunSoar. As Supreme Ruler of Tencendor, Caelum holds the reins of power carefully and the thousands of years of ill-will between the three races seems to be at an end. All seems golden for this land. Or so it might seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the path of the son is not necessarily that of the father. Caelum is untried and has known nothing but peace during his lifetime. And while the three races appear at peace, there are undercurrents of jealousy and bitter memories just buried beneath the surface. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when strange powers threaten to come through the Star Gate (a source of power that gives those with magic their near immortality) bent on the destruction of all he holds dear, Caelum will have to find the strength to fight this threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicating this situation is the almost impossible death of his Icarri sister...and the culprit appears to be none other then his hated brother Drago, who as a baby had been in league with Gorgrael and had sufficient power to try to kill Caelum. As punishment Drago was made mortal (unlike his near invulnerable siblings). As Caelum struggles to hold all he holds dear safe, he is left with this quandary:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Drago as powerless as he seems? Is his hate for his fate enough to have him murder? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And is he in league with the demons that hover ever nearer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the fourth book in Sara Douglass's The Wayfarer Redemption series, however it starts a brand new story arc and is the perfect place for new readers to enter this series.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>At fourteen, Nick Gautier thinks he knows everything about the world around him. Streetwise, tough and savvy, his quick sarcasm is the stuff of legends. . .until the night when his best friends try to kill him. Saved by a mysterious warrior who has more fighting skills than Chuck Norris, Nick is sucked into the realm of the Dark-Hunters: immortal vampire slayers who risk everything to save humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick quickly learns that the human world is only a veil for a much larger and more dangerous one: a world where the captain of the football team is a werewolf and the girl he has a crush on goes out at night to stake the undead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before he can even learn the rules of this new world, his fellow students are turning into flesh eating zombies. And he's next on the menu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if starting high school isn't hard enough. . .now Nick has to hide his new friends from his mom, his chainsaw from the principal, and keep the zombies and the demon Simi from eating his brains, all without getting grounded or suspended. How in the world is he supposed to do that?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A stunning and suspenseful new landscape emerges in the thrilling Dark-Hunter world—a world where nothing will ever be the same again. . .&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fang Kattalakis isn't just a wolf. He is the brother of two of the most powerful members of the Omegrion: the ruling council that enforces the laws of the Were-Hunters. And when war erupts among the lycanthropes, sides must be chosen. Enemies are forced into shaky alliances. And when the woman Fang loves is accused of betraying her people, her only hope is that Fang believes in her. Yet in order to save her, Fang must break the law of his people and the faith of his brothers. That breech could very well spell the end of both their races and change their world forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The war is on and time is running out...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The most anticipated story in the blockbuster Dark-Hunter series. The never-before-revealed story of the Dark-Hunter leader, Acheron.  He was made human in order to escape death, but in death he was reborn a god. . .&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Eleven thousand years ago a god was born. Cursed into the body of a human, Acheron spent a lifetime of shame. However, his human death unleashed an unspeakable horror that almost destroyed the earth. Then, brought back against his will, Acheron became the sole defender of mankind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only it was never that simple. For centuries, he has fought for our survival and hidden a past he’ll do anything to keep concealed. Until a lone woman who refuses to be intimidated by him threatens his very existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now his survival, and ours, hinges on hers and old enemies reawaken and unite to kill them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War has never been more deadly... or more fun.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A penetrating, page-turning tour of a post-human Earth. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In&lt;em&gt; The World Without Us, &lt;/em&gt;Alan Weisman offers an utterly original approach to questions of humanity's impact on the planet: he asks us to envision our Earth without us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this far-reaching narrative, Weisman explains how our massive infrastructure would collapse and finally vanish without human presence; which everyday items may become immortalized as fossils; how copper pipes and wiring would be crushed into mere seams of reddish rock; why some of our earliest buildings might be the last architecture left; and how plastic, bronze sculpture, radio waves, and some man-made molecules may be our most lasting gifts to the universe.&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The World Without Us &lt;/em&gt;reveals how, just days after humans disappear, floods in New York's subways would start eroding the city's foundations, and how, as the world's cities crumble, asphalt jungles would give way to real ones. It describes the distinct ways that organic and chemically treated farms would revert to wild, how billions more birds would flourish, and how cockroaches in unheated cities would perish without us. Drawing on the expertise of engineers, atmospheric scientists, art conservators, zoologists, oil refiners, marine biologists, astrophysicists, religious leaders from rabbis to the Dali Lama, and paleontologists -- who describe a prehuman world inhabited by megafauna like giant sloths that stood taller than mammoths -- Weisman illustrates what the planet might be like today, if not for us.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From places already devoid of humans (a last fragment of primeval European forest; the Korean DMZ; Chernobyl), Weisman reveals Earth's tremendous capacity for self-healing. As he shows which human devastations are indelible, and which examples of our highest art and culture would endure longest, Weisman's narrative ultimately drives toward a radical but persuasive solution that needn't depend on our demise. It is narrative nonfiction at its finest, and in posing an irresistible concept with both gravity and a highly readable touch, it looks deeply at our effects on the planet in a way that no other book has. &lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived–and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who’ve long forgotten her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for details–proof they hope may free Ben–Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club… and maybe she’ll admit her testimony wasn’t so solid after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby’s doomed family members–including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started–on the run from a killer.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;WICKED above her hipbone, GIRL across her heart&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words are like a road map to reporter Camille Preaker’s troubled past. Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, Camille’s first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;NASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her family’s Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;HARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its taut, crafted writing, &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/em&gt; is addictive, haunting, and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>     On August 5, 1949, a crew of fifteen of the United States Forest Service's elite airborne firefighters, The Smoke Jumpers, stepped into the sky above a remote forest fire in the Montana wilderness. Two hours after their jump, all but three of these men were dead or mortally burned from a &lt;em&gt;"blowup"&lt;/em&gt; -- an explosive, 2,000-degree firestorm 300 feet deep and 200 feet tall -- a deadly explosion of flame and wind rarely encountered and little understood at the time.  Only seconds ahead of the approaching firestorm, the foreman, R. Wagner Dodge, throws himself into the ashes of an &lt;em&gt;"escape fire "&lt;/em&gt; - and survives as most of his confused men run, their last moments obscured by smoke. The parents of the dead cry murder, charging that the foreman's fire killed their boys.  Exactly what happened in Mann Gulch that day has been obscured by years of grief and controversy. Now a master storyteller finally gives the Mann Gulch fire its due as tragedy.&lt;br&gt;     These first deaths among the Forest Service's elite firefighters prompted widespread examination of federal fire policy, of the field of fire science, and of the frailty of young men. For Maclean, who witnessed the fire from the ground in August of 1949,  and even then he knew he would one day become a part of its story.  It is a story of Montana, of the ways of wildfires, firefighters, and fire scientists, and especially of a crew, young and proud, who &lt;em&gt;"hadn't learned to count the odds and to sense they might owe the universe a tragedy."&lt;/em&gt; This tale is also Maclean's own, the story of a writer obsessed by a strange and human horror, unable to let the truth die with these young men, searching for the last - and lasting - word. A canvas on which to tell many stories, including the story of his research into the story itself. And finally Nature's violence colliding with human fallibility.&lt;br&gt;      Haunted by these deaths for forty years, Norman Maclean returned to the scene with two of the survivors and pursues the mysteries that Mann Gulch has kept hidden since 1949.  From the words of witnesses, the evidence of history, and the research of fire scientists, Maclean at last assembles the scattered pieces of the Mann Gulch tragedy; in his last work that consumed 14 years of his life, and earned a 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award.&lt;br&gt;       The excruciating detail of this book makes for a sobering reading experience. Maclean -- a former University of Chicago English professor and avid fisherman -- also wrote &lt;u&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A River Runs Through It and Other Stories&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;, which is set along the Missouri River, one gulch downstream from Mann Gulch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;       "A magnificent drama of writing, a tragedy that pays tribute to the dead and offers rescue to the living.... Maclean's search for the truth, which becomes an exploration of his own mortality, is more compelling even than his journey into the heart of the fire. His description of the conflagration terrifies, but it is his battle with words, his effort to turn the story of the 13 men into tragedy that makes this book a classic."&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;         —  from &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review Editor's Choice, Best Books of 1992&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The Men who Perished in the Mann Gulch Fire:&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert J. Bennett &lt;br&gt;Eldon E. Diettert &lt;br&gt;James O. Harrison&lt;br&gt; William J. Heilman &lt;br&gt;Phillip R. McVey &lt;br&gt;David R. Navon &lt;br&gt;Leonard L.

  <description>A dazzling novel in the most untraditional fashion, this is the remarkable story of Henry DeTamble, a dashing, adventuresome librarian who travels involuntarily through time, and Clare Abshire, an artist whose life takes a natural sequential course. Henry and Clare's passionate love affair endures across a sea of time and captures the two lovers in an impossibly romantic trap, and it is Audrey Niffenegger's cinematic storytelling that makes the novel's unconventional chronology so vibrantly triumphant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An enchanting debut and a spellbinding tale of fate and belief in the bonds of love, &lt;em&gt;The Time Traveler's Wife&lt;/em&gt; is destined to captivate readers for years to come.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Barcelona, 1945: A city slowly heals in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, and Daniel, an antiquarian book dealer’s son who mourns the loss of his mother, finds solace in a mysterious book entitled The Shadow of the Wind, by one Julián Carax. But when he sets out to find the author’s other works, he makes a shocking discovery: someone has been systematically destroying every copy of every book Carax has written. In fact, Daniel may have the last of Carax’s books in existence. Soon Daniel’s seemingly innocent quest opens a door into one of Barcelona’s darkest secrets--an epic story of murder, madness, and doomed love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A long, hot summer...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's what Macy has to look forward to while her boyfriend, Jason, is away at Brain Camp. Days will be spent at a boring job in the library, evenings will be filled with vocabulary drills for the SATs, and spare time will be passed with her mother, the two of them sharing a silent grief at the traumatic loss of Macy's father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But sometimes unexpected things can happen—things such as the catering job at Wish, with its fun-loving, chaotic crew. Or her sister's project of renovating the neglected beach house, awakening long-buried memories. Things such as meeting Wes, a boy with a past, a taste for Truth-telling, and an amazing artistic talent, the kind of boy who could turn any girl's world upside down. As Macy ventures out of her shell, she begins to wonder, Is it really better to be safe than sorry?</description>

  <description>Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. Here Steinbeck created some of his most memorable characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity; the inexplicability of love; and the murderous consequences of love’s absence.</description>

  <description>What's this elaborate illustration? "Horrible Hairy Hogs Hurrying Homewards on Heavily Harnessed Horses," of course. Graeme Base's astonishingly creative oeuvre begins with &lt;em&gt;Animalia&lt;/em&gt;, the alphabet book that challenges the standard idea of how long reading a book for small kids ought to take. &lt;em&gt;Animalia&lt;/em&gt;, like many of Base's books, is a vast puzzle, built with entrancing pictures that unfold into layers and layers of objects--all matched to each page's corresponding letter. Base leaves us stunned and amazed, painting reflections into the oddest surfaces and driving the urge to page-turn. This wonderful picture book works for 2-year-olds, 5-year-olds, and adults alike--something few other alphabet books can manage. &lt;em&gt;--Andrew Bartlett&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Clarissa Pinkola Estés, Ph.D., the internationally known poet, psychoanalyst, and author of the seminal classic &lt;em&gt;Women Who Run With The Wolves&lt;/em&gt; (99 weeks on the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller list, translated into eighteen languages, and a bestseller worldwide), touches our lives anew, rendering in the strong and lyrical voice for which she has become known a powerful series of her signature healing stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These elegantly interlocked tales of loss, survival, and fierce rebirth center around Dr. Estes's uncle, a war-ravaged Hungarian peasant farmer and refugee, a faithful gardener, and a storehouse of stories who was one of the "dancing fools, wise old crows, grumpy sages, and 'almost saints' who made up the old people" in Estés's childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told with graceful simplicity, deep feeling, generous humor, and profound optimism, The Faithful Gardener is, at its captivating core, the story of an open-hearted child who listened well to her old-country elders and who grew up to remember, to bear witness, and, as one of the premier storytellers of our times, to remind readers and listeners of all ages of "that magisterial life force within all things that strengthens us in times of turmoil or transition, that faithful force which can never die."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Tall, dark, and lethal...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble just walked into Nicholas Rixey's tattoo parlor. Becca Merritt is warm, sexy, wholesome — pure temptation to a very jaded Nick. He's left his military life behind to become co-owner of Hard Ink Tattoo, but Becca is his ex-commander's daughter. Loyalty won't let him turn her away. Lust has plenty to do with it too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her brother presumed kidnapped, Becca needs Nick. She just wasn't expecting to want him so much. As their investigation turns into all-out war with an organized crime ring, only Nick can protect her. And only Becca can heal the scars no one else sees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desire is the easy part. Love is as hard as it gets. Good thing Nick is always up for a challenge...</description>

  <description>Hades doesn’t often give second chances...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xypher has one month on Earth to redeem himself through one good deed or be condemned to eternal torture in Tartarus. But redemption means little to a demigod who only wants vengeance on the one who caused his downfall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until one day in a cemetery...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simone Dubois is a medical examiner with a real knack for the job. Those who are wrongfully killed appear to her and help her find the evidence the police need to convict their killers. But when a man appears and tells her that she’s more than just a psychic, she’s convinced he’s insane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the fate of the world hangs in her hands...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was bad enough when just the dead relied on her. Now’s there’s the seductive Dream-Hunter Xypher who needs Simone’s help in opening a portal to the Atlantean hell realm to fight insatiable demons. The future of mankind is at stake—and so is her life. The only question now is: Who is the bigger threat: the demons out to kill her, or the man who has left her forever changed?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It's a predator-eat-predator world for the Were-Hunters. Danger haunts any given day. There is no one to trust. No one to love. Not if they want to live...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;An orphan with no clan that will claim him, Wren Tigarian grew to adulthood under the close scrutiny and mistrust of those around him. A forbidden blend of two animals - snow leopard and white tiger - Wren has never listened to anyone when there was something he wanted. Now he wants Marguerite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marguerite D'Aubert Goudeau is the daughter of a prominent U.S. senator who hates the socialite life she's forced to live. Like her mother before her, she has strong Cajun roots that her father doesn't understand. Still, she has no choice but to try and conform to a world where she feels like an outsider. But the world of rich and powerful humans is never to meet the world of the Were-Hunters who exist side by side with them, unseen, unknown, undetected. To break this law is to call down a wrath of the highest order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to have Marguerite, Wren must fight not just the humans who will never accept his animal nature, but the Were-Hunters who want him dead for endangering their world. It's a race against time and magic without boundary that could cost Marguerite and Wren not just their lives, but their very souls...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Y’all need to get yourselves together. Here’s a newsflash from the only High Priestess you have left at this dang school: Zoey isn’t dead. And believe me, I know dead. I’ve been there, done that and got the fricken tee-shirt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zoey Redbird is the youngest High Priestess in House of Night history and is the only person—vamp or fledgling—that can stop the evil Neferet from raising all kinds of immortal trouble. And she might just have a chance if she wasn’t so busy being dead.Well, dead is too strong a word. Stevie Rae knows she can bring her BFF back from her unscheduled va-cay in the Otherworld. But it’s going to take a lot more than hoping to bring Zoey back. Stevie Rae will have to give up a few secrets of her own...</description>

  <description>So...you'd think after banishing an immortal being and a fallen High Priestess, saving Stark's life, biting Heath, getting a headache from Erik, and almost dying, Zoey Redbird would catch a break. Sadly, a break is not in the House of Night school forecast for the High Priestess in training and her gang. Juggling three guys is anything but a stress reliever, especially when one of them is a sexy Warrior who is so into protecting Zoey that he can sense her emotions. Speaking of stress, the dark force lurking in the tunnels under the Tulsa Depot is spreading, and Zoey is beginning to believe Stevie Rae could be responsible for a lot more than a group of misfit red fledglings. Aphrodite's visions warn Zoey to stay away from Kalona and his dark allure, but they also show that it is Zoey who has the power to stop the evil immortal. Soon it becomes obvious that Zoey has no choice: if she doesn't go to Kalona he will exact a fiery vengeance on those closest to her. Will Zoey have the courage to chance losing her life, her heart, and her soul? Find out in the next spectacular installment in the House of Night Series, "Tempted."</description>

  <description>One year following their deaths in a late-night car accident, teenagers Danielle, Marco, and Christopher return, in spirit, to the sleepy New England suburb of Avon. Over the course of the evening, the three will drift into and out of the lives of those who knew and were affected by them. None is more affected than Tim, survivor of the crash, who plots a grisly act of remembrance, and Brooks, the well-intentioned police officer who first discovered the crash and whose life has changed in startling ways since.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Life sucks when your friends are pissed at you. Just ask Zoey Redbird - she's become an expert on suckiness. In one week she has gone from having three boyfriends to having none, and from having a close group of friends who trusted and supported her, to being an outcast. Speaking of friends, the only two Zoey has left are undead and unMarked. And Neferet has declared war on humans, which Zoey knows in her heart is wrong. But will anyone listen to her? Zoey's adventures at vampyre finishing school take a wild and dangerous turn as loyalties are tested, shocking true intentions come to light, and an ancient evil is awakened in PC and Kristin Cast's spellbinding fourth House of Night novel. (""Recommended for readers age 13 and older"")</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;As an ancient Sumerian god, Sin was one of the most powerful among his pantheon.  . . Until the night Artemis brutally stole his godhood and left him for dead. For millennia, this ex-god turned Dark-Hunter has dreamed only of regaining his powers and seeking revenge on Artemis. If only life were that simple.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Unfortunately he has bigger fish--or in Sin's case--demons, to fry. The lethal gallu that were buried by his pantheon are now stirring and they are hungry for human flesh. Their goal is to destroy mankind and anyone else who gets in their way.  Sin is the only one who can stop them--that is if a certain woman doesn't kill him first. Unfortunately, Sin discovers that now he must rely on her or witness an annihilation of biblical proportions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enemies have always made strange bedfellows, but never more so than when the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Now a man who knows only betrayal must trust the one person most likely to hand him to the demons. Artemis may have stolen his godhood, but this one has stolen his heart. The only question is will she keep it or feed it to the ones who want him dead? &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Welcome to Elsewhere. It is warm, with a breeze, and the beaches are marvelous. It’s quiet and peaceful. You can’t get sick or any older. Curious to see new paintings by Picasso? Swing by one of Elsewhere’s museums. Need to talk to someone about your problems? Stop by Marilyn Monroe’s psychiatric practice. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;     Elsewhere is where fifteen-year-old Liz Hall ends up, after she has died. It is a place so like Earth, yet completely different. Here Liz will age backward from the day of her death until she becomes a baby again and returns to Earth. But Liz wants to turn sixteen, not fourteen again. She wants to get her driver’s license. She wants to graduate from high school and go to college. And now that she’s dead, Liz is being forced to live a life she doesn’t want with a grandmother she has only just met. And it is not going well. How can Liz let go of the only life she has ever known and embrace a new one? Is it possible that a life lived in reverse is no different from a life lived forward?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;     This moving, often funny book about grief, death, and loss will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>Includes "Second Chances" previously included in "Dark-Hunter Collectable Booklet"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consider this handbook your education. Hunter 101. And don't go thinking you got off easy just because there's not a pop quiz at the end. This is the good stuff. The real deal. In here you'll find out all there is to know about being a Dark-Hunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now for the disclaimer: This book is mutable. It goes with the wind. It changes more often than the mind of a sixteen-year-old Gemini with a closet full of clothes and a date in an hour. Don't be surprised if you open it up for the thirty-five thousandth time and find something old, something new, something borrowed or...well you get the point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curl up in a comfy chair with some millennium-old scotch and feast upon the informative banquet I have prepared for your enjoyment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to your new life.</description>

  <description>The House of Night series is set in a world very much like our own, except in 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres have always existed.  In this first book in the series, Zoey enters the House of Night, a school where, after having undergone the Change, she will train to become an adult vampire -- that is, if she makes it through the Change.  Not all of those who are chosen do.  It's tough to begin a new life, away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.  She has been Marked as special by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx.  But she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers.  When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite club, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends.</description>

  <description>Known throughout Tennessee as "Old Kate," the Bell Witch took up residence with John Bell's family in 1818. It was a cruel and noisy spirit, given to rapping and gnawing sounds before it found its voices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these voices and its supernatural acts, the Bell Witch tormented the Bell family. This extraordinary book recounts the only documented case in U.S. history when a spirit actually caused a man's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The local schoolteacher, Richard Powell, witnessed the strange events and recorded them for his daughter. His astonishing manuscript fell into the hands of novelist Brent Monahan, who has prepared the book for publication. Members of the Bell family have previously provided information on this fascinating case, but this book recounts the tale with novelistic vigor and verve. It is truly chilling.</description>

  <description>In May 1996 three expeditions attempted to climb Mount Everest on the Southeast Ridge route pioneered by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Crowded conditions slowed their progress. Late in the day twenty-three men and women-including expedition leaders Scott Fischer and Rob Hall-were caught in a ferocious blizzard. Disoriented and out of oxygen, climbers struggled to find their way down the mountain as darkness approached. Alone and climbing blind, Anatoli Boukreev brought climbers back from the edge of certain death. This new edition includes a transcript of the Mountain Madness expedition debriefing recorded five days after the tragedy, as well as G. Weston DeWalt's response to &lt;em&gt;Into Thin Air &lt;/em&gt;author Jon Krakauer.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller! Michael Jackson’s one and only autobiography – &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;life, in &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;words. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;With original Foreword by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a new Introduction by Motown founder Berry Gordy, and an Afterword by Michael Jackson’s editor and publisher, Shaye Areheart.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I’ve always wanted to be able to tell stories, you know, stories that came from my soul. I’d like to sit by a fire and tell people stories – make them see pictures, make them cry and laugh, take them &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; emotionally with something as deceptively simple as words. I’d like to tell tales to move their souls and transform them. I’ve always wanted to be able to do that. Imagine how the great writers must feel, knowing they have that power. I sometimes feel I &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;do it. It’s something I’d like to develop. In a way, songwriting uses the same skills, creates the emotional highs and lows, but the story is a sketch. It’s quicksilver. There are very few books written on the art of storytelling, how to grip listeners, how to get a group of people together and amuse them. No costumes, no makeup, no nothing, just you and your voice, and your powerful ability to take them anywhere, to transform their lives, if only for minutes.” –Michael Jackson, in &lt;em&gt;Moonwalk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 1988 edition: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Megastar Michael Jackson’s singularly brilliant career and intensely private lifestyle have become a magnificent obsession for millions of rock fans and celebrity watchers throughout the world. His double-platinum singles rocket to the top of the music charts with a velocity equaled only by the inevitable accompaniment of wild rumors about his eccentric personal life. Now for the first time, Michael Jackson breaks the fiercely guarded barrier of silence that has surrounded him in a remarkably candid and courageous book — &lt;em&gt;Moonwalk&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this intimate and often moving personal account of Michael Jackson’s public and private life, he recalls a childhood that was both harsh and joyful but always formidable. Michael and his brothers played amateur music shows and seamy Chicago strip joints until Motown’s corporate image makers turned the Jackson 5 into worldwide superstars. Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5 have combined sales of over 200 million albums. He talks about the happy prankster days of his youth, traveling with his brothers, and of his sometimes difficult relationships with his family over the years. He speaks candidly about the inspiration behind his music, his mesmerizing dance moves, and the compulsive drive to create that has made him one of the biggest stars in the music business and a legend in his own time. &lt;em&gt;The Guinness Book of World Records&lt;/em&gt; lists &lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt; as the biggest-selling-album of all time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Moonwalk&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Jackson shares his personal feelings about some of his most public friends…friends like Diana Ross, Berry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Paul McCartney, Fred Astaire, Marlon Brando, and Katharine Hepburn. He talks openly about the crushing isolation of his fame, of his first love, of his plastic surgery, and of his wholly exceptional career and the often bizarre and unfair rumors that have surrounded it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Illustrated with rare photographs from Jackson family albums and Michael’s personal photographic archives, as well as a drawing done by Michael exclusively for this book, &lt;em&gt;Moonwalk&lt;/em&gt; is a memorable journey to the very heart and soul of a modern musical genius.</description>

  <description>Keith Donohue’s first novel, &lt;em&gt;The Stolen Child&lt;/em&gt;, was a national bestseller hailed as “captivating” (USA Today), “luminous and thrilling” (Washington Post), and “wonderful...So spare and unsentimental that it’s impossible not to be moved (Newsweek. His new novel, &lt;em&gt;Angels of Destruction&lt;/em&gt;, opens on a winter’s night, when a young girl appears at the home of Mrs. Margaret Quinn, a widow who lives alone. A decade earlier, she had lost her only child, Erica, who fled with her high school sweetheart to join a radical student group known as the Angels of Destruction. Before Margaret answers the knock in the dark hours, she whispers a prayer and then makes her visitor welcome at the door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The girl, who claims to be nine years old and an orphan with no place to go, beguiles Margaret, offering some solace, some compensation, for the woman’s loss. Together, they hatch a plan to pass her off as her newly found granddaughter, Norah Quinn, and enlist Sean Fallon, a classmate and heartbroken boy, to guide her into the school and town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their conspiracy is vulnerable not only to those children and neighbors intrigued by Norah’s mysterious and magical qualities but by a lone figure shadowing the girl who threatens to reveal the child’s true identity and her purpose in Margaret’s life. Who are these strangers really? And what is their connection to the past, the Angels, and the long-missing daughter? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angels of Destruction is an unforgettable story of hope and fear, heartache and redemption. The saga of the Quinn family unfolds against an America wracked by change. As it delicately dances on the line between the real and the imagined, this mesmerizing new novel confirms Keith Donohue’s standing as one of our most inspiring and inventive novelists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Fast on the heels of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Book of General Ignorance&lt;/em&gt; comes &lt;em&gt;The Book of Animal Ignorance&lt;/em&gt;, a fun, fact-ﬁlled bestiary that is sure to delight animal lovers everywhere. Arranged alphabetically from aardvark to worm, here are one hundred of the most interesting members of the animal kingdom explained, dissected, and illustrated, with the trademark wit and wisdom of John Lloyd and John Mitchinson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did you know, for instance, that&lt;br&gt;• when a young albatross takes wing, it may stay aloft for ten years&lt;br&gt;• vampire bat saliva—unsurprisingly, when you think about it—is the source of the world’s most powerful blood thinning drug, appropriately called draculin&lt;br&gt;• bombardier beetles fire a boiling chemical spray out of their rears at 300 pulses per second&lt;br&gt;• a bald eagle’s feathers weigh twice as much as its bones&lt;br&gt;• a giant tortoise recently died at the documented age of 255&lt;br&gt;• octopuses are dexterous enough to unscrew tops from jars&lt;br&gt;• spider silk is so light that a strand long enough to circle the world would weigh as much as a bar of soap?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So meet the water bears that can live in suspension for hundreds of years, the parasite carried by your cat that makes men grumpy and women promiscuous, and the woodlouse that drinks through its bottom. Marvel at elephants that walk on tiptoe, pigs that shine in the dark, and woodpeckers that have ears on the ends of their tongues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you still think a pangolin is a musical instrument, that hyenas are dogs, or that sheep are pointless and stupid, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Animal Ignorance&lt;/em&gt; has arrived just in time.</description>

  <description>In her first two books, Byron Katie showed how suffering can be ended by questioning the stressful thoughts that create it, through a process of self-inquiry she calls The Work. Now, in &lt;strong&gt;A Thousand Names for Joy&lt;/strong&gt;, she encourages us to discover the freedom that lives on the other side of inquiry.Stephen Mitchell—the renowned translator of the Tao Te Ching—selected provocative excerpts from that ancient text as a stimulus for Katie to talk about the most essential issues that face us all: life and death, good and evil, love, work, and fulfillment. The result is a book that allows the timeless insights of the Tao Te Ching to resonate anew for us today, while offering a vivid and illuminating glimpse into the life of someone who for twenty years—ever since she “woke up to reality” one morning in 1986—has been living what Lao-tzu wrote more than 2,500 years ago.Katie’s profound, lighthearted wisdom is not theoretical; it is absolutely authentic. That is what makes this book so compelling. It’s a portrait of a woman who is imperturbably joyous, whether she is dancing with her infant granddaughter or finds that her house has been emptied out by burglars, whether she stands before a man about to kill her or embarks on the adventure of walking to the kitchen, whether she learns that she is going blind, flunks a “How Good a Lover Are You?” test, or is diagnosed with cancer. With her stories of total ease in all circumstances, Katie does more than describe the awakened mind; she lets you see it, feel it, in action. And she shows you how that mind is yours as well.</description>

  <description>Nobel Prize-winner Jose Saramago's brilliant new novel poses the question -- what happens when the grim reaper decides there will be no more death? On the first day of the new year, no one dies. This of course causes consternation among politicians, religious leaders, morticians, and doctors. Among the general public, on the other hand, there is initially celebration—flags are hung out on balconies, people dance in the streets. They have achieved the great goal of humanity: eternal life. Then reality hits home—families are left to care for the permanently dying, life-insurance policies become meaningless, and funeral parlors are reduced to arranging burials for pet dogs, cats, hamsters, and parrots. &lt;br&gt;Death sits in her chilly apartment, where she lives alone with scythe and filing cabinets, and contemplates her experiment: What if no one ever died again? What if she, death with a small "d" became human and were to fall in love?</description>

  <description>»Tu, was du willst« lautet die Inschrift auf dem Symbol der unumschränkten Herrschaftsgewalt in Phantásien. Doch was dieser Satz in Wirklichkeit bedeutet, erfährt Bastian erst, als ihn ein magisches Buch in das wunderbare Land entführt. Phantásien ist vom Untergang bedroht. Um das Reich der Kindlichen Kaiserin vor dem Nichts zu retten, muß Bastian immer tiefer in das Land der Irrlichter, Schlafmuffen, Gnomen und Glücksdrachen eindringen und gerät dabei in den Strudel grenzenloser Phantasie.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; is a spine-tingling novel of supernatural suspense from master of horror Joe Hill, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horns.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victoria McQueen has a secret gift for finding things: a misplaced bracelet, a missing photograph, answers to unanswerable questions. On her Raleigh Tuff Burner bike, she makes her way to a rickety covered bridge that, within moments, takes her wherever she needs to go, whether it’s across Massachusetts or across the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles Talent Manx has a way with children. He likes to take them for rides in his 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith with the NOS4A2 vanity plate. With his old car, he can slip right out of the everyday world, and onto the hidden roads that transport them to an astonishing – and terrifying – playground of amusements he calls “Christmasland.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one day, Vic goes looking for trouble—and finds Manx. That was a lifetime ago. Now Vic, the only kid to ever escape Manx’s unmitigated evil, is all grown up and desperate to forget. But Charlie Manx never stopped thinking about Victoria McQueen. He’s on the road again and he’s picked up a new passenger: Vic’s own son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Exclusive to the print editions of &lt;em&gt;NOS4A2&lt;/em&gt; are more than 15 illustrations by award-winning Locke &amp;amp; Key artist Gabriel Rodríguez.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Dating the Prince of Darkness has its challenges...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leila's psychic abilities have been failing her, and now she isn't sure what the future holds. If that weren't enough, her lover, Vlad, has been acting distant. Though Leila is a mere mortal, she's also a modern woman who refuses to accept the cold shoulder treatment forever–especially from the darkly handsome vampire who still won't admit that he loves her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like choosing between eternal love and a loveless eternity...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon circumstances send Leila back to the carnival circuit, where tragedy strikes. And when she finds herself in the crosshairs of a killer who may be closer than she realizes, Leila must decide who to trust– the fiery vampire who arouses her passions like no other or the tortured knight who longs to be more than a friend? With danger stalking her every step of the way, all it takes is one wrong move to damn her for eternity.</description>

  <description>The Tattoo Chronicles is an illustrated diary that offers an intimate look at a crucial year in the personal and professional life of Kat Von D, the charismatic, no-holds-barred tattooer and star of LA Ink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kat does a tattoo, she writes an entry about it in her journal, reflecting not only on the significance of the tattoo for the person who is receiving it but also on how the experience of creating this tattoo affects her personally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these diary entries—some poignant, some hilarious, some confessional—Kat lays it on the line about how doing these tattoos influences her life and art. Here are the highs and the lows, the good, the bad, and the ugly—including her feelings about her fame, family, love life, friends, and fans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visually stunning, this graphically compelling diary is jam-packed with tons of Kat's images, from sketches of her tattoos to the finished works, and candid shots of her unusual personal collections—all photographed by Kat herself. Fans will love reading about her array of clients from all walks of life, including MotÖrhead's Lemmy Kilmister, Dave Navarro, and members of Metallica, Green Day, Kings of Leon, and the Eagles. Throughout The Tattoo Chronicles are captivating, color photographs of Kat that were taken specifically for the book, published here for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here she is: the real Kat Von D: unscripted and uncensored!</description>

  <description>For the past four years, Frank Warren, known as "the most trusted stranger in America," has invited people all over the world to send him creatively decorated postcards bearing secrets they have never before revealed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warren's fifth book presents a never-before-seen collection of the most personal PostSecrets he's ever received—those dealing with life, death, and issues of faith and belief. The book lays bare the confessions of people at every stage of life, from every major faith (or from no faith). Warren's latest collection of secrets is his most profoundly moving yet.</description>

  <description>Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a pair of horns growing from his temples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who had been raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once, the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed. But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. Nothing Ig can do or say matters. Everyone it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone that is, but the devil inside. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Ig is possessed of a terrible new power—a macabre talent he intends to use to find the monster who killed Merrin and destroyed his life. It's time for a little revenge . . . it's time the devil had his due . . .</description>

  <description>Kurt Cobain, Anne Sexton, Mark Rothko, Ernest Hemingway, Adolf Hitler . . . all famous, some rich and powerful, some beloved, some abhorred. But when life and circumstance got to be too much, each headed for the exit door. Sigmund Freud overdosed on morphine. Dorothy Dandridge stripped naked and swallowed a handful of antidepressants. Hunter S. Thompson shot himself while talking to his wife on the phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are the lonely personal nightmares behind celebrity suicides—the deaths and their causes are as diverse as the victims themselves. In &lt;em&gt;Death Becomes Them&lt;/em&gt;, Alix Strauss bids each one a final good-bye while examining the last days and the unbearable incidents that drove these notables to end their lives. She decodes their notes, touches on their accomplishments, and delves into the methodologies of their deaths using autopsy and police reports and personal photos. Strauss also explores the morbid curiosity that feeds our fixation with famously tortured souls and provides lists of other controversial, bizarre, and poorly executed suicides in this mammoth tome.</description>

  <description>(Originally published as Carnival of Souls)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a city of daimons, rigid class lines separate the powerful from the power-hungry. And at the heart of The City is the carnival, where both murder and pleasure are offered up for sale. Once in a generation, the carnival hosts a deadly competition that allows every daimon a chance to join the ruling elite. Without the competition, Aya and Kaleb would both face bleak futures—if for different reasons. For each of them, fighting to the death is the only way to try to live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Mallory knows of The City is that her father—and every other witch there—fled it for a life in exile in the human world. Instead of a typical teenage life full of friends and maybe even a little romance, Mallory scans quiet streets for threats, hides herself away, and trains to be lethal. She knows it's only a matter of time until a daimon finds her and her father, so she readies herself for the inevitable.While Mallory possesses little knowledge of The City, every inhabitant of The City knows of her. There are plans for Mallory, and soon she, too, will be drawn into the decadence and danger that is the carnival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Melissa Marr, bestselling author of the Wicked Lovely series and &lt;em&gt;Graveminder&lt;/em&gt;, comes a brand-new tale of lush secrets, dark love, and the struggle to forge one's own destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Her deadly dreams leave her in grave danger...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since half-vampire Cat Crawfield and her undead lover Bones met six years ago, they've fought against the rogue undead, battled a vengeful Master vampire, and pledged their devotion with a blood bond. Now it's time for a vacation. But their hopes for a perfect Paris holiday are dashed when Cat awakes one night in terror. She's having visions of a vampire named Gregor who's more powerful than Bones and has ties to her past that even Cat herself didn't know about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gregor believes Cat is his and he won't stop until he has her. As the battle begins between the vamp who haunts her nightmares and the one who holds her heart, only Cat can break Gregor's hold over her. She'll need all the power she can summon in order to bring down the baddest bloodsucker she's ever faced . . . even if getting that power will result in an early grave.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Reality TV. Celebutantes. YouTube. Sex Tapes. Gossip Blogs. Drunk Driving. Tabloids. Drug Overdoses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this entertainment? Why do we keep watching? What does it mean for our kids?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the last decade, the face of entertainment has changed radically—and dangerously, as addiction specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky and business and entertainment expert Dr. S. Mark Young argue in this eye-opening new book. The soap opera of celebrity behavior we all consume on a daily basis—stories of stars treating rehab like vacation, brazen displays of abusive and self-destructive "diva" antics on TV, shocking sexual imagery in prime time and online, and a constant parade of stars crashing and burning—attracts a huge and hungry audience. As Pinsky and Young show in &lt;em&gt;The Mirror Effect&lt;/em&gt;, however, such behavior actually points to a wide-ranging psychological dysfunction among celebrities that may be spreading to the culture at large: the condition known as narcissism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The host of VH1's &lt;em&gt;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew&lt;/em&gt; and of the long-running radio show &lt;em&gt;Loveline&lt;/em&gt;, Pinsky recently teamed with Young to conduct the first-ever study of narcissism among celebrities. In the process, they discovered that a high proportion of stars suffer from traits associated with clinical narcissism—including vanity, exhibitionism, entitlement, exploitativeness, self-sufficiency, authority, and superiority. Now, in &lt;em&gt;The Mirror Effect&lt;/em&gt;, they explore how these stars, and the media, are modeling such behavior for public consumption—and how the rest of us, especially young people, are mirroring these dangerous traits in our own behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking at phenomena as diverse as tabloid exploitation (&lt;em&gt;"Stars . . . they're just like us!"&lt;/em&gt;), reality-TV train wrecks (from &lt;em&gt;The Anna Nicole Show&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;My Super Sweet 16&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Bad Girls Club&lt;/em&gt;), gossip websites (TMZ, PerezHilton, Gawker), and the ever-evolving circle of pop divas known as celebutantes (or, more cruelly, celebutards), The Mirror Effect reveals how figures like Britney and Paris and Lindsay and Amy Winehouse—and their media enablers—have changed what we consider "normal" behavior. It traces the causes of disturbing celebrity antics to their roots in self-hatred and ultimately in childhood disconnection or trauma. And it explores how YouTube, online social networks, and personal blogs offer the temptations and dangers of instant celebrity to the most vulnerable among us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Informed and provocative, with the warm and empathetic perspective that has won Dr. Drew Pinsky legions of fans, &lt;em&gt;The Mirror Effect&lt;/em&gt; raises important questions about our changing culture—and provides insights for parents, young people, and anyone who wonders what celebrity culture is doing to America.</description>

  <description>Since the dawn of time, the Faerie have taken. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For seventeen-year-old actress Kelley Winslow, faeries are just something from childhood stories. Then she meets Sonny Flannery, whose steel-gray eyes mask an equally steely determination to protect her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sonny guards the Samhain Gate, which connects the mortal realm with the Faerie's enchanted, dangerous Otherworld. Usually kept shut by order of icy King Auberon, the Gate stands open but once a year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, as the time approaches when the Samhain Gate will swing wide and nightmarish Fae will fight their way into an unsuspecting human world, something different is happening . . . something wondrous and strange. And Kelley's eyes are opening not just to the Faerie that surround her but to the heritage that awaits her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Kelley must navigate deadly Faerie treachery—and her growing feelings for Sonny—in this dazzling page-turner filled with luminous romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondrous Strange&lt;/em&gt; is a richly layered tale of love between faerie and mortal, betrayal between kings and queens, and magic . . . between author and reader.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Unbeknownst to mortals&lt;/em&gt;, a power struggle is unfolding in a world of shadows and danger. After centuries of stability, the balance among the Faery Courts has altered, and Irial, ruler of the Dark Court, is battling to hold his rebellious and newly vulnerable fey together. If he fails, bloodshed and brutality will follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Leslie knows nothing of faeries or their intrigues. When she is attracted to an eerily beautiful tattoo of eyes and wings, all she knows is that she has to have it, convinced it is a tangible symbol of changes she desperately craves for her own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tattoo &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; bring changes - not the kind Leslie has dreamed of, but sinister, compelling changes that are more than symbolic. Those changes will bind Leslie and Irial together, drawing Leslie deeper and deeper into the faery world, unable to resist its allures, and helpless to withstand its perils....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melissa Marr continues her tales of Faerie in a dark, ravishing story of temptation and consequences, and of heroism when least expected.</description>

  <description>Rule #3: &lt;em&gt;Don't stare at invisible faeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislinn has always seen faeries. Powerful and dangerous, they walk hidden in the mortal world. Aislinn fears their cruelty - especially if they learn of her Sight - and wishes she were as blind to their presence as other teens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #2: &lt;em&gt;Don't speak to invisible faeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now faeries are stalking her. One of them, Keenan, who is equal parts terrifying and alluring, is trying to talk to her, asking questions Aislinn is afraid to answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #1: &lt;em&gt;Don't ever attract their attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's too late. Keenan is the Summer King, who has sought his queen for nine centuries. Without her, summer itself will perish. He is determined that Aislinn will become the Summer Queen at any cost — regardless of her plans or desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly none of the rules that have kept Aislinn safe are working anymore, and everything is on the line: her freedom; her best friend, Seth; her life; everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faery intrigue, mortal love, and the clash of ancient rules and modern expectations swirl together in Melissa Marr's stunning twenty-first-century faery tale.</description>

  <description>"This terse account of an American girl's breakdown and treatment gains its considerable power from an objectivity that is extraordinary considering the nature of the material.  Sylvia Plath's attention had the quailty of ruthlessness and ... imagery and rhetoric is disciplined by an unwinking intelligence."     -Stephen Wall in the "Observer"</description>

  <description>I killed and buried my best friend today ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When authorities found Raffi Kodikian -- barely alive -- four days after he and his friend David Coughlin became lost in Rattlesnake Canyon, they made a grim and shocking discovery. Kodikian freely admitted that he had stabbed Coughlin twice in the heart. Had there been a darker motive than mercy? And how could anyone, under any circumstances, kill his best friend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armed with the journal Kodikian and Coughlin carried into Rattle- snake Canyon, Jason Kersten re-creates in riveting detail those fateful days that led to the killing in an infamously unforgiving wilderness.</description>

  <description>"To appreciate &lt;em&gt;Shy Boy,&lt;/em&gt;" writes horse gentler Monty Roberts, "you must see him or his kind running free and easy, in a wide open space." This compelling story, and the breathtaking photographs that accompany it, offer a chance to do just that. During a dramatic three-day ride across miles of high desert, Monty Roberts used all his skill to connect with the little mustang he finally befriended. In the year that followed, Shy Boy grew to love life on the farm, playfully demanding attention, and becoming fascinated by children. After a year of challenges and one frightening illness, the wild horse's exceptional spirit earned the respect and admiration of his trainers. And, as a result of a PBS-aired program based on his initial encounter with Roberts, &lt;em&gt;Shy Boy&lt;/em&gt; gained international fame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet throughout this extraordinary year, Monty Roberts struggled with the question, "Would &lt;em&gt;Shy Boy&lt;/em&gt; rather be free?" With trepidation, he took Shy Boy back to the wild to let him choose. The event, and its stunning conclusion, are memorably captured in these magnificent photographs and in a story that is both unforgettable and inspiring.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Why Good People Do Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; exposes the pervasive and often hidden impulses that influence our everyday decisions. The headlines are full of stories of good people gone astray. They show up on the evening news and are splashed across the weekly tabloids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In many ways, these sad stories have become a national obsession. Yet countless other acts of self-destruction and sabotage take place in our families, in our communities, in our circle of friends. Despite good intentions, “good people” do very bad things—often without understanding why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Debbie Ford guides us into the heart of the duality that unknowingly operates within each one of us: the force that compels us to live by our values, give and receive love, and be a contributing member of the community; and the force that holds us back, sabotages our efforts, and repeatedly steers us toward bad choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ford begins with an examination of what she calls the Beach-Ball Effect—the way in which suppressed emotions eventually rise to the surface—revealing the origins of self-destructive behavior. By describing the never-ending battle between our light and dark sides and then identifying the signposts for potential disaster, Ford helps us understand how we end up damaging the lives we've worked so hard to create. She then breaks new ground by helping us recognize the masks we wear to protect ourselves, including the People Pleaser, the Victim, the Bully, Mister Cool, and the Jokester. Understanding these masks and what they cover up allows us to go beneath the surface, wake up from denial, and become the person we always intended to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Why Good People Do Bad Things&lt;/em&gt; Ford has created her most enduring, expansive, and powerful work to date. Providing the tools to unlock the patterns of self-sabotage, Ford ultimately knocks down the façade of the false self and shows us how to heal the split between light and dark and live the authentic life within our reach.</description>

  <description>Opening on the windswept front of Morecambe Bay, on the remote north-west coast of England, &lt;em&gt;The Electric Michelangelo&lt;/em&gt; is a novel of love, loss and the art of tattooing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the uniquely sensuous and lyrical prose that has already become her trademark, Sarah Hall's remarkable new novel tells the story of Cy Parks, from his childhood years spent in a seaside guest house for consumptives with his mother, Reeda, to his apprenticeship as a tattoo-artist with Eliot Riley - a scraper with a reputation as a Bolshevik and a drinker to boot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His skills acquired and a thirst for experience burning within him, Cy departs for America and the riotous world of the Coney Island boardwalk, where he sets up his own business as 'The Electric Michelangelo'. In this carnival environment of roller-coasters and freak-shows, while the crest of the Edwardian amusement industry wave is breaking, Cy becomes enamoured with Grace, a mysterious East European immigrant and circus performer who commissions him to cover her body entirely with tattooed eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hugely atmospheric, exotic, and familiar, &lt;em&gt;The Electric Michelangelo&lt;/em&gt; is a love story and an exquisitely rendered portrait of seaside resorts on opposite sides of the Atlantic by one of the most uniquely talented novelists of her generation.</description>

      <![CDATA[This book does not give up its secrets easily.  It took about 100 pages for me to settle into its flow and even after, I found that if I wandered away for just a moment, I would be lost and have to backtrack to find my way again.  I did very much enjoy its atmosphere and almost poetic feel.]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fatal collision of three lives in the most intriguing and original crime story since In Cold Blood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine how strange and frightening it would be to see a picture of yourself, not quite a year old, with your mother and two men, one of whom is a confessed serial killer.  This is what happened to Sebastian Junger, and only a small part of what he recounts in &lt;em&gt;A Death in Belmont&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;p&gt; The quiet suburb of Belmont, Massacuusetts, is in the grip of fear. The Boston Strangler murders have taken place nearby, and now there is another shocking sex crime, right in Belmont. The victim is Bessie Goldberg, a middle-aged woman who had hired a cleaning man to help out around the house on that fall day in 1963. He is a black man named Roy Smith.  He did the appointed chores, collected his money and left a receipt on the kitchen table.  Neighbors will say that he looked furtive when he walked down the street, that he was in a hurry, that he stopped to buy cigarettes, that he looked over his shoulder.  They didn't see a black man in Belmont very often, so, of course, they noticed him. So the story went, and on these slender threads, and his own checkered history, Roy Smith is convicted of the Belmont murder and sent to prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the day of the murder, Albert DeSalvo, an Italian-American handyman, is also in Belmont, working as a carpenter in the Junger home, where the picture is taken. Two years after his work for the Jungers, he confesses in vivid detail to the crimes of which the Boston Strangler is accused, and sent to prison, where he is stabbed to death by an inmate.  But he never confesses to the Bessie Goldberg murder.  Could he have left the Junger home, committed the murder a few blocks away and calmly returned to finish his day's work?  Could Roy Smith really have been the guilty party, even though his sentence was commuted after De Salvo confessed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the grand tradition of his bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Storm&lt;/em&gt;, Junger tells a terrific story, lining up all the elements, asking all the pertinent questions, digging into the backgrounds of both men, retelling his mother's very strange encounter with Albert when she is home alone with Sebastian.  He then asks the larger questions:  Was Roy Smith convicted summarily because he was black?  Was Albert De Salvo really the Boston Strangler? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Junger cannot answer all the questions, as no one can.  Without DNA, there is no way to be certain of which of the two men might have committed the rape and murder of Bessie Goldberg, or if neither of them is guilty.  While it is frustrating not to know for sure, the story is fascinating, reads like a tautly plotted mystery thriller, and Junger's close connection is downright creepy.  &lt;em&gt;--Valerie Ryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>After reverently lambasting the most cherished rites and credos of virtually every one of the world's major religions in his transcendently hilarious novel &lt;em&gt;Lamb&lt;/em&gt;, the one and only Christopher Moore returns with a wild look at interspecies communication, adventure on the high seas, and an eons-old mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn is in love -- with the salt air and sun-drenched waters off Maui ... and especially with the majestic ocean-dwelling behemoths that have been bleeping and hooting their haunting music for more than twenty million years. But just why do the humpback whales sing? That's the question that has Nate and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing any large marine mammal that crosses their path. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one on Nate's team has ever seen such a thing; not his longtime partner, photographer Clay Demodocus, not their saucy young research assistant, Amy. Not even spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman, Kona (the former Preston Applebaum of New Jersey), could boast such a sighting in one of his dope-induced hallucinations. And when a roll of film returns from the lab missing the crucial tail shot -- and their research facility is summarily trashed -- Nate realizes that something very fishy indeed is going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, apparently, is big, involving dangerously interested other parties -- competitive researchers, the cutthroat tourist industry, perhaps even the military. The weirdness only gets weirder when a call comes in from Nate's big-bucks benefactor saying that a whale has made contact -- by phone. Andit's asking for a hot pastrami and Swiss on rye. Suddenly the answer to the question that has daunted and driven Nate throughout his adult life is within his reach. But it's waiting for him in the form of an amazing adventure beneath the waves, 623 feet down, somewhere off the coast of Chile. And it's not what anyone would think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It must be said: Christopher Moore's &lt;em&gt;Fluke&lt;/em&gt; is a whale of a novel.</description>

  <description>Under the streets of London there's a place most people could never even dream of. A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, knights in armour and pale girls in black velvet. This is the city of the people who have fallen between the cracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Mayhew, a young businessman, is going to find out more than enough about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his workday existence and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and utterly bizarre. And a strange destiny awaits him down here, beneath his native city: Neverwhere.</description>

  <description>In the&lt;br&gt; beginning&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was the Serpent, there for Eve's awakening, and for all the days since. Teacher, mentor, companion, friend, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was God. The Creator. Quick to anger. Dangerous. Majestic.There was Adam: as God said, a joy to behold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And there was Eve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These four hold the future in their hands. And only Eve -- or perhaps the Serpent, too -- wonders what lies outside the Garden of Eden.</description>

  <description>After the grisly murder of his entire family, a toddler wanders into a graveyard where the ghosts and other supernatural residents agree to raise him as one of their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead. There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack—who has already killed Bod's family . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beloved master storyteller Neil Gaiman returns with a luminous new novel for the audience that embraced his New York Times bestselling modern classic Coraline. Magical, terrifying, and filled with breathtaking adventures, The Graveyard Book is sure to enthrall readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>Fire Lover is the incredible true story of John Orr who, as a young boy growing up in Los Angeles, watched with awe as firefighters scrambled to put out blazes with a seeming disregard for their own lives. Wanting to emulate his heroes, he later became a fireman with the Glendale Fire Department. An eccentric loner who made few friends, Orr moonlighted as a security guard, eventually becoming a fire captain and one of Southern California s most renowned serial-arson investigators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though he successfully helped apprehend a string of petty arsonists, there was one serial criminal Orr couldn t track down one who was responsible for the deaths of four people. These perfectly executed blazes were set by a fire lover who used the same simple yet devastating device time after time. He went undiscovered until one day when he left a fingerprint, one clue investigators could match. When they did, they were stunned to discover that the print belonged to none other than John Orr.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using interviews, case records, and hundreds of thousands of pages of court transcriptions, Joseph Wambaugh writes a chilling, sophisticated, and suspenseful story that is destined to rank beside his previous bestsellers.</description>

  <description>Rebekkah Barrow never forgot the tender attention her grandmother, Maylene, bestowed upon the dead of Claysville. While growing up, Rebekkah watched as Maylene performed the same unusual ritual at every funeral: three sips from a small silver flask followed by the words, ""Sleep well, and stay where I put you.""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Maylene is gone and Bek must return to the hometown--and the man--she abandoned a decade ago, only to discover that Maylene's death was not natural . . . and there was good reason for her odd traditions. In Claysville, the worlds of the living and the dead are dangerously connected--and beneath the town lies a shadowy, lawless land ruled by the enigmatic Charles, aka Mr. D. From this dark place the deceased will return if their graves are not properly minded. And only the Graveminder, a Barrow woman, and the current Undertaker, Byron, can set things to right once the dead begin to walk. . . .</description>

Recapturing their night of unparalleled passion won’t be easy—but love won’t be denied… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter Winston is a successful business man and a captain in the National Guard. On the night before his second tour in Afghanistan, he and his partners at Kensington &amp;amp; Associates head out to enjoy an upscale BDSM club. While the evening begins with laughter and whiskey, it takes a sharp turn when Peter, a sexual Dominant, sets his eyes on a beautiful masked submissive… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Army Sergeant Dana Smith doesn’t often seek the shelter of a man, but being Peter’s gives her a welcome sense of sanctuary. What begins as a night of fantastic pleasure becomes something they hope will never end. But duty calls, and it will be over a year before they can see each other again. And when they do, things have drastically changed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Severely injured in the line of duty, Dana has lost her sight and her will to live. But Peter doesn’t accept defeat in business, battle or love. With the talents of the other K&amp;amp;A males, he’ll set the stage for another special night for them, knowing that only a submissive’s willingness to trust her Master will bring her back to love and life again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes a preview of the next novel in the bestselling Vampire Queen series, Taken By a Vampire &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honor Bound previously appeared in Laced With Desire.</description>

  <description>The steamy outtake that takes readers even further into Laurell K. Hamilton’s bestselling novel, Kiss the Dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’d think I’d get used to seeing such a beautiful man and knowing he was mine, but it never grew old, as if his beauty and the fact that he was mine, and I was his, would forever surprise me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a vampire like Jean Claude around, it’s far too easy for Anita Blake to doubt her own appearance—and the hold it has on those who love her. But one hot tub and two incredibly sexy men—Jean Claude and Asher—will make her feel like the most lusted-after woman alive…or undead. Not bad for a mere human…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes an excerpt of Kiss the Dead, the new Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novel.</description>

  <description>The time is the present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The place, the rugged coast of northern California. A bluff high above the Pacific. A grand mansion full of beauty and tantalizing history set against a towering redwood forest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young reporter on assignment from the San Francisco Observer. . . an older woman, welcoming him into her magnificent, historic family home that he has been sent to write about and that she must sell with some urgency . . . A chance encounter between two unlikely people . . . an idyllic night—shattered by horrific unimaginable violence. . .The young man inexplicably attacked—bitten—by a beast he cannot see in the rural darkness . . . A violent episode that sets in motion a terrifying yet seductive transformation as the young man, caught between ecstasy and horror, between embracing who he is evolving into and fearing who—what—he will become, soon experiences the thrill of the wolf gift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he resists the paradoxical pleasure and enthrallment of his wolfen savagery and delights in the power and (surprising) capacity for good, he is caught up in a strange and dangerous rescue and is desperately hunted as “the Man Wolf,” by authorities, the media and scientists (evidence of DNA threaten to reveal his dual existence). . . As a new and profound love enfolds him, questions emerge that propel him deeper into his mysterious new world: questions of why and how he has been given this gift; of its true nature and the curious but satisfying pull towards goodness; of the profound realization that there are others like him who may be watching—guardian creatures who have existed throughout time and may possess ancient secrets and alchemical knowledge and throughout it all, the search for salvation for a soul tormented by a new realm of temptations, and the fraught, exhilarating journey, still to come, of being and becoming, fully, both wolf and man.</description>

      <![CDATA[As a lifelong Anne Rice fan, I so wanted to love this book, but I didn't.  It is just okay.  Maybe I had forgotten how she meanders and how every one of her last half dozen or so books wanders off into a huge theological debate.]]>

  <description>Catherine has been enjoying the single life for long enough to know a good catch when she sees one. Gorgeous, charismatic, spontaneous - Lee seems almost too perfect to be true. And her friends clearly agree, as each in turn falls under his spell. But there is a darker side to Lee. His erratic, controlling and sometimes frightening behaviour means that Catherine is increasingly isolated. Driven into the darkest corner of her world, and trusting no one, she plans a meticulous escape. Four years later, struggling to overcome her demons, Catherine dares to believe she might be safe from harm. Until one phone call changes everything. This is an edgy and powerful first novel, utterly convincing in its portrayal of obsession, and a tour de force of suspense.</description>

  <description>For most of us, traveling means visiting the most beautiful places on Earth—Paris, the Taj Mahal, the Grand Canyon. It’s rare to book a plane ticket to visit the lifeless moonscape of Canada’s oil sand strip mines, or to seek out the Chinese city of Linfen, legendary as the most polluted in the world. But in &lt;em&gt;Visit Sunny Chernobyl&lt;/em&gt;, Andrew Blackwell embraces a different kind of travel, taking a jaunt through the most gruesomely polluted places on Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the hidden bars and convenience stores of a radioactive wilderness to the sacred but reeking waters of India, &lt;em&gt;Visit Sunny Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;fuses immersive first-person reporting with satire and analysis, making the case that it’s time to start appreciating our planet as it is—not as we wish it would be. Irreverent and reflective, the book is a love letter to our biosphere’s most tainted, most degraded ecosystems, and a measured consideration of what they mean for us. Equal parts travelogue, expose, environmental memoir, and faux guidebook, Blackwell careens through a rogue’s gallery of environmental disaster areas in search of the worst the world has to offer—and approaches a deeper understanding of what’s really happening to our planet in the process.</description>

  <description>Erotic romance -- M/M/F menage&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a conservative Long Island university, Dr. Emmaline Silvay has two great loves -- her life-saving work and her younger research associate. But this love is impossible. After all, she's his boss and he lives with his girlfriend. But his "girlfriend" turns out to be his boyfriend, a gentle and beautiful supermodel. Resigned to a platonic friendship, she accepts a weekend invitation, but the men have far more passionate ideas. They want her to "be a part of them". A three-way love defies propriety and the strict rules of her University. The supermodel's fame makes secrecy impossible. The menage threatens her carefully constructed world. Something must be given up. Someone's heart will be broken.</description>

  <description>Zoey is finally home where she belongs, safe with her Guardian Warrior, Stark, by her side, and preparing to face off against Neferet - which would be a whole lot easier if the High Counsel saw the ex-High Priestess for what she really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are new forces at work at the House of Night. An influx of humans, including Lenobia's handsome horse whisperer, threatens their precarious stability. And then there's the mysterious Aurox, a jaw-droppingly gorgeous teen boy who is actually more - or possibly less - than human. Only Zoey can sense the part of his soul that remains human, the compassion that wars with his Dark calling. And there's something strangely familiar about him...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Neferet's true nature be revealed before she succeeds in silencing them all? And will Zoey be able to touch Aurox's humanity in time to protect him - and everyone - from his own fate?</description>

  <description>Having narrowly averted an (under)world war, Cat Crawfield wants nothing more than a little downtime with her vampire husband, Bones. Unfortunately, her gift from New Orleans' voodoo queen just keeps on giving--leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centuries ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity--forever. But how do you kill a killer who's already long dead?</description>

  <description>Nick Gautier’s day just keeps getting better and better. Yeah, he survived the zombie attacks, only to wake up and find himself enslaved to a world of shapeshifters and demons out to claim his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His new principal thinks he’s even more of a hoodlum than the last one, his coach is trying to recruit him to things he can’t even mention and the girl he’s not seeing, but is, has secrets that terrify him.&lt;br&gt;                                    &lt;br&gt;But more than that, he’s being groomed by the darkest of powers and if he doesn’t learn how to raise the dead by the end of the week, he will become one of them...</description>

  <description>Elizabeth has a new job at an unusual library - a lending library of objects, not books. In a secret room in the basement lies the Grimm Collection. That's where the librarians lock away powerful items straight out of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales; seven-league boots, a table that produces a feast at the blink of an eye, Snow White's stepmother's sinister mirror that talks in riddles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the magical objects start to disappear, Elizabeth embarks on a dangerous quest to catch the thief before she can be accused of the crime or captured by the thief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Polly Shulman has created a contemporary fantasy with a fascinating setting and premise, starring an ordinary girl whose after-school job is far from ordinary and leads to a world of excitement, romance and magical intrigue.</description>

  <description>""My love, speak to me. Tell me everything." Neferet went to Kalona, kneeling before him, stroking the soft, dark wings that unfurled loosely around the immortal. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""What would you have me say?" He didn't meet her eyes. "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" "Zoey lives." Neferet's voice was flat, cold, lifeless."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""She does.""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""Then you owe me the subservience of your immortal soul." She started to walk away from him."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""Where are you going? What will happen next?""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" "It is quite simple. I will ensure Zoey is drawn back to Oklahoma. There, on my own terms, I will complete the task you failed.""&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exonerated by the Vampyre High Council and returned to her position of High Priestess at Tulsa's House of Night, Neferet has sworn vengeance on Zoey. Dominion over Kalona is only one of the weapons she plans to use against Z. But Zoey has found sanctuary on the Isle of Skye and is being groomed by Queen Sgiach to take over for her there. Being Queen would be cool, wouldn't it? Why should she return to Tulsa? After losing her human consort, Heath, she will never be the same - and her relationship with her super-hot-warrior, Stark, may never be the same either...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what about Stevie Rae and Rephaim? The Raven Mocker refuses to be used against Stevie Rae, but what choice does he have when no one in the entire world, including Zoey, would be okay with their relationship? Does he betray his father or his heart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the pulse-pounding 8th book in the bestselling House of Night series, how far will the bonds of friendship stretch and how strong are the ties that bind one girl's heart?</description>

  <description>Savannah was groomed from birth to take the reins of her father’s manufacturing empire. Her emotional armor is as tough as the steel used in her factories, and nobody is allowed past it. Business partner Matt realizes that the key to entry is to command her submission. Calling on the unique sensual talents of his four-man management team, he engineers an aggressive and erotic takeover, determined to rescue the woman he loves from the steel cage she’s manufactured around her heart. Masked and lost to the sensations the team arouses in her, Savannah is theirs, at least for this one night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher’s Note:  Originally published in the Behind the Mask anthology.</description>

  <description>Her car disabled during a tropical storm, Jessica Randall discovers the isolated house where she's sheltering is a private bondage club. At first shocked, she soon becomes aroused watching the interactions between the Doms and their subs. But she's a professional woman--an accountant--and surely isn't a submissive...is she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master Z hasn't been so attracted to a woman in years. But the little sub who has wandered into his club intrigues him. She's intelligent. Reserved. Conservative. After he discovers her interest in BDSM, he can't resist tying her up and unleashing the passion she hides within.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Alternate Cover ISBN: 0060915544/9780060915544&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clear-eyed and spirited, Taylor Greer grew up poor in rural Kentucky with the goals of avoiding pregnancy and getting away. But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has acquired a completely unexpected child, a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Twenty years ago, a boy named Jack Sawyer travelled to a parallel universe called The Territories to save his mother and her Territories "twinner" from a premature and agonizing death that would have brought cataclysm to the other world. Now Jack is a retired Los Angeles homicide detective living in the nearly nonexistent hamlet of Tamarack, WI. He has no recollection of his adventures in the Territories and was compelled to leave the police force when an odd, happenstance event threatened to awaken those memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a series of gruesome murders occur in western Wisconsin that are reminiscent of those committed several decades earlier by a real-life madman named Albert Fish, the killer is dubbed "The Fisherman" and Jack's buddy, the local chief of police, begs Jack to help his inexperienced force find him. But is this merely the work of a disturbed individual, or has a mysterious and malignant force been unleashed in this quiet town? What causes Jack's inexplicable waking dreams, if that is what they are, of robins' eggs and red feathers? It's almost as if someone is trying to tell him something. As that message becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, Jack is drawn back to the Territories and to his own hidden past, where he may find the soul-strength to enter a terrifying house at the end of a deserted track of forest, there to encounter the obscene and ferocious evils sheltered within it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A guided tour through the burgeoning business of exorcism and the darker side of American life&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no other religious ritual more fascinating, or more disturbing, than exorcism.  This is particularly true in America today, where the ancient rite has a surprisingly strong hold on our imagination, and on our popular entertainment industry.  We’ve all heard of exorcism, seen the movies and read the books, but few of us have ever experienced it firsthand.&lt;br&gt;Conducted by exorcists officially appointed by Catholic archdioceses and by maverick priests sidestepping Church sanctions, by evangelical ministers and Episcopal charismatics, exorcism is alive and well in the new millennium. Oprah, Diane Sawyer, and Barbara Walters have featured exorcists on their shows. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;, and other publications have charted the proliferation of exorcisms across the United States. Last year, the Archdiocese of Chicago appointed its first full-time exorcist in its 160-year history; in New York, four priests have officially investigated about forty cases of suspected possession every year since 1995. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American Exorcism&lt;/strong&gt; is an inside look at this burgeoning phenomenon, written with objectivity, insight, and just the right touch of irony. Michael W. Cuneo attended more than fifty exorcisms and interviewed many of the participants–both the exorcists who performed the rituals and the people from all walks of life who believed they were possessed by the devil. He brings vividly to life the ceremonies themselves, conjuring up memories of Linda Blair’s astonishing performance in the 1973 movie &lt;em&gt;The Exorcist&lt;/em&gt; and other bizarre (and sometimes stomach-churning) images. Cuneo dissects, as well, the arguments of such well-known exorcism advocates as Malachi Martin, author of the controversial &lt;strong&gt;Hostage to the Devil&lt;/strong&gt;, self-help guru M. Scott Peck, and self-professed demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren of &lt;em&gt;Amityville Horror &lt;/em&gt;fame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he explores this netherworld of American life, Cuneo reflects on the meaning of exorcism in the twenty-first century and on the relationship between religious ritual and popular culture. Touching on such provocative topics as the “satanic panics” of the 1980s, repressed memory, and ritual abuse, &lt;strong&gt;American Exorcism&lt;/strong&gt; is a remarkably revealing, consistently entertaining work of cultural commentary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Flirting with the Grave...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half-vampire Catherine Crawfield is going after the undead with a vengeance, hoping that one of these deadbeats is her father - the one responsible for ruining her mother's life. Then she's captured by Bones, a vampire bounty hunter, and is forced into an unholy partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for finding her father, Cat agrees to train with the sexy night stalker until her battle reflexes are as sharp as his fangs. She's amazed she doesn't end up as his dinner - are there actually &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; vampires? Pretty soon Bones will have her convinced that being half-dead doesn't have to be all bad. But before she can enjoy her newfound status as kick-ass demon hunter, Cat and Bones are pursued by a group of killers. Now Cat will have to choose a side . . . and Bones is turning out to be as tempting as any man with a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Middle Ages. Finally, the Black Plague has passed and for a while it seems evil has been defeated. Europe recovers; prosperity returns, trade resumes, and people slowly recover from the effects of the plague. Then, just as the Church relaxes its guard, war spreads across Europe. Widespread heresies challenge the authority of the Church. Revolts and rebellions threaten to topple the established monarchies and overturn the social order of Europe. And then the plague returns, worse than ever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas Neville, a neurotic warrior-priest, eventually discovers the cause. The minions of the Devil have been scattered throughout European society during the confusion of the Black Death. His task is to discover the identities of these shapeshifters so that the Church can move against them, but it is a dangerous task. These are master shapeshifters, perfect at their craft, and Neville can never be certain of who he should trust.</description>

  <description>Dal buio della galleria abbandonata cosparsa di cocci e bottiglie rotte dove è stata violentata la notte dell'ultimo giorno di corso, mentre attraversava il parco diretta al pensionato studentesco, Alice Sebold ci consegna una sconvolgente rivelazione: "Io divenni tutt'uno con quell'uomo. Quell'uomo teneva in mano la mia vita..." Il racconto di questo trauma violento che imprime un segno fondamentale nella sua vita, ci trascina in una esperienza sconvolgente. Alice non tralascia alcun particolare, i più segreti ingranaggi psicologici, sociali, familiari, che entrano in gioco a partire dallo stupro subito, modificano la percezione del mondo, di se stessa e le relazioni con gli altri. E nulla viene lasciato fuori dalla sua affilata e dolorosa analisi.</description>

  <description>In the 11 days following the Chernobyl catastrophe on April 26, 1986, more than 116,000 people were permanently evacuated from the area surrounding the nuclear power plant. Declared unfit for human habitation, the Zones of Exclusion includes the towns of Pripyat (established in the 1970s to house workers) and Chernobyl. In May 2001, Robert Polidori photographed what was left behind in the this dead zone. His richly detailed images move from the burned-out control room of Reactor 4, where technicians staged the experiment that caused the disaster, to the unfinished apartment complexes, ransacked schools and abandoned nurseries that remain as evidence of those who once called Pripyat home. Nearby, trucks and tanks used in the cleanup efforts rest in an auto graveyard, some covered in lead shrouds and others robbed of parts. Houseboats and barges rust in the contaminated waters of the Pripyat River. Foliage grows over the sidewalks and hides the modest homes of Chernobyl. In his large-scale photographs, Polidori captures the faded colors and desolate atmosphere of these two towns, producing haunting documents that present the reader with a rare view of not just a disastrous event, but a place and the people who lived there.</description>

  <description>Cameron Jamie's calling is tracking down extreme social phenomena and presenting them in short documentary films. His best known film, "BB," documents "backyard wrestling" among working-class kids in his native San Fernando Valley. In "Spook Houses," he explores a suburban Chicago community that takes a little too much pleasure in the macabre at Halloween, transforming front lawns into cemeteries and kitchens into mausoleums. And in "Kranky Claus, " a film about Krampus rituals in Austria, he accompanies those legendary demons on their nightmarish pre-Christmas tour, thrashing frightened children. As Jamie says of his subjects and as he proves to his audiences, "The creepiest things in the world are always the things that are considered to be the most OEormal.'"</description>

  <description>For almost 3,000 years apocalypse prophecies have convinced people all over the world that the future is about to give them the world they want instead of the world they’ve got. All the end time prophecies splashed across the media in every age have had something else in common: every one of them has been wrong. &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse Not&lt;/em&gt; is a lively and engaging survey of predictions about the end of the world, along with the failed dreams and nightmares that have clustered around them. Among the stories highlighted in &lt;em&gt;Apocalypse Not&lt;/em&gt; are: the birth of the apocalypse meme out of archaic star myths in the ancient Middle East; the failed end time prophecies of Nostradamus, Mother Shipton, and other famous prophets; the long and murky road from the Great Pyramid to today’s Rapture beliefs; and the real origins of the belief in apocalypse in 2012 (hint: it’s not originally Mayan at all).</description>

  <description>Erik Ruhling assembles an unmatched array of torture tools invented exclusively for the infliction of pain and the ending of life, each carefully researched with an accompanying full-color, highly detailed rendering. This beautifully presented book features classics like the Iron Maiden and the Guillotine, as well as more rarified connoisseur’s fare such as the Scavenger’s Daughter and the Ear Chopper. And if the Tongue Tearer is not to your taste, there’s always the Breast Ripper or the Drunkard’s Cloak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erik Ruhling&lt;/strong&gt; is a graphic designer and the curator of &lt;a href="http://www.occasionalhell.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.occasionalhell.com&lt;/a&gt;. He holds degrees in anthropology and English and lives in Atlanta, Georgia, in a house without a dungeon (unfortunately).</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;�I am often asked why I chose to paint faeries. The answer is—I didn’t, they chose me!”&lt;/em&gt;  For artist Linda Ravenscroft, capturing the fairy world on paper is nothing less than a calling. &lt;em&gt;Enchanted&lt;/em&gt; is her third book devoted to these fantastical creatures, and it is her finest work yet. Linda has created images rich in detail and magic, able to transport viewers into mysterious other realms. In addition to the paintings, she reveals a little about her artistic approach…but generally lets the work speak for itself. A gorgeous gift book for fairy-lovers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>In The Four Agreements shamanic teacher and healer Don Miguel Ruiz exposes self-limiting beliefs and presents a simple yet effective code of personal conduct learned from his Toltec ancestors. Full of grace and simple truth, this handsomely designed book makes a lovely gift for anyone making an elementary change in life, and it reads in a voice that you would expect from an indigenous shaman.</description>

  <description>When Caroline Roberts accepted a job at 25 Cromwell Street, the infamous address of Fred and Rose West, she was only 16. Realizing that there was something very malevolent about the couple, she left their employment soon after, glad to be rid of them. The story should have ended there, but a month, later she was abducted by the Wests and suffered violent sexual abuse at their hands before being told that she would be killed and buried. Through a combination of luck and quick thinking, depite the trauma of what had happened, Caroline managed to escape to freedom. This is her story of those fateful days and the appalling aftermath.</description>

  <description>In 2009, tastemaker and bestselling author Lena Corwin turned the top floor of her Brooklyn brownstone into a studio and began hosting classes for local crafters. In Lena Corwin’s Made by Hand, she re-creates and builds upon her popular workshop series in order to reach crafters in Brooklyn and beyond. For this “best of” collection, she has chosen expert teachers and her favorite projects: Jenny Gordy introduces us to knitted socks and elegantly sewn tops and dresses; Cal Patch teaches how to make a modern embroidery sampler as well as a braided rag rug; and Corwin herself presents her favorite screen-printing and stamping techniques. In total, there are 26 lessons/projects, all presented with step-by-step photos and illustrations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for Lena Corwin's Made By Hand:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Decorate with coffee table books. A few Glamour picks: Lena Corwin’s Made by Hand . . .” —Glamour Magazine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A must-have for anyone who wants to create unique décor.” —Decorating Shortcuts magazine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Made By Hand offers the perfect range of usable textile handiwork, presented by fourteen teachers who obviously enjoy their craft —ForeWord Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The 385 detailed illustrations, along with excellent step-by-step photographs and clear instructions, make each project tempting and approachable.” —Studios magazine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Those messy hands alone are inspiring me to get creative.” —Modern Eve&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I got a sneak peek at a mostly lovely book. I can’t contain my excitement over this book. The projects are varied and so much fun.” —The Stylish Nest&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The photography and layout of the book is gorgeous: wide open with lots of white space, reminiscent of Japanese craft books. And there are people, whole people, sitting and doing crafts, not just disembodied hands. Isn’t that part of the reason we craft—for the human contact?” —Knitty.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Made By Hand offers the perfect range of usable textile handiwork, presented by fourteen teachers who obviously enjoy their craft.” —ForeWord Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Made By Hand is gorgeous . . . filled to the brim with beautifully executed diy tutorials from a host of talented artisans.” —Michelle S Blog</description>

      <![CDATA[I really enjoyed the first say, 3/4 of this book.  I enjoyed hearing about how the author faced his many adversities and triumphed against them without boasting, exaggerating or begging for pity.  As I came towards the end of the book though, that feeling seemed to be lost... There was never a sear...]]>

  <description>Most of us know what it feels like to fall under the spell of food—when one slice of pizza turns into half a pie, or a handful of chips leads to an empty bag. But it’s harder to understand why we can't seem to stop eating—even when we know better. When we want so badly to say "no," why do we continue to reach for food? Dr. David Kessler, the dynamic former FDA commissioner who reinvented the food label and tackled the tobacco industry, now reveals how the food industry has hijacked the brains of millions of Americans. The result? America’s number-one public health issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kessler cracks the code of overeating by explaining how our bodies and minds are changed when we consume foods that contain sugar, fat, and salt. Food manufacturers create products by manipulating these ingredients to stimulate our appetites, setting in motion a cycle of desire and consumption that ends with a nation of overeaters. &lt;em&gt;The End of Overeating&lt;/em&gt; explains for the first time why it is exceptionally difficult to resist certain foods and why it’s so easy to overindulge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Kessler met with top scientists, physicians, and food industry insiders. &lt;em&gt;The End of Overeating&lt;/em&gt; uncovers the shocking facts about how we lost control over our eating habits—and how we can get it back. Dr. Kessler presents groundbreaking research, along with what is sure to be a controversial view inside the industry that continues to feed a nation of overeaters—from popular brand manufacturers to advertisers, chain restaurants, and fast food franchises.  For the millions of people struggling with weight as well as for those of us who simply don't understand why we can't seem to stop eating our favorite foods, Dr. Kessler’s cutting-edge investigation offers new insights and helpful tools to help us find a solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has never been a more thorough, compelling, or in-depth analysis of why we eat the way we do.</description>

  <description>The Golden Gate Bridge links the urbanity of San Francisco with the wild headlands of Marin County, as if to suggest the paradox of California and America itself—the place that Fitzgerald saw as the last spot commensurate with the human capacity for wonder. The bridge, completed in 1937, also announced to the world America's engineering prowess and full assumption of its destined continental dominance. The Golden Gate is a counterpart to the Statue of Liberty, pronouncing American achievement in an unmistakable American fashion. The nation's very history is expressed in the bridge's art deco style and stark verticality. &lt;br&gt;Kevin Starr's &lt;em&gt;Golden Gate &lt;/em&gt;is a brilliant and passionate telling of the history of the bridge, and the rich and peculiar history of the California experience. The Golden Gate is a grand public work, a symbol and a very real bridge, a magnet for both postcard photographs and suicides. In this compact but comprehensive narrative, Starr unfolds the hidden-in-plain-sight meaning of the Golden Gate, putting it in its place among classic works of art.</description>

  <description>What really drives success and failure?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Can I trust you? It’s the question that strikes at the heart of human existence. Whether we’re talking about business partnerships, romantic relationships, child-parent bonds, or the brave new world of virtual interaction, trust, when correctly placed, is what makes our world spin and lives flourish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Renowned psychologist David DeSteno brings together the latest research from diverse fields, including psychology, economics, biology, and robotics, to create a compelling narrative about the forces that have shaped the human mind’s propensities to trust. He shows us how trust influences us at every level, from how we learn, to how we love, to how we spend, to how we take care of our own health and well-being. Using cuttingedge research from his own lab, he also unlocks, for the first time, the cues that allow us to read the trustworthiness of others accurately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Appealing to readers of Dan Ariely, Dan Gilbert, and David Eaglemen, &lt;em&gt;The Truth About Trust&lt;/em&gt; offers a new paradigm that will change not only how you think about trust, but also how you understand, communicate, and make decisions in every area of your life.</description>

  <description>Video From "The Chemist's War" (&lt;em&gt;Slate Magazine&lt;/em&gt;), by Deborah Blum &lt;strong&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer Deborah Blum follows New York City's first forensic scientists to discover a fascinating Jazz Age story of chemistry and detection, poison and murder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Deborah Blum, writing with the high style and skill for suspense that is characteristic of the very best mystery fiction, shares the untold story of how poison rocked Jazz Age New York City. In &lt;em&gt;The Poisoner's Handbook&lt;/em&gt; Blum draws from highly original research to track the fascinating, perilous days when a pair of forensic scientists began their trailblazing chemical detective work, fighting to end an era when untraceable poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Drama unfolds case by case as the heroes of &lt;em&gt;The Poisoner's Handbook&lt;/em&gt;—chief medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler—investigate a family mysteriously stricken bald, Barnum and Bailey's Famous Blue Man, factory workers with crumbling bones, a diner serving poisoned pies, and many others. Each case presents a deadly new puzzle and Norris and Gettler work with a creativity that rivals that of the most imaginative murderer, creating revolutionary experiments to tease out even the wiliest compounds from human tissue. Yet in the tricky game of toxins, even science can't always be trusted, as proven when one of Gettler's experiments erroneously sets free a suburban housewife later nicknamed "America's Lucretia Borgia" to continue her nefarious work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From the vantage of Norris and Gettler's laboratory in the infamous Bellevue Hospital it becomes clear that killers aren't the only toxic threat to New Yorkers. Modern life has created a kind of poison playground, and danger lurks around every corner. Automobiles choke the city streets with carbon monoxide; potent compounds, such as morphine, can be found on store shelves in products ranging from pesticides to cosmetics. Prohibition incites a chemist's war between bootleggers and government chemists while in Gotham's crowded speakeasies each round of cocktails becomes a game of Russian roulette. Norris and Gettler triumph over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice during a remarkably deadly time. A beguiling concoction that is equal parts true crime, twentieth-century history, and science thriller, &lt;em&gt;The Poisoner's Handbook&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turning account of a forgotten New York.</description>

  <description>In 2000–2001, Michael Jackson sat down with his close friend and spiritual guide, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, to record what turned out to be the most intimate and revealing conversations of his life. It was Michael’s wish to bare his soul and unburden himself to a public that he knew was deeply suspicious of him. The resulting thirty hours are the basis of &lt;em&gt;The Michael Jackson Tapes&lt;/em&gt;. There has never been, and never will be, anything like them.In these searingly honest conversations, Michael exposes his emotional pain and profound loneliness, his longing to be loved, and the emptiness of his fame. You discover why he was suspicious of women and how only children provided the innocence for which he so desperately longed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his own words, he takes us into the jarring moments of his childhood and speaks of the measures he took to try and heal. He divulges how he came to be alienated from his strong religious anchor and describes his views on the nature of faith. Michael brings us into his tortured yet loving relationship with his siblings. He opens up about his father and his yearning for a time when they might finally reconcile. He talks about his most personal friendships and shares with us his terror of growing old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite his unprecedented fame and recent death, there remain unanswered questions about his life. The answers, presented here in &lt;em&gt;The Michael Jackson Tapes&lt;/em&gt;, will both intrigue and move you. You will be surprised, riveted, and troubled as you peer into the soul of a tragic icon whose life is an American morality tale and whose flame was extinguished much too early.&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I wavered between three and four stars and finally decided to round it down.  Even with so many of his own words, this book left Michael Jackson as even more of a mystery with me than he was when I started.  A very interesting read, in a thought provoking and tragic kind of way.]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Researcher and thought leader Dr. Brené Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore Roosevelt&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Every day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, &lt;em&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/em&gt; will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.</description>

  <description>One out of every two people will experience trauma, says psychiatrist Boris Cyrulnik, and one in ten will remain a prisoner of that suffering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why are some children permanently damaged by difficult childhoods, while others grow up into secure, creative, loving adults? This book, based on Dr. Cyrulnik's broad experience with victims of childhood distress, offers a message of hope for everyone concerned about the impact of deprivation and such traumatic events as separation, emotional or sexual abuse, and violence in the environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ghosts of the past keep on whispering to the child within the adult. Through dozens of moving, vivid examples, Dr. Cyrulnik describes the ingredients of resilience, the ability to heal the wounded self and move on, to make sense of what happened back then and form new emotional and social ties. Affection is such a vital need, he writes, that those who were deprived of it will attach themselves intensely to anything that rekindles a spark of life, whatever the cost. From the earliest parent-child bonding to the sexual turbulence of the teenage years, this book shows what makes for success or failure in the struggle to gain freedom from early pain.</description>

  <description>This how-to jewelry-making book features the work of an array of invited jewelry designers influenced by the growing Steampunk trend. In Steampunk circles, jewelry-makers are often master metalsmiths who combine found objects with fine metals to create elaborate pieces. In &lt;em&gt;Steampunk-Style Jewelry&lt;/em&gt;, the projects focus on "no fire" techniques—like simple stringing, wirework, hammering, stamping, gluing, stitching, and off-loom beadwork—so that even a beginner can create pieces in the style. Each project provides a complete materials and tools list, step-by-step instructions, and clear illustrations. This book offers a broad overview of a growing design trend that is part of the literary, industrial design, fashion, and popular culture scene. Readers will learn about the art movement through the many photographic sidebars that explore the many aspects of the trend.</description>

  <description>33 Craft Projects That Give Old Books New Life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all love to read and learn from books, but The Repurposed Library takes our passion even further, presenting us with 33 projects to make--quite literally--out of books. For these projects, Lisa Occhipinti rescues and repurposes orphaned and outdated books from flea markets and library sales and turns them into new art objects and practical items for the home. Her creations range from artfully constructed mobiles, wreaths, and vases, to functional items like shelves, storage boxes, and even a Kindle "keeper" for those who want to replicate the sensation of holding a "real" book while reading from an e-reader. Projects utilize every imaginable part of a book--from hardback cover to individual pages--and are a DIY celebration of a new way to view a book's potential.</description>

  <description>In Create Your Own Artist's Journal, Erin O'Toole helps artists capture those fleeting moments of inspiration and beauty that compel them to create. She begins by showing them how to observe and record what they see, composing images that come alive with color and movement.O'Toole also discusses the materials involved in keeping a journal, and offers advice for finding interesting subjects, painting from memory and improvising sketches as a scene changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, she provides guidelines for compiling a portable journaling "kit" that artists can take with them anywhere!</description>

  <description>Dark allegory describes the narrator’s journey up the Congo River and his meeting with, and fascination by, Mr. Kurtz, a mysterious personage who dominates the unruly inhabitants of the region. Masterly blend of adventure, character development, psychological penetration. Considered by many Conrad’s finest, most enigmatic story.</description>

  <description>Nearly every time you see him, he's laughing, or at least smiling. And he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling. He's the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and an increasingly popular speaker and statesman. What's more, he'll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that "the very motion of our life is towards happiness." How to get there has always been the question. He's tried to answer it before, but he's never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand. Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life's obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace.</description>

  <description>This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form the links in a chain letter of death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abigail and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This no-holds-barred autobiography chronicles the remarkable life of Phil Robertson, the original Duck Commander and &lt;em&gt;Duck Dynasty&lt;/em&gt; star, from early childhood through the founding of a family business.&lt;/strong&gt; Life was always getting in the way of Phil Robertson’s passion for duck hunting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An NFL-bound quarterback, Phil made his mark on Louisiana Tech University in the 1960s by playing football and completing his college career with a master’s degree in English. But Phil’s eyes were not always on the books or the ball; they were usually looking to the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil grew up with the dream of living the simple life off the land like his forebears, but he soon found himself on a path to self-destruction—leasing a bar, drinking too much, fighting, and wasting his talents. He almost lost it all until he gave his life to God. And then everything changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phil’s incredible story tells how he followed a calling from God and soon after invented a duck call that would begin an incredible journey to the life he had always dreamed of for himself and his family. With great love for his country, his family, and his maker, Phil has finally found the ingredients to the “good life” he always wanted.</description>

  <description>Mark Jenkins’s engrossing history draws on the latest science, anthropological and archaeological research to explore the origins of vampire stories, providing gripping historic and folkloric context for the concept of immortal beings who defy death by feeding on the lifeblood of others. From the earliest whispers of eternal evil in ancient Mesopotamia, Greece, and Rome, vampire tales flourished through the centuries and around the globe, fueled by superstition, sexual mystery, fear of disease and death, and the nagging anxiety that demons lurk everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Vampire Forensics,&lt;/em&gt; Mark Jenkins probes vampire legend to tease out the historical truths enshrined in the tales of terror: sherds of Persian pottery depicting blood-sucking demons; the amazing recent discovery by National Geographic archaeologist Matteo Borrini of a 16th-century Venetian grave of a plague victim and suspected vampire; and the Transylvanian castle of "Vlad the Impaler," whose bloodthirsty cruelty remains unsurpassed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenkins navigates centuries of lore and legend, adding new chapters to the chronicle and weaving an irresistibly seductive blend of superstition, psychology, and science sure to engross everyone from Anne Rice’s countless readers to serious students of archaeology and mythology.</description>

But when a mysterious mortal acquaintance appears on campus, followed by demon cheerleaders, things quickly move from bad to worse.&lt;br&gt;In this fourth installment of the blockbuster series, time is running out as war between the Olympians and the evil Titan lord Kronos draws near. Even the safe haven of Camp Half-Blood grows more vulnerable by the minute as Kronos's army prepares to invade its once impenetrable borders. To stop the invasion, Percy and his demigod friends must set out on a quest through the Labyrinth - a sprawling underground world with stunning surprises at every turn.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Walden; or Life in the Woods&lt;/em&gt; is an American book written by noted transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau. The work is part personal declaration of independence, social experiment, voyage of spiritual discovery, satire, and manual for self-reliance. Published in 1854, it details Thoreau's experiences over the course of two years in a cabin he built near Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts.</description>

  <description>"Sunshine, you're my baby and I'm your only mother. You must mind the one taking care of you, but she's not your mama." Ashley Rhodes-Courter spent nine years of her life in fourteen different foster homes, living by those words. As her mother spirals out of control, Ashley is left clinging to an unpredictable, dissolving relationship, all the while getting pulled deeper and deeper into the foster care system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Painful memories of being taken away from her home quickly become consumed by real-life horrors, where Ashley is juggled between caseworkers, shuffled from school to school, and forced to endure manipulative,humiliating treatment from a very abusive foster family. In this inspiring, unforgettable memoir, Ashley finds the courage to succeed - and in doing so, discovers the power of her own voice.</description>

  <description>Jody never asked to become a vampire. But when she wakes up under an alley Dumpster with a badly burned arm, an aching back, superhuman strength, and a distinctly Nosferatuan thirst, she realizes the decision has been made for her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Making the transition from the nine-to-five grind to an eternity of nocturnal prowlings is going to take some doing, however, and that's where C. Thomas Flood fits in. A would-be Kerouac from Incontinence, Indiana, Tommy (to his friends) is biding his time night-clerking and frozen-turkey bowling in a San Francisco Safeway. But all that changes when a beautiful undead redhead walks through the door...and proceeds to rock Tommy's life -- and afterlife -- in ways he never thought possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A shocking scientific discovery. A conspiracy of staggering brilliance. A thriller unlike any you've ever read....&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a NASA satellite discovers an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory -- a victory with profound implications for NASA policy and the impending presidential election. To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House calls upon the skills of intelligence analyst Rachel Sexton. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charismatic scholar Michael Tolland, Rachel travels to the Arctic and uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery -- a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversy. But before she can warn the president, Rachel and Michael are ambushed by a team of assassins. Fleeing for their lives across a desolate and lethal landscape, their only hope for survival is to discover who is behind this masterful plot. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>"Killing me won't kill the beast" are the last words of rapist-murderer Ronnie Joe Waddell, written four days before his execution. But they can't explain how Dr. Kay Scarpetta finds Waddell's fingerprints on &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; crime scene -- &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; she'd performed his autopsy. If this is some sort of game, Scarpetta seems to be the target. And if the next victim is someone she knows, the punishment will be cruel and unusual...</description>

  <description>After rewriting history with their discovery of a Nazi U-boat off the coast of New Jersey, legendary divers John Chatterton and Richie Kohler decided to investigate the great enduring mystery of history's most notorious shipwreck: Why did Titanic sink as quickly as it did? &lt;br&gt;To answer the question, Chatterton and Kohler assemble a team of experts to explore Titanic, study its engineering, and dive to the wreck of its sister ship, Brittanic, where Titanic's last secrets may be revealed. &lt;br&gt;Titanic"'s Last Secrets" is a rollercoaster ride through the shipbuilding history, the transatlantic luxury liner business, and shipwreck forensics. Chatterton and Kohler weave their way through a labyrinth of clues to discover that "Titanic" was not the strong, heroic ship the world thought she was and that the men who built her covered up her flaws when disaster struck. If "Titanic" had remained afloat for just two hours longer than she did, more than two thousand people would have lived instead of died, and the myth of the great ship would be one of rescue instead of tragedy. &lt;br&gt;Titanic's Last Secrets is the never-before-told story of the Ship of Dreams, a contemporary adventure that solves a historical mystery.</description>

  <description>For weirdness to flourish, it requires a combination of dramatic history, amazing environments, and truly unique, off-the-grid characters. Colorado is blessed with all three! From the Frozen Dead Guy Days festival in tiny Nederland, to Fruita's annual commemoration of Mike (the rooster that lost its head but not its will to live), there's no shortage of bizarre happenings in this Rocky Mountain locale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>In Las Vegas, there's a family-owned business called the Gold &amp;amp; Silver Pawn Shop, run by three generations of the Harrison family: Rick; his son, Big Hoss; and Rick's dad, the Old Man. Now &lt;em&gt;License to Pawn&lt;/em&gt; takes readers behind the scenes of the hit History show Pawn Stars and shares the fascinating life story of its star, Rick Harrison, and the equally intriguing story behind the shop, the customers, and the items for sale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rick hasn't had it easy. He was a math whiz at an early age, but developed a similarly uncanny ability to find ever-deepening trouble that nearly ruined his life. With the birth of his son, he sobered up, reconnected with his dad, and they started their booming business together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;License to Pawn&lt;/em&gt; also offers an entertaining walk through the pawn shop's history. It's a captivating look into how the Gold &amp;amp; Silver works, with incredible stories about the crazy customers and the one-of-a-kind items that the shop sells. Rick isn't only a businessman; he's also a historian and keen observer of human nature. For instance, did you know that pimps wear lots of jewelry for a reason? It's because if they're arrested, jewelry doesn't get confiscated like cash does, and ready money will be available for bail. Or that WWII bomber jackets and Zippo lighters can sell for a freakishly high price in Japan? Have you ever heard that the makers of Ormolu clocks, which Rick sells for as much as $15,000 apiece, frequently died before forty thanks to the mercury in the paint?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rick also reveals the items he loves so much he'll never sell. The shop has three Olympic bronze medals, a Patriots Super Bowl ring, a Samurai sword from 1490, and an original Iwo Jima battle plan. Each object has an incredible story behind it, of course. Rick shares them all, and so much more--there's an irresistible treasure trove of history behind both the Gold &amp;amp; Silver Pawn Shop and the life of Rick Harrison.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;High Crimes&lt;/em&gt; is journalist Michael Kodas's gripping account of life on top of the world--where man is every bit as deadly as Mother Nature. In the years following the publication of &lt;em&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/em&gt;, much has changed on Mount Everest. Among all the books documenting the glorious adventures in mountains around the world, none details how the recent infusion of wealthy climbers is drawing crime to the highest place on the planet. The change is caused both by a tremendous boom in traffic, and a new class of parasitic and predatory adventurer. It's likely that Jon Krakauer would not recognize the camps that he visited on Mount Everest almost a decade ago. This book takes readers on a harrowing tour of the criminal underworld on the slopes of the world's most majestic mountain. &lt;em&gt;High Crimes&lt;/em&gt; describes two major expeditions: the tragic story of Nils Antezana, a climber who died on Everest after he was abandoned by his guide; as well as the author's own story of his participation in the Connecticut Everest Expedition, guided by George Dijmarescu and his wife and climbing partner, Lhakpa Sherpa. Dijmarescu, who at first seemed well-intentioned and charming, turned increasingly hostile to his own wife, as well as to the author and the other women on the team. By the end of the expedition, the three women could not travel unaccompanied in base camp due to the threat of violence. Those that tried to stand against the violence and theft found that the worst of the intimidation had followed them home to Connecticut. Beatings, thefts, drugs, prostitution, coercion, threats, and abandonment on the highest slopes of Everest and other mountains have become the rule rather than the exception. Kodas describes many such experiences, and explores the larger issues these stories raise with thriller-like intensity.</description>

      <![CDATA[If I could, I would rate this one "It was OK".  The subject matter is interesting.  It is sad, although not incredibly surprising, to hear about the dark side of high mountain adventuring, particularly on Everest.  Kodas' writing style is, I think, a bit difficult and disjointed.  There isn't a flow...]]>

  <description>See alternate cover edition: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7390240-dearly-devoted-dexter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He's a charming monster... A macabre hero... A serial killler who only kills bad people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dexter Morgan has been under considerable pressure. It's just not easy being an ethical serial killer - especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac...which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the world's first serial couch potato. But how long can Dexter play Kick the Can instead of Slice the Slasher? How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through Miami - a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As Dexter's dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective), is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monster - but it isn't until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything. Unless, of course, his plaything finds him first...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the incredible wit and freshness that drew widespread acclaim to &lt;em&gt;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&lt;/em&gt;, Jeff Lindsay now takes Dexter Morgan to a new level of macabre appeal and gives us one of the most original, colorful narrators in years.</description>

  <description>Nel 2004, l'esploratore americano Bill Stone e l'ucraino Alexander Klimchouk hanno guidato due diverse spedizioni scientifiche, una nello Stato di Oaxaca, nel Messico meridionale, e l'altra nella Repubblica ex sovietica della Georgia, alla scoperta della più grande regione geografica sconosciuta del nostro pianeta nota come "l'ottavo continente". Dopo aver rischiato tutto, comprese le proprie vite e quelle di chi li accompagnava, sono riusciti a esplorare le due supergrotte - uniche vie d'accesso al mondo ipogeo - per molti chilometri sotto la superficie del mare realizzando così il sogno di una vita: scoprire per primi un luogo inesplorato. La discesa all'interno di questi mostri geologici, "immaginate di scalare l'Everest al contrario", è stata raccontata dal giornalista James Tabor fin nei minimi dettagli. Grazie alla voce diretta dei protagonisti e alla visione di video e fotografie molte delle quali sono contenute nel libro - l'autore è riuscito a restituire la sensazione claustrofobica, l'angoscia e il terrore che ogni minuto accompagnano gli speleologi. Calarsi in profondità, dove ogni metro rappresenta l'ignoto, nell'oscurità più assoluta, in grotte gigantesche che scendono a precipizio per centinaia di metri, con fiumi sotterranei che bloccano la strada e il costante rischio di precipitare nel vuoto, è un'esperienza che lascerà il lettore senza fiato.</description>

  <description>The Emotional Eating Rescue Plan for Smart, Busy Women Emotional eating is a major cause of overeating and of weight gain. Imagine a life where you don't overeat and YOU are in control of your cravings. If you struggle with emotional eating, diets and willpower won't help, but making peace with food changes everything. Psychologist Dr. Melissa McCreery outlines a day-by-day rescue plan for emotional eating and overeating designed specifically for high-performing, busy women ready to take control of their eating and their weight. Based on thousands of hours of work with smart women struggling to stop overeating, this 28 day plan walks you through the steps to: Take control of stress eating, comfort eating, and other types of emotional eating Say goodbye to guilt, shame, and feeling frustrated with yourself Discover what you really crave and how to really feed yourself Create solutions that don't leave you feeling hungry and deprived Design your recipe for lasting weight loss - even when you are busy and have a lot on your plate. "This is a book you will write in, cry on, and take into the bath. This is a book that has the power to change your relationship to food and emotional eating - forever. Read it and free yourself to be fully and wholly who you are meant to be." Jennifer Louden, author of The Woman's Comfort Book and The Life Organizer "If you've been stuck on the weight loss hamster wheel, your brain is probably full of clutter - advice and strategies that just don't work for you or your busy life. Dr. McCreery's book helps you organize and take control of your relationship with food once and for all, allowing the other pieces of your life to fall into place. It all makes perfect sense!" Lorie Marrero, creator of The Clutter Diet(r) and author of The Home Office Handbook: Rules of Thumb for Organizing Your Time, Information, and Workspa</description>

  <description>"This is a book about making art. Ordinary art. Ordinary art means something like: all art &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; made by Mozart. After all, art is rarely made by Mozart-like people; essentially—statistically speaking—there &lt;em&gt;aren't&lt;/em&gt; any people like that. Geniuses get made once-a-century or so, yet good art gets made all the time, so to equate the making of art with the workings of genius removes this intimately human activity to a strangely unreachable and unknowable place. For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius."&lt;br&gt;—-from the Introduction&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Fear&lt;/em&gt; explores the way art gets made, the reasons it often &lt;em&gt;doesn't&lt;/em&gt; get made, and the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artists to give up along the way. The book's co-authors, David Bayles and Ted Orland, are themselves both working artists, grappling daily with the problems of making art in the real world. Their insights and observations, drawn from personal experience, provide an incisive view into the world of art as it is expeienced by artmakers themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not your typical self-help book. This is a book written by artists, for artists -— it's about what it feels like when artists sit down at their easel or keyboard, in their studio or performance space, trying to do the work they need to do. First published in 1994, &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Fear&lt;/em&gt; quickly became an underground classic. Word-of-mouth response alone—now enhanced by internet posting—has placed it among the best-selling books on artmaking and creativity nationally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Fear&lt;/em&gt; has attracted a remarkably diverse audience, ranging from beginning to accomplished artists in every medium, and including an exceptional concentration among students and teachers. The original Capra Press edition of &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Fear&lt;/em&gt; sold 80,000 copies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An excerpt:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, more than it was however many years ago, art is hard because you have to keep after it so consistently. On so many different fronts. For so little external reward. Artists become veteran artists only by making peace not just with themselves, but with a huge range of issues. You have to find your work...</description>

  <description>Cameron Jamie's work--a blend of video, sound, performance, photography and drawing--confronts the dysfunction of European and American society. His critical gaze often focuses on ritualistic practices in popular culture, such as hot dog eating contests and backyard wrestling. Taking suburban phenomena of this sort as his primary material, Jamie explores the dark underbelly of the American dream in drawings, film and performance. This artist-designed exhibition catalogue features more than 60 works in various media, illuminating the artist's process with selections from his personal archive of clippings and ephemera, as well as raw sketches for his projects. An essay by exhibition curator Philippe Vergne, a foreword by Walker director Kathy Halbreich and a reprint of a poem by Charles Bukowski selected by the artist provide context for this first large-scale, museum presentation of Jamie's work.</description>

  <description>It's the end of the world as we know it...&lt;br&gt;Someday soon, you might wake up to the call to prayer from a muezzin. Europeans already are. And liberals will still tell you that "diversity is our strength"--while Talibanic enforcers cruise Greenwich Village burning books and barber shops, the Supreme Court decides sharia law doesn't violate the "separation of church and state," and the Hollywood Left decides to give up on gay rights in favor of the much safer charms of polygamy. If you think this can't happen, you haven't been paying attention, as the hilarious, provocative, and brilliant Mark Steyn--the most popular conservative columnist in the English-speaking world--shows to devastating effect. The future, as Steyn shows, belongs to the fecund and the confident. And the Islamists are both, while the West is looking ever more like the ruins of a civilization. But America can survive, prosper, and defend its freedom only if it continues to believe in itself, in the sturdier virtues of self-reliance (not government), in the centrality of family, and in the conviction that our country really is the world's last best hope. Mark Steyn's America Alone is laugh-out-loud funny--but it will also change the way you look at the world.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Griffin: It's good to get in touch with you at last. Could I have one of your fish postcards? I think you were right -- the wine glass has more impact than the cup. --Sabine&lt;/em&gt;But Griffin had never met a woman named Sabine. How did she know him? How did she know his artwork? Who is she? Thus begins the strange and intriguing correspondence of Griffin and Sabine. And since each letter must be pulled from its own envelope, the reader has the delightful, forbidden sensation of reading someone else's mail.&lt;em&gt; Griffin &amp;amp; Sabine &lt;/em&gt;is like no other illustrated novel: appealing to the poet and artist in everyone and sure to inspire a renaissance in the fine art of letter-writing, it tells an extraordinary story in an extraordinary way.</description>

  <description>The acclaimed author of The Wonder of Boys provides a revolutionary and immensely practical vision of male adolescence, helping parents and mentors shepherd boys through the challenging ages of ten to twenty.As boys enter the second decade of their lives, they are confronted with tremendous challenges at home, at school, and in personal relationships. In a phenomenon long overlooked by the media and policy makers, adolescent boys are the most at-risk group in our society, today, facing the highest incidence of addiction, violence, mental illness, and emotional neglect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building on his pioneering work in The Wonder of Boys, Michael Gurian now explores the misunderstood life of the '90s male adolescent, providing parents and mentors with eye-opening and practical wisdom. Gurian answers tough questions about the changes boys face, focusing on new understandings of the hidden biology of the adolescent male; the development of emotional structure and social adaptation; the changing emotional safety within the family unit; necessary rites of passage; and the critical shifting in the attitude of society, educators, and the media in order to nurture adolescent boys into loving, wise, and responsible men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giving us the tools to better nurture, discipline, and cultivate our adolescent males, Gurian delivers the most responsible and enlightening assessment of young manhood in our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Inside the “Most Haunted” House in New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Explores a pivotal event in a city that drips legends from every pore. In the end, Long reminds us that history has just one indisputable ‘truth’—the past was a complex world whose deeds continue to haunt us.”—Elizabeth Shown Mills, author of &lt;em&gt;Isle of Canes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A page-turner. History, folklore, myth—this book has it all, like almost everything in New Orleans.”—Nathalie Dessens, author of &lt;em&gt;From Saint-Domingue to New Orleans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The legend of Madame Delphine Lalaurie, a wealthy society matron, has haunted the city of New Orleans for nearly two hundred years. &lt;br&gt;     When fire destroyed part of her home in 1834, the public was outraged to learn that behind closed doors Lalaurie routinely bound, starved, and tortured her slaves. Forced to flee the city, her guilt was unquestioned, and tales of her actions have become increasingly fanciful and grotesque over the decades. Even today, the Lalaurie house is described as the city’s “most haunted” during ghost tours.&lt;br&gt;     Carolyn Long, a meticulous researcher of New Orleans history, disentangles the threads of fact and legend that have intertwined over the decades. Was Madame Lalaurie a sadistic abuser? Mentally ill? Or merely the victim of an unfair and sensationalist press? Using carefully documented eyewitness testimony, archival documents, and family letters, Long recounts Lalaurie’s life from legal troubles before the fire and scandal through her exile to France and death in Paris in 1849.&lt;br&gt;     Themes of mental illness, wealth, power, and questions of morality in a society that condoned the purchase and ownership of other human beings pervade the book, lending it an appeal to anyone interested in antebellum history. Long’s ability to tease the truth from the knots of sensationalism is uncanny as she draws the facts from the legend of Madame Lalaurie’s haunted house.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two mysterious deaths unlock one man's past and another's future in this moving tale of art, love, and history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the wife of renowned art critic Daniel Lichtmann plunges to her death, she is not alone. Lying next to her is her suspected lover, Benjamin Wind, the very artist Daniel most championed. Tormented by questions about the circumstances of their deaths, Daniel dedicates himself to uncovering the secrets of their relationship and the inspiration behind Wind's dazzling final exhibition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Daniel discovers is a web of mysteries leading back to pre-World War II Vienna and the magnificent life of Josef Pick, a forgotten artist who may have been the twentieth century's greatest painter of love. But the most astonishing discoveryis what connects these two artists acrosshalf a century: a remarkable woman whose response to the tragedy of her generation offers Daniel answers to the questions he never knew to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ambitious, haunting, and stunningly written, &lt;em&gt;The Marriage Artist&lt;/em&gt; tells a universal tale of a family dramatically reshaped by the quest for personal freedom in the face of inherited beliefs, public prejudices, and the unfathomable turns of history. It is at once a provocative snapshot of contemporary marriage, the recovery of a passion that history never recorded, and a fierce reminder of the way we enlist love in our perpetual search for meaning and permanence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Believing Brain&lt;/em&gt; is bestselling author Michael Shermer's comprehensive and provocative theory on how beliefs are born, formed, reinforced, challenged, changed, and extinguished.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this work synthesizing thirty years of research, psychologist, historian of science, and the world's best-known skeptic Michael Shermer upends the traditional thinking about how humans form beliefs about the world. Simply put, beliefs come first and explanations for beliefs follow. The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. From sensory data flowing in through the senses, the brain naturally begins to look for and find patterns, and then infuses those patterns with meaning. Our brains connect the dots of our world into meaningful patterns that explain why things happen, and these patterns become beliefs. Once beliefs are formed the brain begins to look for and find confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, which accelerates the process of reinforcing them, and round and round the process goes in a positive-feedback loop of belief confirmation. Shermer outlines the numerous cognitive tools our brains engage to reinforce our beliefs as truths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interlaced with his theory of belief, Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, from politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. Ultimately, he demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not a belief matches reality.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The never-before-told story of one of the worst rail disasters in U.S. history in which two trains full of people, trapped high in the Cascade Mountains, are hit by a devastating avalanche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In February 1910, a monstrous blizzard centered on Washington State hit the Northwest, breaking records. The world stopped--but nowhere was the danger more terrifying than near a tiny town called Wellington, perched high in the Cascade Mountains, where a desperate situation evolved minute by minute: two trainloads of cold, hungry passengers and their crews found themselves marooned without escape, their railcars gradually being buried in the rising drifts. For days, an army of the Great Northern Railroad's most dedicated men--led by the line's legendarily courageous superintendent, James O'Neill--worked round-the-clock to rescue the trains. But the storm was unrelenting, and to the passenger's great anxiety, the railcars--their only shelter--were parked precariously on the edge of a steep ravine. As the days passed, food and coal supplies dwindled. Panic and rage set in as snow accumulated deeper and deeper on the cliffs overhanging the trains. Finally, just when escape seemed possible, the unthinkable occurred: the earth shifted and a colossal avalanche tumbled from the high pinnacles, sweeping the trains and their sleeping passengers over the steep slope and down the mountainside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centered on the astonishing spectacle of our nation's deadliest avalanche, The White Cascade is the masterfully told story of a supremely dramatic and never-before-documented American tragedy. An adventure saga filled with colorful and engaging history, this is epic narrative storytelling at its finest.</description>

  <description>In this impassioned, shocking, and deeply personal story, Alla Yaroshinskaya, then a journalist from Zhitomir, Ukraine, near the Chernobyl power station, describes the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the bureaucratic and scientific corruption surrounding it. Despite the government’s official silence, news and panic spread throughout the USSR and Europe after the horrific accident. Like others, Yaroshinskaya initially fled with her family in hopes of escaping the danger from radioactive fallout that exceeded that of Hiroshima by three hundred times. When she returned home, she discovered that people in highly contaminated areas were being resettled in ones barely less contaminated, that their serious health problems were officially denied, and that people had to eat locally grown contaminated food. Her newspaper refused to publish her stories and instead commissioned another journalist to write more reassuring accounts. Finally, Isvestia published her articles. Despite official pressure, Yaroshinskaya was nominated overwhelmingly to the new parliament in 1989. This position gained her access to classified documents know as the Kremlin’s "Forty Secret Protocols." Undaunted by threats, she revealed an official cover-up, including lies about "permissible" higher radioactive levels. Her courageous campaign won her the Right Livelihood Award in 1992.</description>

  <description>As a follow-up to his bestselling book &lt;em&gt;Life Strategies&lt;/em&gt;, Oprah acolyte Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D., moves from aiding the aimless individual to coaching the disconnected couple. McGraw has distilled his more than two decades of counseling experience into a seven-step strategy he calls "Relationship Rescue." "I'm prepared to kick a hole in the wall of the pain-ridden, unhappy maze you've gotten yourself into, and provide you clear access to action-oriented answers and instructions on what you must do to have what you want," says Dr. Phil. His aim is to expose and eliminate the saboteurs that cause senseless damage to already-fragile marriages, and, like an emotional root canal, to replace them with values he says provide positive results. If you follow Dr. Phil's strategy, he will lead you on a precise journey to uncover your heart and then share it with your partner as part of taking the "risk of intimacy." Dr. Phil leads you to "reconnect with your core" in the first five steps of his seven-step strategy. By no means a quick fix, there are in-depth and rigorous questionnaires, surveys, tests, and profiles that require a "brutally candid" mindset, with such fill-in-the-blanks as "List five things that today would make you fall out of love with your partner." With this internal work accomplished, you'll then move on to reconnecting with your partner during a two-week, half-hour-a-day short course. As a "dyad," you and your loved one take turns giving monologues on topics such as "The most positive thing I took away from my mother and father's relationship was..." Once the "reconnection" has been established, Dr. Phil says the work shifts to a management role, as relationships are always a work in progress. Dr. Phil humorously refers to his own marriage throughout the book, sharing his mishaps and victories in learning to accept and enjoy what he sees as fundamental but complementary differences between men and women. --John Youngs</description>

  <description>Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school... again. And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus' master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus' stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.</description>

  <description>Two of today's top investigative journalists discovered the reality of the world's most foremost biker gang — The Hells Angels. With an estimated 2,500 members in 25 countries, the Hells Angels have inspired a global subculture of violence and fear. Sher and Marsden unflinching look at how law enforcement agencies worldwide are trying to stop — with little success — the biker gangs from spreading their violent outlaw creed around the world.</description>

  <description>Painstakingly researched over three years, based on nearly one hundred hours of exclusive interviews with Richard Ramirez on California's Death Row, &lt;em&gt;The Night Stalker&lt;/em&gt; is the definitive account of America's most feared serial murderer.&lt;br&gt;From Ramirez's earliest brushes with the law to his deadliest stalking expeditions to the unprecedented police and civilian manhunt that resulted in one of the most sensational trials in California history, &lt;em&gt;The Night Stalker&lt;/em&gt; is an eerie and spellbinding descent into the very heart of human evil.&lt;br&gt;It is more than epic nonfiction at its most brutally real - it is true crime masterpiece.</description>

  <description>Once upon a time yet to come, creatures of myth and fairy tale gained entry to the human realm and were expelled with extreme prejudice. Banished Underground, they carved out two kingdoms: the Lightworld of the Fae and their kin, and the Darkworld of demons, werewolves and their ilk. But the boundaries between these Worlds and the Upworld are about to be redrawn...in blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a Lightworld royal gala, Queene Ayla announces the betrothal of her daughter, Cerridwen, to a high-ranking councilor. Though strategically brilliant, the engagement comes as a shock to Cerridwen especially. Infuriated by her mother s high-handedness, ignorant of her own true origins, she flees the court leaving herself vulnerable to those who would see the Lightworld destroyed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amid burgeoning unrest, desperate desires become divided loyalties and terrifying mercenaries lurk in the shadowy space between rebellion and anarchy.</description>

  <description>In a time not long from now, the veil between fantasy and reality is ripped asunder—creatures of myth and fairy tale spill into the mortal world. Enchanted yet horrified, humans force the magical beings Underground, to colonize the sewers and abandoned subway tunnels beneath their glittering cities. But even magic folk cannot dwell in harmony, and soon two Worlds emerge: the Lightworld, home to faeries, dragons and dwarves; and the Darkworld, where vampires, werewolves, angels and demons lurk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in the dank and shadowy place between Lightworld and Darkworld, a transformation is about to begin….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ayla, a half faery, half human assassin, is stalked by Malachi, a Death Angel tasked with harvesting mortal souls. They clash. Immortality evaporates, forging a bond neither may survive. And in the face of unbridled ambitions and untested loyalties, an ominous prophecy is revealed that will shake the Worlds.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Much to the chagrin of his girlfriend, Gia, Repairman Jack doesn't deal with electronic appliances--he fixes &lt;em&gt;situations&lt;/em&gt; for people, situations that usually involve putting himself in deadly danger. His latest project is recovering a stolen necklace, which carries with it an ancient curse that may unleash a horde of Bengali demons. Jack is used to danger, but this time Gia's daughter Vicky is threatened. Can Jack overcome the curse of the yellow necklace and bring Vicky safely back home?&lt;br&gt;

  <description>The Black Plague. The Pestilence. Disease and death haunt every town and village across 14th century Europe and none are immune from its evil. Some see the devastation of their world as a sign from God for Man's wickedness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Brother Thomas Neville sees this swath of death as something much more. Neville is a man beset by demons. Or is it angels? He has had a visitation from none other than the Archangel Michael, who commands Thomas to a mission. This mission will take Neville across the length and breath of the continent in a desperate bid to find the means to stop the minions of Satan who have found a doorway out of Hell and are preparing to venture forth, to try and seize this world in preparation for an assault on Heaven itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Thomas Neville encounters angels and demons, saints and witches, he comes to realize that the armies of God and Satan are arraying themselves for the final battle...and that his soul is to be the battleground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is, has Neville picked the truly good side?&lt;br&gt;</description>

The eagerly awaited new title in the best-selling ’Ology series — more than 5 million sold worldwide!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step lively, pirate foes and fanciers! Mysterious booty found inside a long-lost sea chest, hidden for hundreds of years off the coast of Newfoundland, has just been uncovered for your enjoyment.

An extraordinary find for pirateologists, here is a true and complete companion for the dedicated pirate hunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pirateology’s special treasures include:&lt;br&gt;— a stunning cover bearing a working compass and glittering gems—treasure map with a missing piece — for the canny reader to find &lt;br&gt;— multiple flaps, maps, charts, and booklets harboring codes and clues&lt;br&gt;— intricate drawings of ships’ interiors&lt;br&gt;— a packet of gold dust — a pocket sundial&lt;br&gt;— a cache of pirate letters, pieces of eight— and a jewel as a final reward</description>

  <description>Despite growing evidence of geothermic activity under America's first and foremost national park, it took geologists a long time to realize that there was actually a volcano beneath Yellowstone. And then, why couldn't they find the caldera or crater? Because, as an aerial photograph finally revealed, the caldera is 45 miles wide, encompassing all of Yellowstone. What will happen, in human terms, when it erupts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Greg Breining explores the shocking answer to this question and others in a scientific yet accessible look at the enormous natural disaster brewing beneath the surface of the United States. Yellowstone is one of the world's five "super volcanoes." When it erupts, much of the nation will be hit hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Though historically Yellowstone has erupted about every 600,000 years, it has not done so for 630,000, meaning it is 30,000 years overdue. Starting with a scenario of what will happen when Yellowstone blows, this fascinating study describes how volcanoes function and includes a timeline of famous volcanic eruptions throughout history.</description>

  <description>When it comes to jobs in hell, being a succubus seems pretty glamorous. A girl can be anything she wants, the wardrobe is killer, and mortal men will do anything just for a touch. Granted, they often pay with their souls, but why get technical?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Seattle succubus Georgina Kincaid's life is far less exotic. At least there's her day job at a local bookstore--free books; all the white chocolate mochas she can drink; and easy access to bestselling, sexy writer, Seth Mortensen, aka He Whom She Would Give Anything to Touch but Can't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But dreaming about Seth will have to wait. Something wicked is at work in Seattle's demon underground. And for once, all of her hot charms and drop-dead one-liners won't help because Georgina's about to discover there are some creatures out there that both heaven and hell want to deny. . .</description>

  <description>Under cover of night in Richmond, Virginia, a human monster strikes, leaving a gruesome trail of stranglings that has paralyzed the city. Medical examiner Kay Scarpetta suspects the worst: a deliberate campaign by a brilliant serial killer whose signature offers precious few clues. With an unerring eye, she calls on the latest advances in forensic research to unmask the madman. But this investigation will test Kay like no other, because it's being sabotaged from within and someone wants her dead.</description>

  <description>An idyllic Hawaiian wedding held the promise of a wonderful future for handsome, athletic Chris Northon, an airline pilot, a confirmed bachelor-turned-devoted family man; and Liysa, an acclaimed surf photographer, loving mother, and aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. But few, including Chris, had seen Liysa's other side -- her controlling behavior and dark moods, her insatiable hunger for money and property. And no one anticipated the fatal outcome of a family camping trip in an Oregon forest. Liysa soon revealed herself as a victim of domestic abuse that culminated at the campsite, where she shot Chris in self-defense. But crime scene evidence led detectives to wonder if Liysa was a killer, not a victim. Her controversial trial stunned all who thought they knew her. A lifetime of sociopathic manipulations and lies had been expertly hidden behind her fa&amp;amp;#231;ade of perfection -- as was her rage to destroy any obstacle to her ultimate happiness, even if it was the man she vowed to love forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Originally published in 1988, Anthony Storr's enlightening meditation on the creative individual's need for solitude has become a classic.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solitude&lt;/em&gt; was seminal in challenging the established belief that "interpersonal relationships of an intimate kind are the chief, if not the only, source of human happiness." Indeed, most self-help literature still places relationships at the center of human existence. Lucid and lyrical, Storr's book cites numerous examples of brilliant scholars and artists -- from Beethoven and Kant to Anne Sexton and Beatrix Potter -- to demonstrate that solitude ranks alongside relationships in its impact on an individual's well-being and productivity, as well as on society's progress and health. But solitary activity is essential not only for geniuses, says Storr; the average person, too, is enriched by spending time alone. &lt;br&gt; For fifteen years, readers have found inspiration and renewal in Storr's erudite, compassionate vision of human experience.</description>

  <description>Heaven can wait.&lt;p&gt;In the meantime...why not go to Hell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while a little book comes along that sheds light on our desire for intimacy, our determination to grow spiritually, and our collective yearning to define the boundaries of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Five People You Meet in Hell&lt;/em&gt; is not that little book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensitive everyman, Edgy works a meaning-less job at a seaside tourist trap. When a freak accident sends him to "the other side," he encounters a series of strangers compelled to explain the meaning of life. Running the gamut from annoying and incoherent to irritating and hard to follow, these individuals all share a basic desire with virtually every other soul in the universe: to make quick money from a made-for-television movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Five People You Meet in Hell&lt;/em&gt; is as illuminating as a short-circuited night light and contains all the insight of a chocolate-dipped fortune cookie (with none of the fat). If you've ever died, expect to die, know someone who has died, raise alpacas, collect Hummel figurines, breathe air, or enjoy line dancing, you must buy this book. You will never think about thirteen bucks the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience erections lasting more than four hours, please consult your physician.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Called &amp;amp;#8220;The Entitlement Generation&amp;amp;#8221; or Gen Y, they are storming into schools, colleges, and businesses all over the country. In this provocative new book, headline-making psychologist and social commentator Dr. Jean Twenge explores why the young people she calls &amp;amp;#8220;Generation Me&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;amp;#8212;those born in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s&amp;amp;#8212;are tolerant, confident, open-minded, and ambitious but also cynical, depressed, lonely, and anxious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Herself a member of Generation Me, Dr. Twenge uses findings from the largest intergenerational research study ever conducted&amp;amp;#8212;with data from 1.3 million respondents spanning six decades&amp;amp;#8212;to reveal how profoundly different today&amp;amp;#8217;s young adults are. Here are the shocking truths about this generation, including dramatic differences in sexual behavior, as well as controversial predictions about what the future holds for them and society as a whole. Her often humorous, eyebrow-raising stories about real people vividly bring to life the hopes and dreams, disappointments, and challenges of Generation Me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GenMe has created a profound shift in the American character, changing what it means to be an individual in today&amp;amp;#8217;s society. The collision of this generation&amp;amp;#8217;s entitled self-focus and today&amp;amp;#8217;s competitive marketplace will create one of the most daunting challenges of the new century. Engaging, controversial, prescriptive, funny, &lt;em&gt;Generation Me&lt;/em&gt; will give Boomers new insight into their offspring, and help those in their teens, 20s, and 30s finally make sense of themselves and their goals and find their road to happiness.</description>

  <description>"Why is it that women, who are so competent in all other areas of their lives, cannot find the same competence when it comes to matters of money? &lt;br&gt;"Suze Orman investigates the complicated, dysfunctional relationship women have with money in this groundbreaking new book. With her signature mix of insight, compassion, and soul-deep recognition, she equips women with the financial knowledge and emotional awareness to overcome the blocks that have kept them from making more out of the money they make. At the center of the book is The Save Yourself Plan--a streamlined, five-month program that delivers genuine long-term financial security. But what's at stake is far bigger than money itself: It's about every woman's sense of who she is and what she deserves, and why it all begins with the decision to save yourself.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Welcome To A World Where Nothing Is What It Seems And Every Touch Is Ecstasy&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Alexandria's car goes off the road in a terrible blizzard, she has no idea night will bring a powerful rescuer and the start of an ecstatic sexual awakening. The moment Xandi wakes in Stefan's muscular arms, feels the heat of his body pressing against hers, she feels no fear. Instead, she allows herself to be taken by one who is more than a man, whose primal nature is never far from him. As their connection grows, and as Xandi gradually loses her sensual inhibitions, experiencing pleasures she never dreamed possible, she is drawn deeper into Stefan's mysterious world, meeting the alluring beauty, Keisha, as well as the dominant and sometimes ruthlessly commanding Anton, who can have any man or woman he wants...in any way he wishes...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Charles Frazier's &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Moons&lt;/em&gt; is the story of one man's remarkable life, spanning a century of relentless change. At the age of twelve, an orphan named Will Cooper is given a horse, a key, a map and is sent on a journey through the wilderness to the edge of the Cherokee Nation, the uncharted white space on the map. Will is a bound boy, obliged to run a remote Indian trading post, As he fulfills his lonesome duty, Will finds a father in Bear, a Cherokee chief, and is adopted by him and his people, developing relationships that ultimately forge Will's character. All the while, his love of Claire, the enigmatic and captivating charge of volatile and powerful Featherstone, will forever rule Will's heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a distinct voice filled with both humor and yearning, Will tells of a lifelong search for home, the hunger for fortune and adventure, the rebuilding of a trampled culture, and above all an enduring pursuit of passion. As he comes to realize, "When all else is lost and done forever, there is yearning. One of the few welcome lessons age teaches is that only desire trumps time."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Cooper, in the hands of Charles Frazier, becomes a classic American soul: a man devoted to a place and its people, a woman, and a way of life, all of which seem forever just beyond his reach. &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Moons&lt;/em&gt; takes us from the uncharted wilderness of an unspoiled continent, across the South, up and down the Mississippi, and to the urban clamor of a raw Washington City. Throughout, Will is swept along as the wild beauty of the nineteenth century gives way to the telephones, automobiles, and encroaching railways of the Twentieth. Steeped in history, rich in insight, and filled with moments of sudden beauty, &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Moons&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable work of fiction by an American master.</description>

  <description>Dr. Temperance "Tempe" Brennan spends her days in the autopsy suite, the courtroom, the crime lab, with cops, and at exhumation sites. Often her long days turn into harrowing nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's June in Montreal, and Tempe, who has left a shaky marriage back home in North Carolina to take on the challenging assignment of director of forensic anthropology for the province of Quebec, looks forward to a relaxing weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, though, she must stop at a newly uncovered burial site in the heart of the city. One look at the decomposed and decapitated corpse, stored neatly in plastic bags, tells her she'll spend the weekend in the crime lab. This is homicide of the worst kind. To begin to find some answers, Tempe must first identify the victim. Who is this person with the reddish hair and a small bone structure?</description>

  <description>Acclaimed for her "devastatingly accurate insight" &lt;em&gt;(The New York Times Book Review)&lt;/em&gt; into the criminal mind, Ann Rule has chronicled the most fascinating cases of our time in her bestselling Crime Files series. For this sixth stunning collection, Rule has culled from her private files the most-asked-about homicide cases -- riveting accounts of seemingly normal men and women who are compelled d by a murderous rage to suddenly lash out at innocent victims. &lt;p&gt; Torn from the headlines, here is the case that shocked a nation: the Seattle city bus ride that turned to mayhem and murder at the hands of a gunman. Ann Rule unmasks the forces that drove quiet, clean-cut Silas Cool to shoot the driver, causing the bus to plunge off the Aurora Bridge into an apartment building. The catastrophe left three dead -- including Cool -- and dozens injured. While the scene unfolds as in a terrifying movie, Rule finds very real answers to the haunting question "how could this happen?" -- and expertly constructs the unseen chain of events that resulted in an explosive and shattering tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Included here are nine other sensational cases that illuminate Rule's unique and authoritative view of the human psyche gone temporarily berserk. No one can match Rule's meticulous research, or reveal the motives to murder in such explicit and chilling detail. You may think you know who is safe and who is dangerous; in &lt;em&gt;A Rage to Kill,&lt;/em&gt; Ann Rule frighteningly shows that none of us are truly protected from the flashes of irrational violence that can erupt from the killers among us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Stephen King, whose first novel, &lt;em&gt;Carrie&lt;/em&gt;, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war - and the protests against it - had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. &lt;em&gt;Hearts in Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Part One, "Low Men in Yellow Coats," eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Blind Willie" and "Why We're in Vietnam," two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow - and as haunted - as their own lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in "Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling," this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt;, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.</description>

  <description>In the #1 "New York Times" bestseller "Mindhunter," John Douglas, who headed the FBI's elite Investigative Support Unit, told the story of his brilliant and terrifying career tracking down some of the most heinous criminals in history. Using behavioral profiling and criminal investigative analysis to get into the head and psyche of both the criminal and victim -- to feel what they felt at the critical moment -- Douglas helped crack many high profile cases, including the Trailside Killer, the Atlanta child murders, and the Tylenol murders. Now, working again with his co-author Mark Olshaker, Douglas delves further into the criminal mind with a series of chilling new cases in "Journey into Darkness": Follow the FBI's premier investigative profiler as he penetrates the minds and motives of the most terrifying serial killers. In "Journey into Darkness," Douglas profiles vicious serial killers, rapists, and child molesters. He is straightforward, blunt, often irreverent, and outspoken, but takes pains not to glorify any of these murderers. Some of the unique cases Douglas discusses include: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Clairemont killer -- Six women were found stabbed to death in San Diego, three in the same apartment complex. In each case, the killer entered through an unlocked door or window in the late morning to early afternoon. A suspect was in custody, tied to one of the murders through a DNA match. Douglas was called upon to use his profiling techniques to link the other five murders to the suspect. Douglas looked at the "signature" of the killer, and found that all the murders were committed by the same man. The prosecution used the profile to force the jury to find the defendant guilty ofall six murders, if they felt he was guilty of the one murder. Celophus Prince was found guilty on all counts. &lt;br&gt; The schoolgirl murders -- What became Canada's "trial of the century." Several schoolgirls disappeared in 1992; their bodies were dumped several weeks later, beaten and sexually attacked. Canadian police agencies contacted the FBI for help on the case and to get a profile on the killer and, according to witnesses, his accomplice. Following the advice of the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico, Canada aired a television special entitled "The Abduction of Kristin French, " allowing agent Gregg McCrary to describe the killer's profile on air. Knowing that the murderer and his accomplice would be watching, he planned to confront the unknown killer, assuring him he would be caught. Paul Bernardo was arrested on February 17, 1993, turned in by his wife and partner in crime, Karla Leanne Homolka.. The profile was dead on the money. &lt;br&gt; Richmond's First Serial Murderer -- In 1987, Richmodd, Virginia, was struck by a serial rapist/murderer. The Richmond police called upon the Investigative Support Unit in Quantico to make up a profile of the perpetrator. The crimes and profile beared a remarkable resemblance to a string of burglaries, rapes and murders in Alexandria, Virginia, several years before. Agent Steve Mardigian then formulated a complex strategy that caught the killer who fit the profile to a tee. In the process he helped free a wrongly convicted man, who due to his low intelligence level, had become confused and confessed to the crime. &lt;br&gt; The brutal and sadistic murder of Suzanne Marie Collins, a beautiful young Marine on the verge of a brilliant career. Theculprit was caught and confessed to her killing, but his story was very different than what really happened. By delving into Sedley Alley's mind, Douglas helped bring the murderer to justice, recreating the evening from the perspective of a sadistic and angry man. Suzanne Collins' horrifying end haunts Douglas to this day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Douglas delves into other cases, including Polly Klaas' abduction and murder by Richard Allen Davis, the tragedy that lead to the creation of Megan's Law; the abduction and murder of six-year-old Cassandra Lynn Hansen, who was snatched from an evening church service; and the vicious murder and sexual assault of Nancy Newman and her two daughters, eight-year-old Melissa and three-year-old Angie in Anchorage, Alaska. He also explores the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, focusing on the double homicide purely from a behavioral perspective. Douglas examines what the facts at and surrounding the crime scene told about the killer from a behavioral point of view. From Douglas's profile, the only viable suspect to date is O.J. Simpson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With "Journey into Darkness, " Douglas provides more than a glimpse into the minds of serial killers; he demonstrates what a powerful weapon behavioral science has become. Profiling criminals helps not only to capture them, but also helps society understand how these predators work and what can be done to prevent them from striking again. Douglas focuses especi</description>

  <description>As dusk approaches a small Dublin suburb in the summer of 1984, mothers begin to call their children home. But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox—his partner and closest friend—find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richly atmospheric, stunning in its complexity, and utterly convincing and surprising to the end, In the Woods is sure to enthrall fans of Mystic River and The Lovely Bones. And look for French's new mystery, Broken Harbor, for more of the Dublin Murder Squad.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A thrilling epic about an ancient clash reignited in our time--between a hidden society and heaven's darkest creatures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. --&lt;/em&gt;Genesis 6:5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sister Evangeline was just a girl when her father entrusted her to the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in upstate New York. Now, at twenty-three, her discovery of a 1943 letter from the famous philanthropist Abigail Rockefeller to the late mother superior of Saint Rose Convent plunges Evangeline into a secret history that stretches back a thousand years: an ancient conflict between the Society of Angelologists and the monstrously beautiful descendants of angels and humans, the Nephilim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the secrets these letters guard are desperately coveted by the once-powerful Nephilim, who aim to perpetuate war, subvert the good in humanity, and dominate mankind. Generations of angelologists have devoted their lives to stopping them, and their shared mission, which Evangeline has long been destined to join, reaches from her bucolic abbey on the Hudson to the apex of insular wealth in New York, to the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris and the mountains of Bulgaria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rich in history, full of mesmerizing characters, and wondrously conceived, &lt;em&gt;Angelology&lt;/em&gt; blends biblical lore, the myth of Orpheus and the Miltonic visions of Paradise Lost into a riveting tale of ordinary people engaged in a battle that will determine the fate of the world.</description>

Parts are quite dry and I found it a slog in places to keep going.  I don't think that I will be running out to pick up...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A cultural history of witch-hunting, from the Romans through McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The term �witch-hunt� is used today to describe everything from political scandals to school board shake-ups. But its origins are far from trivial. Long before the Salem witch trials, women and men were rounded up by neighbors, accused of committing horrific crimes using supernatural powers, scrutinized by priests and juries, and promptly executed. The belief in witchcraft--and the deep fear of evil it instilled in communities--led to a cycle of accusation, anger, and purging that has occurred repeatedly in the West for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Award-winning historian John Demos puts this cultural paranoia in context. He takes readers from the early Christians persecuted in Rome through the Salem witch trials, McCarthy�s hunt for communists, and the hysteria around child sex-abuse cases and satanic cults in the 1980s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An original and fascinating look at the cultural, societal, and psychological practice of witch-hunts, &lt;em&gt;The Enemy Within&lt;/em&gt; illuminates the dark side of communities driven to rid themselves of �evil,� no matter what the cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The God Delusion&lt;/em&gt; caused a sensation when it was published in 2006. Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic, with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design' and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God Delusion &lt;/em&gt;is a brilliantly argued, fascinating polemic that will be required reading for anyone interested in this most emotional and important subject.</description>

  <description>He lives in solitude beneath the city, an exile from society, which will destroy him if he is ever seen.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; She dwells in seclusion, a fugitive from enemies who will do her harm if she is ever found.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; But the bond between them runs deeper than the tragedies that have scarred their lives. Something more than chance—and nothing less than destiny—has brought them together in a world whose hour of reckoning is fast approaching.&lt;br&gt;  </description>

  <description>Hailed for her rich and powerful works of psychological suspense as well as her &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling mysteries, Laurie R. King now takes us to a remote cottage in Cornwall where a gripping tale of intrigue, terrorism, and explosive passions begins with a visit to a recluse upon whom the fate of an entire nation may rest—a man code-named ... Touchstone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s eight years after the Great War shattered Bennett Grey’s life, leaving him with an excruciating sensitivity to the potential of human violence, and making social contact all but impossible. Once studied by British intelligence for his unique abilities, Grey has withdrawn from a rapidly changing world—until an American Bureau of Investigation agent comes to investigate for himself Grey’s potential as a weapon in a vicious new kind of warfare. Agent Harris Stuyvesant desperately needs Grey’s help entering a world where the rich and the radical exist side by side—a heady mix of the powerful and the celebrated, among whom lurks an enemy ready to strike a deadly blow at democracy on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, among a titled family whose servants dress in whimsical costumes and whose daughter conducts an open affair with a man who wants to bring down the government, Stuyvesant finds himself dangerously seduced by one woman and—even more dangerously—falling in love with another. And as he sifts through secrets divulged and kept, he uncovers the target of a horrifying conspiracy, and wonders if he can trust his touchstone, Grey, to reveal the most dangerous player of all ….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building to an astounding climax on an ancient English estate,&lt;strong&gt; Touchstone&lt;/strong&gt; is both a harrowing thriller by a master of the genre and a thought-provoking exploration of the forces that drive history—and human destinies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Anne Frank's &lt;em&gt;The Diary of a Young Girl&lt;/em&gt; is among the most enduring documents of the twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been read by tens of millions of people all over the world. It remains a beloved and deeply admired testament to the indestructible nature of the human spirit. Restored in this Definitive Edition are diary entries that were omitted from the original edition. These passages, which constitute 30 percent more material, reinforce the fact that Anne was first and foremost a teenage girl, not a remote and flawless symbol. She fretted about and tried to cope with her own sexuality. Like many young girls, she often found herself in disagreements with her mother. And like any teenager, she veered between the carefree nature of a child and the full-fledged sorrow of an adult. Anne emerges more human, more vulnerable and more vital than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation, hid in the back of an Amsterdam warehouse for two years. She was thirteen when she went into the Secret Annex with her family.</description>

  <description>One of the most important &amp;amp; influential books written in the past half-century, Robert M. Pirsig's &lt;em&gt;Zen &amp;amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/em&gt; is a powerfully moving &amp;amp; penetrating examination of how we live, a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. Here is the book that transformed a generation, an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father &amp;amp; his young son. A story of love &amp;amp; fear--of growth, discovery &amp;amp; acceptance--that becomes a profound personal &amp;amp; philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching &amp;amp; transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence &amp;amp; the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.</description>

  <description>The Wolfen (1978), the debut novel by Whitley Strieber, tells the story of two police detectives in New York City who, while investigating the violent deaths of two policemen in a junk yard, discover that a pack of intelligent and savage wolf-like creatures are stalking the city. These predators are not traditional werewolves, as they are a separate race of intelligent beings descended from wolves that live secretly alongside mankind in our cities and quickly killing anyone who learns about their existence. What is unique about this novel is that some of the story is told from the point of view of the alpha creatures and this causes the reader to be sympathetic of the creatures' needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A film adaptation directed by Michael Wadleigh and starring Albert Finney, was released in 1981.</description>

  <description>Twenty years ago, four teenagers at summer camp walked into the woods at night. Two were found murdered, and the others were never seen again. Four families had their lives changed forever. Now, two decades later, they are about to change again. For Paul Copeland, the county prosecutor of Essex, New Jersey, mourning the loss of his sister has only recently begun to subside. Cope, as he is known, is now dealing with raising his six- year-old daughter as a single father after his wife has died of cancer. Balancing family life and a rapidly ascending career as a prosecutor distracts him from his past traumas, but only for so long. When a homicide victim is found with evidence linking him to Cope, the well-buried secrets of the prosecutor's family are threatened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is this homicide victim one of the campers who disappeared with his sister? Could his sister be alive? Cope has to confront so much he left behind that summer twenty years ago: his first love, Lucy; his mother, who abandoned the family; and the secrets that his Russian parents might have been hiding even from their own children. Cope must decide what is better left hidden in the dark and what truths can be brought to the light.</description>

  <description>"RAISING THE DEAD IS EASY. LOVE IS HARD..." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are lots of reasons to raise the dead-some private, some public. In this case, the feds have a witness who died before he could speak on the record. They want him raised so his testimony can be taken. So here I am, on a plane to Philadelphia, flying off to do my job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I'm not alone. Micah is with me. Micah, head of the St. Louis wereleopard pard. King to my Queen. The only one of my lovers who can stir my blood with just a glance from his chartreuse cat's eyes. I was happy to have him at my side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until he mentioned that this will be our first time alone together. No Master Vampire. No Alpha Werewolf. Just me and Micah. And all my fears and doubts...</description>

  <description>The New Madrid Seismic Zone is 140 miles, stretching across five states. In 1811 and 1812 enormous earthquakes erupted along this zone, effecting 24 states, creating lakes in Tennessee and causing the Mississippi River to run backward. In Peter Hernon’s 8.4 the New Madrid awakens, threatening the country with systematic collapse in a chillingly plausible case of history repeating itself. It’s up to a team of scientists to stop the impending destruction, working against nature, time and a horrifying, human-made conspiracy.</description>

      <![CDATA[Mediocre.  Just go and watch the movie Armageddon instead.  This is the same story.  Swap a killer meteor for an earthquake.  Shake (pun totally intended) the characters around a bit and vwalha - 8.4.  Tedious and overdone in the places when it should have been peaking.]]>

  <description>Los Angeles is no longer the City of Angels; dark things haunt its streets- dark restless things. Bodies have been found, and the tentative peace between humans, vampires, and werewolves teeters on the brink of collapse. Keeli Maddox needs to know why. If she and her kin are to survive, she must trust a man as different from her as night from day, as tooth from claw. He's a slayer, a betrayer, an enemy. But nobility lurks in dark places, and Keeli herself is no stranger to shadow. As sure as the moon will rise, Michael was meant for her. Life is about to change. Only three things will remain: the color of blood, the hot joy of skin on skin, and the danger in a taste of crimson.</description>

  <description>He looks out of place in Dela Reese's Beijing hotel room- exotic and poignant, some mythic, tragic hero of an epic tale. With his feline yellow eyes, he's like nothing from her world. Yet Dela has danced through the echo of his soul and knows this warrior will obey her every command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hari has been used and abused for millennia. But he sees, upon his release from the riddle box, that this new mistress is different. There is a hidden power in Dela's eyes- and with her, he may regain all that was lost to him. Where once he savaged, now he must protect; where once he only knew hatred, now he must embrace love. Dela is the key. For Dela, he will risk all.</description>

  <description>Once, this was the City of Angels. The angels are no longer in charge. From the extravagant appetites of the vampire world above, to the gritty defiance of the werewolves below, the specter of darkness lives around every corner, the hope of paradise in every heart. All walk freely with humans in a tentative peace, but to live in Los Angeles is to balance on the edge of a knife. One woman knows better than most that death lurks here in nights of bliss or hails of UV bullets. She’s about to be tested, to taste true thirst. She’s about to regain the power she’s long been denied. And Fleur Dumont is about to meet the one man who may understand her: a tormented protector who’s lost his way and all he loved.</description>

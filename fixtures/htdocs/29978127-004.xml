  <description>In this eye-opening examination of a pathology that has swept the country, the noted sociologist Barry Glassner reveals why Americans are burdened with overblown fears. He exposes the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our anxieties: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV news-magazines that monger a new scare every week to garner ratings.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Sun and the Moon&lt;/em&gt; tells the delightful, entertaining, and surprisingly true story of how in the summer of 1835 a series of articles in the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;, the first of the city’s �penny papers,” convinced the citizens of New York that the moon was inhabited. Six articles, purporting to reveal the lunar discoveries made by a world-famous British astronomer, described the life found on the moon—including unicorns, beavers that walked upright, and, strangest of all, four-foot-tall flying man-bats. The series quickly became the most widely circulated newspaper story of the era. And the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;, a brash working-class upstart less than two years old, had become the most widely read newspaper in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in richly novelistic detail, &lt;em&gt;The Sun and the Moon&lt;/em&gt; brings the raucous world of 1830s New York City vividly to life—the noise, the excitement, the sense that almost anything was possible. The book overflows with larger-than-life characters, including Richard Adams Locke, author of the moon series (who never intended it to be a hoax at all); a fledgling showman named P.T. Barnum, who had just brought his own hoax to New York; and the young writer Edgar Allan Poe, who was convinced that the moon series was a plagiarism of his own work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An exhilarating narrative history of a city on the cusp of greatness and a nation newly united by affordable newspapers, &lt;em&gt;The Sun and the Moon&lt;/em&gt; may just be the strangest true story you’ve ever read.</description>

  <description>On a warm October day, Jessie Burlingame lies in the bedroom of her secluded lake home, listening to the far-off sounds of the country; the cry of a loon, the growl of a chain saw, the bark of a lonesome dog. Nearer, she hears the banging of the screen door, left unlatched in the autumn breeze; nearer still, the click of the key locking the second pair of handcuffs that chain her to the bed. Gerald Burlingame, her husband of 17 years, looms over her, grin on his face, gleam in his eye, lust in his heart. This is Gerald's favorite game--little kinky, perhaps, but all in good fun. &lt;br&gt;And then, quite suddenly, the fun is over. Gerald's heart fails him in the heat of passion, leaving Jessie hideously trapped and dreadfully alone. As darkness gathers in the room that is now Jessie's whole world, she must face not only the terror of never escaping, but the most excruciating truths about her life: the murky secrets that brought her here in the first place.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Triskaidekaphobia&lt;/em&gt;: fear of the number 13&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt; If thirteen people sit down at a table, will one die within a year? Why did five U.S. presidents join the Thirteen Club? What is the only major New York hotel that has a thirteenth floor? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 13, a fascinating cultural history-cum-detective story, Nathaniel Lachenmeyer gets to the root of how one superstition�the fear of the number 13�developed among wildly divergent societies. A book about mythmaking, 13 explores why people believe what they believe, and the real reason Friday the 13th is the most unlucky day in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Keleios the Half-Elf was but five years old when she saw her mother murdered by the evil witch Harque. For years she has asked the gods for the strength she'll need to avenge this foul death, and it seems the gods have answered her. She's been granted an array of powers never before seen in one person, but she has also acquired a most terrifying burden, a demonmark. This mark can open the door to undreamed abilities, but it can also open her soul to the forbidden dark side of magic. Keleios must choose between the demonmark's tainted power and the lives of those she holds most dear. In an epic battle of good versus evil, of enchanted swords and shapeshifting dragons, of unquenchable hatred and unlikely love, Keleios must face her own demons—before she can acquire the most important power of all: the power to forgive.</description>

  <description>Ralph Roberts used to be an ordinary guy - until insomnia robbed him of sleep.  Now he's no longer ordinary - he can see horrible things happening to the people of Derry, Maine.  He can see how, one by one, they are turning into monsters straight from hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He'd like to call them nightmares, but he's wide awake.  He can't call himself crazy, because there is another person who sees these happenings, too.  But even if seeing is believing, it still doesn't give him a clue of how to stop these deadly, demonic visions from coming true.</description>

  <description>Inside David Koresh's Cult- Into The Heart Of A Human Hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-IF you are one of Koresh's Mighty Men, you will be honored to give him your wife to sleep with.&lt;br&gt;-IF you are one of his string of child-brides, you will obey your parents and be grateful for his favors and look on while other little girls share him.&lt;br&gt;-IF you are a follower, you will applaud his decision to have an unstable woman beaten and raped for weeks. &lt;br&gt;-IF you are anyone living at the compound, you will abide by his bizarre diet rules, listen to his rock music performances, endure his day-long prayer meetings, watch his abuse of children including his own son, undergo his training in weaponry and military tactics- and you will look forward to the ultimate battle with the outside world that he prepares you for with hypnotic eloquence.&lt;br&gt;-AND above all, you will believe, believe, believe this man who says he is the Son of God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a person who lived this story-forced marriages,rapes,beatings, torturous rules of behavior-could tell it. Marc Breault is such a person. Once Koresh's right-hand man, Breault broke free of that hold to escape and survive. Now he and a reporter who risked his life to interview Koresh inside the compound join to take you on an unforgettable journey into the mind of the man who bears responsibility for the deaths of his followers.</description>

  <description>A big, friendly dog chases a rabbit into a hidden underground cave--and stirs a sleeping evil crueler than death itself. A terrified four-year-old boy sees his bedroom closet door swing open untouched by human hands, and screams at the unholy red eyes gleaming in the darkness. The little Maine town of Castle Rock is about to be invaded by the most hideous menace ever to savage the flesh and devour the mind....</description>

  <description>Something strange is going on in Jerusalem's Lot ... but no one dares to talk about it. By day, 'Salem's Lot is a typical modest New England town; but when the sun goes down, evil roams the earth. The devilishly sweet insistent laughter of a child can be heard echoing through the fields, and the presence of silent looming spirits can be felt lurking right outside your window. Stephen King brings his gruesome imagination to life in this tale of spine tingling horror.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the co-author of the two-million copy mega-bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Rule of Four &lt;/em&gt;comes a riveting thriller with a brilliant premise based on the 2012 apocalypse phenomenon—perfect for readers of Steve Berry, Preston and Child, and Dan Brown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; For decades, December 21, 2012, has been a touchstone for doomsayers worldwide. It is the date, they claim, when the ancient Maya calendar predicts the world will end.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; In Los Angeles, two weeks before, all is calm. Dr. Gabriel Stanton takes his usual morning bike ride, drops off the dog with his ex-wife, and heads to the lab where he studies incurable prion diseases for the CDC. His first phone call is from a hospital resident who has an urgent case she thinks he needs to see. Meanwhile, Chel Manu, a Guatemalan American researcher at the Getty Museum, is interrupted by a desperate, unwelcome visitor from the black market antiquities trade who thrusts a duffel bag into her hands.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; By the end of the day, Stanton, the foremost expert on some of the rarest infections in the world, is grappling with a patient whose every symptom confounds and terrifies him. And Chel, the brightest young star in the field of Maya studies, has possession of an illegal artifact that has miraculously survived the centuries intact: a priceless codex from a lost city of her ancestors. This extraordinary record, written in secret by a royal scribe, seems to hold the answer to her life’s work and to one of history’s great riddles: why the Maya kingdoms vanished overnight. Suddenly it seems that our own civilization might suffer this same fate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; With only days remaining until December 21, 2012, Stanton and Chel must join forces before time runs out.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>If you've ever experienced the one true love of your life, a love that for some reason could never be, you will understand why readers all over the world were so moved by this small, unknown first novel that they made it a publishing phenomenon and #1 bestseller. The story of Robert Kincaid, the photographer and free spirit searching for the covered bridges of Madison County, and Francesca Johnson, the farm wife waiting for the fulfillment of a girlhood dream, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY gives voice to the longings of men and women everywhere-and shows us what it is to love and be loved so intensely that life is never the same again.</description>

  <description>Sookie Stackhouse is a small-time cocktail waitress in small-town Louisiana. She's quiet, keeps to herself, and doesn't get out much. Not because she's not pretty. She is. It's just that, well, Sookie has this sort of "disability." She can read minds. And that doesn't make her too dateable.  And then along comes Bill. He's tall, dark, handsome--and Sookie can't hear a word he's thinking. He's exactly the type of guy she's been waiting for all her life....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Bill has a disability of his own: He's a vampire with a bad reputation. He hangs with a seriously creepy crowd, all suspected of--big surprise--murder. And when one of Sookie's coworkers is killed, she fears she's next....</description>

  <description>Here's the ultimate guide to life for the millennium, packed with advice on love and sex and everything else you're too embarrassed to talk about--sometimes X-rated, always real --for today's generation, today's relationships, and tomorrow's world. As the hosts of the late-night radio program and MTV sensation "LoveLine, " straight-talking physician Dr. Drew Pinsky and comedian Adam Carolla have become the duo you depend on for answers to questions about relationships going sour, truly embarrassing sexual problems, the dilemmas of finding the right partners... or dumping the wrong one. &lt;br&gt;In this first-of-its-kind guide, Dr. Drew gives you answers you can trust. Adam strips off the sugarcoating with wisecracking candor. Worried about masturbation? Virginity? Sexual etiquette? HIV and AIDS? You'll find real advice and more, including. . . the secret guys need to know to understand women sexually. . . how to help a friend who is threatening suicide. . . how to have good sex, maybe even great sex--or at least sex that won't make you pregnant or endanger your health. . . . PLUS Dr. Drew's primer on STDs. . . Adam's rules for who is not allowed to have sex. . . the Gay or Lesbian Aptitude Test. . . sidebars, quizzes, myth busters, and more. . .</description>

  <description>A captivating story of courage and strength against terrible odds, this is the story of Midge, left to stay with her eccentric uncle during the holidays, and her adventures with the Various, a band of fairies. The existence of the Various, who are strange, wild, and sometimes even deadly, has been kept secret since the beginning of time, but when their world begins to clash with the human world, they are threatened with extinction. &lt;p&gt;This wonderfully imaginative story of love and loyalty is the first in a powerful trilogy. &lt;em&gt;VOYA &lt;/em&gt;says of &lt;em&gt;The Various&lt;/em&gt;: “A marvelous blend of oldfashioned storytelling, the book has a freshness and immediacy that will intrigue fantasy lovers of all ages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A rousing addition to the durable genre of British fairy lit.”&lt;em&gt;—New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“Augarde unfolds the events gradually, allowing readers to luxuriate in the near-idyllic setting he has created and beckoning them back for future installments.”&lt;em&gt;—Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Here is the highly anticipated second installment of Philip Pullman's epic fantasy trilogy, begun with the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/em&gt;. Lyra and Will, her newfound friend, tumble separately into the strange tropical otherworld of Cittàgazze, "the city of magpies," where adults are curiously absent and children run wild. Here their lives become inextricably entwined when Lyra's alethiometer gives her a simple command:  find Will's father. Their search is plagued with obstacles--some familiar and some horribly new and unfathomable--but it eventually brings them closer to Will's father and to the Subtle Knife, a deadly, magical, ancient tool that cuts windows between worlds. Through it all, Will and Lyra find themselves hurtling toward the center of a fierce battle against a force so awesome that leagues of mortals, witches, beasts, and spirits from every world are uniting in fear and anger against it. This breathtaking sequel will leave readers eager for the third and final volume of &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/em&gt;.  </description>

  <description>In the Pacific there is island that looks like a big fish sunning itself in the sea. Around it, blue dolphins swim, otters play, and sea elephants and sea birds abound. Once, Indians also lived on the island. And when they left and sailed to the east, one young girl was left behind.This is the story of Karana, the Indian girl who lived alone for years on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. Year after year, she watched one season pass into another and waited for a ship to take her away. But while she waited, she kept herself alive by building shelter, making weapons, finding food, and fighting her enemies, the wild dogs. Hers is not only an unusual adventure of survival, but also a tale of natural beauty and personal discovery.</description>

  <description>12 year-old Meggie lives with her father, Mortimer, a bookbinder. Mo never reads stories aloud to Meggie because he has a special gift: when he reads a book aloud, the characters come out of the book and into the real world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, when Meggie was a small child, Mortimer was reading aloud from a book named Inkheart when an evil villain named Capricorn, his aide Basta, and a fire-eater named Dustfinger escape from the book and into their living room. At the same time, Mo's wife Resa gets trapped within the book .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twelve years later, Capricorn is on a hunt to find and destroy all copies of Inkheart and use Mo's abilities to gain more power for himself in the real world. Meggie discovers her father's secret and, along with the help of Dustfinger and Meggie's eccentric aunt Elinor, fights to free her father and destroy Capricorn.</description>

  <description>Watch a video&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The music came back up and the next group of little girls, slightly older, came out. There was a lot of that in the next hour and change. I liked dance, and it was no reflection on the kids, but my will to live began to seep away on about the fifth group of sequined children... &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Anita Blake is back in St. Louis and trying to live a normal life-as normal as possible for someone who is a legal vampire executioner and a U. S. Marshal. There are lovers, friends and their children, school programs to attend. In the midst of all the ordinary happiness a vampire from Anita's past reaches out. She was supposed to be dead, killed in an explosion, but the Mother of All Darkness is the first vampire, their dark creator. It's hard to kill a god. This dark goddess has reached out to her here-in St. Louis, home of everyone Anita loves most. The Mother of All Darkness has decided she has to act now or never, to control Anita, and all the vampires in America. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Mother of All Darkness believes that the triumvirate created by master vampire Jean-Claude with Anita and the werewolf Richard Zeeman has enough power for her to regain a body and to immigrate to the New World. But the body she wants to possess is already taken. Anita is about to learn a whole new meaning to sharing her body, one that has nothing to do with the bedroom. And if the Mother of All Darkness can't succeed in taking over Anita's body for herself, she means to see that no one else has the use of it, ever again. Even Belle Morte, not always a friend to Anita, has sent word: "Run if you can..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Ann Brashares has created a wonderful, heartfelt series for teens (and adults) around a pair of pants. In her breakout bestseller, &lt;em&gt;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants&lt;/em&gt;, Brashares introduced readers to four girls, Lena, Bridget, Carmen, and Tibby, and to the magical pair of jeans that fit them all perfectly, and inspired them to live their young lives to the fullest. &lt;em&gt;Forever in Blue&lt;/em&gt;, the fourth and final novel in the series, promises a dazzling finale--one "last glorious summer" for the four girls, and their fans.</description>

  <description>When fugitive Italian monk Giordano Bruno—philosopher, magician, and heretical scientist—arrives in London, he’s only one step ahead of the Inquisition. An undercover mission for Queen Elizabeth I and her spymaster provides added protection. Officially, Bruno is to take part in a debate on the Copernican theory of the universe at Oxford University; unofficially, he is to find out whatever he can about a Catholic plot to overthrow the queen. But when his mission is dramatically thrown off course by a series of grisly deaths and the charms of a mysterious but beautiful young woman, he realizes that somewhere within Oxford’s private chambers lurks a brutal killer.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this wonderfully transporting novel, award-winning author Karen Essex turns a timeless classic inside out, spinning a haunting, erotic, and suspenseful story of eternal love and possession.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;From the shadowy banks of the river Thames to the wild and windswept Yorkshire coast, Dracula’s eternal muse, Mina Murray, vividly recounts the intimate details of what really transpired between her and the Count—the joys and terrors of a passionate affair that has linked them through the centuries, and her rebellion against her own frightening preternatural powers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mina’s version of this gothic vampire tale is a visceral journey into Victorian England’s dimly lit bedrooms, mist-filled cemeteries, and asylum chambers, revealing the dark secrets and mysteries locked within. Time falls away as she is swept into a mythical journey far beyond mortal comprehension, where she must finally make the decision she has been avoiding for almost a millennium.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Bram Stoker’s classic novel offered one side of the story, in which Mina had no past and bore no responsibility for the unfolding events. Now, for the first time, the truth of Mina’s personal voyage, and of vampirism itself, is revealed. What this flesh and blood woman has to say is more sensual, more devious, and more enthralling than the Victorians could have expressed or perhaps even have imagined.</description>

  <description>Since George Lister’s chemical plant closed down, Innertown has been a shadow of its former self. In the woods that once teemed with life, strange sickly plants grow. Homes that were once happy are threatened by a mysterious illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, a young boy named Leonard and his friends exist in a state of confusion and despair, as every year or so a boy from their school vanishes after venturing into the poisoned woods. Without conclusive evidence of foul play, the authorities consider the boys to be runaways. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The town policeman suspects otherwise but, paralyzed with fear, he does nothing. And so it is up to the children who remain to take action. Their plan to stop the forces of evil that are destroying their town is at the shocking and terrifying heart of &lt;em&gt;The Glister&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>The macabre, witty &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling series (and inspiration for the #1 Showtime series, Dexter) continues as our darkly lovable killer matches wits with a sadistic artiste--who is creating bizarre murder tableaux of his own all over Miami.&lt;br&gt;After his surprisingly glorious honeymoon in Paris, life is almost normal for Dexter Morgan. Married life seems to agree with him: he’s devoted to his bride, his stomach is full, and his homicidal hobbies are nicely under control. But old habits die hard--and Dexter’s work as a blood spatter analyst never fails to offer new temptations that appeal to his offbeat sense of justice...and his Dark Passenger still waits to hunt with him in the moonlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery of a corpse (artfully displayed as a sunbather relaxing on a Miami beach chair) naturally piques Dexter’s curiosity and Miami’s finest realize they've got a terrifying new serial killer on the loose. And Dexter, of course, is back in business.</description>

  <description>In his work as a Miami crime scene investigator, Dexter Morgan is accustomed to seeing evil deeds...particulary because, on occasion, he rather enjoys committing them himself. Guided by his dark Passenger - the voice inside him that helps stalk his prey - he lives his outwardly normal life adhering to one simple rule: he only kills very bad people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dexter slides through life underected, working as a blood splatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, helping his fiancee raise her two adorable (if somewhat...unique) children, and always planning his next jaunt as Dexter the Dark Avenger under the light of the full moon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But everthing changes when Dexter is called to a gruesome double homicide. Dex realises he's dealing with someone a whole lot more sinister than he is and it sends the Dark Passenger into hiding. And when something scares your friendly neighnourhood serial killer, you know it's serious...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More used to inspiring fear then experiencing it, Dex must investigate, while simultaneously coping with is demanding family. If he's to save himself, and those around him, Dexter must pose questions he's never dared ask - where does evil come from, and does it hide inside everyone...?</description>

  <description>Imagine a killer with the infectiousness of the common cold and power of the Black Death. Imagine something so deadly that it wipes out 90 per cent of those it touches. Imagine an organism against which there is no defence. But you don't need to imagine. Such a killer exists: it is a virus and its name is Ebola. "The Hot Zone" tells what happens when the unthinkable becomes reality: when a deadly virus, from the rain forests of Africa, crosses continents and infects a monkey house ten miles from the White House. Ebola is that reality. It has the power to decimate the world's population. Try not to panic. It will be back. There is nothing you can do...</description>

  <description>Few works of literature are as universally beloved as&lt;em&gt; Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Now, in this spellbinding historical novel, we meet the young girl whose bright spirit sent her on an unforgettable trip down the rabbit hole–and the grown woman whose story is no less enthralling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;But oh my dear, I am tired of being Alice in Wonderland. Does it sound ungrateful?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice Liddell Hargreaves’s life has been a richly woven tapestry: As a young woman, wife, mother, and widow, she’s experienced intense passion, great privilege, and greater tragedy. But as she nears her eighty-first birthday, she knows that, to the world around her, she is and will always be only “Alice.” Her life was permanently dog-eared at one fateful moment in her tenth year–the golden summer day she urged a grown-up friend to write down one of his fanciful stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That story, a wild tale of rabbits, queens, and a precocious young child, becomes a sensation the world over. Its author, a shy, stuttering Oxford professor, does more than immortalize Alice–he changes her life forever. But even he cannot stop time, as much as he might like to. And as Alice’s childhood slips away, a peacetime of glittering balls and royal romances gives way to the urgent tide of war.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Alice, the stakes could not be higher, for she is the mother of three grown sons, soldiers all. Yet even as she stands to lose everything she treasures, one part of her will always be the determined, undaunted Alice of the story, who discovered that life beyond the rabbit hole was an astonishing journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A love story and a literary mystery, &lt;strong&gt;Alice I Have Been&lt;/strong&gt; brilliantly blends fact and fiction to capture the passionate spirit of a woman who was truly worthy of her fictional alter ego, in a world as captivating as the Wonderland only she could inspire.</description>

  <description>EMBARK ON A TURBULENT JOURNEY THROUGH A RAVAGED COUNTRYSIDE... WITH ONLY LIARS FOR COMPANY. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this extraordinary novel, Karen Maitland delivers a dazzling reinterpretation of Chaucer's&lt;/em&gt; The Canterbury Tales-- &lt;em&gt;an ingenious alchemy of history, mystery, and powerful human drama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The years is 1348. The Black Plague grips the country. In a world ruled by faith and fear, nine desperate strangers, brought together by chance, attempt to outrun the certain death that is running inexorably toward them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each member of this motley company has a story to tell. From Camelot, the relic-seller who will become the group's leader, the Cygnus, the one-armed storyteller...from the strange silent child called Narigorn to a painter and his pregnant wife, each has a secret. None are what they seems. And one among them conceals the darkest secret of all--propelling these liars to a destiny they never saw coming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magical, heart-quickening, and raw, &lt;em&gt;Company of Liars&lt;/em&gt; is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.</description>

  <description>The birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth birthday. But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years -- except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work "reminiscent of Vonnegut and Douglas Adams" (Philadelphia Inquirer).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more -- except maybe "Maggie," Mary of Magdala -- and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“Deep-earth adventure, scintillating science, and cutthroat intrigue collide with thrilling results that left me breathless and awed. . . . Truly impressive.”—James Rollins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burned by her own government in a trumped-up scandal, brilliant microbiologist Hallie Leland swore she’d never return to the world of cutting-edge science and dangerous secrets. But a shocking summons from the White House changes all that. A mysterious epidemic is killing American soldiers in Afghanistan—and poised for outbreak in the United States and beyond. Without the ultrarare organism needed to create an antidote, millions will die. Hallie knows more about “Moonmilk” than anyone—but it can be found only at the bottom of the deepest cave on Earth. To get there, she and her team of experts must brave a forbidding Mexican jungle crawling with drug cartels, federales, and murderous locals. And in the supercave await far greater terrors: flooded tunnels, acid lakes, bottomless chasms, mind-warping blackness—and a cunning assassin with orders to make the mission a journey of no return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Just like the perilous cave that serves as its backdrop, this story is dark and terrifying—but with a light at its end. The book should come shrink-wrapped with a seat belt.”—Steve Berry&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Brings  a new meaning to ‘frightening.’”—&lt;em&gt;The Star-Ledger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>You may know me best as Meredith Nic Essus, princess of faerie. Or perhaps as Merry Gentry, Los Angeles private eye. In the fey and mortal realms alike, my life is the stuff of royal intrigue and celebrity drama. Among my own, I have confronted horrendous enemies, endured my noble kin’s treachery and malevolence, and honored my duty to conceive a royal heir—all for the right to claim the throne. But I turned my back on court and crown, choosing exile in the human world—and in the arms of my beloved Frost and Darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While I may have rejected the monarchy, I cannot abandon my people. Someone is killing the fey, which has left the LAPD baffled and my guardsmen and me deeply disturbed. My kind are not easily captured or killed. At least not by mortals. I must get to the bottom of these horrendous murders, even if that means going up against Gilda, the Fairy Godmother, my rival for fey loyalties in Los Angeles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even stranger things are happening. Mortals I once healed with magic are suddenly performing miracles, a shocking phenomenon wreaking havoc on human/faerie relations. Though I am innocent, dark suspicions of banned magical activities swirl around me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought I’d left the blood and politics behind in my own turbulent realm. I had dreamed of an idyllic life in sunny L.A. with my beloved ones beside me. But it becomes time to wake up and realize that evil knows no borders, and that nobody lives forever—even if they’re magical.</description>

  <description>Deftly written and emotionally powerful, Drowning Ruth is a stunning portrait of the ties that bind sisters together and the forces that tear them apart, of the dangers of keeping secrets and the explosive repercussions when they are exposed. A mesmerizing and achingly beautiful debut. &lt;br&gt;Winter, 1919. Amanda Starkey spends her days nursing soldiers wounded in the Great War. Finding herself suddenly overwhelmed, she flees Milwaukee and retreats to her family's farm on Nagawaukee Lake, seeking comfort with her younger sister, Mathilda, and three-year-old niece, Ruth. But very soon, Amanda comes to see that her old home is no refuge--she has carried her troubles with her. On one terrible night almost a year later, Amanda loses nearly everything that is dearest to her when her sister mysteriously disappears and is later found drowned beneath the ice that covers the lake. When Mathilda's husband comes home from the war, wounded and troubled himself, he finds that Amanda has taken charge of Ruth and the farm, assuming her responsibility with a frightening intensity. Wry and guarded, Amanda tells the story of her family in careful doses, as anxious to hide from herself as from us the secrets of her own past and of that night. &lt;br&gt;Ruth, haunted by her own memory of that fateful night, grows up under the watchful eye of her prickly and possessive aunt and gradually becomes aware of the odd events of her childhood. As she tells her own story with increasing clarity, she reveals the mounting toll that her aunt's secrets exact from her family and everyone around her, until the heartrending truth is uncovered.&lt;br&gt;Guiding us through the lives of the Starkey women, Christina Schwarz's first novel shows her compassion and a unique understanding of the American landscape and the people who live on it. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>At the turn of the twentieth century, Ellen Rimbauer became the young bride of Seattle industrialist John Rimbauer, and began keeping a remarkable diary. This diary became the secret place where Ellen could confess her fears of the new marriage, her confusion over her emerging sexuality, and the nightmare that her life would become. The diary not only follows the development of a girl into womanhood, it follows the construction of the Rimbauer mansion—called Rose Red—an enormous home that would be the site of so many horrific and inexplicable tragedies in the years ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red&lt;/em&gt; is a rare document, one that gives us an unusual view of daily life among the aristocracy in the early 1900s, a window into one woman's hidden emotional torment, and a record of the mysterious events at Rose Red that scandalized Seattle society at the time—events that can only be fully understood now that the diary has come to light. Edited by Joyce Reardon, Ph.D. as part of her research, the diary is being published as preparations are being made by Dr. Reardon to enter Rose Red and fully investigate its disturbing history.</description>

  <description>Four high school students in present-day New Orleans are torn apart by envy, passion, and tragedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meredith, Brandon, Greg, and Stephen quickly discover the fragile boundaries between friendship and betrayal as they enter high school and form new alliances.  Brandon and Greg gain popularity as football jocks and Meredith joins the bulimic in-crowd, while Stephen becomes the target of homophobia in a school that viciously mocks him.  Then two violent deaths disrupt the core of what they once shared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years later, the friends are drawn back together as new facts about their mutual history are revealed, and what was held to be a tragic accident is discovered to be murder.  As the true story emerges, other secrets begin to unravel and the casual cruelties of high school develop into acts of violence that threaten an entire city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Density of Souls is a stunning debut novel that lays bare the darker side of the teenage experience in modern-day America.</description>

  <description>Fans of The Twilight Saga will be enthralled by this riveting story of Bree Tanner, a character first introduced in Eclipse, and the darker side of the newborn vampire world she inhabits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bree Tanner can barely remember life before she had uncannily powerful senses, superhuman reflexes, and unstoppable physical strength. Life before she had a relentless thirt for blood...life before she became a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Bree knows is that living with her fellow newborns has few certainties and even fewer rules: watch your back, don't draw attention to yourself, and above all, make it home by sunrise or die. What she doesn't know: her time as an immortal is quickly running out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Bree finds an unexpected friend in Diego, a newborn just as curious as Bree about their mysterious creator, whom they only know as &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. As they come to realize that the newborns are pawns in a game larger than anything they could have imagined, Bree and Diego must choose sides and decide whom to trust. But when everything you know about vampires is based on a lie, how do you find the truth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another irresistile combination of danger, mystery, and romance, Stephenie Meyer tells the devastating story of the newborn army as they prepare to close in on Bella Swan and the Cullens, following their encounter to its unforgettable conclusion.</description>

  <description>In James Patterson's blockbuster series, fourteen-year-old Maximum Ride, better known as Max, knows what it's like to soar above the world. She and all the members of the "flock"--Fang, Iggy, Nudge, Gasman and Angel--are just like ordinary kids--only they have wings and can fly. It may seem like a dream come true to some, but their lives can morph into a living nightmare at any time...like when Angel, the youngest member of the flock, is kidnapped and taken back to the "School" where she and the others were experimented on by a crew of wack jobs. Her friends brave a journey to blazing hot Death Valley, CA, to save Angel, but soon enough, they find themselves in yet another nightmare--this one involving fighting off the half-human, half-wolf "Erasers" in New York City. Whether in the treetops of Central Park or in the bowels of the Manhattan subway system, Max and her adopted family take the ride of their lives. Along the way Max discovers from her old friend and father-figure Jeb--now her betrayed and greatest enemy--that her purpose is save the world--but can she?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Don't be afraid," I murmured. "We belong together."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was abruptly overwhelmed by the truth of my own words. This moment was so perfect, so right, there was no way to doubt it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His arms wrapped around me, holding me against him... It felt like every nerve ending in my body was a live wire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Forever," he agreed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life-first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in New Moon and Eclipse-seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

      <![CDATA[I loved the other books, but am really on the fence about this one.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either.  A lot of the plot seemed very convenient, or too busy - too much (like things that should have been saved for a fifth book) and the characters unusually two dimensional.]]>

  <description>In 1972, a 16-year-old American living in Amsterdam finds a mysterious book in her diplomat father's library. The book is ancient, blank except for a sinister woodcut of a dragon and the word "Drakulya," but it's the letters tucked inside, dated 1930 and addressed to "My dear and unfortunate successor," that really pique her curiosity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her widowed father, Paul, reluctantly provides pieces of a chilling story; it seems this ominous little book has a way of forcing itself on its owners, with terrifying results. Paul's former adviser at Oxford, Professor Rossi, became obsessed with researching Dracula and was convinced that he remained alive. When Rossi disappeared, Paul continued his quest with the help of another scholar, Helen, who had her own reasons for seeking the truth. As Paul relates these stories to his daughter, she secretly begins her own research. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kostova builds suspense by revealing the threads of her story as the narrator discovers them: what she's told, what she reads in old letters and, of course, what she discovers directly when the legendary threat of Dracula looms. Along with all the fascinating historical information, there's also a mounting casualty count, and the big showdown amps up the drama by pulling at the heartstrings at the same time it revels in the gruesome. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exotic locales, tantalizing history, a family legacy and a love of the bloodthirsty: it's hard to imagine that readers won't be bitten, too.</description>

  <description>A mysterious house harbors an unimaginable secret. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s wartime, and the Carver family decides to leave the capital where they live and move to a small coastal village where they’ve recently bought a home. But from the minute they cross the threshold, strange things begin to happen. In that mysterious house there still lurks the spirit of Jacob, the previous owners’ son, who died by drowning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of their new friend Roland, Max and Alicia Carver begin to explore the suspicious circumstances of that death and discover the existence of a mysterious being called The Prince of Mist—a diabolical character who has returned from the shadows to collect on a debt from the past. Soon the three friends find themselves caught up in an adventure of sunken ships and an enchanted stone garden, which will change their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In his landmark bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Tipping Point&lt;/em&gt;, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt;, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. &lt;em&gt;Blink&lt;/em&gt; reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In Cornwall, England, three members of the same family have suddenly died. Among the dead is Olivia, the reclusive writer whose war poetry gave Ian Rutledge a handhold on sanity while he fought in the trenches of France. Although no evidence indicates foul play, a concerned and influential relative suspects that the deaths are actually murders, and she convinces Scotland Yard to send someone for a thorough investigation. Rutledge's rival, Bowles, sees the Cornwall incident as an opportunity to get the shell-shocked World War I veteran away from London, where a recent Ripper-style killing spree promises celebrity for the detective who can crack the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accompanying the Inspector to Cornwall is Rutledge's constant "companion" Hamish, the young Scot whom he unwillingly had to execute on the battlefield and whose tormenting voice sounds in Rutledge's head, forcing him to face unpleasant truths.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Ever think Scrooge had it right before the ghosts ruined his life? Meet Aidan O'Conner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At one time he was a world-renowned celebrity who gave freely of himself and his money without wanting anything in return...until those around him took without asking. Now Aidan wants nothing of the world--or anyone who's a part of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a stranger appears at his doorstep, Aidan knows he's seen her before…in his dreams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born on Olympus as a goddess, Leta knows nothing of the human world. But a ruthless enemy has driven her from the world of dreams and into the home of the only man who can help her: Aidan. Her immortal powers are derived from human emotions--and his anger is just the fuel she needs to defend herself…&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One cold winter's night will change their lives forever…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trapped together in a brutal winter storm, Aidan and Leta must turn to the only power capable of saving them--or destroying them both: trust.</description>

Servants of the Furies, we are the right hand of justice and no one stands before us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The son of Warcraft and Hate, Cratus spent eternity battling for the ancient gods who birthed him.

The only hope we have is the one god who swears he will never fight again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a Dream-Hunter, Delphine has spent eternity protecting mankind from the predators who prey on our unconscious state. But now that her allies have been turned, she knows in order to survive, the Dream-Hunters need a new leader. Someone who can train them to fight their new enemies. Cratus is her only hope. But she is a bitter reminder of why he chose to lay down his arms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time is running out and if she can’t win him to her cause, mankind will be slaughtered and the world we know will soon cease to exist.</description>

  <description>In the ethereal world of dreams, there are champions who fight to protect the dreamer and there are demons who prey on them... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arik is such a predator. Condemned by the gods to live eternity without emotions, Arik can only feel when he's in the dreams of others. For thousands of years, he's drifted through the human unconscious, searching for sensation. Now he's finally found a dreamer whose vivid mind can fill his emptiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Megeara Kafieri watched her father ruin himself and his reputation as he searched to prove Atlantis was real. Her deathbed promise to him to salvage his reputation has now brought her to Greece where she intends to prove once and for all that the fabled island is right where her father said it was. But frustration and bad luck dog her every step. Especially the day they find a stranger floating in the sea. His is a face she's seen many times.... in her dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that Arik holds more than the ancient secrets that can help her find the mythical isle of Atlantis. He has made a pact with the god Hades: In exchange for two weeks as a mortal man, he must return to Olympus with a human soul. Megeara's soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a secret society out to ruin her expedition, and mysterious accidents that keep threatening her life, Megeara refuses to quit. She knows she's getting closer to Atlantis and as she does, she stumbles onto the truth of what Arik really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Arik his quest is no longer simple. No human can know of a Dream-Hunter's existence. His dream of being mortal has quickly turned into his own nightmare and the only way to save himself will be to sacrifice the very thing he wanted to be human for. The only question is, will he?</description>

But the greatest threat is yet to come...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Susan Michaels was once the hottest reporter on the Beltway Beat until she walked into a setup that ruined her reputation. Now she's working for a small Seattle paper, penning stories about killer moths and alien babies, convinced that her life couldn't get any worse...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was before an idea for a breaking news piece brings her to a local animal shelter where she ends up listening to her source rant about vampires and gets coerced into adopting a cat despite her allergies. But when her new pet suddenly reveals himself to be a gorgeous - and lethal - shapeshifter, Susan realizes that there's far more at stake than a career-saving by-line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born into a world of predators, Were-Hunter Ravyn Kontis was betrayed by those he loved best. Soulless, pitiless, he has spent three hundred years battling the Diamons who seek to subjugate humankind.

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the realm of the Dark-Hunters there is a code of honor that even immortal bad boys must follow:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harm no human. Drink no blood. Never fall in love. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But every now and again a Dark-Hunter thinks himself above the Code. That's when I'm summoned. Who am I? I'm the one thing the fearless fear. Step over the line and it's my wrath you will face. Nothing can touch me. Nothing can sway me. I am relentless and unfeeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so I thought until I met a female Dark-Hunter who goes by the name of Danger-it's not just her name, it's how she lives her life. She doesn't trust me at all. And who could blame her? She alone knows that I'm here to be judge, jury and most likely executioner of her friends. Yet she is my key to saving some of them. Without her, they all will die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dangereuse St. Richard is a deadly distraction. Something about her is reawakening a heart I thought was long dead. But in a race against evil, the only hope mankind has is that I do my duty. And how can I do my duty when it means that I will have to sacrifice the only woman I've ever loved?&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Live fast, fight hard and if you have to die then take as many of your enemies with you as you can. That is the Amazon credo and it was one Samia lived and died by. Now in contemporary New Orleans, the immortal Amazon warrior is about to learn that there’s a worse evil coming to slaughter mankind than she’s ever faced before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shapeshifter Dev Peltier has stood guard at the front of Sanctuary for almost two hundred years and in that time, he’s seen it all. Or so he thought. Now their enemies have discovered a new source of power- one that makes a mockery of anything faced to date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The war is on and Dev and Sam are guarding ground zero. But in order to win, they will have to break the most cardinal of all rules and pray it doesn’t unravel the universe as we know it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/em&gt; is the true story of a boy whose mother (a poet with delusions of Anne Sexton) gave him away to be raised by her psychiatrist, a dead-ringer for Santa and a lunatic in the bargain. Suddenly, at age twelve, Augusten Burroughs found himself living in a dilapidated Victorian in perfect squalor. The doctor’s bizarre family, a few patients, and a pedophile living in the backyard shed completed the tableau. Here, there were no rules, there was no school. The Christmas tree stayed up until summer, and Valium was eaten like Pez. And when things got dull, there was always the vintage electroshock therapy machine under the stairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/em&gt; is at turns foul and harrowing, compelling and maniacally funny. But above all, it chronicles an ordinary boy’s survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.</description>

  <description>Something strange is happening in the seaside town of Bareneed. Mythical creatures are being pulled from the sea, perfectly preserved corpses of long-lost villagers are washing up on the shore, and residents of the town are suddenly overcome by a mysterious illness that is making them forget how to breathe.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A page-turning gothic thriller reminiscent of H. P. Lovecraft, &lt;em&gt;The Town That Forgot How to Breathe &lt;/em&gt;is "a novel of dazzling ambition and strange, haunting loveliness. . . . An absolute triumph of the storyteller's art" (Joseph O'Connor, author of &lt;em&gt;Star of the Sea&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It was expecting them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conrad and Joanna Harrison, a young couple from Los Angeles, attempt to save their marriage by leaving the pressures of the city to start anew in a quiet, rural setting.  They buy a Victorian mansion that once served as a haven for unwed mothers, called a birthing house.  One day when Joanna is away, the previous owner visits Conrad to bequeath a vital piece of the house’s historic heritage, a photo album that he claims “belongs to the house.”  Thumbing through the old, sepia-colored photographs of midwives and fearful, unhappily pregnant girls in their starched, nineteenth-century dresses, Conrad is suddenly chilled to the bone: staring back at him with a countenance of hatred and rage is the image of his own wife….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            Thus begins a story of possession, sexual obsession, and, ultimately, murder, as a centuries-old crime is reenacted in the present, turning Conrad and Joanna’s American dream into a relentless nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;            An extraordinary marriage of supernatural thrills and exquisite psychological suspense, &lt;em&gt;The Birthing House &lt;/em&gt;marks the debut of a writer whose first novel is a terrifying tour de force.</description>

  <description>The Despair has plagued the earth for five years. Most of the world’s population has inexplicably died by its own hand, and the few survivors struggle to remain alive. A mysterious, shadowy group called the Collectors has emerged, inevitably appearing to remove the bodies of the dead. But in the crumbling state of Florida, a man named Norman takes an unprecedented stand against the Collectors, propelling him on a journey across North America. It’s rumored a scientist in Seattle is working on a cure for the Despair, but in a world ruled by death, it won’t be easy to get there.</description>

  <description>Dark forces are at work at the House of Night and fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird’s adventures at the school take a mysterious turn.  Those who appear to be friends are turning out to be enemies.  And oddly enough, sworn enemies are also turning into friends.  So begins the gripping third installment of this “highly addictive series” (&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;), in which Zoey’s mettle will be tested like never before.  Her best friend, Stevie Rae, is undead and struggling to maintain a grip on her humanity. Zoey doesn’t have a clue how to help her, but she does know that anything she and Stevie Rae discover must be kept secret from everyone else at the House of Night, where trust has become a rare commodity.  Speaking of rare: Zoey finds herself in the very unexpected and rare position of having &lt;em&gt;three &lt;/em&gt;boyfriends. Mix a little bloodlust into the equation and the situation has the potential to spell social disaster.  Just when it seems things couldn’t get any tougher, vampyres start turning up dead. Really dead. It looks like the People of Faith, and Zoey’s horrid step-father in particular, are tired of living side-by-side with vampyres.  But, as Zoey and her friends so often find out, how things appear rarely reflects the truth…</description>

  <description>Fledging vampyre Zoey Redbird has managed to settle in at the House of Night finishing school. She finally feels like she belongs, even gets chosen as the Leader of the Dark Daughters. Best of all, she actually has a boyfriend... or two. Then the unthinkable happens: Human teenagers are being killed, and all the evidence points to the House of Night. While danger stalks the humans from Zoey’s old life, she begins to realize that the very powers that make her so unique might also threaten those she loves. Then, when she needs her new friends the most, death strikes the House of Night, and Zoey must find the courage to face a betrayal that could break her heart, her soul, and jeopardize the very fabric of her world.</description>

  <description>Before the multi-million, runaway bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt;, Dan Brown set his razor-sharp research and storytelling skills on the most powerful intelligence organization on earth--the National Security Agency (NSA), an ultra-secret, multibillion-dollar agency many times more powerful than the CIA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the NSA's invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant and beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage...not by guns or bombs, but by a code so ingeniously complex that if released it would cripple U.S. intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Susan Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the underground hallways of power to the skyscrapers of Tokyo to the towering cathedrals of Spain, a desperate race unfolds. It is a battle for survival--a crucial bid to destroy a creation of inconceivable genius...an impregnable code-writing formula that threatens to obliterate the post-cold war balance of power. Forever.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Finally, help for the millions of people suffering from low-grade depression, also known as dysthymia or chronic discontent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frustrated. Irritable. Discouraged. Fed up. These are among the feelings experienced by millions of people suffering from low-grade depression. Often erroneaously attributed to a negative attitude or laziness, this common condition saps feelings of happiness, contentment, and passion, and frequently goes undiagnosed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Half-Empty Heart&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful and practical book that explains how the condition takes hold--and presents simple yet profound ways to overcome it for good. Using anecdotes from his private practice as well as quizzes, checklists, exercises, and a complete five-week plan for achieving lasting results, clinical psychologist Alan Downs, Ph.D., shines light into the dark corners of this isolating and debilitating condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;feel good again. &lt;em&gt;The Half-Empty Heart&lt;/em&gt; shows the way.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;About three things I was absolutely certain.&lt;br&gt;First, Edwart was most likely my soul mate, maybe.&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a vampire part of him--which I assumed was wildly out of his control--that wanted me dead.&lt;br&gt;And third, I unconditionally, irrevocably, impenetrably, heterogeneously, gynecologically, and disreputably wished he had kissed me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thus Belle Goose falls in love with the mysterious and sparkly Edwart Mullen in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Lampoon&lt;/em&gt;’s hilarious send-up of Twilight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pale and klutzy, Belle arrives in Switchblade, Oregon looking for adventure, or at least an undead classmate. She soon discovers Edwart, a super-hot computer nerd with zero interest in girls. After witnessing a number of strange events–Edwart leaves his tater tots untouched at lunch! Edwart saves her from a flying snowball!–Belle has a dramatic revelation: Edwart is a vampire. But how can she convince Edwart to bite her and transform her into his eternal bride, especially when he seems to find girls so repulsive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complete with romance, danger, insufficient parental guardianship, creepy stalker-like behavior, and a vampire prom, &lt;em&gt;Nightlight&lt;/em&gt; is the uproarious tale of a vampire-obsessed girl, looking for love in all the wrong places.</description>

  <description>The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America’s first ambassador to Hitler’s Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the “New Germany,” she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance—and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler’s true character and ruthless ambition.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, &lt;em&gt;In the Garden of Beasts&lt;/em&gt; lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.</description>

  <description>Did you know?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Freemasonry's first American lodge included a young Benjamin Franklin among its members. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• The Knights Templar&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;began as impoverished warrior monks then evolved into bankers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Groom Lake, Dreamland, Homey Airport, Paradise Ranch, The Farm, Watertown Strip, Red Square, “The Box,” are all names for Area 51. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An indispensable guide, &lt;strong&gt;Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies&lt;/strong&gt; connects the dots and sets the record straight on a host of greedy gurus and murderous messiahs, crepuscular cabals and suspicious coincidences. Some topics are familiar—the Kennedy assassinations, the Bilderberg Group, the Illuminati, the People's Temple and Heaven's Gate—and some surprising, like Oulipo, a select group of intellectuals who created wild formulas for creating literary masterpieces, and the Chauffeurs, an eighteenth-century society of French home invaders, who set fire to their victims' feet.</description>

  <description>At twelve, Howard Dully was guilty of the same crimes as other boys his age: he was moody and messy, rambunctious with his brothers, contrary just to prove a point, and perpetually at odds with his parents. Yet somehow, this normal boy became one of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbital—or ice pick—lobotomy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties in a bottle. It wasn’t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his life together. But even as he began to live the “normal” life he had been denied, Howard struggled with one question: Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“October 8, 1960. I gather that Mrs. Dully is perpetually talking, admonishing, correcting, and getting worked up into a spasm, whereas her husband is impatient, explosive, rather brutal, won’t let the boy speak for himself, and calls him numbskull, dimwit, and other uncomplimentary names.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctor’s attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadn’t intervened on his son’s behalf, was still living. Time was running out. Stable and happy for the first time in decades, Howard began to search for answers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“December 3, 1960. Mr. and Mrs. Dully have apparently decided to have Howard operated on. I suggested [they] not tell Howard anything about it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through his research, Howard met other lobotomy patients and their families, talked with one of Freeman’s sons about his father’s controversial life’s work, and confronted Rodney about his complicity. And, in the archive where the doctor’s files are stored, he finally came face to face with the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revealing what happened to a child no one—not his father, not the medical community, not the state—was willing to protect,&lt;em&gt; My Lobotomy&lt;/em&gt; exposes a shameful chapter in the history of the treatment of mental illness. Yet, ultimately, this is a powerful and moving chronicle of the life of one man. Without reticence, Howard Dully shares the story of a painfully dysfunctional childhood, a misspent youth, his struggle to claim the life that was taken from him, and his redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, &lt;em&gt;Quiet &lt;/em&gt;shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a "pretend extrovert."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.</description>

  <description>In 1917, after years of selling worthless patent remedies throughout the Southeast, John R. Brinkley–America’s most brazen young con man–arrived in the tiny town of Milford, Kansas. He set up a medical practice and introduced an outlandish surgical method using goat glands to restore the fading virility of local farmers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was all nonsense, of course, but thousands of paying customers quickly turned “Dr.” Brinkley into America’s richest and most famous surgeon. His notoriety captured the attention of the great quackbuster Morris Fishbein, who vowed to put the country’s “most daring and dangerous” charlatan out of business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their cat-and-mouse game lasted throughout the 1920s and ’30s, but despite Fishbein’s efforts Brinkley prospered wildly. When he ran for governor of Kansas, he invented campaigning techniques still used in modern politics. Thumbing his nose at American regulators, he built the world’s most powerful radio transmitter just across the Rio Grande to offer sundry cures, and killed or maimed patients by the score, yet his warped genius produced innovations in broadcasting that endure to this day. By introducing country music and blues to the nation, Brinkley also became a seminal force in rock ’n’ roll. In short, he is the most creative criminal this country has ever produced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Culminating in a decisive courtroom confrontation that pit Brinkley against his nemesis Fishbein, &lt;em&gt;Charlatan&lt;/em&gt; is a marvelous portrait of a boundlessly audacious rogue on the loose in an America that was ripe for the bamboozling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The classic supernatural thriller by an author who helped define the genre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; First published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt; has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a "haunting"; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers—and soon it will choose one of them to make its own.&lt;br&gt;  </description>

  <description>In her early thirties, Elizabeth Gilbert had everything a modern American woman was supposed to want--husband, country home, successful career--but instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she felt consumed by panic and confusion. This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and of what she found in their place. Following a divorce and a crushing depression, Gilbert set out to examine three different aspects of her nature, set against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.</description>

  <description>According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for "social") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.</description>

  <description>From the author of the breathtaking bestsellers Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber, the extraordinary saga continues. Their passionate encounter happened long ago by whatever measurement Claire Randall took. Two decades before, she had traveled back in time and into the arms of a gallant eighteenth-century Scot named Jamie Fraser. Then she returned to her own century to bear his child, believing him dead in the tragic battle of Culloden. Yet his memory has never lessened its hold on her... and her body still cries out for him in her dreams.&lt;br&gt;       Then Claire discovers that Jamie survived. Torn between returning to him and staying with their daughter in her own era, Claire must choose her destiny. And as time and space come full circle, she must find the courage to face the passion and pain awaiting her...the deadly intrigues raging in a divided Scotland... and the daring voyage into the dark unknown that can reunite or forever doom her timeless love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a story about cheerful youngsters spending a jolly time at boarding school, look elsewhere. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent and resourceful children, and you might expect that they would do very well at school. Don't. For the Baudelaires, school turns out to be another miserable episode in their unlucky lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, within the chapters that make up this dreadful story, the children will face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E., and the metric system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my solemn duty to stay up all night researching and writing the history of these three hapless youngsters, but you may be more comfortable getting a good night's sleep. In that case, you should probably choose some other book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all due respect,&lt;br&gt;Lemony Snicket&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The world's unluckiest trio of children have their most perilous adventure yet in &lt;em&gt;The Miserable Mill&lt;/em&gt;, the fourth book in Lemony Snicket's delightful tales of woe, A Series of Unfortunate Events. Orphans Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire have yet to find a guardian they can live with and, after the disasters that occurred during their last living arrangement, they are now headed for a lumber mill in the town of Paltryville (most of the names used in these tales are as revealing as they are entertaining), located just beyond the gloomy, black Finite Forest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another misadventure is virtually guaranteed when the children arrive at the mill and discover an eye-shaped building (the eye being Count Olaf's signature symbol) located right next door. Supposedly the building is an eye clinic, but the children have their doubts. Life with their newest caretaker doesn't look very promising either, as the children are forced to work in the mill and bunk in a dormitory with the other employees, all of whom are paid in coupons. Then Klaus breaks his glasses and has to visit the eye clinic. He doesn't return for hours -- and then when he does, he acts very strangely. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet begins to suspect that Klaus has been hypnotized and her investigation of the eye clinic reveals Count Olaf in his latest disguise. It's one the children can see through easily, though they can't seem to convince any of the adults around them that the eye clinic receptionist named Shirley is actually Count Olaf. Only by using their singular strengths -- Violet's knack for inventing, Klaus's book smarts, and Sunny's T-Rex-like bite -- can they escape their latest horrible fate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;While many of the events that occur on these pages are indeed bleak, miserable, and unfortunate, the indomitable spirits of the Baudelaire children and Lemony Snicket's gleeful telling of their tale makes reading them irresistible. As a side benefit, there's also a marvelous education in linguistics hidden amidst the mishaps. &lt;em&gt;(Beth Amos)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This holiday season, join two of today’s most popular paranormal authors for a special look into their worlds, where creatures are always stirring and no one sleeps through the night. . . . &lt;em&gt;The Bite Before Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gift by Lynsay Sands&lt;br&gt;Teddy Brunswick knows about the immortals among us. He’s worked with them, called them friend—but he never counted on being snowed in with one over Christmas. Katricia Argeneau is a tasty little bundle and she seems to feel the same way about him. Problem is, he’s not sure she feels &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; the same way. After all, the snowstorm has derailed her blood delivery, which leaves him the only available meal on the menu. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Home for the Holidays by Jeaniene Frost&lt;br&gt;Cat and Bones are looking forward to a normal holiday—at least as “normal” as it gets for the combustible vampire couple and their otherworldly friends and family. But their yuletide plans are shattered when a stranger shows up and reveals long-buried family secrets that threaten to take a bite out of their holiday cheer . . . and lives.</description>

      <![CDATA[I just read the Jeaniene Frost section.  A nice romp with Cat and Bones.  Not fabulous and very simplified for the plot, which really deserved a full book all its own.  If you are a reader of the series, this one is a MUST.  I don't usually do short stories and would be inclined to skip them, but tha...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She's a mortal with dark powers...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a tragic accident scarred her body and destroyed her dreams, Leila never imagined that the worst was still to come: terrifying powers that let her channel electricity and learn a person's darkest secrets through a single touch. Leila is doomed to a life of solitude...until creatures of the night kidnap her, forcing her to reach out with a telepathic distress call to the world's most infamous vampire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He's the Prince of Night...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vlad Tepesh inspired the greatest vampire legend of all—but whatever you do, don't call him Dracula. Vlad's ability to control fire makes him one of the most feared vampires in existence, but his enemies have found a new weapon against him—a beautiful mortal with powers to match his own. When Vlad and Leila meet, however, passion ignites between them, threatening to consume them both. It will take everything that they are to stop an enemy intent on bringing them down in flames.</description>

  <description>Hunger for nourishment.Hunger for touch.Hunger to belong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half-human and half-faery, Ani is driven by her hungers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those same appetites also attract powerful enemies and uncertain allies, including Devlin. He was created as an assassin and is brother to the faeries' coolly logical High Queen and to her chaotic twin, the embodiment of War. Devlin wants to keep Ani safe from his sisters, knowing that if he fails, he will be the instrument of Ani's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ani isn't one to be guarded while others fight battles for her, though. She has the courage to protect herself and the ability to alter Devlin's plans--and his life. The two are drawn together, each with reason to fear the other and to fear for one another. But as they grow closer, a larger threat imperils the whole of Faerie. Will saving the faery realm mean losing each other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alluring romance, heart-stopping danger, and sinister intrigue combine in the penultimate volume of Melissa Marr's New York Times bestselling Wicked Lovely series.</description>

  <description>Gretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. "The days are long, but the years are short," she realized. "Time is passing, and I'm not focusing enough on the things that really matter." In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this lively and compelling account of that year, Rubin carves out her place alongside the authors of bestselling memoirs such as &lt;em&gt;Julie and Julia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Year of Living Biblically&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/em&gt;. With humor and insight, she chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rubin didn't have the option to uproot herself, nor did she really want to; instead she focused on improving her life as it was. Each month she tackled a new set of resolutions: give proofs of love, ask for help, find more fun, keep a gratitude notebook, forget about results. She immersed herself in principles set forth by all manner of experts, from Epicurus to Thoreau to Oprah to Martin Seligman to the Dalai Lama to see what worked for her—and what didn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her conclusions are sometimes surprising—she finds that money can buy happiness, when spent wisely; that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that "treating" yourself can make you feel worse; that venting bad feelings doesn't relieve them; that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference—and they range from the practical to the profound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written with charm and wit, &lt;em&gt;The Happiness Project&lt;/em&gt; is illuminating yet entertaining, thought-provoking yet compulsively readable. Gretchen Rubin's passion for her subject jumps off the page, and reading just a few chapters of this book will inspire you to start your own happiness project.</description>

  <description>The night is not safe for mortals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denise MacGregor knows all too well what lurks in the shadows – her best friend is half-vampire Cat Crawfield – and she has already lost more than the average human could bear. But her family’s dark past is wrapped in secrets and shrouded in darkness – and a demon shapeshifter has marked Denise as prey. Now her survival depends on an immortal who craves a taste of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is Spade, a powerful, mysterious vampire who has walked the earth for centuries and is now duty-bound to protect this endangered, alluring human – even if it means destroying his own kind. Denise may arouse his deepest hungers, but Spade knows he must fight his urge to have her as they face the demon nightmare together…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because once the first drop of crimson falls, they will both be lost.</description>

  <description>It should be the best time of half-vampire Cat Crawfield’s life. With her undead lover Bones at her side, she’s successfully protected mortals from the rogue undead. But though Cat’s worn disguise after disguise to keep her true identity a secret from the brazen bloodsuckers, her cover’s finally been blown, placing her in terrible danger. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that wasn’t enough, a woman from Bones’s past is determined to bury him once and for all. Caught in the crosshairs of a vengeful vamp, yet determined to help Bones stop a lethal magic from being unleashed, Cat’s about to learn the true meaning of bad blood. And the tricks she’s learned as a special agent won’t help her. She will need to fully embrace her vampire instincts in order to save herself—and Bones—from a fate worse than the grave.</description>

  <description>While parked at a gas station, Rhonda sees something so incongruously surreal that at first she hardly recognizes it as a crime in progress. She watches, unmoving, as someone dressed in a rabbit costume kidnaps a young girl. Devastated over having done nothing, Rhonda joins the investigation. But the closer she comes to identifying the abductor, the nearer she gets to the troubling truth about another missing child: her best friend, Lizzy, who vanished years before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Promise Not to Tell&lt;/em&gt; comes a chilling and mesmerizing tale of shattered innocence, guilt, and ultimate redemption.</description>

  <description>The beloved American classic about a young girl's coming-of-age at the turn of the century, Betty Smith's &lt;em&gt;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant and moving tale filled with compassion and cruelty, laughter and heartache, crowded with life and people and incident. The story of young, sensitive, and idealistic Francie Nolan and her bittersweet formative years in the slums of Williamsburg has enchanted and inspired millions of readers for more than sixty years. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the daily experiences of the unforgettable Nolans are raw with honesty and tenderly threaded with family connectedness -- in a work of literary art that brilliantly captures a unique time and place as well as incredibly rich moments of universal experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 2002, &lt;em&gt;Stupid White Men&lt;/em&gt; took America -- and the world -- by storm. Tired and skeptical of George W. Bush's high approval ating, frightened by the implications of the Enron scandal -- and generally just looking for a voice of honest dissent in the thick atmosphere of jingoism that followed 9/11 -- book buyers from coast to coast swiftly embraced Michael Moore's in-your-face anti-Bush-era manifesto, making it one of the bestselling nonfiction books of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With an unerring eye for greed, hypocrisy, and corruption, Michael Moore takes on the whole ugly mess of America at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Whether he's demanding U.N. action to overthrow the Bush Family Junta or calling on African Americans to place whites only signs over the entrances of unfriendly businesses, &lt;em&gt;Stupid White Men&lt;/em&gt; is a pitch-perfect skewering of our culture of Malfeasance and Mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"[The Book of] Revelation has served as a "language arsenal" in a great many of the social, cultural, and political conflicts in Western history. Again and again, Revelation has stirred some dangerous men and women to act out their own private apocalypses. Above all, the moral calculus of Revelation—the demonization of one's enemies, the sanctification of revenge taking, and the notion that history must end in catastrophe—can be detected in some of the worst atrocities and excesses of every age, including our own. For all of these reasons, the rest of us ignore the book of Revelation only at our impoverishment and, more to the point, at our own peril."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The mysterious author of the Book of Revelation (or the Apocalypse, as the last book of the New Testament is also known) never considered that his sermon on the impending end times would last beyond his own life. In fact, he predicted that the destruction of the earth would be witnessed by his contemporaries. Yet Revelation not only outlived its creator; this vivid and violent revenge fantasy has played a significant role in the march of Western civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since Revelation was first preached as the revealed word of Jesus Christ, it has haunted and inspired hearers and readers alike. The mark of the beast, the Antichrist, 666, the Whore of Babylon, Armageddon, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are just a few of the images, phrases, and codes that have burned their way into the fabric of our culture. The questions raised go straight to the heart of the human fear of death and obsession with the afterlife. Will we, individually or collectively, ride off to glory, or will we drown in hellfire for all eternity? As those who best manipulate this dark vision learned, which side we fall on is often a matter of life or death. Honed into a weapon in the ongoing culture wars between states, religions, and citizenry, Revelation has significantly altered the course of history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirsch, whom the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; calls "a fine storyteller with a flair for rendering ancient tales relevant and appealing to modern audiences," delivers a far-ranging, entertaining, and shocking history of this scandalous book, which was nearly cut from the New Testament. From the fall of the Roman Empire to the Black Death, the Inquisition to the Protestant Reformation, the New World to the rise of the Religious Right, this chronicle of the use and abuse of the Book of Revelation tells the tale of the unfolding of history and the hopes, fears, dreams, and nightmares of all humanity.</description>

  <description>Little Altars Everywhere is a national best-seller, a companion to Rebecca Wells' celebrated novel Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Originally published in 1992, Little Altars introduces Sidda, Vivi, the rest of the spirited Walker clan, and the indomitable Ya-Yas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in alternating voices of Vivi and her husband, Big Shep, along with Sidda, her siblings Little Shep, Lulu, Baylor, and Cheney and Willetta — the black couple who impact the Walkers' lives in ways they never fully comprehend — Little Altars embraces nearly thirty years of life on the plantation in Thorton, Louisiana, where the cloying air of the bayou and a web of family secrets at once shelter, trap and define an utterly original community of souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who can resist such cadences of Sidda Walker and her flamboyant, secretive mother, ViVi? Here the young Sidda — a precocious reader and an eloquent observer of the fault lines that divide her family — leads us on a mischievous adventures at Our Lady of Divine Compassion parochial school and beyond. A Catholic girl of pristine manners, devotion, and provocative ideas, Sidda is the very essence of childhood joy and sorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a series of luminous reminiscences, we also hear Little Shep's stories of his eccentric grandmother, Lulu's matter-of-fact account of her shoplifting skills, and Baylor's memories of Vivi and her friends, the Ya-Yas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beneath the humor and tight-knit bonds of family and friendship lie the undercurrents of alcoholism, abuse, and violence. The overlapping recollections of how the Walkers' charming life uncoils to convey their heart-breaking confusion are oat once unsettling and familiar. Wells creates an unforgettable portrait of the eccentric cast of characters and exposes their poignant and funny attempts to keep reality at arm's length. Through our laughter we feel their inevitable pain, with a glimmer of hope for forgiveness and healing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An arresting combination of colloquialism, poetry, and grace, Little Altars Everywhere is an insightful, piercing and unflinching evocation of childhood, a loving tribute to the transformative power of faith, and a thoroughly fresh chronicle of a family that is as haunted as it is blessed.</description>

  <description>An astonishing story of bravery and honour: one man's quest - against incredible odds - to make a stand against crime.and to uncover the painful truths of his own background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the sagging row houses of New Jersey to the cocaine fields of Colombia, from the razor wire of Rikers Island to the streets of New York City, Bernard Kerik has dedicated his life to a single goal: to fight the injustice he sees around him. A jail warden with a black belt in martial arts and a background in international security and anti-terrorism, he took a substantial pay cut to become a beat cop on the streets of Times Square in 1986. A fearless narcotics detective, he went undercover to buy drugs in Harlem, seized millions of dollars of cocaine from the druglords of the Cali cartel, and was awarded the Police Department's Medal of Valor. As New York City's 40th Police Commissioner, Kerik directed the largest municipal police force in the world, and his battles continued. And yet Bernard Kerik's greatest battle was not pitched on tough city streets, but within himself. The greatest unsolved case of his life: the tragic mystery of his own mother, who abandoned her young son 41 years ago.</description>

  <description>Wally Lamb's two previous novels, &lt;em&gt;She's Come Undone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;I Know This Much Is True,&lt;/em&gt; struck a chord with readers. They responded to the intensely introspective nature of the books, and to their lively narrative styles and biting humor. &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Hour I First Believed,&lt;/em&gt; Lamb travels well beyond his earlier work and embodies in his fiction myth, psychology, family history stretching back many generations, and the questions of faith that lie at the heart of everyday life. The result is an extraordinary tour de force, at once a meditation on the human condition and an unflinching yet compassionate evocation of character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When forty-seven-year-old high school teacher Caelum Quirk and his younger wife, Maureen, a school nurse, move to Littleton, Colorado, they both get jobs at Columbine High School. In April 1999, Caelum returns home to Three Rivers, Connecticut, to be with his aunt who has just had a stroke. But Maureen finds herself in the school library at Columbine, cowering in a cabinet and expecting to be killed, as two vengeful students go on a carefully premeditated, murderous rampage. Miraculously she survives, but at a cost: she is unable to recover from the trauma. Caelum and Maureen flee Colorado and return to an illusion of safety at the Quirk family farm in Three Rivers. But the effects of chaos are not so easily put right, and further tragedy ensues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Maureen fights to regain her sanity, Caelum discovers a cache of old diaries, letters, and newspaper clippings in an upstairs bedroom of his family's house. The colorful and intriguing story they recount spans five generations of Quirk family ancestors, from the Civil War era to Caelum's own troubled childhood. Piece by piece, Caelum reconstructs the lives of the women and men whose legacy he bears. Unimaginable secrets emerge; long-buried fear, anger, guilt, and grief rise to the surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Caelum grapples with unexpected and confounding revelations from the past, he also struggles to fashion a future out of the ashes of tragedy. His personal quest for meaning and faith becomes a mythic journey that is at the same time quintessentially contemporary -- and American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hour I First Believed&lt;/em&gt; is a profound and heart-rending work of fiction. Wally Lamb proves himself a virtuoso storyteller, assembling a variety of voices and an ensemble of characters rich enough to evoke all of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum's classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>“I am not a monster.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or at least that’s what Eavan tells herself. Though Eve knows she is a Glaistig, and that hunger for sex and death – preferably together – runs in her blood, she is determined to keep herself human. She will turn full Glaistig only in the event that she engages in both sex and murder within one month – and so far she’s managed to avoid both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But staying away from temptation is harder than ever before. A mysterious man – as seductive as he is dangerous -- has been drugging and taking advantage of girls in the local night clubs and Eve’s determined to stop him, even as she’s finding it increasingly difficult to control her warring instincts around him. When her grandmother calls in alluring mortal to watch over Eve, Eve may be pushed beyond her limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Eve hang onto her mortality when Glaistig instincts run in her blood? Can she keep herself safe and human, both? Two lines are all that stand between who she is and who she wants to be . . . and Eve will need all her self-control not to cross them both.</description>

  <description>In the nonfiction tradition of John Berendt ("Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil") and Erik Larson ("The Devil in the White City"), &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Douglas Preston presents a gripping account of crime and punishment in the lush hills surrounding Florence, Italy.&lt;br&gt;In 2000, Douglas Preston fulfilled a dream to move his family to Italy. Then he discovered that the olive grove in front of their 14th century farmhouse had been the scene of the most infamous double-murders in Italian history, committed by a serial killer known as the Monster of Florence. Preston, intrigued, meets Italian investigative journalist Mario Spezi to learn more. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;This is the true story of their search for--and identification of--the man they believe committed the crimes, and their chilling interview with him. And then, in a strange twist of fate, Preston and Spezi themselves become targets of the police investigation. Preston has his phone tapped, is interrogated, and told to leave the country. Spezi fares worse: he is thrown into Italy's grim Capanne prison, accused of being the Monster of Florence himself. Like one of Preston's thrillers, &lt;em&gt;The Monster Of Florence&lt;/em&gt;, tells a remarkable and harrowing story involving murder, mutilation, and suicide-and at the center of it, Preston and Spezi, caught in a bizarre prosecutorial vendetta.</description>

  <description>Germany, 1659: When a dying boy is pulled from the river with a mark crudely tattooed on his shoulder, hangman Jakob Kuisl is called upon to investigate whether witchcraft is at play in his small Bavarian town. Whispers and dark memories of witch trials and the women burned at the stake just seventy years earlier still haunt the streets of Schongau. When more children disappear and an orphan boy is found dead ? marked by the same tattoo ? the mounting hysteria threatens to erupt into chaos. Before the unrest forces him to torture and execute the very woman who aided in the birth of his children, Jakob must unravel the truth. With the help of his clever daughter, Magdelena, and Simon, the university-educated son of the town's physician, Jakob discovers that a devil is indeed loose in Schongau. But it may be too late to prevent bloodshed.</description>

  <description>Nostradamus wrote a thousand prophecies. Only 942 have survived. What happened to the missing quatrains? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what secrets did they contain to make it necessary for them to remain hidden? And why did Nostradamus leave his daughter a sealed container in his will? T&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;his mystery drives two men with very different desires. Adam Sabir is a writer desperate to revive his flagging career; Achor Bale is a member of an ancient secret society that has dedicated itself to the protection and support of the ‘Three Antichrists’ foretold in Nostradamus’s verses – Napoleon, Adolf Hitler, and the ‘one still to come’… The pair embark on a terrifying chase through the ancient Romany encampments of France in a quest to locate the missing verses. </description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>A mind-bending supernatural thriller from the creators of "This Present Darkness" and "Saint."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker-two of the most acclaimed writers of supernatural thrillers-have joined forces for the first time to craft a story unlike any you've ever read. Enter "House"-where you'll find yourself thrown into a killer's deadly game in which the only way to win is to lose . . . and the only way out is in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stakes of the game become clear when a tin can is tossed into the house with rules scrawled on it. Rules that only a madman-or worse-could have written. Rules that make no sense yet must be followed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"One game. Seven players. Three rules. Game ends at dawn."</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;More than 20 projects and an array of gallery creations are imaginative and practical fashions-hardworking denim at play.&lt;/strong&gt;Pair cast-off denim with a crafter's unyielding creativity and you have a craft with limitless possibility. Denim is the perfect fabric for many arts and craft methods: it is durable, washable, and dyeable; it can be cut, sliced, shredded, poked, prodded, and cinched. &lt;em&gt;Jean Therapy&lt;/em&gt; teaches basic techniques - building anything from skirts, bags, vests, and accessories - and illuminates these basic techniques with dozens of clever, funky, and stylish variations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jean Therapy&lt;/em&gt; includes straightforward, illustrated instructions for more than 20 projects, running the gamut from simple accessories to reconstructed pants, skirts, and halter tops, each featuring design and personalization tips and techniques. Each project will have a main beauty shot, detail shots (as needed), and a number of technical step illustrations that show creation and assembly details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also includes a detailed chapter on customizing and tailoring clothing for a perfect fit - a key ingredient when working with repurposed clothing.</description>

  <description>An illustrated, encyclopedic overview of the prophecies, calendars, and theories that indicate the year 2012 is a threshold of great change for humanity &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp;bull; Looks at the scientific and anthropological evidence for the rare galactic alignment due to occur in December 2012 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp;bull; Sifts through the catastrophic theories to show what we might really expect in 2012 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In December of 2012 the Mayan Calendar&amp;amp;rsquo;s Great Cycle will come to an end. Opinion remains divided as to whether apocalyptic scenarios of worldwide destruction or utopian visions of a spiritually renewed humanity will prevail after this key date has passed. What is certain, however, is that a rare galactic alignment will occur, one so unique that it is found at the core of many wisdom traditions from around the globe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Geoff Stray has been collecting the vast amounts of data relating to the 2012 phenomena since 1982. Far from confining his research to the Maya, who provide the most prominent predictions indicating this date will herald significant changes for humanity, he has studied the prophetic traditions of other cultures--including the Tibetan, Chinese, Jewish, Ethiopian, and tribal cultures from around the globe--to show the kind of convergence of cosmic purposes happening along a number of parallel tracks. This book offers an extensive study of many modern theories, including Terence McKenna&amp;amp;rsquo;s timewave zero and Maurice Cotterell&amp;amp;rsquo;s sunspot research as well as anomalous phenomena such as near death experiences and crop circles. Sifting through all the scientific research and speculation that the year 2012 has inspired, Geoff Stray provides an encyclopedic look at what we might really expect on this pivotal date.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brilliantly written tour through many lives�and a nation� stranded at the crossroads&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Stuck&lt;/em&gt; the author of the highly praised &lt;em&gt;Party of One: The Loners� Manifesto&lt;/em&gt; identifies a rather striking social trend: many people are stuck. Be it in the wrong relationship, the wrong career, the wrong town, or with the wrong friends, some of them even say they want to make a change but . . . somehow . . . never get the job done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A self-described �adolescent in size-ten shoes who is also a happily married homeowner with a master�s degree,� Anneli Rufus knows whereof she speaks. In this book, she draws on her own life experience as well as interviews with others who are also�in some way or another, and to differing degrees�immobilized. Tracing the many subtle ways in which American culture often conspires to keep us stalled, Rufus delivers a long-awaited diagnosis for our day and age: stuck. But there can be a light at the end of the tunnel; Rufus also tells the stories of people who managed to become unstuck and of others who, after much reflection, decided that where they are is best. After all, she says: �What looks to you like paralysis looks to others like passion. What looks to you like a rut, others would call commitment, true absorption in a topic, a relationship, a career, a pursuit, a place. What looks to you like boredom, others call commitment. And even contentment.�&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuck&lt;/em&gt; is a wise and passionate exploration of the dreams we hold dearest for ourselves�and the road to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; achieving them.</description>

  <description>The &lt;strong&gt;New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; Bestseller from the beloved author of &lt;strong&gt;Bird by Bird&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Traveling Mercies&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mattie Ryder is marvelously neurotic, well-intentioned, funny, religious, sarcastic, tender, angry, and broke. Her life at the moment is a wreck: her marriage has failed, her mother is failing, her house is rotting, her waist is expanding, her children are misbehaving, and she has a crush on a married man. Then she finds a small rubber blue shoe�nothing more than a gumball trinket�left behind by her father. For Mattie, it becomes a talisman�a chance to recognize the past for what it was, to see the future as she always hoped it could be, and to finally understand her family, herself, and the ever-unfolding mystery of her sweet, sad, and sometimes surprising life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From debut author Douglas Nicholas comes a haunting story of love, murder, and sorcery. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;uring the thirteenth century in northwest England, in one of the coldest winters in living memory, a formidable yet charming Irish healer, Molly, and the troupe she leads are driving their three wagons, hoping to cross the Pennine Mountains before the heavy snows set in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Molly, her lover Jack, granddaughter Nemain, and young apprentice Hob become aware that they are being stalked by something terrible. The refuge they seek in a monastery, then an inn, and finally a Norman castle proves to be an illusion. As danger continues to rise, it becomes clear that the creature must be faced and defeated—or else they will all surely die. It is then that Hob discovers how much more there is to his adopted family than he had realized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An intoxicating blend of fantasy and mythology, &lt;em&gt;Something Red &lt;/em&gt;presents an enchanting world full of mysterious and fascinating characters— shapeshifters, sorceresses, warrior monks, and knights—where no one is safe from the terrible being that lurks in the darkness. In this extraordinary, fantastical world, nothing is as it seems, and the journey for survival is as magical as it is perilous.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand."  &lt;br&gt;— Randy Pausch&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A lot of professors give talks titled "The Last Lecture."  Professors are asked to consider   their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them.  And while they speak,   audiences can't help but mull the same question: What wisdom would we impart to the   world if we knew it was our last chance?  If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we   want as our legacy?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  But the lecture he gave--"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams"--wasn't about dying.  It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because "time is all you have...and you may find one day that you have less than you think").  It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe.  It was about &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humor, inspiration and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form.  It is a book that will be shared for generations to come!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In Stefan Merrill Block’s extraordinary debut, three narratives intertwine to create a story that is by turns funny, smart, introspective, and revelatory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abel Haggard is an elderly hunchback who haunts the remnants of his family’s farm in the encroaching shadow of the Dallas suburbs, adrift in recollections of those he loved and lost long ago. As a young man, he believed himself to be “the one person too many”; now he is all that remains. Hundreds of miles to the south, in Austin, Seth Waller is a teenage “Master of Nothingness”–a prime specimen of that gangly, pimple-rashed, too-smart breed of adolescent that vanishes in a puff of sarcasm at the slightest threat of human contact. When his mother is diagnosed with a rare form of early-onset Alzheimer’s, Seth sets out on a quest to find her lost relatives and to conduct an “empirical investigation” that will uncover the truth of her genetic history. Though neither knows of the other’s existence, Abel and Seth are linked by a dual legacy: the disease that destroys the memories of those they love, and the story of Isidora–an edenic fantasy world free from the sorrows of remembrance, a land without memory where nothing is ever possessed, so nothing can be lost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the fusion of myth, science, and storytelling, this novel offers a dazzling illumination of the hard-learned truth that only through the loss of what we consider precious can we understand the value of what remains.</description>

  <description>Every aspect of a relationship takes on the nature of a dilemma when one or both partners are alcoholic. Here, the relatives and friends of alcoholics openly and honestly talk about their marriages and dealing with problems primarily involving sex, communication, maturity, feelings, personalities, security, and independence. Together, these Al-Anon members encourage the reader to "let the understanding, love, and peace of the [Al-Anon] program grow in you one day at a time."</description>

  <description>Since time began, there have been Nightwalkers - the races of the night who live in the shadows of the moonlight. Love with humans is absolutely forbidden, and one man makes certain to uphold this ancient law: Jacob, the Enforcer...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 700 Years, He has resisted temptation. But not tonight...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob knows the excuses his people give when the madness overtakes them and they fall prey to their lust for humans. He's heard every one and still brought the trespassers to justice. Immune to forbidden desires, uncontrollable hungers, or the curse of the moon, his control is total...until the moment he sees Isabella on a shadowy New York City street. Saving her life wasn't in his plans. Nor were the overwhelming feelings she arouses in him. But the moment he holds her in his arms and feels the soft explosion of her body against his, everything changes. Their attraction is undeniable, volatile, and completely against the law. Suddenly everything Jacob has ever believed is inflamed by the heat of desire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bring on the night.</description>

  <description>From award winning writer Gabrielle Zevin comes a biting, powerful, and deliciously entertaining novel about an American family and their misguided efforts to stay afloat--spiritually, morally and financially. &lt;p&gt;Meet the Pomeroys: a church-going family living in a too-red house in a Texas college town. Roger, the patriarch, has impulsively gone back to school, only to find his true ambitions at odds with the temptations of the present. His wife, Georgia, tries to keep things in order at home, but she's been feeding the bill drawer with unopened envelopes for months and can never find the right moment  to confront its swelling contents. In an attempt to climb out of the holes they've dug, Roger and Georgia make a series of choices that have catastrophic consequences for their three children--especially for Patsy, the youngest, who will spend most of her life fighting to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hole We're In&lt;/em&gt; shines a spotlight on some of the most relevant issues of our day--over-reliance on credit, vexed gender and class politics, the war in Iraq--but it is Zevin's deft exploration of the fragile economy of family life that makes this a book for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Tattoos are sexy, fashionable, and creative. This compendium features over 480 designs by the world's leading young graphic artists for tattoos that are new, different, and edgy.Little has appeared that explores fresh designs for tattoos by contemporary graphic artists and designers. &lt;em&gt;Tattoo Art &amp;amp; Design&lt;/em&gt; corrects this with designs by over 60 of today's up-and-coming designers. They draw inspiration from diverse cultures and media, and bridge the highly graphic world of skin art and the exploding creativity in graphic design communities worldwide. Among the featured designers are Kinpro, Klaus Haapaniemi, Marcus Oakley, Rex Koo, Rinzen, Musa Collective, and Stapelberg &amp;amp; Fritz. The designs featured here shatter the conventional notion of the tattoo. Gone are hearts inscribed with names, anchors, Celtic harps, or tribal bands. Instead, the tattoo designs are based on Japanese animé characters, abstract art, hip-hop culture, and Day-Glo pop art in a palette of vibrant colors and elaborate shapes. These fun and playful designs will inspire a new breed of tattoo artist as well as the next generation of graphic designers.</description>

  <description>When a fortune-teller shows bridesmaid Lauren Crow an omen of her gruesome death, she and her friends laugh it off as cheesy theatrics--until women begin disappearing in the night. Even as the streets become more dangerous, Lauren finds herself lusting after a man who is himself dangerous-- and quite possibly crazy. Mark Davidson prowls the city by night armed with crosses and holy water, in search of vampires, whose existence, he insists, is real. He is as irresistibly drawn to Lauren as she is to him, and not only because she's the image of his murdered fiancee. But Mark's frightening obsession with finding his lover's killer merely hides a bitter vendetta that cuts deeper than grief over a lost love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lauren wrestles with desire and disbelief, sinister shadows lengthen over New Orleans, threatening her friends and foretelling a battle that may spell the end of the city's uneasy truce between the living and the undead.</description>

  <description>Everyone has heard ghost stories in the course of his or her life. Although some people are true believers, many others are skeptical of such dark and unearthly tales. &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hauntings!: Real-Life Encounters with Troubled Spirits&lt;/em&gt;, parapsychologist Dr. &lt;em&gt;Hazel Denning&lt;/em&gt; offers a believable way of looking at these inexplicable visitors, providing irrefutable evidence to support the occurrence of paranormal phenomena. &lt;br&gt;The book doesn't just tell stories of haunted houses, channeling, psychic attacks, possession, and witchcraft, it tells them from the tormented, earthbound spirits' points of view! &lt;br&gt;Read about: A French architect, executed in the 1600s, who possessed a normally cheerful woman and caused her to have violent outbursts. &lt;br&gt;Edmund, who killed his sister's fiance and remained in his family's red-brick mansion for thirty years after his physical death.&lt;br&gt;A boy in Los Angeles who was struck with uncontrollable fits of demonic rage.&lt;br&gt;A woman who experienced a nearly fatal illness because doctors could not diagnose her mysterious abdominal pains. &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hauntings!&lt;/em&gt; readers will discover that ghostly encounters take place beyond the pages of storybooks; they happen in the lives of real people everywhere.</description>

  <description>Once upon a time, in the haunted city of Derry, four boys stood together and did a brave thing. It was something that changed them in ways they could never begin to understand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dreamcatcher&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Twenty-five years after saving a Down's-syndrome kid from bullies, Beav, Henry, Pete, and Jonesy -- now men with separate lives and separate problems -- reunite in the woods of Maine for their annual hunting trip. But when a stranger stumbles into their camp, disoriented and mumbling something about lights in the sky, chaos erupts. Soon, the four friends are plunged into a horrifying struggle with a creature from another world where their only chance of survival is locked in their shared past -- and in the Dreamcatcher. &lt;br&gt; Never before has Stephen King contended so frankly with the heart of darkness. &lt;em&gt;Dreamcatcher,&lt;/em&gt; his first full-length novel since &lt;em&gt;Bag of Bones,&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful story of astonishing range that will satisfy fans both new and old.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;What compels mountain climbers to take the risks that they do? Is it the thrill in the physical accomplishment, in managing to defy the odds, or both -- and why do they continue to do what they do in the face of such great danger? In &lt;em&gt;On the Ridge Between Life and Death&lt;/em&gt;, David Roberts confronts these questions head-on as he recounts the exhilarating highs and desperate lows of his climbing career. By the time he was twenty-two, Roberts had already been involved in three fatal mountain climbing accidents and had escaped death himself by the sheerest of luck. And yet, as he acknowledges, few things have brought him more joy than climbing.  &lt;p&gt; In a famous essay on the subject written more than twenty years ago, Roberts judged climbing to be "worth the risk." He continues to climb to this day, and several of his challenging routes in Alaska have never been climbed since. But in reassessing the emotional costs to himself and to loved ones, he reaches a different conclusion, one that is sure to cause controversy not only in climbing circles, but among adventurers of all kinds. Candid and unflinching, &lt;em&gt;On the Ridge Between Life and Death&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling examination of the risks we take in order to feel more alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Do you believe in ghosts? Whether you are a believer or a skeptic, the stories of the supernatural in &lt;em&gt;Ghosts Among Us: True Stories of Spirit Encounters &lt;/em&gt;will keep you riveted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Macabre and fascinating, &lt;em&gt;Ghosts Among Us&lt;/em&gt; offers true-life, haunting accounts of eerie visitations and paranormal experiences along with artistically shot black-and-white photographs of haunted sites. The personal, firsthand reports and chilling, full-length stories are bolstered by sidebars of actual accounts of &amp;amp;quot;Ghosts in the News.&amp;amp;quot; Each chapter explores mysterious events-events that the reader will find hard to pass off as mere coincidence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her quest to uncover explanations for each incident, Leslie Rule extensively researched library archives and interviewed credible witnesses, historians, renowned psychics, and parapsychologists. Throughout &lt;em&gt;Ghosts Among Us,&lt;/em&gt; Rule's findings are mesmerizing. She writes about being raised in a haunted house. &amp;amp;quot;To top that,&amp;amp;quot; Rule explains, &amp;amp;quot;[my mother] introduced me to a serial killer when I was fourteen.&amp;amp;quot; The reader is invited to skip ahead to learn about that chilling episode...but the pages prior to that offer their own gripping, spell-binding encounters.</description>

  <description>A lush, seductive novel of the legendary beauty whose face launched a thousand ships&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daughter of a god, wife of a king, prize of antiquity's bloodiest war, Helen of Troy has inspired artists for millennia. Now, Margaret George, the highly acclaimed bestselling historical novelist, has turned her intelligent, perceptive eye to the myth that is Helen of Troy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Margaret George breathes new life into the great Homeric tale by having Helen narrate her own story. Through her eyes and in her voice, we experience the young Helen's discovery of her divine origin and her terrifying beauty. While hardly more than a girl, Helen married the remote Spartan king Menelaus and bore him a daughter. By the age of twenty, the world's most beautiful woman was resigned to a passionless marriage until she encountered the handsome Trojan prince Paris. And once the lovers flee to Troy, war, murder, and tragedy become inevitable. In Helen of Troy, Margaret George has captured a timeless legend in a mesmerizing tale of a woman whose life was destined to create strife and destroy civilizations.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; series-with an extra serving of historical realism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A prince with a quest. A commoner with mysterious powers. And dragons that demand to be freed—at any cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prince Corin has been chosen to free the dragons from their bondage to the Empire, but dragons aren’t big on directions. They have given him some of their power, but none of their knowledge. No one, not the dragons nor their riders, is even sure what keeps the dragons in the Empire’s control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tam, sensible daughter of a well-respected doctor, had no idea before she arrived in the capital that she is a Seer, gifted with visions. When the two run into each other (quite literally) in the library, sparks fly and Corin impulsively asks Tam to dinner. But it’s not all happily ever after. Never mind that the prince isn’t allowed to marry a commoner: war is coming to Caithen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn between Corin’s quest to free the dragons and his duty to his country, the lovers must both figure out how to master their powers in order to save Caithen. With a little help from a village of secret wizards and a rogue dragonrider, they just might pull it off.</description>

  <description>Los Angeles. Once, it was the City of Angels. Now, it's Crimson City, whose inhabitants know nothing of Heaven. The tentative peace between the species --- werewolf, vampire, human --- teeters on the brink of collapse. Sides are being chosen. Yet the peril is greater than any imagine. There is a power here that longs for release, an ancient darkness held captive too long. Below, beneath, beyond, it seethes. And there are those who would see it freed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mika herself seeks freedom. She's come to Crimson City looking for the key. But that key's keeper is a killer, an outsider, a mercenary with a poisoned past. To her kind, he has meant only death. No matter that Conor McCabe's pale green eyes hold a hint of lust, the glint of a bond never to be broken; the path ahead lies in shadow. In a city like this, death can come by fire or fang, by claw or kiss. And the moment of truth must come ... THROUGH A CRIMSON VEIL</description>

  <description>The grisly murders are just the beginning. Dean Campbell, ex-cop and clairvoyant, is sent to investigate. He is with the Dirk &amp;amp; Steele Detective Agency, that global association of more-than-human men and women. Shapeshifters, psychics and other paranormals, Dean and his peers are devoted to protecting life. But there are those who live to destroy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Taipei, he finds the remains of burned-alive men and women, bits of bone and ash, that reveal a pattern far more deadly than any he has foreseen. Someone knows Dean s secret. And they know more of a power that can change the world, and of a woman who can complete him: Mirabelle Lee, the childhood sweetheart he d once thought dead. Now, all that remains was blinding light and searing pain, potent passion and a purifying fire. And beneath it all is</description>

  <description>First time in trade from the Bram Stoker Award-winning author, with a new introduction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "He brings into being a world of haunted and perilous fantasy," hails Peter Straub of Christopher Golden, and it's never been truer than in this unique novel of dark fiction about the strange summer of a young boy coming of age. But for Kevin Murphy, this is also the season to confess his secret love to his longtime crush, Nikki. When she mysteriously disappears, it's up to Kevin and his friends to follow her, and to find her, in a neverland from which they might never return</description>

  <description>Clinical psychologist Alan Gregory faces disgrace and ruin when several of his attractive female clients die untimely deaths. But professional ethics prevent Gregory from revealing the "privileged information" that will clear his name and perhaps save his life-since the killer responsible for these deaths may be one of his patients.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Because everyone - and every&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; - needs a break from the routine, Charlaine Harris and Toni L. P. Kelner return with an all-new story collection of postcards from the edge of the paranormal world...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really can be an endless summer - if you're immortal. Though a vampire would be ill-advised to take a cruise to Bermuda, the possibilities for getting away from it all - and maybe snacking on some unsuspecting tourist - are many...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sookie Stackhouse and her vampire friend Pam take a weekend getaway to Mississippi in #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Charlaine Harris's "Two Blondes." And when they end up in a shady gentleman's club, to escape in one piece they need to do something that wasn't on their itinerary - something involving a stage, a pole, and very little clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Katie MacAlister's "The Perils of Effrijim" follow a demon whose vacation in Paris is disrupted when he's banished to another plane, thus kicking off a crazy dimension-hopping road trip across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting an heiress from supernatural hit men isn't Cat and Bones's idea of a relaxing vacation in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jeaniene Frost's "One for the Money," but it could get worse. And it does - when Cat's mother shows up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With ten more original tales, editors Harris and Kelner bring together a stellar collection of tour guides who offer vacations frightening, funny, and touching - for the fanged, the furry, the demonic, and the grotesque.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When a vampire asks cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse for a favor, she complies. And soon she's in Dallas, using her telepathic skills to search for a missing vampire. She agrees to interview the humans involved as long as the bloodsuckers promise to let them go unharmed. Easier said than done. All it takes is one delicious blonde and one small mistake for things to turn deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Charlaine Harris playfully mixes several genres to make a new one that is her own bright creation." &lt;em&gt;-Rocky Mountain News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Blending action, romance, and comedy, Harris has created a fully functioning world so very close to our own, except, of course, for the vamps and other supernatural creatures." &lt;em&gt;-The Toronto Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"An entertaining series...It's easy to understand why these oddly charming books have become so popular." &lt;em&gt;-The New Orleans Times-Picayune&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Some zombies are raised. Others must be put down. Just ask Anita Blake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before now, she would have considered them merely off-putting, never dangerous. Before now, she had never heard of any of them causing human beings to perish in agony. But that’s all changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micah’s estranged father lies dying, rotting away inside from some strange ailment that has his doctors whispering about “zombie disease.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anita makes her living off of zombies—but these aren’t the kind she knows so well. These creatures hunt in daylight, and are as fast and strong as vampires. If they bite you, you become just like them. And round and round it goes…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where will it stop?&lt;br&gt;Even Anita Blake doesn’t know.</description>

  <description>For eighteen years, Fran Benedetto kept her secret. And hid her bruises. And stayed with Bobby because she wanted her son to have a father. And because, in spite of everything, she loved him. Then one night, when she saw the look on her ten-year-old son's face, Fran finally made a choice--and ran for both their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she is starting over in a city far from home, far from Bobby. And in this place she uses a name that isn't hers, and cradles her son in her arms, and tries to forget. For the woman who now calls herself Beth, every day is a chance to heal, to put together the pieces of her shattered self. And every day she waits for Bobby to catch up to her. Because Bobby always said he would never let her go. And despite the flawlessness of her escape, Fran Benedetto is certain of one thing: It is only a matter of time...</description>

  <description>Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away. The earth has been invaded by a species that take over the minds of human hosts while leaving their bodies intact. Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, didn't expect to find its former tenant refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Melanie fills Wanderer's thoughts with visions of Jared, a human who still lives in hiding, Wanderer begins to yearn for a man she's never met. Reluctant allies, Wanderer and Melanie set off to search for the man they both love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring one of the most unusual love triangles in literature, THE HOST is a riveting and unforgettable novel about the persistence of love and the essence of what it means to be human.</description>

      <![CDATA[I think that this book has a really good premise that fell flat.  Although there were a few bright spots, for the most part, some inspired direction and a brutal editing would have done wonders.]]>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Wulf is an ancient Viking warrior with a useful but extremely aggravating power—amnesia. No one who meets him in person can remember him 5 minutes later. It makes it easy to have one-night stands, but hard to have a meaningful relationship, and without true love he can never regain his soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he finally meets Cassandra, the one woman who can remember him, she turns out to be the princess of the cursed race he's sworn to hunt—and forbidden to him. The two of them must face ancient curses, prophecies, and the direct meddling of the Greek gods to find true happiness at last.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>What if the hottest guy in the world was hiding a nameless evil, and all he wanted was you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the start of this heart-pounding new installment of the bestselling House of Night series, Zoey's friends have her back again and Stevie Rae and the red fledglings aren't Neferet's secrets any longer. But an unexpected danger has emerged. Neferet guards her powerful new consort, Kalona, and no one at the House of Night seems to understand the threat he poses. Kalona looks gorgeous, and he has the House of Night under his spell. A past life holds the key to breaking his rapidly spreading influence, but what if this past life shows Zoey secrets she doesn't want to hear and truths she can't face?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the run and holed up in Tulsa's Prohibition-era tunnels, Zoey and her gang must discover a way to deal with something that might bring them all down. Meanwhile, Zoey has a few other little problems. The red fledglings have cleaned up well - they've even managed to make the dark, creepy tunnels feel more like home - but are they really as friendly as they seem? On the boyfriend front, Zoey has a chance to make things right with super-hot ex-, Erik, but she can't stop thinking about Stark, the archer who died in her arms after one unforgettable night, and she is driven to try to save him from Neferet's sinister influence at all costs. Will anyone believe the power evil has to hide among us?</description>

  <description>In this hilarious and ultimately moving memoir, comedians and real-life married couple Annabelle Gurwitch and Jeff Kahn prove that in marriage, all you need is love—and a healthy dose of complaining, codependence, and pinot noir.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;After thirteen years of being married, Annabelle and Jeff have found “We’re just not that into us.” Instead of giving up, they’ve held their relationship together by ignoring conventional wisdom and fostering a lack of intimacy, by using parenting as a competitive sport, and by dropping out of couples therapy. The he-said/she-said chronicle of their intense but loving marriage includes an unsentimental account of the medical odyssey that their family embarked upon after their infant son was diagnosed with VACTERL, a very rare series of birth defects. Annabelle and Jeff’s unforgivingly raw, uproariously funny story is sure to strike both laughter and terror in the hearts of all couples (not to mention every single man or woman who is contemplating the connubial state).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Serving up equal parts sincerity and cynicism, &lt;em&gt;You Say Tomato, I Say Shut Up &lt;/em&gt;is a laugh-out-loud must-read for everyone who has come to realize that being “in love” can only get you so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Cohabitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He says: &lt;/strong&gt;“Within days of Annabelle’s arrival, I became very aware that she demanded solitude and had the housekeeping habits of a feral animal.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;She says: &lt;/strong&gt;“The guy had some sort of nudity radar. When I would take my clothes off for even a second, Jeff would be in front of me cheering as if he’d scored box seats at Fenway Park.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Sex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He says: &lt;/strong&gt;“I want to have sex every day, but Annabelle only wants to do it once a week. So we compromise: we have sex once a week.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;She says: &lt;/strong&gt;“Jeff says talking about money before you have sex is a turnoff, but it’s only a &lt;em&gt;turnoff &lt;/em&gt;if you’re talking about not having money. Talking about money before you have sex when you have money is actually a &lt;em&gt;turn-on&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He says: &lt;/strong&gt;“For God’s sake, all I wanted to do was have sex without a condom for a little while; now we were moments from bringing a new life into the world!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;She says: &lt;/strong&gt;“My ass was expanding so fast it was like a Starbucks franchise. On every corner of my ass there was a new branch of ass opening up.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For Taoists everywhere, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Te of Piglet&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The how of Pooh? The Tao of who? The Tao of Pooh!?! In which it is revealed that one of the world's great Taoist masters isn't Chinese--or a venerable philosopher--but is in fact none other than that effortlessly calm, still, reflective bear. A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh! While Eeyore frets, and Piglet hesitates, and Rabbit calculates, and Owl pontificates, Pooh just is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that's a clue to the secret wisdom of the Taoists.</description>

  <description>In 2010 world-renowned innovation expert Clayton M. Christensen gave a powerful speech to the Harvard Business School's graduating class. Drawing upon his business research, he offered a series of guidelines for finding meaning and happiness in life. He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father's life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question "How do you measure your life?" became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I'll find satisfaction in my career? How can I be sure that my personalrelationships become enduring sources of happiness? How can I avoid compromising my integrity—and stay out of jail? Using lessons from some of the world's greatest businesses, he provides incredible insights into these challenging questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Will You Measure Your Life?&lt;/em&gt; is full of inspiration and wisdom, and will help students, midcareer professionals, and parents alike forge their own paths to fulfillment.</description>

  <description>In this riveting work of narrative nonfiction, journalist Graham Bowley re-creates one of the most dramatic tales of death and survival in mountaineering history, vividly taking readers through the tragic 2008 K2 ascent that claimed the lives of eleven climbers, severely injured two others, and made headlines around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its near-perfect pyramid shape, the 28,251-foot K2—the world's second-highest mountain, some 800 feet shorter than the legendary Everest hundreds of miles to the south—has lured serious climbers for decades. In 2008, near the end of a brief climbing season cut even shorter by bad weather, no fewer than ten international teams—some experienced, others less prepared—crowded the mountain's dangerous slopes with their Sherpas and porters, waiting to ascend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, on August 1, they were able to set off. But hindered by poor judgment, lack of equipment, and overcrowded conditions, the last group did not summit until nearly 8 p.m., hours later than planned. Then disaster struck when a huge ice chunk from above the Bottleneck, a deadly 300-foot avalanche-prone gulley just below the summit, came loose and destroyed the fixed guide ropes. More than a dozen climbers and porters still above the Bottleneck—many without oxygen and some with no headlamps—faced the near impossibility of descending in the blackness with no guideline and no protection. Over the course of the chaotic night, some would miraculously make it back. Others would not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on in-depth interviews with surviving climbers and many Sherpas, porters, and family and friends of the deceased, &lt;em&gt;No Way Down&lt;/em&gt; reveals for the first time the full dimensions of this harrowing drama.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Bianca wants to escape.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's been uprooted from her small hometown and enrolled at Evernight Academy, an eerie Gothic boarding school where the students are somehow too perfect: smart, sleek, and almost predatory. Bianca knows she doesn't fit in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Lucas. He's not the "Evernight type" either, and he likes it that way. Lucas ignores the rules, stands up to the snobs, and warns Bianca to be careful—even when it comes to caring about him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I couldn't stand it if they took it out on you,"&lt;/em&gt; he tells Bianca, &lt;em&gt;"and eventually they would." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the connection between Bianca and Lucas can't be denied. Bianca will risk anything to be with Lucas, but dark secrets are fated to tear them apart . . . and to make Bianca question everything she's ever believed.</description>

  <description>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and inspiring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a Gypsy woman, a man who calls himself king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But what starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasure found within. Lush, evocative, and deeply humane, the story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts.</description>

  <description>In her first book in over 10 years, Pia Mellody—author of the groundbreaking bestsellers&lt;em&gt; Facing Codependence &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Facing Love Addiction&lt;/em&gt;—shares her profound wisdom on what it takes to sustain true intimacy and trusting love in our most vital relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on more than 20 years' experience as a counsellor at the renowned Meadows Treatment Centre in Arizona, Mellody now shares what she has learned about why intimate relationships falter—and what makes them work. Using the most up–to–date research and real–life examples, including her own compelling personal journey, Mellody provides readers with profoundly insightful and practical ground rules for relationships that achieve and maintain joyous intimacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This invaluable resource helps diagnose the causes of faulty relationships—many of them rooted in childhood—and provides tools for readers to heal themselves, enabling them to establish and maintain healthy relationships.</description>

  <description>A riveting collection of literary journalism by the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Perfect Storm,&lt;/em&gt; capped off brilliantly by a new Afterword and a timely essay about war-torn Afghanistan -- a superb eyewitness report about the Taliban's defeat in Kabul -- new to book form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebastian Junger has made a specialty of bringing to life the drama of nature and human nature. Few writers have been to so many disparate and desperate corners of the globe. Fewer still have met the standard of great journalism more consistently. None has provided more starkly memorable evocations of extreme events. From the murderous mechanics of the diamond trade in Sierra Leone, to an inferno forest fire burning out of control in the steep canyons of Idaho, to the forensics of genocide in Kosovo, this collection of Junger's reporting will take readers to places they need to know about but wouldn't dream of going on their own. In his company we travel to these places, pass through frightening checkpoints, actual and psychological, and come face-to-face with the truth.</description>

  <description>His most daringly political, sexually transgressive, and moving novel in well over a decade" (&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner of a 2013 Lambda Literary Award&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novel of desire, secrecy, and sexual identity, &lt;em&gt;In One Person&lt;/em&gt; is a story of unfulfilled love&amp;amp;#8212;tormented, funny, and affecting&amp;amp;#8212;and an impassioned embrace of our sexual differences. Billy, the bisexual narrator and main character of &lt;em&gt;In One Person&lt;/em&gt;, tells the tragicomic story (lasting more than half a century) of his life as a "sexual suspect," a phrase first used by John Irving in 1978 in his landmark novel of "terminal cases," &lt;em&gt;The World According to Garp&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In One Person&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant tribute to Billy&amp;amp;#8217;s friends and lovers&amp;amp;#8212;a theatrical cast of characters who defy category and convention. Not least, &lt;em&gt;In One Person&lt;/em&gt; is an intimate and unforgettable portrait of the solitariness of a bisexual man who is dedicated to making himself "worthwhile.</description>

  <description>BAD agent Sydney Westbrook must find the perfect sniper for a risky counter-terrorism mission. J.D. Steele, a military sniper whose attitude problem landed him in prison, seems a good candidate. But as they're dragged into a secret world of freelance killers, Sydney begins to discover the man of honor and passion beneath Steele's arrogant façade. It's a man even Steele didn't know he could be -- and a man whose mission will risk the life of the only woman he's ever loved...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An inventive and richly visual novel about young lovers on a quest to find a cure for a magical ailment, perfect for readers of Alice Hoffman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strange things are happening on the remote and snowbound archipelago of St. Hauda’s Land. Unusual winged creatures flit around the icy bogland, albino animals hide themselves in the snow-glazed woods, and Ida Maclaird is slowly turning into glass. Ida is an outsider in these parts, a mainlander who has visited the islands only once before. Yet during that one fateful visit the glass transformation began to take hold, and now she has returned in search of a cure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Midas Crook is a young loner who has lived on the islands his entire life. When he meets Ida, something about her sad, defiant spirit pierces his emotional defenses. As Midas helps Ida come to terms with her affliction, she gradually unpicks the knots of his heart. Love must be paid in precious hours and, as the glass encroaches, time is slipping away fast. Will they find a way to stave off the spread of the glass?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Girl with Glass Feet&lt;/em&gt; is a dazzlingly imaginative and magical first novel, a love story to treasure.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;At the dawn of the nineteenth century, two very different magicians emerge to change England’s history. In the year 1806, with the Napoleonic Wars raging on land and sea, most people believe magic to be long dead in England—until the reclusive Mr Norrell reveals his powers, and becomes a celebrity overnight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, another practicing magician comes forth: the young, handsome, and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell’s student, and they join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic, straining his partnership with Norrell, and putting at risk everything else he holds dear.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>British diplomat Justin Quayle, complacent raiser of freesias and doting husband of the stunning, much younger Tessa, has tended his own garden in Nairobi too long. Tessa is Justin's opposite, a fiery reformer, "that rarest thing, a lawyer who believes in justice," whose campaigns have earned her a nickname: "the Princess Diana of the African poor." But now Tessa has turned up naked, raped, and dead on a mysterious visit to remote Lake Turkana in Kenya. Her traveling companion (and lover?), the handsome Congolese-Belgian doctor Arnold Bluhm, has vanished. So has Quayle's complacency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tessa had been compiling data against a multinational drug company that uses helpless Africans as guinea pigs to test a tuberculosis remedy with unfortunately fatal side effects. Her report was destroyed by her husband's superiors; was she? It's all somehow connected to the sinister British firm House of ThreeBees, whose ad boasts that it's "buzzy for the health of Africa!" John le Carré symbolically associates ThreeBees with an ominous buzz in the Nairobi morgue: "Over [the corpses], in a swaying, muddy mist, hung the flies, snoring on a single note."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The home office tries to take Quayle in out of the cold. He cleverly eludes their clammy embrace, turns spy, and takes off on a global chase to avenge Tessa and solve her murder. Le Carré has lost none of his gift for setting vivid scenes in far-flung places expertly described: London, Germany, Saskatchewan, Kenya. His sprinting thriller prose remains in great shape. And thanks to his 16 years in the British Foreign Office, his merciless send-up of its cutthroat intrigues and petty self-delusions is unbelievably good--or rather, believably so. This is global do-gooder satire on a literary par with Doris Lessing's The Summer Before the Dark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you want to know if The Constant Gardener is as good as Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Very nearly. Africa's nightmare is more complex than the cold war chess match, and the world pharmaceutical circus is tougher to dramatize than the old spy-versus-spy-versus-spymaster game. Still, le Carré can write a smart, melancholy page-turner, and his moral outrage (the real subject of his books) burns as brightly as ever. --Tim Appelo</description>

  <description>Trisha McFarland is a plucky 9-year-old hiking with her brother and mom, who is grimly determined to give the kids a good time on their weekends together. Trisha's mom is recently divorced, and her brother is feuding with her for moving from Boston to small-town Maine, where classmates razz him. Trisha steps off the trail for a pee and a respite from the bickering. And gets lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trisha's odyssey succeeds on several levels. King renders her consciousness of increasing peril beautifully, from the "first minnowy flutter of disquiet" in her guts to her into-the-wild tumbles to her descent into hallucinations, the nicest being her beloved Red Sox baseball pitcher Tom Gordon, whose exploits she listens to on her Walkman. The nature writing is accurate, tense, and sometimes lyrical, from the maddening whine of the no-see-um mosquito to the profound obbligato of the "Subaudible" (Trisha's dad's term for nature's intimations of God). Our identification with Trisha deepens as we learn about her loved ones: Dad, a dreamboat whose beer habit could sink him; loving but stubborn Mom; Trisha's best pal, Pepsi Robichaud, vividly evoked by her colorful sayings ("Don't go all GIRLY on me, McFarland!"). The personal associations triggered by a full moon, the running monologue with which she stays sane--we who have been lost in woods will recognize these things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In King's revealing Amazon.com interview, he said the one book he wishes he'd written was &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;. When Trisha confronts a vision of buzzing horror in the middle of the woods, King creates his strongest echo yet of the central passage of Golding's novel. &lt;em&gt;--Tim Appelo&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In the 1630s, visitors to the prosperous trading cities of the Netherlands couldn't help but notice that thousands of normally sober, hardworking Dutch citizens from every walk of life were caught up in an extraordinary frenzy of buying and selling. The object of this unprecedented speculation was the tulip, a delicate and exotic Eastern import that had bewitched horticulturists, noblemen, and tavern owners alike. For almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history, and like so many of the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the history of the tulip, from its origins on the barren, windswept steppes of central Asia to its place of honor in the lush imperial gardens of Constantinople, to its starring moment as the most coveted--and beautiful--commodity in Europe. Historian Mike Dash vividly narrates the story of this amazing flower and the colorful cast of characters--Turkish sultans, Yugoslav soldiers, French botanists, and Dutch tavern keepers--who were centuries apart historically and worlds apart culturally, but who all had one thing in common: tulipomania.</description>

  <description>The Perry family's new house is perfect-except for the weird behavior of the neighbors, and that odd smell coming from a dark corner in the basement. Pity no one warned the family about the house. Now it's too late. Because the darkness at the bottom of the basement stairs is rising.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;At last, Zoey has what she wanted:&lt;/strong&gt; the truth is out. Neferet's evil has been exposed, and the High Council is no longer on her side - but she's far from done wreaking havoc in the vampyre world. First, a mysterious fire ravages the stables. Then, Neferet makes a devastating move that will test them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the seeds of distrust sown and Darkness breeding chaos at the House of Night, everyone must band together - but that's proving to be more difficult than ever before. The twins are barely speaking and the House of Night's former enemy, Kalona, has now become their warrior, pushing their trust to the limit. To top it off, Zoey is pretty darn sure she might be losing her mind. She saw something when she looked at Aurox through the Seer Stone that she can hardly explain to herself, let alone her friends. Is it possible that Heath has come back in a different form? Is that why Zoey's so intrigued by Aurox, when it's so obvious that he's dangerous? And who would believe her if she told them? Zoey knows that following her instinct about Aurox might be just what they need to defeat evil . . . but if she's wrong, it could cause the destruction of those closest to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the tension at a breaking point and friendships on the line, can the nerd herd come together to stop the spread of Darkness before it's too late?</description>

  <description>You remember Hannibal Lecter: gentleman. genius. cannibal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven years have passed since Dr. Lecter escaped from custody. And for seven years he's been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter's sanctuary, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman. and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun. All of them, in their separate ways, want to find Dr. Lecter. And all three will get their wish. But only one will live long enough to savor the reward...</description>

  <description>Herculine is only six-years-old when she watches her mother die horribly and inexplicably. A child alone in the nineteenth-century French countryside, she makes her way to the secluded convent, where she is taken in as a foundling orphan and raised by nuns who teach the children of the privileged to fear a wrathful God. But shy, unworldly Herculine is not like the others in this cold, forebidding place. And when she is led down a dark path by a rebellious fellow student, she soon finds herself convicted of crimes unimaginable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But death at the hands of the ignorant and falsely pious is not to be Herculine's lot. Held captive in the convent library, she is visited by four unexpected saviors with timeless needs of their own: the incubus priest Father Louis; the tragic, damned beauty Madeleine; the demonic Asmodei; and Sebastiana d'Azur, a witch. By dawn, Herculine is free yet forever changed as she follows her liberators into a world of sensuous pleasures and great mysteries both wondrous and strange.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secreted away in Sebastiana's once-grand manor high above the Breton sands, Herculine sets out to find out why she has been "chosen" and for what purpose. Her quest - ripe with erotic discovery, dark magic, heresy, and blood - propels her headlong through the perils of the age, across borders between the living and the dead, and back through a time when hysteria and madness reigned, when noble heads were impaled and paraded through the streets of Paris. For only when her mysterious mission is completed - and the terrible, otherworldly roots of a gruesome Revolution are finally revealed - can she understand who and what she truly is. Until then, she must simply trust...and learn.</description>

Creed's suspicion about the fire that killed Addie's family puts him on a collision course with crime boss Joe DeMeo, in what soon becomes an issue of kill or be killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DeMeo, a relentless killer who will stop at nothing to protect his empire, targets Creed and his loved ones for death. But Creed has plans of his own. Employing a bizarre cast of characters including a giant, a rival crime lord, an angry midget bent on world conquest, and a team of circus clowns, Creed goes on the attack, with hilarious results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lethal People&lt;/em&gt; is a bizarre, breezy and exciting thriller with excellent pacing, snappy dialogue and quirky characters who will keep you chuckling late into the night.</description>

  <description>When Stark fixes a problem, a lot of other things get broken. Now he's assigned to finding a missing VIP. But there's something about this job that makes Stark wary. It can't be just an ordinary kidnapping. It seems too easy. And unfortunately, he's right. The author's other books, "One of Us" and "Spares", are headed for the big screen.</description>

  <description>Pick your poison: Vampires, devils, werewolves, faeries, or . . . ? Find them all here in Holly Black’s amazing first collection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her debut collection, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling author Holly Black returns to the world of Tithe in two darkly exquisite new tales. Then Black takes readers on a tour of a faerie market and introduces a girl poisonous to the touch and another who challenges the devil to a competitive eating match. Some of these stories have been published in anthologies such as &lt;em&gt;21 Proms, The Faery Reel,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Restless Dead&lt;/em&gt;, and many have been reprinted in many �Best of ” anthologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poison Eaters&lt;/em&gt; is Holly Black’s much-anticipated first collection, and her ability to stare into the void—and to find humanity and humor there—will speak to young adult and adult readers alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Junior Library Guild Pick. Illustrated by Theo Black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holly Black is the author of &lt;em&gt;Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale&lt;/em&gt; (an ALA Best Book for Young Adults) and two related novels, &lt;em&gt;Valiant&lt;/em&gt; (Norton Award winner) and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Ironside&lt;/em&gt;. Her latest novel, &lt;em&gt;Black Heart&lt;/em&gt; is the third of a new series, The Curseworkers. She and Tony DiTerlizzi created the best-selling Spiderwick Chronicles. Holly lives in Massachusetts with her husband, Theo, in a house with a secret library.</description>

  <description>One of the most famous and enigmatic Americans of the twentieth century, Howard Hughes challenged Hollywood's conventions and packed theaters with his blockbuster films Hell's Angels, Scarface and The Outlaw. He thrilled the world with his aviation exploits, shattering air speed records, flying around the world in record time and building the world's largest aircraft. Hughes was linked with almost every major film beauty of the 1930s and '40s, making him a favorite subject of the nation's gossip columns. One of the world's first billionaires, Hughes transformed his father's small fortune into a vast business empire.But for all his celebrated achievements, Hughes' later years in Las Vegas - when drug addiction, bizarre behavior and a casino buying spree dominated his days - continue to draw the public's fascination. Geoff Schumacher, a veteran journalist and the author of Sun, Sin &amp;amp; Suburbia: An Essential History of Modern Las Vegas, delves into the Las Vegas years of Howard Hughes in this engrossing portrait of a man whose impact on the city is still being felt today.</description>

  <description>In the new mega-anthology from best-selling editor Russ Kick, more than fifty writers, reporters, and researchers invade the inner sanctum for an unrestrained look at the wild and wooly world of organized belief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dawkins&lt;/strong&gt; shows us the strange, scary properties of religion; &lt;strong&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/strong&gt; turns a biblical atrocity story into a comic (that almost sent a publisher to prison); &lt;strong&gt;Erik Davis&lt;/strong&gt; looks at what happens when religion and California collide; &lt;strong&gt;Mike Dash&lt;/strong&gt; eyes stigmatics; &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Rushkoff&lt;/strong&gt; exposes the trouble with Judaism; &lt;strong&gt;Paul Krassner&lt;/strong&gt; reveals his “Confessions of an Atheist”; and best-selling lexicographer &lt;strong&gt;Jonathon Green&lt;/strong&gt; interprets the language of religious prejudice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the dozens of other articles and essays, you’ll find: a sweeping look at classical composers and Great American Songbook writers who were unbelievers, such as &lt;strong&gt;Irving Berlin&lt;/strong&gt;, creator of “God Bless America”; the definitive explanation of why America is not a Christian nation; the bizarre, Catholic-fundamentalist books by Mel Gibson’s father; eye-popping photos of bizarre religious objects and ceremonies, including snake-handlers and pot-smoking children; the thinly veiled anti-Semitism in the &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; novels; an extract from the rare, suppressed book &lt;em&gt;The Sex Life of Brigham Young&lt;/em&gt;; and rarely seen anti-religious writings from &lt;strong&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;H.G. Wells&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further topics include exorcisms, religious curses, Wicca, the Church of John Coltrane, crimes by clergy, death without God, Christian sex manuals, the “ex-gay” movement, failed prophecies, bizarre theology, religious bowling, atheist rock and roll, “how to be a good Christian,” an entertaining look at the best (and worst) books on religion, and much more.</description>

  <description>Young Tessa is a diminutive girl, far too small for farm work and the object of ridicule by both her own family and the other children in their isolated Midwestern community. Her father seems to believe in nothing beyond his crops, certainly not education for his misfit daughter. When a mysterious, entrancing librarian comes to town, full of fabulous stories, earthy wisdom and potions for the lovelorn, she takes Tessa under her wing, teaching her to read and to believe in herself—and a whole new magical world of possibilities opens up. But even as she blooms, Tessa’s father begins sexually abusing her. And her mentor carries a dark secret of her own that finally causes her to drown herself. Tessa runs off, following Mary’s footsteps, to join the circus as a trapeze artist, where she marries a loving man and finds a fulfilling life for herself amidst her new circus family. But she remains haunted by her past. And when a stranger from one of Mary’s fabulist tales shows up, Tessa risks everything to follow him to Rain Village, where she might finally discover her mentor’s tragic secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brilliantly evocative debut set in the early part of the 20th century, steeped in emotional turbulence and down-to-earth wisdom, where a young woman must reconcile the inner traumas from her past and learn to live in the present in order to avoid becoming prisoner to her future. Rain Village casts a fabulous spell, pulling us into a world of mystery and possibility where love, friendship and loyalty might either destroy or set one free.</description>

  <description>Malibu, California-home to rock-and-roll gods and movie stars, the beautiful, the rich . . . and vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powerful and charismatic, Raphael is a Vampire Lord, one of the few who hold the power of life and death over every vampire in existence. Thousands call him Master and have pledged absolute loyalty on their very lives. But when, in a brazen and deadly daylight attack, a gang of human killers kidnaps the one female vampire he'd give his life for, Raphael turns to a human investigator to find his enemies before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cynthia Leighton is smart, tough and sexy, a private investigator and former cop who's tired of spying on cheating spouses and digging out old bank accounts. When Raphael asks for her help in tracking down the kidnappers, Cyn's happy to accept. But she soon realizes her greatest danger comes not from the humans, but from Raphael himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Battling Russian mobsters and treacherous vampires, and betrayed by those they trusted, Cyn and Raphael find themselves fighting for their lives while caught up in a passion of blood and violence that is destined to destroy them both.</description>

  <description>Under the bubbling hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone National Park is a supervolcano. Most people don't know it's there. The caldera is so large that it can only be seen from a plane or satellite. It just could be overdue for an eruption, which would change the landscape and climate of our planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Alex, being left alone for the weekend means having the freedom to play computer games and hang out with his friends without hassle from his mother. Then the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, plunging his hometown into a nightmare of darkness, ash, and violence. Alex begins a harrowing trek to seach for his family and finds help in Darla, a travel partner he meets along the way. Together they must find the strength and skills to survive and outlast an epic disaster.</description>

  <description>Dexter Morgan: Police forensic analyst. Family man. Serial killer. And the star of Showtime’s most-watched series, Dexter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aimed at Dexter devotees and armchair psychologists, The Psychology of Dexter takes on the psychological complexities of the popular series with an eye towards insight and accessibility. It analyzes not just the title character, but his family, coworkers, and even his viewers. What makes Dexter tick? And what makes a show about a serial killer so appealing to those of us at home?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the implications of faking normalcy (could it be behind Dexter’s still-in-progress emotional growth?) to where the show weighs in on the psychological debate between nature and nurture, The Psychology of Dexter gives fans a peek inside Dexter’s�and Dexter’s�psyche.</description>

  <description>While attempting to escape the agonizing memories she associates with Christmas, twenty-nine-year-old widow Megan Snow builds a snow family outside the mountain cabin she once shared with her husband-and collapses in tears against the snowman at the sight of what she'll never have.Called to life by the power of Megan's tears, snow god Owen Winters appears unconscious on her doorstep in the midst of a raging blizzard. As she nurses him to health, Owen finds unexpected solace in her company and unimagined pleasure in the warmth of her body, and vows to win her heart for a chance at humanity.Megan is drawn to Owen's mismatched eyes, otherworldly masculinity, and enthusiasm for the littlest things, and her heart opens enough to believe he's a Christmas miracle. But this miracle comes with an expiration-before the snow melts and the temperature rises, Megan must let go of her widow's grief and learn to trust love again, or she'll lose Owen forever.</description>

  <description>Henri Charrière, called "Papillon," for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 of a murder he did not commit. Sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of French Guiana, he became obsessed with one goal: "escape." After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charrière's astonishing autobiography, "Papillon," was published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape. Since then, it has become a treasured classic -- the gripping, shocking, ultimately uplifting odyssey of an innocent man who would not be defeated.</description>

  <description>Some of the cruelest deeds of Japan's war in Asia did not occur on the battlefield, but in quiet, antiseptic medical wards in obscure parts of the continent. Far from front lines and prying eyes, Japanese doctors and their assistants subjected human guinea pigs to gruesome medical experiments. In the first part of Unit 731: Testimony, author Hal Gold draws upon a painstakingly accumulated reservoir of sources to construct a portrait of the Imperial Japanese Army's most notorious medical unit, giving an overview of its history and detailing its most shocking activities. The second half of the book consists almost entirely of the words of former unit members themselves, taken from remarks they made at a traveling Unit 731 exhibition held around Japan in 1994-95. These people recount their vivid firsthand memories of what it was like to cut open pregnant women as they lay awake on the vivisection table, inject plague germs into healthy farmers, and carry buckets of fresh blood and organs through corridors to their appropriate destinations. Unit 731: Testimony represents an essential addition to the growing body of literature on the still-unfolding story of one of the most infamous military outfits in modern history. By showing how the ethics of "normal" men and women, and even an entire profession, can be warped by the fire of war, this important book offers a window on a time of human madness, in the hope that such days will never come again.</description>

  <description>Вторая изданная "Софией" книга Коэльо - совсем иная, чем знаменитый "Алхимик". О чем же она? Просто о жизни, о смерти, о любви. Да еще о безумии - о "Горечи", которой поражены мы все, и о том Безумии, избавляться от которого нельзя ни в коем случае... "Вероника решает умереть" - прекрасная и ободряющая, придающая силу книга, блестяще проработанная и полная иронических метафор. Это реалистическая история о жажде жизни перед лицом смерти, призывающая воспринимать каждый день как чудо.</description>

  <description>In a spectacular feat of daring and magic, Elena and her army of outlaws and rebels have defeated evil's minions and released the mystic secrets of the Blood Diary. But the malevolent Dark Lord has unleashed the Weirgates—black wells of ferocious energy that are his greatest source of power. Now Elena's bravest allies are sent to find and destroy the Gates, as windships carry the fight north to the frigid woodlands, south to the burning desert sands, and east to the blasted regions of dread Gul'gotha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, they will face their own personal demons as well. The twin brothers Mogweed and Fardale race against time to break the curse that has stolen their shape-changing birthright, and Elena's brother Joach must evade the desert sandsharks if he is to master his own elemental power. The trail will lead them even to the fabulous el'vin homeland of Stormhaven. None of the rebels will come back unscathed, some never returning at all...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Elena herself must journey to Gul'gotha. Daring the enemy's own lair, she must emerge victorious if she is to reveal the secret of the Dark Lord's frightening identity—and the shocking nature of his vast powers.</description>

  <description>I am Meredith Gentry, princess and heir apparent to the throne in the realm of faerie, onetime private investigator in the mortal world. To be crowned queen, I must first continue the royal bloodline and give birth to an heir of my own. If I fail, my aunt, Queen Andais, will be free to do what she most desires: install her twisted son, Cel, as monarch?and kill me. My royal guards surround me, and my best loved - my Darkness and my Killing Frost - are always beside me, sworn to protect and make love to me. But still the threat grows greater. For despite all my carnal efforts I remain childless, while the machinations of my sinister, sadistic Queen and her confederates remain tireless. So my bodyguards and I have slipped back into Los Angeles, hoping to outrun the gathering shadows of court intrigue. But even exile isn't enough to escape the grasp of those with dark designs. Now King Taranis, powerful and vain-glorious ruler of faerie's Seelie Court, has leveled accusations against my noble guards of a heinous crime - and has gone so far as to ask the mortal authorities to prosecute. If he succeeds, my men face extradition to faerie and the hideous penalties that await them there. But I know that Taranis's charges are baseless, and I sense that his true target is me. He tried to kill me when I was a child. Now I fear his intentions are far more terrifying.</description>

D. James's electric debut novel, an ingeniously plotted mystery that immediately placed her among the masters of suspense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A visionary analysis of how the politics of fear, secrecy, cronyism, and blind faith has combined with the degration of the public sphere to create an environment dangerously hostile to reason&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At the time George W. Bush ordered American forces to invade Iraq, 70 percent of Americans believed Saddam Hussein was linked to 9/11. Voters in Ohio, when asked by pollsters to list what stuck in their minds about the campaign, most frequently named two Bush television ads that played to fears of terrorism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We live in an age when the thirty-second television spot is the most powerful force shaping the electorate's thinking, and America is in the hands of an administration less interested than any previous administration in sharing the truth with the citizenry. Related to this and of even greater concern is this administration's disinterest in the process by which the truth is ascertained, the tenets of fact-based reasoning-first among them an embrace of open inquiry in which unexpected and even inconvenient facts can lead to unexpected conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; How did we get here? How much damage has been done to the functioning of our democracy and its role as steward of our security? Never has there been a worse time for us to lose the capacity to face the reality of our long-term challenges, from national security to the economy, from issues of health and social welfare to the environment. As &lt;em&gt;The Assault on Reason&lt;/em&gt; shows us, we have precious little time to waste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gore's larger goal in this book is to explain how the public sphere itself has evolved into a place hospitable to reason's enemies, to make us more aware of the forces at work on our own minds, and to lead us to an understanding of what we can do, individually and collectively, to restore the rule of reason and safeguard our future. Drawing on a life's work in politics as well as on the work of experts across a broad range of disciplines, Al Gore has written a farsighted and powerful manifesto for clear thinking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Nicholas Flamel was born in Paris on 28 September 1330. Nearly seven hundred years later, he is acknowledged as the greatest Alchemyst of his day. It is said that he discovered the secret of eternal life. The records show that he died in 1418. But his tomb is empty and Nicholas Flamel lives. The secret of eternal life is hidden within the book he protects - the Book of Abraham the Mage. It's the most powerful book that has ever existed. In the wrong hands, it will destroy the world. And that's exactly what Dr. John Dee plans to do when he steals it. Humankind won't know what's happening until it's too late. And if the prophecy is right, Sophie and Josh Newman are the only ones with the power to save the world as we know it. Sometimes legends are true. And Sophie and Josh Newman are about to find themselves in the middle of the greatest legend of all time.</description>

  <description>From one of America's best-loved storytellers - the author of the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller WHERE THE HEART IS - comes a tale of a small Oklahoma town and the mystery that has haunted its residents for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1972, windswept DeClare, Oklahoma, was consumed by the murder of a young mother, Gaylene Harjo, and the disappearance of her baby, Nicky Jack. When the child's pajama bottoms were discovered on the banks of Willow Creek, everyone feared that he, too, had been killed, although his body was never found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly thirty years later, Nicky Jack mysteriously returns to DeClare, shocking the town and stirring up long-buried memories. But what he discovers about the night he vanished is more astonishing than he or anyone could have imagine. Piece by piece, what emerges is a story of dashed hopes, desperate love, and a secret that still cries out for justice...and redemption.</description>

  <description>Love hurts...if you're lucky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaden knows he's dying, but before he goes, he has one problem he needs to solve - he must ask his oldest friend Seth to take over as his beloved wife's Dom and Master after his death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth has always seen himself as the perpetual screw-up and Kaden as the strong and steady one, so his friend's request rocks his world. Now Seth finds himself immersed in a role he's far from comfortable with: inflicting pain to provide emotional comfort for the woman he's secretly loved for years. Can he deal with his crushing grief and learn the skills he must master in time to become THE RELUCTANT DOM?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: m/f/m menage, anal sex/play/toys, BDSM, bondage, D/s relationship, and the lesser-known "normality" of the world of BDSM.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural fantasy has a new antihero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life sucks, and then you die. Or, if you're James Stark, you spend eleven years in Hell as a hitman before finally escaping, only to land back in the hell-on-earth that is Los Angeles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Stark's back, and ready for revenge. And absolution, and maybe even love. But when his first stop saddles him with an abusive talking head, Stark discovers that the road to absolution and revenge is much longer than you'd expect, and both Heaven and Hell have their own ideas for his future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resurrection sucks. Saving the world is worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkly twisted, irreverent, and completely hilarious, &lt;em&gt;Sandman Slim&lt;/em&gt; is the breakthrough novel by an acclaimed author.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The book that inspired the major new motion picture &lt;em&gt;Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa's antiapartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is his moving and exhilarating autobiography, destined to take its place among the finest memoirs of history's greatest figures. Here for the first time, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela tells the extraordinary story of his life--an epic of struggle, setback, renewed hope, and ultimate triumph.</description>

  <description>An international sensation that "The Wall Street Journal" called a "publishing phenomenon," this layered, poignant, and chilling novel of psychological suspense is the year's most stunning American fiction debut. From its wrenching opening to its shocking climax, Beautiful Malice unfolds a haunting story in which people, motives, and circumstances are never what they seem. &lt;br&gt;Who is Katherine Patterson? It is a question she hopes no one can answer. To erase her past, Katherine has moved to a new city, enrolled in a new school, and even changed her name. She's done the next best thing to disappearing altogether. Now, wary and alone, she seeks nothing more than anonymity. What she finds instead is the last thing she expected: a friend. &lt;br&gt;Even more unlikely, Katherine's new friend is the most popular and magnetic girl in school. Extroverted, gorgeous, flirtatious, and unpredictable, she is everything that Katherine is not and doesn't want to be: the center of attention. Yet Alice's enthusiasm is infectious, her candor sometimes unsettling, and Katherine, in spite of her guarded caution, finds herself drawn into Alice's private circle. &lt;br&gt;But Alice has secrets, too--darker than anyone can begin to imagine. And when she lets her guard down at last, Katherine discovers the darkest of them all. For there will be no escaping the past for Katherine Patterson--only a descent into a trap far more sinister . . . and infinitely more seductive. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>After Kari breaks up with her date during Beginner's Night at Club Shadowlands, she's given the option to continue with an experienced dominant. Despite her steamy fantasies about BDSM, the inexperienced schoolteacher plans to simply observe. Yet under the unyielding hands of Master Dan, she not only participates, but gives him everything he asks for. There is nothing she can hide from him. Not her passion…or her love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still mourning the death of his wife, Master Dan avoids getting involved with women and he never takes a sub twice. But this modest little beginner is such a sweetie, one night is far from enough. As he plumbs her responses, taking her ever deeper into the world of BDSM, the gentle submissive begins to show him how barren his life has become and what a dark citadel he's made of his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During their three nights together, the teacher will learn to submit...can she teach the master to love?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>What goes on in the mind of a serial killer? How does he attract his victims? How far will he go to avoid capture or, once in custody, to escape and kill again? And how could a vicious and sadistic murderer claim the lives of at least eight young women before the authorities even realized that a monster was on the prowl?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killer, you'll discover startling answers to all of these questions and many more. Drawn from more than 150 hours of exclusive tape-recorded interviews with the seemingly clean-cut, all-American boy whose grisly killing spree left at least thirty young women dead, this chilling expose provides a shocking self-portrait of one of the most savage sex killers in history. Speaking eerily in the third person, Bundy reveals appalling details about his crimes, explains the methods he used to disguise his acts, and recounts his two daring jailbreaks in detail. Bundy also offers his thoughts on John Wayne Gacy, Son of Sam, and other serial killers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ted Bundy: Conversations with a Killer is, quite simply, a horrifying glimpse into the brilliant, manipulative, and savage mind of, in his own words, "the most cold-blooded son-of-a-bitch you'll ever meet."</description>

  <description>My name is Elizabeth Anne Hawksmith, and my age is three hundred and eighty-four years. Each new settlement asks for a new journal, and so this Book of Shadows begins…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the spring of 1628, the Witchfinder of Wessex finds himself a true Witch. As Bess Hawksmith watches her mother swing from the Hanging Tree she knows that only one man can save her from the same fate at the hands of the panicked mob: the Warlock Gideon Masters, and his Book of Shadows. Secluded at his cottage in the woods, Gideon instructs Bess in the Craft, awakening formidable powers she didn’t know she had and making her immortal. She couldn't have foreseen that even now, centuries later, he would be hunting her across time, determined to claim payment for saving her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In present-day England, Elizabeth has built a quiet life for herself, tending her garden and selling herbs and oils at the local farmers' market. But her solitude abruptly ends when a teenage girl called Tegan starts hanging around. Against her better judgment, Elizabeth begins teaching Tegan the ways of the Hedge Witch, in the process awakening memories--and demons—long thought forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part historical romance, part modern fantasy, &lt;em&gt;The Witch’s Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh, compelling take on the magical, yet dangerous world of Witches.Readers will long remember the fiercely independent heroine who survives plagues, wars, and the heartbreak that comes with immortality to remain true to herself, and protect the protégé she comes to love.</description>

  <description>Twenty years ago, one man's murderous rampage destroyed his own family . . . and devastated a community. Now the only survivor[ his daughter[ tells her story at last. On April 14, 1989, for reasons still debated today, Mexican immigrant Ramn Salcido went on a violent rampage in the idyllic Sonoma Valley wine country where he lived and worked. In the course of just two hours, he killed his wife, Angela, her two younger sisters, his mother-in-law, and the man with whom he suspected Angela was having an affair. He then slashed the throats of his three young daughters[ four-year-old Sophia, three-year-old Carmina, and twenty-two-month-old Teresa[ leaving them for dead in the county dump. A little more than a day later, the bodies of his daughters were discovered. Miraculously, tiny Carmina was still alive and able to tell her rescuers, ""My daddy cut me."" In Not Lost Forever, Carmina Salcido explores the events surrounding these headline-making murders with extraordinary clarity and composure. Reaching back to understand the events that traumatized her in childhood[ and weaving them together with the recollections of detectives and witnesses[ she reconstructs the story of her father's crimes, and their aftermath, in sobering detail. Yet Carmina's story doesn't end there. Those who remember her as the tiny victim of these murders will also be shocked by what followed: how she was adopted by a Catholic extremist family who tried to change her name and bury her past; how she tried to escape their sheltering influence by joining a Carmelite convent and then a ranch for troubled girls; and how the psychological trials she endured along the way nearly broke her spirit[ until, at last, she found peace by turning to the one relative still alive to share her grief: her grandfather. As a young woman, Carmina returned to California to share her experiences and discover the family that was brutally taken from her. The devout Catholic also returned to look into her father's eyes on death row and confront the man who took away her entire family. With clear-eyed candor, courage, and grace, this brave young woman takes readers along on her miraculous journey of survival, discovery, and hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Thomas has led his life according to the tenets of chivalry laid out by King Arthur. Now his deepest desires and his unshakable honor have joined in single purpose. His soul mate, Lilith, whom he has met only in dreams, is bespelled by a wizard. For five years she has been forced to exist as Lord Zorac’s prisoner in a state of high arousal, unable to gain fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To free her from her torment, Thomas must perform the sensual Rite of Awakening and convince Lilith to accept his word and hand as that of her true Master. But Lilith’s punishment is more than the capricious act of an evil wizard, and all is not as it seems…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:  Originally published in the 2003 anthology,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16406879-enchained"&gt;Enchained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The books in the How to Draw series are especially designed for artists of all levels, beginner to advanced, who are looking to hone their skills in a specific style of artwork. The books are 6.5in x 8in, hardcover with an internal spiral binding so they lay open flat as readers follow the steps on their own canvas or paper. The books are beautifully illustrated and contain hundreds of colorful pieces of artwork, photographs, and helpful diagrams. Step-by-step instructions help guide artists through the learning process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tattoos have been in existence for as long as man has been drawing images. The desire to display permanent drawn markings on our bodies goes back to prehistoric times, and in modern times tattoo art is one of the fastest-growing and most popular forms of art. Designing tattoo art is a challenging discipline—the artist is working with a two-dimensional design which will be applied to a three-dimensional body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A great tattoo starts with a great tattoo drawing, and How to Draw Tattoo-Style can help you perfect your artwork, and will inform you of the fascinating history of this style of artistic self-expression.</description>

  <description>Dying is what changed Mary O’Reilly’s life. Well, actually, coming back from the dead and having the ability to communicate with ghosts is really what did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, a private investigator in rural Freeport, Illinois, Mary’s trying to learn how to incorporate her experience as a Chicago cop and new-found talent into a real job. Her challenge is to solve the mysteries, get real evidence (a ghost’s word just doesn’t hold up in court), and be sure the folks in town, especially the handsome new police chief, doesn’t think she’s nuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-four years ago, a young woman drowned in the swimming pool of a newly elected State Senator. It was ruled an accident. But now, as the Senator prepares to move on to higher positions, the ghost of the woman is appearing to the Senator’s wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary is hired to discover the truth behind the death. She unearths a connection between the murder and the disappearance of five little girls whose cases, twenty-four years later, are still all unsolved. As she digs further she becomes the next target for serial killers’ quest to tie up all his loose ends.</description>

  <description>The acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Sweet Hereafter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rule of the Bone&lt;/em&gt; returns with a provocative new novel that illuminates the shadowed edges of contemporary American culture with startling and unforgettable results&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suspended in a strangely modern-day version of limbo, the young man at the center of Russell Banks’s uncompromising and morally complex new novel must create a life for himself in the wake of incarceration. Known in his new identity only as the Kid, and on probation after doing time for a liaison with an underage girl, he is shackled to a GPS monitoring device and forbidden to live within 2,500 feet of anywhere children might gather. With nowhere else to go, the Kid takes up residence under a south Florida causeway, in a makeshift encampment with other convicted sex offenders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barely beyond childhood himself, the Kid, despite his crime, is in many ways an innocent, trapped by impulses and foolish choices he himself struggles to comprehend. Enter the Professor, a man who has built his own life on secrets and lies. A university sociologist of enormous size and intellect, he finds in the Kid the perfect subject for his research on homelessness and recidivism among convicted sex offenders. The two men forge a tentative partnership, the Kid remaining wary of the Professor’s motives even as he accepts the counsel and financial assistance of the older man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the camp beneath the causeway is raided by the police, and later, when a hurricane all but destroys the settlement, the Professor tries to help the Kid in practical matters while trying to teach his young charge new ways of looking at, and understanding, what he has done. But when the Professor’s past resurfaces and threatens to destroy his carefully constructed world, the balance in the two men’s relationship shifts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, the Kid must reconsider everything he has come to believe, and choose what course of action to take when faced with a new kind of moral decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long one of our most acute and insightful novelists, Russell Banks often examines the indistinct boundaries between our intentions and actions. A mature and masterful work of contemporary fiction from one of our most accomplished storytellers, &lt;em&gt;Lost Memory of Skin&lt;/em&gt; unfolds in language both powerful and beautifully lyrical, show-casing Banks at his most compelling, his reckless sense of humor and intense empathy at full bore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The perfect convergence of writer and subject, &lt;em&gt;Lost Memory of Skin&lt;/em&gt; probes the zeitgeist of a troubled society where zero tolerance has erased any hope of subtlety and compassion—a society where isolating the offender has perhaps created a new kind of victim.</description>

  <description>Twelve-year-old September lives in Omaha, and used to have an ordinary life, until her father went to war and her mother went to work. One day, September is met at her kitchen window by a Green Wind (taking the form of a gentleman in a green jacket), who invites her on an adventure, implying that her help is needed in Fairyland. The new Marquess is unpredictable and fickle, and also not much older than September. Only September can retrieve a talisman the Marquess wants from the enchanted woods, and if she doesn’t . . . then the Marquess will make life impossible for the inhabitants of Fairyland. September is already making new friends, including a book-loving Wyvern and a mysterious boy named Saturday. &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With exquisite illustrations by acclaimed artist Ana Juan, &lt;em&gt;Fairyland &lt;/em&gt;lives up to the sensation it created when the author first posted it online. For readers of all ages who love the charm of &lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt; and the soul of &lt;em&gt;The Golden Compass&lt;/em&gt;, here is a reading experience unto itself: unforgettable, and so very beautiful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>The Georgia Guidestones are a collection of standing stones near Elberton, Georgia. Built in 1980, they are primarily composed of six slabs of granite: one central pillar, four "major" stones that fan out from the center, and a capstone. The capstone has engravings on all four of its sides in four different ancient languages, all of which read, "Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason," when translated. The major stones are each engraved on both sides, and each side contains text in one of eight modern languages asserting the same ten guidelines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those guidelines have proven extremely controversial, causing speculation and rumors of conspiracy that go far beyond northeast Georgia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conspiracy theorists surmise a global plot on the part of a group of shadowy men to subjugate and oppress the world's population and create a "new world order." Others believe that the man behind the monument was a Rosicrucian, and that the stones are representative of that group's magical manifesto. Some people even believe that it is a landing site for an alien spacecraft of some kind. At the heart of this confusion is the missing piece of the puzzle: who was the mystery man who started the entire chain of events?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georgia native &lt;strong&gt;Raymond Wiley&lt;/strong&gt; was interviewed for The History Channel's &lt;em&gt;Brad Meltzer's Decoded&lt;/em&gt; program about the Guidestones and is a principal expert for a feature length documentary currently in production. With local writer &lt;strong&gt;KT Prime&lt;/strong&gt; he has written the definitive account of America's most famous megalithic monument.</description>

  <description>"The Journal of James Halldon".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a place where nightmares are real. It is a dark and terrifying place, hidden from the world we know by borders that &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;only the most unfortunate of souls will ever cross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James Halldon woke up in the dark, alone, without any food or water, without a clue where he was, and with no memory of &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;where he came from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It only got stranger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James has somehow found his way to The Corridor, a midnight place that no human should ever see and the prison of a creature &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that has destroyed entire worlds. Somehow James has to learn to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he is not alone. The lost souls of others who have drifted into The Corridor, and died, also haunt this world, and they &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;have been waiting a long time for someone to come along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Journal of James Halldon is a dark sci-fi novel that follows Halldon's struggle to survive whilst trying to understand &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;the strange, dark, and terrifying world in which he is trapped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it's dark when you wake up, and you can hear growling, then close your eyes and maybe it will go away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But maybe it won't...</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1991 I was a normal kid. I did normal things. I had friends and a mother who loved me. I was just like you. Until the day my life was stolen. &lt;br&gt;For eighteen years I was a prisoner. I was an object for someone to use and abuse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For eighteen years I was not allowed to speak my own name. I became a mother and was forced to be a sister. For eighteen years I survived an impossible situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On August 26, 2009, I took my name back. My name is Jaycee Lee Dugard. I don’t think of myself as a victim. I survived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Stolen Life is my story—in my own words, in my own way, exactly as I remember it.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;#8220;When you add us up, you always have to carry the one.&amp;amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following a devastating moment in the hours after Carmen&amp;amp;#8217;s wedding, three siblings and their friends move through the next twenty-five years under its long shadow. Through friendships and love affairs; marriage and divorce; parenthood, holidays, and the modest calamities and triumphs of ordinary days, &lt;em&gt;Carry the One &lt;/em&gt;shows how one life affects another, and how those who thrive and those who self-destruct are closer to each other than we&amp;amp;#8217;d expect. Whether they take refuge in art, drugs, social justice, or love, Carol Anshaw&amp;amp;#8217;s characters are sympathetic, funny, and uncannily familiar as they reflect back to us our deepest pain and longings, our joys, and our transcendent moments of understanding.</description>

  <description>HOUDINI HEART harkens back to the masters of suspenseful supernatural horror: Poe, Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson, but speaks with a wholly fresh voice. Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called home: a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets. Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note? But life is never as you dream it, and River House isn't what she'd always imagined it was. Intense, literary, and harrowing, Houdini Heart is a tale of bone-chilling horror, emotional torment, and psychological terror. Gripped by River House, trapped in an aging hotel of mirrors only Houdini could escape, how much can haunt a mind before it too is only a thing once imagined? "A haunting and disturbing journey through the psyche."-Erika Mailman, Author of "The Witch's Trinity"</description>

  <description>Katherine Howe, author of the phenomenal &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane&lt;/em&gt;, returns with an entrancing historical novel set in Boston in 1915, where a young woman stands on the cusp of a new century, torn between loss and love, driven to seek answers in the depths of a crystal ball.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still reeling from the deaths of her mother and sister on the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;, Sibyl Allston is living a life of quiet desperation with her taciturn father and scandal-plagued brother in an elegant town house in Boston’s Back Bay. Trapped in a world over which she has no control, Sibyl flees for solace to the parlor of a table-turning medium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when her brother is suddenly kicked out of Harvard under mysterious circumstances and falls under the sway of a strange young woman, Sibyl turns for help to psychology professor Benton Derby, despite the unspoken tensions of their shared past. As Benton and Sibyl work together to solve a harrowing mystery, their long-simmering spark flares to life, and they realize that there may be something even more magical between them than a medium’s scrying glass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the opium dens of Boston’s Chinatown to the opulent salons of high society, from the back alleys of colonial Shanghai to the decks of the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The House of Velvet and Glass&lt;/em&gt; weaves together meticulous period detail, intoxicating romance, and a final shocking twist that will leave readers breathless.</description>

  <description>Harold Fry is convinced that he must deliver a letter to an old friend in order to save her, meeting various characters along the way and reminiscing about the events of his past and people he has known, as he tries to find peace and acceptance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently retired, sweet, emotionally numb Harold Fry is jolted out of his passivity by a letter from Queenie Hennessy, an old friend, who he hasn't heard from in twenty years. She has written to say she is in hospice and wanted to say goodbye. Leaving his tense, bitter wife Maureen to her chores, Harold intends a quick walk to the corner mailbox to post his reply but instead, inspired by a chance encounter, he becomes convinced he must deliver his message in person to Queenie--who is 600 miles away--because as long as he keeps walking, Harold believes that Queenie will not die. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So without hiking boots, rain gear, map or cell phone, one of the most endearing characters in current fiction begins his unlikely pilgrimage across the English countryside. Along the way, strangers stir up memories--flashbacks, often painful, from when his marriage was filled with promise and then not, of his inadequacy as a father, and of his shortcomings as a husband. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ironically, his wife Maureen, shocked by her husband's sudden absence, begins to long for his presence. Is it possible for Harold and Maureen to bridge the distance between them? And will Queenie be alive to see Harold arrive at her door?</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>Three Fates. Three Sisters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a will from her dead father decrees Chloe into the protection of the renowned vampire commander, Tyrian en Kulev, she does what any woman would do—and casts a spell. Things get worse for Chloe when the spell she and her sisters perform summons an ancient demon from deep within the earth. Now she's being hunted by a demon set on killing her and must live at the aptly named Castle Death with the king of cold, Tyrian. Surprisingly, Chloe finds that she doesn’t mind her new Protector so much. His cold, impassionate nature needs a firm push to show his true colors, and Chloe thinks she’s just the one to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyrian en Kulev always pays his debts. When Francis Bellum dies and orders Tyrian to act as his eldest daughter’s Protector, Tyrian resigns himself to the position. What should have been a simple deal--keep her in the castle, protect her--has turned difficult. Chloe comes to him with a demon trying to kill her and a sexy attitude that keeps invading his thoughts everywhere he goes. The little succubus easily grabs hold of the heart he’d kept locked away for so long and makes him feel once again. But can they defeat the demon that haunts her and can Tyrian overcome his past and move on to a new future with Chloe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chains of Frost is a full-length novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;FIVE INJURED CLIMBERS. TEN SEASONED RANGERS. ONE IMPOSSIBLE RESCUE.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the afternoon of July 26, 2003, six vacationing mountain climbers ascended the peak of the Grand Teton in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Rain and colliding air currents blew in, and soon a massive electrical charge began to build. As the group began to retreat from its location, a colossal lightning bolt struck and pounded through the body of every climber. One of the six died instantly, one lay critically injured next to her body, and four dangled perilously into the chasm below. In riveting, page-turning prose, veteran journalist Jennifer Woodlief tells the story of the climb, the arrival of the storm, and the unprecedented rescue by the Jenny Lake Rangers, one of the most experienced climbing search-and-rescue teams in the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against the dramatic landscape of the Teton Range, Woodlief brings to life the grueling task of the rangers, a band of colorful characters who tackle one of the riskiest, most physically demanding jobs in the world. By turns terrifying and exhilarating, &lt;em&gt;A Bolt from the Blue &lt;/em&gt;is both a testament to human courage and an astonishing journey into one of history’s most dangerous mountain rescues.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“There are only two reasons a non-seer would see a spirit on St. Mark’s Eve,” Neeve said. “Either you’re his true love . . . or you killed him.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is freezing in the churchyard, even before the dead arrive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year, Blue Sargent stands next to her clairvoyant mother as the soon-to-be dead walk past. Blue herself never sees them—not until this year, when a boy emerges from the dark and speaks directly to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Gansey, and Blue soon discovers that he is a rich student at Aglionby, the local private school. Blue has a policy of staying away from Aglionby boys. Known as Raven Boys, they can only mean trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Blue is drawn to Gansey, in a way she can’t entirely explain. He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die. She never thought this would be a problem. But now, as her life becomes caught up in the strange and sinister world of the Raven Boys, she’s not so sure anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Maggie Stiefvater, the bestselling and acclaimed author of the Shiver trilogy and The Scorpio Races, comes a spellbinding new series where the inevitability of death and the nature of love lead us to a place we’ve never been before.</description>

  <description>The new novel from the New York Times and internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Distant Hours&lt;/em&gt; is a spellbinding mix of mystery, thievery, murder, and enduring love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During a party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood tree house and is dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the road and sees her mother speak to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress, living in London. She returns to the family farm for Dorothy’s ninetieth birthday and finds herself overwhelmed by questions she has not thought about for decades. From pre-WWII England through the Blitz, to the fifties and beyond, discover the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds—Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy—who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Keeper&lt;/em&gt; explores longings and dreams, the lengths people go to fulfill them, and the consequences they can have. It is a story of lovers, friends, dreamers, and schemers told—in Morton’s signature style—against a backdrop of events that changed the world.</description>

  <description>THE &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/em&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness… &lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I’d never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gideon &lt;em&gt;knew. &lt;/em&gt;He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other’s most private wounds…and desires.The bonds of his love transformed me, even as i prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart...&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Truly, madly...deadly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A BDSM thriller&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Tom Hanson has a string of grotesquely mutilated bodies on his hands and no answers—aside from the fact that the victims were members of an underground sex club catering to singular erotic tastes. Tastes the long, lean detective has sampled himself in the arms of his former lover, a fiery redhead who offered the most erotic, irresistible sex he’d ever encountered. Until the night she’d begged for the one thing he couldn’t give, and he lost her forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gina Larsen is the only one who can guide Hanson through the fringe world of dark fantasy and desire that lies hidden deep beneath the Bible Belt. Lured into her lair by a quest for justice, Hanson discovers his hunger for Gina has only grown stronger and deeper…beyond the edge of control. Soon he’s shedding his last inhibitions in the search for answers, but the more she draws him into her erotic web, the less he can distinguish between passion and duty, pleasure and pain…good and evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;85,000 Words.</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Camryn Bennett had always been one to think out-of-the-box, who knew she wanted something more in life than following the same repetitive patterns and growing old with the same repetitive life story. And she thought that her life was going in the right direction until everything fell apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined not to dwell on the negative and push forward, Camryn is set to move in with her best friend and plans to start a new job. But after an unexpected night at the hottest club in downtown North Carolina, she makes the ultimate decision to leave the only life she’s ever known, far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a purse, a cell phone and a small bag with a few necessities, Camryn, with absolutely no direction or purpose boards a Greyhound bus alone and sets out to find herself. What she finds is a guy named Andrew Parrish, someone not so very different from her and who harbors his own dark secrets. But Camryn swore never to let down her walls again. And she vowed never to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with Andrew, Camryn finds herself doing a lot of things she never thought she’d do. He shows her what it’s really like to live out-of-the-box and to give in to her deepest, darkest desires. On their sporadic road-trip he becomes the center of her exciting and daring new life, pulling love and lust and emotion out of her in ways she never imagined possible. But will Andrew’s dark secret push them inseparably together, or tear them completely apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Due to sexual content and language, this book is recommended for 17+ – Adult Contemporary Women’s – New Adult Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling erotic enovella trilogy, a buttoned-up businesswoman takes her friend’s advice and has a fling with a stranger on a trip to Vegas—only to find herself under his mysterious, sexy power both in the boardroom and the bedroom. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kasie Fitzgerald knows who she’s supposed to be. She’s a rising-star-workaholic at a global consulting firm. She’s the fiancée of a well-connected man who’s won the approval of her parents. People know that she’s reliable, serious, proper, cautious, pragmatic, and yes, a little predictable. She’s who Dave and her family &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; her to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as her thirtieth birthday looms, buried feelings begin to resurrect. Her friend takes her to Vegas for one last wild and crazy night. In a dress much shorter and sexier than anything she has ever dared to wear before, she hits the blackjack tables. And meets &lt;em&gt;him.&lt;/em&gt; Under the tailored clothes it’s clear that this is a man who is intense, powerful, and maybe even a little dangerous. With a touch of trepidation she accepts his invitation to get a drink, and before long, she’s in his hotel room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She never gets his full name. Perhaps his anonymity is one of the reasons she’s able to give herself over to him and to the moment so completely&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps it’s why she’s just had the most exquisite and passionate sex of her life. Shaken by her own behavior, Kasie tries to chalk it up to one crazy night. But when the mysterious gentleman she’s just had a fling with shows up in her office—as the CEO of a firm her company does a billion dollars of business with a year, demanding that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; handle his account, and so much more—things will never be the same again. And there’s no telling where this will go…</description>

  <description>Available for the first time as an exclusive eBook in this original Outlander novella, Diana Gabaldon reveals what really happened to Roger MacKenzie Wakefield’s parents. Orphaned during World War II, Roger believed that his mother died during the London Blitz, and that his father, an RAF pilot, was killed in combat. But in An Echo in the Bone, Roger discovers that this may not be the whole story. Now, in “A Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows,” readers finally learn the truth.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;"A letter to my sub:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You trust me completely to know what you need. And I do know what you need. I know what to whisper in your ear to make you need me even more. I know how to touch, where to touch, when to touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can relax completely with me. You can feel everything possible with me. You can respond with total abandon with me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is what I most desire."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins an enticing letter from an anonymous Dominant to his new submissive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While graduate student Kate McDermott waits in a Manhattan cafe to meet the Dom who will help with her research on BDSM, she reads the letter again, telling herself her interest is strictly academic. If she's honest, Kate must admit it's more than that – it's a deeper need she can't deny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Drake Morgan, MD, neurosurgeon, bass player, philanthropist walks through the cafe door to talk to her about the lifestyle, Kate is mortified. The son of her father's oldest and best friend, Drake is far too desirable and too much a part of her social circle for comfort. If she decides to go through with this, can the carefully-worded agreement she draws up restrain their undeniable desire for each other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to resist his determined seduction, Kate begins an intense relationship with Drake that pushes all of her, and Drake's, boundaries. Highly erotic, The Agreement is a love story that will stay with you long after you finish reading.</description>

  <description>Be careful what you wish for…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You just might get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Gautier is tired of his destiny. He doesn’t want to be the son of a demon who’s fated to end the world. Nor does he want to see another demon or other preternatural creature who wants to kill or enslave him. He just wants to be normal and have normal problems like everyone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But normality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. When he gets sucked into an alternate reality where his mother has married his mentor and his Atlantean god best friend has become a human geek, he begins to understand that no life is free of pain, and that every person has a specific place in the universe… Even the son of a hated demon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of all, he sees that his powers aren’t the curse he thought they were, and that the world needs a champion, especially one its enemies can’t imagine rising up to defend the ones he should destroy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Old enemies and new friends square off for a major battle that will either restore Nick to his real world, or end him forever.</description>

  <description>Part of the Knights of the Board Room series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel gave up seeking a Master years ago. After a failed marriage and terrible tragedy, she’s walled her soul against going down that dangerous path again. Then Jon joins her yoga class. He’s thirteen years younger than she, but his Dominant nature threatens her shields from the moment she recognizes it. Not only does he understand what her body wants—he knows what her soul craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the five-man executive team of Kensington &amp;amp; Associates, Jon uses his calm, philosophical nature to defuse volatile acquisition negotiations. He can compel opponents to willingly surrender when he draws the sword that closes the deal. As a sexual Dominant, he employs that same expertise. A spiritually-driven Master who enjoys connecting with a woman’s soul, he wins her utter submission with his skills. But with Rachel, it goes beyond that. She’s the submissive his own soul has always hungered to have, and he won’t hesitate to use his talents, as well as that of the other four K&amp;amp;A men, to claim her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher’s Note: Rachel’s sensual journey to healing contains light female/female exploration and group sex.</description>

  <description>What if all you knew about fairy tales was wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book description of Ashes to Ashes and Cinder to Cinder: A Grimm Diaries Prequel as told by Alice Grimm:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Alice Grimm lives a dangerously enchanted life. Other than being distracted by a Dreamhunter called Loki Blackstar who has a heart of gold but acts like a jerk, she has a job to do. Being a descendant of the Brothers Grimm, she is one of few in the world who can locate the fairy tale characters and remind them of who they are. This time, Alice flies to Venice where an 800 hundred year old witch's skeleton surrounded with seventeen glass slippers was found by archeologists in the city that invented the art of glassblowing. When Alice and Loki follow the lead, they find one of the fairy tale characters she had been searching for. It's a famous girl character that you know by name, but never really knew what actually happened to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Grimm Diaries Prequels are a number of short books in the form of epistolary diary entries. The diaries are more of teasers for the upcoming series: The Grimm Diaries, allowing you to get a glimpse of what to expect of the series</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What if all you knew about fairy tales was wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen year old Loki Blackstar is no Prince Charming. His mother is a ghost. His only friend is a red Cadillac that sings to him through the radio. He looks like an Angel but acts like jerk. No wonder he has been banned from Heaven, which is the least of his troubles. Loki needs a job to pay for school and support himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, Loki has a rare gift: He is a Dreamhunter. One of the few in the world who can hunt and kill immortal demons in their dreams so they never wake up again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Loki is sent to kill a sixteen-year-old vampire girl the locals call Snow White Sorrow, he is pulled into a magical but dangerous world. The locals believe the monster to be Snow White.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The real Snow White...&lt;/strong&gt; living in the ruins of an ancient castle in a small town. She is described as horribly beautiful, terrifyingly enchanting, and wickedly lovely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he finds instead is a beautiful monster girl filled with rage and hurt, who has an epic untold story to tell of things such like why the Brothers Grimm altered the fairy tale, who the Evil Queen really is, where the mirror came from, and who possessed it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snow White has killed every person who has dared come near the castle where she once lived with the queen. Mysteriously, she lets Loki live, and whispers two words in his ears; two words that will change his life forever.</description>

  <description>200 years ago, the Brothers Grimm unleashed their stories upon the world. Literally. Now the characters of the Grimms’ stories walk among us. With every day that passes, they grow more evil. They are the Corrupted, and only a hero can stop them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 18-year-old Alice Goodenough, that means taking precious time off from her summer vacation. In addition to volunteering at the local library, Alice must stop the Corrupted who are now actively hunting her down. With the help of her magic pen and her trusty rabbit friend, the world has suddenly gotten a lot more complex. The Corrupted are everywhere, and only Alice can see them for what they truly are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book contains the first 3 episodes of the critically acclaimed series: Episode 1: Prince Charming Must Die!&lt;br&gt;Episode 2: Happily Never After&lt;br&gt;Episode 3: Revenge of the Castle Cats</description>

  <description>An investigative criminologist, Christopher Berry-Dee is a man who talks to serial killers. In this book, their pursuit of horror and violence is described in their own words, transcribed from audio and videotape interviews conducted deep inside some of the toughest prisons in the world. Berry-Dee describes the circumstances of his meetings with some of the world's most evil men, and reproduces their very words as they describe their crimes and discuss their remorse—or lack of it. This work offers a penetrating insight into the workings of the criminal mind.</description>

  <description>Here Monsters are hidden ... A lyrical anti-quest through a conscious maze without center, borders, or escape--a dark pilgrim's progress through a landscape of vicious Angels, plague houses, crocodile-prophets, tragic chess-sets, and the mind of an unraveling woman, driven on by the mocking guide who seeks to destroy as much as save. Enter the world of the Labyrinth, where Doors do not wait to be opened, but hunt you in the night. This is Zarathustra in Wonderland, a puzzle which defies solution, a twisted path through language and madness... But where will you hide?</description>

  <description>The curator of the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices shares his collection of hilarious, horrifying, and preposterous medical devices that have been foisted upon the gullible in their quest for good health. These modern-day snake oil salesmen, with their dubious devices, have preyed on the medically ignorant with ridiculous and sobering results. From the Prostate Gland Warmer to the Retro Rotor, from the Nose Straightener to the Wonder Electro Marvel, these implements reveal the desperate measures sought for magic cures. With period advertisements, promotional literature, and gadget instructions, this book offers a wealth of past -- and present -- medical fraud.</description>

  <description>For nearly a century, the original version of Upton Sinclair's classic novel has remained almost entirely unknown. When it was published in serial form in 1905, it was a full third longer than the censored, commercial edition published in book form the following year. That expurgated commercial edition edited out much of the ethnic flavor of the original, as well as some of the goriest descriptions of the meat-packing industry and much of Sinclair's most pointed social and political commentary. The text of this new edition is as it appeared in the original uncensored edition of 1905. It contains the full 36 chapters as originally published, rather than the 31 of the expurgated edition. A new foreword describes the discovery in the 1980s of the original edition and its subsequent suppression, and a new introduction places the novel in historical context by explaining the pattern of censorship in the shorter commercial edition.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In this perennial bestseller, Seth challenges our assumptions about the nature of reality. He explains how the conscious mind directs unconscious activity and has at its command all the powers of the inner self. Included are excellent exercises for applying these theories to any life situation.</description>

  <description>Tattoos and tattoo culture have gone mainstream in the last few years, with popular TV shows such as &lt;em&gt;LA Ink&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Miami Ink&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;London Ink&lt;/em&gt; making celebrities out of tattooists and their clients. Highly skilled artists, many tattooists have moved beyond the artwork they draw on skin to create personal work on canvas. &lt;em&gt;Art by Tattooists&lt;/em&gt; is the first book to showcase this art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book features twenty-six international artists who use a variety of mediums, from ink, watercolor, acrylic paint, and oil to lino printing, painting on wood and board, and even examples of tattoo-style street art and skateboard graphics. Many of the artists are heavily influenced by the imagery they use as tattooists—roses, hearts, skulls, scrolls, birds, pin-ups, etc.—and carry this into their personal work. Other work features colors, themes, or subject matter that is more subtly related to tattoo styles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the current popularity of all things tattoo-related, the book will have a wide appeal, not only to anyone interested in tattoo art and culture but also to artists, illustrators, designers, and students.</description>

  <description>An epic drama of adventure, courage, ruthlessness and passion by one of Scandinavia's most acclaimed storytellers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1848 a motley crew of Danish sailors sets sail from the small island town of Marstal to fight the Germans. Not all of them return - and those who do will never be the same. Among them is the daredevil Laurids Madsen, who promptly escapes again into the anonymity of the high seas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As soon as he is old enough, his son Albert sets off in search of his missing father on a voyage that will take him to the furthest reaches of the globe and into the clutches of the most nefarious company. Bearing a mysterious shrunken head, and plagued by premonitions of bloodshed, he returns to a town increasingly run by women - among them a widow intent on liberating all men from the tyranny of the sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the barren rocks of Newfoundland to the lush plantations of Samoa, from the roughest bars in Tasmania, to the frozen coasts of northern Russia, &lt;em&gt;We, The Drowned&lt;/em&gt; spans four generations, two world wars and a hundred years. Carsten Jensen conjures a wise, humorous, thrilling story of fathers and sons, of the women they love and leave behind, and of the sea's murderous promise. This is a novel destined to take its place among the greatest seafaring literature.</description>

  <description>Peter "Ginger" Baker is a legend. A pioneering drummer who has transcended genres, he did much to popularize world music with his fierce passion for the rhythms of Africa. He is that rare thing, a critically acclaimed musician who has enjoyed global success with not one but several supergroups to his name, including Cream and Blind Faith. Here, Ginger tells his story for the first time and without any self-censorship. It's an often harrowing, but honest journey from his humble beginnings in war-torn south London to his adopted home in South Africa's beautiful Western Cape. He tells of his life-long love of jazz, how he discovered the drums and African music, and life on the road. He also confesses to the heroin use that should have killed him in his colorful 1960s prime, working and playing with the biggest names of the time. In the 1970s, he came up with a trans-Saharan trucking scheme, was a successful rally driver, built an ill-fated recording studio, and discovered a consuming passion for playing polo. He talks candidly of the loss and recovery of his fortune, his three marriages, Cream's 1993 induction into the rock 'n' roll hall of fame, their subsequent successful reunion in 2005, and his hopes for the future.</description>

  <description>After 30 years of silence, and on the eve of the verdict of a Fourth Inquest, Michael Chamberlain writes his own account of the death of his baby daughter Azaria Chamberlain in a heart-wrenching and compelling book. Never before has Michael Chamberlain spoken about this tragic event and the release comprises a number of picture sections with exclusive unreleased family images. The story of the Chamberlains has been the one subject that has divided many a dinner party throughout Australia and the world. They were a young family who loved the outdoors. When they took their two young children and baby to Ayers Rock they never knew their lives would be forever changed. Tragedy struck when a dingo forced its way into the tent and dragged their daughter Azaria to its lair. 'That dingo's got my baby!'. That 'cry in the dark' on 17 August, 1980 of her mother Lindy Chamberlain remains imprinted in the world's mind. In Heart of Stone Michael takes the reader back to the place where it all began - Ayers Rock (before it was also named Uluru) . In a detailed, methodical and emotional account he writes of all tragic moment when Lindy heard the 'cry in the dark' and the discovery of the empty baby's bed. Michael describes that long night - with Aboriginal trackers springing to their aid to search, and the head ranger who had agonized for three months previous about the troublesome dingoes in the camping areas. He describes in detail the heartache of the first inquest at Ayers Rock - the first to be broadcast live - which declared that the dingo had taken the baby, and then the turnaround, when he and his wife were charged with suspected murder. Michael describes his life in the painful and horrendous lead up to the arrest and persecution of his wife Lindy and her wrongful imprisonment for the murder of her own child in the 'trial of the century'. He takes the reader through their ordeal of the following inquests, the tragic breakup of their marriage. When an English tourist fell off the rock the search led to the discovery of the 'matinee jacket' in a dingo lair. The news led to Lindy's release 'on compassionate grounds' and yet another inquiry. All of these events are described, as Michael lived in the unrelenting glare of the media, whose opinion and fostering of rumours added to the impression of the public of Michael and his family. There were unfounded rumours, for example, that Azaria meant 'sacrifice in the desert' when it actually means 'blessed'. Questions over Michael's reluctance to cry in public, or his reserved nature were taken to mean he was hiding the truth. Michael's own determination for justice has led to a fourth inquest in the Northern Territory of Australian into the death of Azaria. This book is about getting justice for a family, full circle. It is about the impossible mission driven this time by me, against all odds; to open the fourth inquest and the truth, backed by the law, declaring that a dingo killed Azaria. While Lindy has published her own book, with a TV mini series based on that, John Bryson has written Evil Angels and Meryl Streep starred in Cry in the Dark, this book is a missing link in the story of Azaria, written in his own hand by her father. THE TIMELINE OF EVENTS Azaria Chantelle Loren Chamberlain born, Mount Isa Public Hospital: 11 June 1980 Taken by a dingo at Ayers Rock:</description>

  <description>The second in a series of novels by bondage connoisseur Alison Tyler features heroine Samantha progressing with her predilections and exploring the deepest recesses of her master's dungeon and her heart. &lt;em&gt;The Delicious Torment&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;Story of O&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;9 1/2 Weeks&lt;/em&gt; coming-of-age tale fueled by lust, longing, and based on the author's personal diaries. &lt;em&gt;The Delicious Torment&lt;/em&gt; takes readers to Sunset Strip, way up in the sky in a penthouse apartment overlooking Los Angeles with a love affair ensconced in an S&amp;amp;M relationship filled with corsets, crops, and plenty of kink. In the introduction Tyler notes, "This is a novel with me at the center. That is, my heroine is based on me. I’ve sketched her with broad strokes, but at our core we are the same. She’s gotten herself entwined with an older man — nothing new there. But now she has to learn how to maneuver a 24/7 relationship."&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>London, 1861.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir Richard Francis Burton—explorer, linguist, scholar, and swordsman; his reputation tarnished; his career in tatters; his former partner missing and probably dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Algernon Charles Swinburne—unsuccessful poet and follower of de Sade; for whom pain is pleasure, and brandy is ruin!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They stand at a crossroads in their lives and are caught in the epicenter of an empire torn by conflicting forces: Engineers transform the landscape with bigger, faster, noisier, and dirtier technological wonders; Eugenicists develop specialist animals to provide unpaid labor; Libertines oppose repressive laws and demand a society based on beauty and creativity; while the Rakes push the boundaries of human behavior to the limits with magic, drugs, and anarchy. The two men are sucked into the perilous depths of this moral and ethical vacuum when Lord Palmerston commissions Burton to investigate assaults on young women committed by a weird apparition known as Spring Heeled Jack, and to find out why werewolves are terrorizing London's East End.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their investigations lead them to one of the defining events of the age, and the terrifying possibility that the world they inhabit shouldn't exist at all!</description>

  <description>When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. That dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father (a professional taxidermist who created dead-animal hand puppets) and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humor in the strange shame spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawson's long-suffering husband and sweet daughter are the perfect comedic foils to her absurdities, and help her to uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments-the ones we want to pretend never happened-are the very same moments that make us the people we are today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's Pretend This Never Happened is a poignantly disturbing, yet darkly hysterical tome for every intellectual misfit who thought they were the only ones to think the things that Lawson dares to say out loud. Like laughing at a funeral, this book is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started.</description>

  <description>A renowned cardiologist explains how eliminating wheat from our diets can prevent fat storage,&lt;br&gt;shrink unsightly bulges, and reverse myriad health problems.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Every day, over 200 million Americans consume food products made of wheat. As a result, over 100&lt;br&gt;million of them experience some form of adverse health effect, ranging from minor rashes and high blood sugar to the unattractive stomach bulges that preventive cardiologist William Davis calls “wheat bellies.” According to Davis, that excess fat has nothing to do with gluttony, sloth, or too much butter: It’s due to the whole grain wraps we eat for lunch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;After witnessing over 2,000 patients regain their health after giving up wheat, Davis reached the&lt;br&gt;disturbing conclusion that wheat is the single largest contributor to the nationwide obesity epidemic—and its elimination is key to dramatic weight loss and optimal health. In &lt;em&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/em&gt;, Davis exposes the harmful effects of what is actually a product of genetic tinkering and agribusiness being sold to the&lt;br&gt;American public as “wheat”—and provides readers with a user-friendly, step-by-step plan to navigate a new, wheat-free lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Informed by cutting-edge science and nutrition, along with case studies from men and women who&lt;br&gt;have experienced life-changing transformations in their health after waving goodbye to wheat, &lt;em&gt;Wheat&lt;br&gt;Belly&lt;/em&gt; is an illuminating look at what is truly making Americans sick and an action plan to clear our plates of this seemingly benign ingredient.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of a Books for a Better Life Award&lt;/strong&gt;Everyone experiences some level of apprehension about major life decisions—from wedding day jitters to new job nerves. But what about the quieter, less noticeable fears that inform everyday choices and disrupt relationships? Fearing intimacy, change, or failure may sound cliché, but for most people, deeply embedded anxieties such as these can act as subconscious saboteurs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Life Unlocked&lt;/em&gt;, Harvard psychotherapist Dr. Srinivasan Pillay draws from cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to show that the biggest roadblock to happiness is fear. Brain imaging studies reveal that when fear is reframed, a person can become less fearful. In fact, fear itself doesn’t cause anxiety—&lt;em&gt;fear &lt;/em&gt;of fear is what causes anxiety and dread. Recognizing and understanding fear is the first step toward overcoming it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on his research and extensive clinical experience, Dr. Pillay addresses specific, common problems such as fear of success, economic worries, and relationship anxieties, and also explores broader subjects such as the biology of prejudice and the science of positive thinking. With helpful exercises and proven techniques, &lt;em&gt;Life Unlocked &lt;/em&gt;shows how to move past fear and unlock the happiness you deserve.</description>

  <description>While best known as the creator of "Peanuts," Charles M. Schulz (1922-2000) was also a thoughtful and precise prose writer who knew how to explain his craft in clear and engaging ways. "My Life with Charlie Brown" brings together his major prose writings, many published here for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Schulz's autobiographical articles, book introductions, magazine pieces, lectures, and commentary elucidate his life and his art, and clarify themes of modern life, philosophy, and religion that are interwoven into his beloved, groundbreaking comic strip. Edited and with an introduction by comics scholar M. Thomas Inge, this volume will serve as the touchstone for Schulz's thoughts and convictions and as a wide-ranging, unique autobiography in the absence of a traditional, extended memoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inge and the Schulz estate have chosen a number of illustrations to include. With the approval and cooperation of the Schulz family, Inge draws on the cartoonist's entire archives, papers, and correspondence to allow Schulz full voice to speak his mind. The project includes his comics criticism, his introductions to "Peanuts" volumes, his essays about philanthropy, his commentary on Christianity, his newspaper articles about the creation of his characters, and more. "My Life with Charlie Brown" will reveal new dimensions of this legendary cartoonist.</description>

  <description>Have You Forgotten? I Am Your Mother. You Are Under My Protection. There is a promise Holy Mother makes to us, proclaims Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estes, that any soul needing comfort, vision, guidance, or strength can cry out to her, flee to her protection, and Blessed Mother will immediately arrive with veils flying. She will place us under her mantle for refuge, and give us the warmth of her most compassionate touch, and strong guidance about how to go by the soul s lights. Untie the Strong Woman is Dr. Estes invitation to come together under the shelter of The Mother whether she appears to us as the Madonna, Our Lady of Guadalupe, or any one of her countless incarnations. In this unforgettable collection of stories, prayers, and blessings, Dr. Estes shares: The Drunkard and the Lady a story of unexpected miracles that arise from the mud and soil Guadalupe is a Girl Gang Leader in Heaven a poem of resistance and hope No One Too Bad, Too Mean, or Too Hopeless the fierce Mother that never gives up on us The Shirt of Arrows a love that is invincible no matter how many times we are wounded The Black Madonna she who stands at the juncture between two worlds and protects us as we enter the dark places Why does the face of Our Lady appear in the most humble and unexpected places? Why does she burst forth into every culture no matter how hard authority tries to suppress her? It is because no bonds can restrain the power of her love, nor prevent her from returning to those who need her most. With Untie the Strong Woman, Dr. Estes invites you to encounter the force of Immaculate Love So that your memory of Her is renewed, or that the knowledge of her miraculous, fierce, enduring ways is drawn into your heart for the very first time.</description>

  &lt;p&gt;Jim Henson, an extraordinary artist and visionary, invented unique worlds and characters that remain just as vivid, original and fresh today as when they were created. A television pioneer, an innovator in puppetry, technology and visual arts, and a performer who literally brought to life some of the most memorable characters ever, Jim Henson's impact on entertainment, education and culture continues to this day more than 20 years after his death. &lt;/p&gt;

  <description>Throughout her life, Melissa Jesperson Moore had to hide her true identity. She had pretended that life was perfect after her parents divorced and she was suddenly uprooted from everything familiar and loving. She had to be silent, and to pretend not to be disturbed or upset by her father's actions.    Those experiences prepared Melissa to hide the deepest, darkest secret of all. As she began making different choices, building a successful and loving life on her own, her heart began to fill with rays of hope, though she could never quite rid herself of the dark shadow of secrecy and shame. Then one day, her beautiful, innocent daughter looked into her eyes and said, "Mommy, everybody's got a daddy. Where's your daddy?"    Shattered Silence is an astonishing, true narrative of personal and spiritual transformation. From her secret life as "the daughter of The Happy Face Serial Murderer" to a woman that bared her soul and inspired millions, Melissa leads the reader on the vulnerable, compelling, and sometimes very raw journey of what it took to shatter the silence, and claim her own life.</description>

  <description>The dramatic story of the methamphetamine epidemic as it sweeps the American heartland--a timely, moving, very human account of one community's attempt to battle its way to a brighter future. Crystal methamphetamine is widely considered to be the most dangerous drug in the world, and nowhere is that more true than in the small towns of the American heartland. "Methland "tells the story of Oelwein, Iowa (pop. 6,159), which, like thousands of other small towns across the country, has been left in the dust by the consolidation of the agricultural industry, a depressed local economy, and an out-migration of people. As if this weren't enough to deal with, an incredibly cheap, longlasting, and highly addictive drug has rolled into town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over a period of four years, journalist Nick Reding brings us into the heart of Oelwein through a cast of intimately drawn characters, including: Clay Hallburg, the town doctor, who fights meth even as he struggles with his own alcoholism; Nathan Lein, the town prosecutor, whose caseload is filled almost exclusively with meth-related crime; and Jeff Rohrick, a meth addict, still trying to kick the habit after twenty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tracing the connections between the lives touched by the drug and the global forces that set the stage for the epidemic, "Methland "offers a vital and unique perspective on a pressing contemporary tragedy.</description>

  <description>"Eastern State Penitentiary: A History" documents the stories of the men and the method that shaped one of Philadelphia's most recognizable landmarks. In this superbly balanced and thoroughly researched volume, Paul Kahan presents the history of this revolutionary penitentiary, from its inception as a model of the revolutionary Pennsylvania System of incarceration in 1829 to the demands for its closure in the wake of everincreasing violence in 1971. Through tales of spectacular escapes, official corruption, reformation and retribution, Kahan chronicles the tensions that plagued Eastern State since the arrival of its first prisoners.</description>

  <description>From Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Restak (Mozart's Brain), a neurosurgeon and popular science writer on the brain, focuses on new technology for examining the physiology of the brain (such as MRI) and how it allows us to monitor and control a far wider range of activities than was formerly possible. Recent work holds the potential for, among other things, reducing the use of psychopharmacological drugs that have unpredictable side effects; substituting one sense (touch) for another (sight); and direct repair of brain and other neurological damage. Restak also demonstrates how the brain is modified the old-fashioned way, such as by practicing a skill. The negative aspects of recent work are invoked in more polemical than scientific prose, such as the specter of social control through "medicalization" of everything, and how the overstimulation of our brains by modern society is giving us all ADD. Hackles will rise the farthest over the author's proclamation that it is proven that TV violence affects our brains in ways that lead to violent behavior without even mentioning the word "censorship." A compact if sometimes oversimplified introduction to its subject, Restak's latest is best when it stays close to the data. &lt;br&gt;Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Scientific American&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pity the poor neurologists of yesteryear, saddled as they were with their conviction that our brains are hardwired after childhood. Then celebrate today’s scientists, who are exploiting brain-imaging technologies to show that our brains are capable of profound and permanent alterations throughout our lives. Neurologist Richard Restak does just that in The New Brain: How the Modern Age Is Rewiring Your Mind, even as he argues that we are being negatively altered by the sound-bite, techno environment in which we live. Technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, Restak begins, can now demonstrate that as a musician practices for many hours, certain neural pathways are strengthened. He then moves to a profound implication, namely that all kinds of technological stimuli are forging brain circuits that may hurt us instead of helping us. For instance, he cites correlations between positron emission tomography scans of violent people and normal experimental subjects who are simply thinking about fighting, then asserts that repeated viewing of violence on television and in video games can set up brain circuits that make us more likely to initiate realworld fisticuffs. Unfortunately, such brain imaging may leave more questions than answers. As Restak himself points out, the technology does not provide "neurological explanations," just "important correlations." Yet he is whipped up enough to diagnose all of modern society with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the probable result of brain changes we are initiating in our media-saturated world. He reminds us of the antidote, though: we are still in control of what we allow ourselves to see and hear. In the end, Restak fails to create a sense that scientists have revealed a new way of understanding the brain. And the images that inspire speculation in the book still await research that may finally reveal the mechanisms of such phenomena as memory and aggression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Available in Paperback!The era of the New Brain is upon us! Already our brains are working differently than they did just one hundred years ago. Drugs are already available that work in the brain to prevent us from feeling drowsy, depressed, anxious, or fearful, or that enhance concentration and memory. Dramatic treatments to repair damage in the brain are becoming common. In The New Brain, neurologist, neuropsychiatrist, and bestselling author Dr. Richard Restak tells how technology and biology are converging to influence the evolution of the human brain. Dr. Restak describes the dramatic advances that now are possible, as well as the potential for misuse and abuse, examining such questions as: Is Attention Deficit Disorder a "normal" response to the modern world's demand that we attend to several things at once? What happens in our brains when images replace language as the primary means of communication? How does exposure to violent imagery affect our brains? Are we all capable of training our brains to perform at a superior level?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The mother of Matthew Shepard shares her story about her son's death and the choice she made to become an international gay rights activist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, the name Matthew Shepard is synonymous with gay rights, but before his grisly murder in 1998, Matthew was simply Judy Shepard's son. For the first time in book form, Judy Shepard speaks about her loss, sharing memories of Matthew, their life as a typical American family, and the pivotal event in the small college town that changed everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Matthew&lt;/em&gt; follows the Shepard family in the days immediately after the crime, when Judy and her husband traveled to see their incapacitated son, kept alive by life support machines; how the Shepards learned of the incredible response from strangers all across America who held candlelit vigils and memorial services for their child; and finally, how they struggled to navigate the legal system as Matthew's murderers were on trial. Heart-wrenchingly honest, Judy Shepard confides with readers about how she handled the crippling loss of her child, why she became a gay rights activist, and the challenges and rewards of raising a gay child in America today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Matthew&lt;/em&gt; not only captures the historical significance and complicated civil rights issues surrounding one young man's life and death, but it also chronicles one ordinary woman's struggle to cope with the unthinkable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;The Wordy Shipmates&lt;/em&gt;, Sarah Vowell travels once again through America's past, this time to seventeenth-century New England. From the British Library to the Mohegan Sun casino, from the nation's first synagogue to a &lt;em&gt;Mayflower&lt;/em&gt; waterslide, Vowell studies the Puritan effect and finds their beliefs about church and state more interesting than their buckles-and-corn reputation would suggest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She asks: Was Massachusetts Bay Colony governor John Winthrop a communitarian, Christlike Christian, or conformity's tyrannical enforcer? Yes! Was Rhode Island's architect Roger Williams America's founding freak or the father of the First Amendment? Same difference. How come Henry Vane the Younger, who argued against beheading the English king, was himself beheaded for helping behead said king? Good question. What does it take to get that Jezebel Anne Hutchinson to shut up? A hatchet. What was the Puritans' pet name for the Pope? The Great Whore of Babylon. What is the lesson of the Pequot War? Why, don't fire one of your military's embarrassingly few Arabic translators just because he's gay, of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As in all Vowell's bestselling books, this exploration of America's past is both poignant and entertaining. &lt;em&gt;The Wordy Shipmates&lt;/em&gt; is rich with historical fact, humorous insight, and social commentary by one of America's celebrated voices.</description>

  <description>The Little Stranger follows the strange adventures of Dr. Faraday, the son of a maid who has built a life of quiet respectability as a country doctor. One dusty postwar summer in his home of rural Warwickshire, he is called to a patient at Hundreds Hall. Home to the Ayres family for more than two centuries, the Georgian house, once grand and handsome, is now in decline-its masonry crumbling, its gardens choked with weeds, the clock in its stable yard permanently fixed at twenty to nine. But are the Ayreses haunted by something more ominous than a dying way of life? Little does Dr. Faraday know how closely, and how terrifyingly, their story is about to become entwined with his.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Award-winning writer Maile Meloy's return to short stories explores complex lives in an austere landscape with the clear-sightedness that first endeared her to readers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Meloy's first return to short stories since her critically acclaimed debut, &lt;em&gt;Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It&lt;/em&gt; is an extraordinary new work from one of the most promising writers of the last decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Eleven unforgettable new stories demonstrate the emotional power and the clean, assured style that have earned Meloy praise from critics and devotion from readers. Propelled by a terrific instinct for storytelling, and concerned with the convolutions of modern love and the importance of place, this collection is about the battlefields-and fields of victory-that exist in seemingly harmless spaces, in kitchens and living rooms and cars. Set mostly in the American West, the stories feature small-town lawyers, ranchers, doctors, parents, and children, and explore the moral quandaries of love, family, and friendship. A ranch hand falls for a recent law school graduate who appears unexpectedly- and reluctantly-in his remote Montana town. A young father opens his door to find his dead grandmother standing on the front step. Two women weigh love and betrayal during an early snow. Throughout the book, Meloy examines the tensions between having and wanting, as her characters try to keep hold of opposing forces in their lives: innocence and experience, risk and stability, fidelity and desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Knowing, sly, and bittersweet, &lt;em&gt;Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It&lt;/em&gt; confirms Maile Meloy's singular literary talent. Her lean, controlled prose, full of insight and unexpected poignancy, is the perfect complement to her powerfully moving storytelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In Keith Miller's debut novel, our hero is Pico, a poet and librarian who is and forbidden to pursue the girl of his dreams - for she has wings, and Pico does not. When he discovers an ancient letter in his library telling of the mythical Morning Town where the flightless may gain their wings, he sets off on a quest. It's a magical journey and coming-of-age story in which he meets a robber queen, a lonely minotaur, a cannibal, an immortal beauty, and a dream seller. Each has a story, and a lesson, for Pico-about learning to love, to persevere, and, of course, to fly. A gorgeously poetic tale of fantasy for adults, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Flying&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful modern fable and daring new take on the quest narrative.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Ingrid Betancourt tells the story of her captivity in the Colombian jungle, sharing powerful teachings of resilience, resistance, and faith. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Born in Bogotá, raised in France, Ingrid Betancourt at the age of thirty-two gave up a life of comfort and safety to return to Colombia to become a political leader in a country that was being slowly destroyed by terrorism, violence, fear, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. In 2002, while campaigning as a candidate in the Colombian presidential elections, she was abducted by the FARC. Nothing could have prepared her for what came next. She would spend the next six and a half years in the depths of the jungle as a prisoner of the FARC. &lt;em&gt;Even Silence Has an End&lt;/em&gt; is her deeply personal and moving account of that time. Chained day and night for much of her captivity, she never stopped dreaming of escape and, in fact, succeeded in getting away several times, always to be recaptured. In her most successful effort she and a fellow captive survived a week away, but were caught when her companion became desperately ill; she learned later that they had been mere miles from freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The facts of her story are astounding, but it is Betancourt's indomitable spirit that drives this very special account, bringing life, nuance, and profundity to the narrative. Attending as intimately to the landscape of her mind as she does to the events of her capture and captivity, &lt;em&gt;Even Silence Has an End&lt;/em&gt; is a meditation on the very stuff of life-fear and freedom, hope and what inspires it. Betancourt tracks her metamorphosis, sharing how in the routines she established for herself-listening to her mother and two children broadcast to her over the radio, daily prayer-she was able to do the unthinkable: to move through the pain of the moment and find a place of serenity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Freed in 2008 by the Colombian army, today Betancourt is determined to draw attention to the plight of hostages and victims of terrorism throughout the world and it is that passion that motivates &lt;em&gt;Even Silence Has an End&lt;/em&gt;. The lessons she offers here-in courage, resilience, and humanity-are gifts to treasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1912 what was arguably the most violent crime, the darkest mystery, in Midwest history took place. Law enforcement officers encountered a scene of unimagined violence: eight victims, six of them children, bludgeoned to death with an ax while they slept. Everywhere there were clues. But inexperienced investigators failed, and private detectives took over. When Detective James Newton Wilkerson charged that a respected state senator had been motivated to the unthinkable by the promiscuity of his daughter-in-law, the community was drawn into a bitter and accelerating struggle between powerful men. And then a deranged and perverted minister confessed. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A bestselling, groundbreaking author investigates successful long term marriages, interviewing wives and their uncensored strategies for staying married. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;America's high divorce rate is well known. But little attention has been paid to the flip side: couples who creatively (sometimes clandestinely) manage to build marriages that are lasting longer than we ever thought possible. What's the secret? To find out, bestselling journalist Iris Krasnow interviewed more than 200 wives whose marriages have survived for 15 to 70 years. They are a diverse cast, yet they share one common and significant trait: They have made bold, sometimes secretive and shocking choices on how to keep their marital vows, "till death do us part," as Krasnow says, "without killing someone first."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In raw, candid, titillating stories, Krasnow's cast of wise women give voice to the truth about marriage and the importance of maintaining a strong sense of self apart from the relationship. Some spend summers separately from their partners. Some make time for wine with the girls. One septuagenarian has a recurring date with an old flame from high school. In every case, the marriage operates on many tracks, giving both spouses license to pursue the question "Who am I apart from my marriage?" Krasnow's goal is to give women permission to create their own marriages at any age. Marital bliss is possible, she says, if each partner is blissful apart from the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fascinating window on the many faces of modern relationships, &lt;em&gt;The Secret Lives of Wives&lt;/em&gt; brims with inspiring and daring examples of women who have it both ways: a committed marriage and personal adventures in uncharted territory. For anyone who wants to stay married and stay sane, this is the book to read!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; An entertaining illumination of the stupid beliefs that make us feel wise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You believe you are a rational, logical being who sees the world as it really is, but journalist David McRaney is here to tell you that you're as deluded as the rest of us. But that's OK- delusions keep us sane. &lt;em&gt;You Are Not So Smart&lt;/em&gt; is a celebration of self-delusion. It's like a psychology class, with all the boring parts taken out, and with no homework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the popular blog of the same name, &lt;em&gt;You Are Not So Smart&lt;/em&gt; collects more than 46 of the lies we tell ourselves everyday, including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dunbar's Number - Humans evolved to live in bands of roughly 150 individuals, the brain cannot handle more than that number. If you have more than 150 Facebook friends, they are surely not all real friends. Hindsight bias - When we learn something new, we reassure ourselves that we knew it all along. Confirmation bias - Our brains resist new ideas, instead paying attention only to findings that reinforce our preconceived notions. Brand loyalty - We reach for the same brand not because we trust its quality but because we want to reassure ourselves that we made a smart choice the last time we bought it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Packed with interesting sidebars and quick guides on cognition and common fallacies, &lt;em&gt;You Are Not So Smart&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating synthesis of cutting-edge psychology research to turn our minds inside out.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;�The last scan in the pile was strikingly odd. In fact it looked exactly like the most abnormal of the scans I had just been writing about, suggesting that the poor individual it belonged to was a psychopath—or at least shared an uncomfortable amount of traits with one....When I found out who the scan belonged to, I had to believe there was a mistake....But there had been no mistake. The scan was mine.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For the first fifty-eight years of his life James Fallon was by all appearances a normal guy. A successful neuroscientist and medical school professor, he’d been raised in a loving, supportive family, married his high school sweetheart, and had three kids and lots of friends. &lt;br&gt; Then he learned a shocking truth that would not only disrupt his personal and professional life, but would lead him to question the very nature of his own identity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Psychopath Inside&lt;/em&gt; tells the fascinating story of Fallon’s reaction to the discovery that he has the brain of a psychopath. While researching serial murderers, he uncovered a distinct neurological pattern in their brain scans that helped explain their cold and violent behavior. A few months later he learned that he was descended from a family with a long line of murderers which confirmed that Fallon’s own brain pattern wasn’t a fluke. &lt;br&gt; As a scientist convinced that humans are shaped by their genetics, Fallon set out to reconcile the truth about his brain with everything he knew about the mind, behavior, and the influence of nature vs. nurture on our personalities. How could he, a successful scientist and a happy family man with no history of violence, be a psychopath? How much did his biology influence his behavior? Was he capable of some of the gruesome atrocities perpetrated by the serial killers he had studied? &lt;br&gt; Combining his personal experience with scientific analysis, Fallon shares his journey and the discoveries that ultimately led him to understand that, despite everything science can teach us, humans are even more complex than we can imagine.</description>

  <description>The crimes of Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Dennis Rader, and other high-profile killers are so breathtakingly awful that most people would not hesitate to label them "evil." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this groundbreaking book, renowned psychiatrist Michael H. Stone—host of Discovery Channel’s former series Most Evil—uses this common emotional reaction to horrifying acts as his starting point to explore the concept and reality of evil from a new perspective. In an in-depth discussion of the personality traits and behavior that constitute evil across a wide spectrum, Dr. Stone takes a clarifying scientific approach to a topic that for centuries has been inadequately explained by religious doctrines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basing his analysis on the detailed biographies of more than 600 violent criminals, Stone has created a 22-level hierarchy of evil behavior, which loosely reflects the structure of Dante’s Inferno. He traces two salient personality traits that run the gamut from those who commit crimes of passion to perpetrators of the worst crimes—sadistic torture and murder. One trait is narcissism, as exhibited in people who are so self-centered that they have little or no ability to care about their victims. The other is aggression, the use of power over another person to inflict humiliation, suffering, and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stone then turns to the various factors that, singly or intertwined, contribute to pushing certain people over the edge into committing heinous crimes. They include heredity, adverse environments, violence-prone cultures, mental illness or brain injury, and abuse of mind-altering drugs. All are considered in the search for the root causes of evil behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience tell us about the minds of those whose actions could be described as evil? And what will that mean for the rest of us? Stone discusses how an increased understanding of the causes of evil will affect the justice system. He predicts a day when certain persons can safely be declared salvageable and restored to society and when early signs of violence in children may be corrected before potentially dangerous patterns become entrenched.</description>

  <description>The summer of 1919 is over, and on the high prairie, a small army of men, women, and machines moves across the land, bringing in the wheat harvest.  Custom threshers, steam engineers, bindlestiffs, cooks, camp followers, and hobos join the tide.  Prosperous farmers proudly proclaim “Rain follows the plow,” meaning that the bounty of the land will never be exhausted.  Everywhere, people gleefully embrace the gospels of progress and greed.  The threshing season is on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But there is also an evil upon the land.  A killer who calls himself the Windmill Man believes he has a holy calling to water the newly plucked earth with blood. For him, the moving harvest is a target-rich environment, an endless supply of ready victims.  He has been killing for years now and intends to kill for many more.  Who could stop him? Nobody even knew he existed.  Until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A young man named Charlie Krueger also follows the harvest.  Jilted by his childhood sweetheart and estranged from his drunkard father, he hopes to find a new life as a steam engineer.  But in a newly harvested field in the nearly black Dakota night, he has come upon a strange man digging a grave.  And in that moment, he has become the only person who can stop the evil, if he lives long enough. For the killer knows his name and his wanderings, and he, too, is now a target. When next they meet, one of them will have to die.</description>

  <description>Its landscaped ground, chosen by Frederick Law Olmsted and dotted with Tudor mansions, could belong to a New England prep school. There are no fences, no guards, no locked gates. But McLean Hospital is a mental institution-one of the most famous, most elite, and once most luxurious in America. McLean "alumni" include Olmsted himself, Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath, James Taylor and Ray Charles, as well as (more secretly) other notables from among the rich and famous. In its "golden age," McLean provided as genteel an environment for the treatment of mental illness as one could imagine. But the golden age is over, and a downsized, downscale McLean-despite its affiliation with Harvard University-is struggling to stay afloat. &lt;em&gt;Gracefully Insane&lt;/em&gt;, by &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; columnist Alex Beam, is a fascinating and emotional biography of McLean Hospital from its founding in 1817 through today. It is filled with stories about patients and doctors: the Ralph Waldo Emerson protégé whose brilliance disappeared along with his madness; Anne Sexton's poetry seminar, and many more. The story of McLean is also the story of the hopes and failures of psychology and psychotherapy; of the evolution of attitudes about mental illness, of approaches to treatment, and of the economic pressures that are making McLean-and other institutions like it-relics of a bygone age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a compelling and often oddly poignant reading for fans of books like Plath's &lt;em&gt;The Bell Jar&lt;/em&gt; and Susanna Kaysen's &lt;em&gt;Girl, Interrupted&lt;/em&gt; (both inspired by their author's stays at McLean) and for anyone interested in the history of medicine or psychotherapy, or the social history of New England.</description>

  <description>Project Nemesis does not exist ... at least as far as the country's civilians are concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Jesse Stone, a lycanthrope captured for their use, the project was very much real and ongoing. He was a slave to their experiments--tortured endlessly, starved, and all but drained of his will to live. Only one bright spot remained in his life--Erin. Until the day she came to him, a willing participant in their schemes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The betrayal was more than he could bear. It hardened him, turned his mind to white hot rage as feverish as the searing pleasure he felt in taking her. They would regret taking him. He would destroy them all. And Erin ... she he would save for last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rating: Contains graphic, explicit sex, violence and language, profanity, attempted rape (not by hero), and harsh language.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The amazing story of Australian mountain climber Lincoln Hall�s rescue following a night spent near the summit of Mount Everest, where he had been left for dead by the other members of his expedition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lincoln Hall likes to say that on the evening of May 25, 2006, he died on Everest. Indeed, he attempted to climb the mountain during a deadly season in which eleven people perished. And Hall, in fact, was pronounced dead, after collapsing from altitude sickness. Two Sherpas spent hours trying to revive him, but, as darkness fell, word came via radio from the exhibition�s leader that the Sherpas should descend the mountain in order to save themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The news of Lincoln Hall�s death traveled rapidly from mountaineering websites to news media around the world, and ultimately to his family back in Australia. Early the next morning, however, an American guide, climbing with two clients and a Sherpa, was startled to find Hall, sitting cross-legged on the summit ridge, just staring at them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As featured in the Emmy-nominated &lt;em&gt;Dateline NBC&lt;/em&gt; documentary �Miracle on Mount Everest,� &lt;em&gt;Dead Lucky&lt;/em&gt; is Lincoln Hall�s account of this miraculous night atop Everest and the days and nights that led up to and followed this fascinating expedition. Hall had been part of Australia�s first attempt to climb to the top of the mountain in 1984, but, he had not done any serious climbing for many years, having set aside his passion in order to support his family. Hall was forced to turn back due to illness in 1984 so his triumph in reaching the summit at the age of fifty is a story unto itself. Not since &lt;em&gt;Into Thin Air&lt;/em&gt; has there been such a thrilling Everest story. &lt;em&gt;Dead Lucky&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turner from beginning to end.</description>

  <description>The growing phenomenon known as translucence is effecting a gentle yet profound revolution in human consciousness. Millions of people from all walks of life are experiencing a deep change in awareness, an experience marked by a new sense of well-being, and increasing joy in life, a diminishing of fear — including fear of death — and a natural impulse to serve the world in a real way. The Translucent Revolution describes this awakening and offers readers ample opportunities to cultivate and encourage the qualities of translucence in their own lives. Drawing from a highly convincing body of evidence, observations from pioneers in the field of human consciousness, and a vast pool of powerful stories, the book explores the effects of translucence on many aspects of contemporary western life, including personal relationships, sex, parenting, education, psychotherapy, medicine, aging, business, and global politics.</description>

  <description>The right kind of punishment can be a powerful turn on. Restraint can release hidden desires. A simple leather strap, a shiny pair of handcuffs, a delicate silk scarf, a dominant’s stern gaze. The yearning for a partner who will take control can grip one as powerfully as the most intricate, indecipherable rope knot. In &lt;em&gt;Slave to Love&lt;/em&gt;, Alison Tyler gathers the most popular — and often most taboo — fantasies of sexual control and erotic restraint. Featuring such popular erotica writers as Marilyn Jaye Lewis, Saskia Walker and Rachel Kramer Bussel, &lt;em&gt;Slave to Love&lt;/em&gt; is luscious, naughty, and infinitely sexy.</description>

  <description>An upper-class woman recovering from a suicide attempt, Margaret Prior has begun visiting the women’s ward of Millbank prison, Victorian London’s grimmest jail, as part of her rehabilitative charity work. Amongst Millbank’s murderers and common thieves, Margaret finds herself increasingly fascinated by one apparently innocent inmate, the enigmatic spiritualist Selina Dawes. Selina was imprisoned after a séance she was conducting went horribly awry, leaving an elderly matron dead and a young woman deeply disturbed. Although initially skeptical of Selina’s gifts, Margaret is soon drawn into a twilight world of ghosts and shadows, unruly spirits and unseemly passions, until she is at last driven to concoct a desperate plot to secure Selina’s freedom, and her own.</description>

  <description>On the Ides of March, our hero, Raleigh Whittier Hayes (forgetful husband, baffled father, prosperous insurance agent and leading citizen of Thermopylae, North Carolina), learns that his father has discharged himself from the hospital, taken all his money out of the bank and, with a young black female mental patient, vanished in a yellow Cadillac convertible. Left behind is a mysterious list of seven outrageous tasks that Raleigh must perform in order to rescue his father and his inheritance. &lt;br&gt;And so Raleigh and fat Mingo Sheffield (his irrepressibly loyal friend) set off on an uproarious contemporary treasure hunt through a landscape of unforgettable characters, falling into adventures worthy of Tom Jones and Huck Finn. A moving parable of human love and redemption, Handling Sin is Michael Malone's comic masterpiece.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Street-smart and straightforward police chief Cuddy Mangum and his refined homicide detective Justin Savile V are determined to keep their town's cultural, political and racial divisions stable...even peaceful. But when a young black activist is murdered while in the process of fighting for his brother's freedom from death row, the lines keeping Hillston, North Carolina, in balance start to crumble. &lt;br&gt;Thrust into a dirty political campaign and torn between his morals and his love for the wealthy and beautiful wife of an up-and-coming politician, Cuddy must uncover the secrets that lie in his own backyard. &lt;br&gt;From high-powered and elegant country club ballrooms to dark and dangerous bar room corners, Malone weaves a mystery of plot and place where the difference between good and evil and right and wrong sometimes become indistinct.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;ADVANCE PRAISE FOR &lt;em&gt;GODLESS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;�Valuable in the human story are the reflections of intelligent and ethical people who listen to the voice of reason and who allow it to vanquish bigotry and superstition. This book is a classic example.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;—CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS author of &lt;em&gt;God is Not Great&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;�The most eloquent witness of internal delusion that I know—a triumphantly smiling refugee from the zany, surreal world of American fundamentalist Protestantism—is Dan Barker.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;—RICHARD DAWKINS author of The God Delusion&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;�&lt;em&gt;Godless&lt;/em&gt; was a revelation to me. I don’t think anyone can match the (devastating!) clarity, intensity, and honesty which Dan Barker brings to the journey—faith to reason, childhood to growing up, fantasy to reality, intoxication to sobriety.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;—OLIVER SACKS authors of &lt;em&gt;Musicophilia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Godless&lt;/em&gt;, Barker recounts his journey from evangelical preacher to atheist activist, and along the way explains precisely why it is not only okay to be an atheist, it is something in which to be proud.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;—MICHAEL SHERMER publisher of &lt;em&gt;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt; Magazine&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;�&lt;em&gt;Godless&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating memoir and a handbook for debunking theism. But most of all, it is a moving testimonial to one man’s emotional and intellectual rigor in acclaiming critical thinking.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;—ROBERT SAPOLSKY author of &lt;em&gt;Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The Buddha. Rene Descartes. Emily Dickinson. Greta Garbo. Bobby Fischer. J. D. Salinger: Loners, all—along with as many as 25 percent of the world's population. Loners keep to themselves, and like it that way. Yet in the press, in films, in folklore, and nearly everywhere one looks, loners are tagged as losers and psychopaths, perverts and pity cases, ogres and mad bombers, elitists and wicked witches. Too often, loners buy into those messages and strive to change, making themselves miserable in the process by hiding their true nature—and hiding from it. Loners as a group deserve to be reassessed—to claim their rightful place, rather than be perceived as damaged goods that need to be "fixed." In Party of One Anneli Rufus -- a prize-winning, critically acclaimed writer with talent to burn -- has crafted a morally urgent, historically compelling tour de force—a long-overdue argument in defense of the loner, then and now. Marshalling a polymath's easy erudition to make her case, assembling evidence from every conceivable arena of culture as well as interviews with experts and loners worldwide and her own acutely calibrated analysis, Rufus rebuts the prevailing notion that aloneness is indistinguishable from loneliness, the fallacy that all of those who are alone don't want to be, and wouldn't be, if only they knew how.</description>

  <description>Orphaned, penniless, Jacob Jankowski jumps a freight train in the dark, and in that instant, transforms his future.  &lt;p&gt; By morning, he's landed a job with the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. By nightfall, he's in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an America made colourless by prohibition and the Depression, the circus is a refuge of sequins and sensuality. But behind the glamour lies a darker world, where both animals and men are dispensable. Where falling in love is the most dangerous act of all...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1900, Margaret Hossack, the wife of a prominent Iowa farmer, was arrested for bludgeoning her husband to death with an ax while their children slept upstairs. The community was outraged: How could a woman commit such an act of violence? Firsthand accounts describe the victim, John Hossack, as a cruel and unstable man. Perhaps Margaret Hossack was acting out of fear. Or perhaps the story she told was true--that an intruder broke into the house, killed her husband while she slept soundly beside him, and was still on the loose. Newspapers across the country carried the story, and community sentiment was divided over her guilt. At trial, Margaret was convicted of murder, but later was released on appeal. Ultimately, neither her innocence nor her guilt was ever proved. &lt;br&gt; Patricia Bryan and Thomas Wolf examine the harsh realities of farm life at the turn of the century and look at the plight of women--legally, socially, and politically--during that period. What also emerges is the story of early feminist Susan Glaspell, who covered the Hossack case as a young reporter and later used it as the basis for her acclaimed work " A Jury of Her Peers." &lt;br&gt; Midnight Assassin expertly renders the American character and experience: our obsession with crime, how justice is achieved, and the powerful influence of the media.</description>

  <description>Marusia, in her seventies, is the matriarch of the Petrenko family. She has lived and worked all her life in starylis, a tiny town in rural Ukraine. Starylis is a place where families still live in the ancient thatched-roof cottages that have been their homes for generations. It's a place where everyone grows their own vegetables, where the old women (the babas) sweep the church steps daily and bake bread in outdoor communal clay ovens. It's a place where everyone knows everyone else, and everyone else's business. It's a little town just down the road from Chernobyl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On April 26, 1986, the lives of Marusia, her family, and her townspeople change forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The air begins to taste strange, the workers don't come home from their shifts at the nearby power plant. Eventually the Soviet government orders a mandatory and permanent evacuation. But less than a year after the accident, a handful of elderly women - the first of whom is Marusia - defy the government prohibition and return, one by one, to their now deserted town. Despite their differences and their losses, they band together for survival, companionship, and to confront the Soviet officials responsible for their fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a tale of ordinary citizens who, when faced with extraordinary circumstances, become the most unexpected heroes. Inspired by a true incident and transformed by the talents of a remarkable young writer, The Sky Unwashed is a simple story told with gentle humor that redefines our notions of home and community.</description>

  <description>In the course of his numerous talks and presentations to college and grade school students, civic clubs, and nursing homes, climatologist Randy Cerveny found that people of all ages are fascinated by the "unusual"—and he seized on that fascination to tell them about strange weather. Now, in his first book, the rest of us can learn of real, documented stories such as these: Odd occurrences of chickens losing all their feathers during tornadoes (so-called "chicken plucking"); Strange stories of finding lightning victims who have been completely stripped of all of their clothes (through a process known as "the vapor effect"); Weird stories of how past powerful hailstorms have both led to the ending of one war—and the complete prevention of another; Bizarre uses of weather—such as the strange contraption called a "windwagon" that literally "sailed" nearly 500 miles from Kansas to Colorado; Each chapter in Freaks of the Storm encompasses the oddities of a specific type of weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning, and hail. The author also divides specific conditions into a set of categories associated with the overall phenomena.</description>

  <description>This book chronicles the unforgettable account of one of the most severe child abuse cases in California history. It is the story of Dave Pelzer, who was brutally beaten and starved by his emotionally unstable, alcoholic mother: a mother who played tortuous, unpredictable games--games that left him nearly dead. He had to learn how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no longer a boy, but an "it." Dave's bed was an old army cot in the basement, and his clothes were torn and raunchy. When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare. He had nothing or no one to turn to, but his dreams kept him alive--dreams of someone taking care of him, loving him and calling him their son.</description>

  <description>This entertaining guide directs travelers to the off-the-wall and offbeat destinations in Florida, home of gator wrestlers, school bus demolition derbies, Hemingway wannabes, the Fountain of Youth, the Nudist Hall of Fame, and a utopian community based on the premise that the earth is not round, but concave. Additional oddball attractions include a graveyard for roosters, the world’s largest strawberry, the world’s smallest police station, and museums dedicated to seashells, hamburgers, oranges, teddy bears, sponges, air conditioning, and one very old petrified cat. Documenting local oddities and forgotten history, this travel guide covers Florida in six regions with maps and detailed directions for each site as well as phone numbers, hours, websites, and various photographs.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Love is everywhere. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When does a gift become a curse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt Stone doesn't believe in ghosts. But there are those who are convinced his home, a historic Virginia estate that dates back to the Revolutionary War, is haunted. Pressured to get at the truth about some strange happenings at Melody House, he agrees to let Harrison Investigations explore the house. But he isn't ready for beautiful, intriguing Darcy Tremayne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a paranormal investigator, Darcy has learned to believe in the unbelievable. And she's given Matt fair warning: sometimes people don't like the skeletons she finds. She never dreamed that the warning would apply to herself. For she's about to discover that Melody House holds much more than a simple mystery form the distant past. What it holds is a very real and lethal danger, one that will cast her into a struggle against the worlds of both the living and the dead.</description>

  <description>The world is changing. Markets have crashed. Jobs have disappeared. Industries have been disrupted and are being remade before our eyes. Everything we aspired to for "security," everything we thought was "safe," no longer is: College. Employment. Retirement. Government. It's all crumbling down. In every part of society, the middlemen are being pushed out of the picture. No longer is someone coming to hire you, to invest in your company, to sign you, to pick you. It's on you to make the most important decision in your life: Choose Yourself. New tools and economic forces have emerged to make it possible for individuals to create art, make millions of dollars and change the world without "help." More and more opportunities are rising out of the ashes of the broken system to generate real inward success (personal happiness and health) and outward success (fulfilling work and wealth). This book will teach you to do just that. With dozens of case studies, interviews and examples-including the author, investor and entrepreneur James Altucher's own heartbreaking and inspiring story-Choose Yourself illuminates your personal path to building a bright, new world out of the wreckage of the old.</description>

The Corrupted are everywhere, and only Alice can see them for what they truly are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book contains the first 3 episodes of the critically acclaimed series: Episode 1: Prince Charming Must Die!&lt;br&gt;Episode 2: Happily Never After&lt;br&gt;Episode 3: Revenge of the Castle Cats</description>

  <description>Legends linger in the dark places of this world, legends as old as fear itself. Deep within the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a series of macabre murders draws ever nearer to the isolated farmhouse where a lonely woman struggles to raise her strange, disturbed son. Does some ancient evil prowl the woods? The boy seems to be in league with a presence that makes itself felt in every rustle of wind, in every gleam of moonlight. As a wave of terrifying violence threatens to engulf them, the young mother must join with a group of demon hunters -- outcasts all -- in a battle for her own survival ... and for the life and soul of her son.</description>

  <description>On May 5, 1993, second-graders Christopher Byers, Stevie Branch, and Michael Moore disappeared from their West Memphis, Arkansas, homes. The following afternoon, their nude, beaten, and bound bodies were discovered in a drainage ditch less than a mile away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a troublesome confession, three local teenagers, later dubbed the “West Memphis Three,” were arrested, tried, and convicted in early 1994. Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley received life sentences, while ringleader Damien Echols went to death row. Three years later, the documentary film “Paradise Lost” premiered on HBO, and the effect on viewers was dramatic. Many became skeptical of the verdicts and also felt one of the fathers of the victims was a better suspect—John Mark Byers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Untying the Knot, author Greg Day tells the true story of John Mark Byers and the about-face he made to free the men convicted of the crime. Day exposes the propaganda campaign used to convince a gullible public that Byers was complicit in the deaths of his wife and son. Based on court transcripts and hours of personal interviews, Untying the Knot explores all the case evidence while interweaving dialogues and statements. It traces the life of Byers from his roots in rural Arkansas, to his son’s murder and the death of his wife, to his ultimate imprisonment in 1999. It reveals a man redeemed by prison and whose change of heart changed his life.</description>

  <description>People, young and old, are fascinated when they meet Betty Cranmer because she truly bubbles with joy. She does not have to share much of her life journey before listeners understand there is real depth here-love and loss, disappointment and darkness, battle and surrender. Also clearly present is grace and freedom and joy. Surviving World War II England as an air force nurse, leaving her homeland to enter a new life more foreign than she could imagine, finding new love and fulfillment, surrendering life and loved ones, only to arrive at fullness of joy-Betty's journey is a true triumph.</description>

  <description>"GREETINGS. THERE IS A BODY BURIED ON YOUR PROPERTY, COVERED IN YOUR BLOOD. THE UNFORTUNATE YOUNG LADY'S NAME IS RITA JONES. IN HER JEANS POCKET YOU'LL FIND A SLIP OF PAPER WITH A PHONE NUMBER ON IT. CALL THAT NUMBER. IF I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM YOU BY 8:00 P.M., THE POLICE WILL RECEIVE AN ANONYMOUS CALL. I'LL TELL THEM WHERE RITA JONES IS BURIED ON YOUR PROPERTY, HOW YOU KILLED HER, AND WHERE THE MURDER WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN YOUR HOUSE. (I DO BELIEVE A PARING KNIFE IS MISSING FROM YOUR KITCHEN.) I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST GOING TO THE POLICE, AS I AM ALWAYS WATCHING YOU." Andrew Z. Thomas is a successful writer of suspense thrillers, living the dream at his lake house in the piedmont of North Carolina. One afternoon in late spring, he receives a bizarre letter that eventually threatens his career, his sanity, and the lives of everyone he loves. A murderer is designing his future, and for the life of him, Andrew can't get away. About the Author: BLAKE CROUCH was born near the piedmont town of Statesville, North Carolina in 1978. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and graduated in 2000 with degrees in English and Creative Writing. Blake is the author of four novels and numerous short stories. He lives with his family in southwest Colorado, where he is at work on a new book. His website is &lt;a href="http://www.blakecrouch.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.blakecrouch.com&lt;/a&gt;. PRAISE FOR DESERT PLACES... Harrowing...terrific...a whacked out combination of Stephen King and Cormac McCarthy. PAT CONROY Crouch's smart, tight prose displays plenty of narrative energy...[he] shows real talent here... PUBLISHERS WEEKLY An ingenious, diabolical debut that calls into question all our easy moral assumptions. DESERT PLACES is a genuine thriller that pulses with adrenaline from start to finish. Blake Crouch is one of the most exciting new writers I've read in years. VAL MCDERMID DESERT PLACES is about survival, both emotional and physical. Crouch delivers his description of place with telling and vivid prose...[and his] carefully crafted characters make the story immediate, intense and thoroughly believable...will linger in the [reader's] consciousness long after the book is read. DENVER POST [T]he fastest, meanest read I've had in quite a while. Crouch clamps on and propels you forward, even though you're not at all sure you want to go into the disturbing places where he's taking you. THE CAPITAL TIMES Wow. Sometimes you stumble across a book that just plain creeps you out. There are many types of DESERT PLACES, and the most inhospitable are in the human heart. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NEWS [T]wisted...surprises around every turn...don't climb in if you have a heart condition, high blood pressure, might be pregnant, or are under four feet tall. IREDELL CITIZEN Crouch maintains a roller-coaster pace, with twists that leave you blinking. THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER [Crouch's] writing is sick, and I mean that in the very best way. If DESERT PLACES is any indication of what we can expect from Crouch in the future, be prepared to see his name on the bestseller lists. OTTAWA SUN This is a complex, cleverly constructed novel of motive, and Crouch takes his time bringing us through the story...it's a great debut. Crouch is an author to watch. THE GLOBE AND MAIL (TORONTO) Two hundred and eighty pages of pure, lean thriller...prose that's throat grabbing...Blake Crouch is a major league talent who's going to be really, really big. SARAH WEINMAN, Gumshoe-Award Winning Crime Columnist [C]arried by rich, image-filled prose. Crouch will handcuff you, blindfold you, throw you in the trunk of a car, and drag you kicking and screaming through a story so intense, so emotionally packed, that you will walk away stunned.

  <description>Foul-mouthed and heavily tattooed, former standup comic-turned-Lutheran pastor Nadia Bolz-Weber weaves hilarious rants and stunning theological insight into her personal narrative of a flawed, beautiful, and unlikely life of faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bizarre, rich, and remarkable, PASTRIX turns spiritual memoir on its ear in a sardonically irreverent and beautifully honest page-turner that readers will never forget. Nadia Bolz-Weber takes no prisoners as she reclaims the term pastrix (a negative term used by some Christians who refuse to recognize women as pastors) in this wildly entertaining and deeply resonant memoir about an outrageous, unlikely life of faith. From a commune of haggard-but-hopeful slackers to the wobbly chairs and war stories of Alcoholic Anonymous, from a funeral in a smoky downtown comedy club to an unexpected revelation during the Haitian stations of the cross, PASTRIX is a journey of cranky spirituality that intersects religion with real life, weaving incredible narrative, hilarious rants, and poignant honesty to portray a life deeply flawed and deeply faithful-giving hope to the rest of us.</description>

  <description>Mesmerizing and illuminating, Alice Hoffman's The Museum of Extraordinary Things is the story of an electric and impassioned love between two vastly different souls in New York during the volatile first decades of the twentieth century.&lt;br&gt;Coralie Sardie is the daughter of the sinister impresario behind The Museum of Extraordinary Things, a Coney Island boardwalk freak show that thrills the masses. An exceptional swimmer, Coralie appears as the Mermaid in her father's museum, alongside performers like the Wolfman, the Butterfly Girl, and a one-hundred-year-old turtle. &lt;br&gt;One night Coralie stumbles upon a striking young man taking pictures of moonlit trees in the woods off the Hudson River. The dashing photographer is Eddie Cohen, a Russian immigrant who has run away from his father's Lower East Side Orthodox community and his job as a tailor's apprentice. When Eddie photographs the devastation on the streets of New York following the infamous Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, he becomes embroiled in the suspicious mystery behind a young woman's disappearance and ignites the heart of Coralie.&lt;br&gt;With its colorful crowds of bootleggers, heiresses, thugs, and idealists, New York itself becomes a riveting character as Hoffman weaves her trademark magic, romance, and masterful storytelling to unite Coralie and Eddie in a sizzling, tender, and moving story of young love in tumultuous times. The Museum of Extraordinary Things is Alice Hoffman at her most spellbinding.</description>

  <description>What would you sacrifice for the people you love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;KATE AND ZOE met at nineteen when they both made the cut for the national training program in track cycling&amp;amp;#8212;a sport that demands intense focus, blinding exertion, and unwavering commitment. They are built to exploit the barest physical and psychological edge over equally skilled rivals, all of whom are fighting for the last one tenth of a second that separates triumph from despair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now at thirty-two, the women are facing their last and biggest race: the 2012 Olympics. Each wants desperately to win gold, and each has more than a medal to lose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate is the more naturally gifted, but the demands of her life have a tendency to slow her down. Her eight-year-old daughter Sophie dreams of the Death Star and of battling alongside the Rebels as evil white blood cells ravage her personal galaxy&amp;amp;#8212;she is fighting a recurrence of the leukemia that nearly killed her three years ago. Sophie doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t want to stand in the way of her mum&amp;amp;#8217;s Olympic dreams, but each day the dark forces of the universe seem to be massing against her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devoted and self-sacrificing Kate knows her daughter is fragile, but at the height of her last frenzied months of training, might she be blind to the most terrible prognosis? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intense, aloof Zoe has always hovered on the periphery of real human companionship, and her compulsive need to win at any cost has more than once threatened her friendship with Kate&amp;amp;#8212;and her own sanity. Will she allow her obsession, and the advantage she has over a harried, anguished mother, to sever the bond they have shared for more than a decade? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Echoing the adrenaline-fueled rush of a race around the Velodrome track, &lt;em&gt;Gold &lt;/em&gt;is a triumph of superbly paced, heart-in-throat storytelling. With great humanity and glorious prose, Chris Cleave examines the values that lie at the heart of our most intimate relationships, and the choices we make when lives are at stake and everything is on the line.</description>

  <description>This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative--like maybe someone who isn’t me wrote it--but I soon discovered that I’m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pictures&lt;br&gt;Words&lt;br&gt;Stories about things that happened to me&lt;br&gt;Stories about things that happened to other people because of me&lt;br&gt;Eight billion dollars*&lt;br&gt;Stories about dogs&lt;br&gt;The secret to eternal happiness*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!</description>

  <description>The Silver Star, Jeannette Walls has written a heartbreaking and redemptive novel about an intrepid girl who challenges the injustice of the adult world, a triumph of imagination and storytelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is 1970 in a small town in California. 'Bean' Holladay is twelve and her sister, Liz, is fifteen when their artistic mother, Charlotte, a woman who found something wrong with every place she ever lived, takes off to find herself, leaving her girls enough money to last a month or two. When Bean returns from school one day and sees a police car outside the house, she and Liz decide to take the bus to Virginia, where their Uncle Tinsley lives in the decaying mansion that's been in Charlotte's family for generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An impetuous optimist, Bean soon discovers who her father was, and hears many stories about why their mother left Virginia in the first place. Because money is tight, Liz and Bean start babysitting and doing office work for Jerry Maddox, foreman of the mill in town;a big man who bullies his workers, his tenants, his children, and his wife. Bean adores her whip-smart older sister;inventor of word games, reader of Edgar Allan Poe, nonconformist. But when school starts in the fall, it's Bean who easily adjusts and makes friends, and Liz who becomes increasingly withdrawn. And then something happens to Liz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeannette Walls, supremely alert to abuse of adult power, has written a deeply moving novel about triumph over adversity and about people who find a way to love each other and the world, despite its flaws and injustices.</description>

  <description>In many ways, the Browns are like any other middle-American family. They eat, play, and pray together, squabble and hug, striving to raise happy, well-adjusted children while keeping their relationship loving and strong. The difference is, there are five adults in the openly polygamous Brown marriage&amp;amp;#8212;Kody and his four wives&amp;amp;#8212;who among them have seventeen children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since TLC first launched its popular reality program Sister Wives, the Browns have become one of the most famous families in the country. Now Kody, Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn reveal in their own words exactly how their special relationship works&amp;amp;#8212;the love and faith that drew them together, the plusses and pitfalls of having sister wives, and the practical and emotional complications of a lifestyle viewed by many with distrust, prejudice, even fear. With the candor and frankness that have drawn millions to their show, they talk about what makes their fascinating family work, addressing the topics that intrigue outsiders: How do the four relationships differ? What effect does a polygamous upbringing have on their children? What are the challenges&amp;amp;#8212;emotional, social, or financial&amp;amp;#8212;involved in living this lifestyle? Is it possible for all four sister wives to feel special when sharing a husband&amp;amp;#8212;and what happens when jealousy arises? How has being on camera changed their lives? And what&amp;amp;#8217;s it like to add a new wife to the family&amp;amp;#8212;or to be that new wife? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with humor, warmth, surprising insights, and remarkable honesty, this is a singular story of plural marriage and all the struggles and joys that go with it. At heart, it&amp;amp;#8217;s a love story&amp;amp;#8212;unconventional but immediately recognizable in the daily moments of trust, acceptance, forgiveness, passion, and commitment that go into making one big, happy, extraordinary family.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;amp;#8217;t cross your eyes or they&amp;amp;#8217;ll stay like that!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feed a cold, starve a fever!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;amp;#8217;t touch your Halloween candy until we get it checked out!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never run with scissors&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;amp;#8217;t look in the microwave while it&amp;amp;#8217;s running!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will go down on your permanent record&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is any of it true? If so, how true? &lt;/strong&gt;Ken Jennings wants to find out if mother and father always know best. Yes, all those years you were told not to sit too close to the television (you&amp;amp;#8217;ll hurt your eyes!) or swallow your gum (it stays in your stomach for seven years!) or crack your knuckles (arthritis!) are called into question by our country&amp;amp;#8217;s leading trivia guru. Jennings separates myth from fact to debunk a wide variety of parental edicts: no swimming after meals, sit up straight, don&amp;amp;#8217;t talk to strangers, and so on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armed with medical case histories, scientific findings, and even the occasional experiment on himself (or his kids), Jennings exposes countless examples of parental wisdom run amok. Whether you&amp;amp;#8217;re a parent who wants to know what you can stop worrying about or a kid (of &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;age) looking to say, &amp;amp;#8220;I told you so,&amp;amp;#8221; this is the anti&amp;amp;#8211;helicopter parenting book you&amp;amp;#8217;ve been waiting for.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The most authoritative account ever written of how an ordinary juvenile delinquent named Charles Manson became the notorious murderer whose crimes still shock and horrify us today. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than forty years ago Charles Manson and his mostly female commune killed nine people, among them the pregnant actress Sharon Tate. It was the culmination of a criminal career that author Jeff Guinn traces back to Manson&amp;amp;#8217;s childhood. Guinn interviewed Manson&amp;amp;#8217;s sister and cousin, neither of whom had ever previously cooperated with an author. Childhood friends, cellmates, and even some members of the Manson Family have provided new information about Manson&amp;amp;#8217;s life. Guinn has made discoveries about the night of the Tate murders, answering unresolved questions, such as why one person on the property where the murders occurred was spared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manson&lt;/em&gt; puts the killer in the context of his times, the turbulent late sixties, an era of race riots and street protests when authority in all its forms was under siege. Guinn shows us how Manson created and refined his message to fit the times, persuading confused young women (and a few men) that he had the solutions to their problems. At the same time he used them to pursue his long-standing musical ambitions, relocating to Los Angeles in search of a recording contract. His frustrated ambitions, combined with his bizarre race-war obsession, would have lethal consequences as he convinced his followers to commit heinous murders on successive nights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to stunning revelations about Charles Manson, the book contains family photographs never before published.</description>

  <description>The sequel to the million-selling international hit Sh*t My Dad Says&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Human beings fear the unknown. So, whatever's freaking you out, grab it by the balls and say hello. Then it ain't the unknown anymore and it ain't scary. Or I guess it could be a sh*tload scarier’ Sam Halpern&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon after Sh*t My Dad Says began to take off, comic writer Justin Halpern decided to take the plunge and propose to his then girlfriend. But before doing so, he asked his dad's advice, which was very, very simple (and surprisingly clean): 'Just take a day to think about it.' This book is the story of that trip down memory lane, a toe-curlingly honest pilgrim’s progress of teenage relationships, sex and love by one of the funniest writers at work today.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;THE ULTIMATE QUEST FOR REDEMPTION &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On his eighteenth birthday, Aaron begins to hear strange voices and is convinced he is going insane. But having moved from foster home to foster home, Aaron doesn't know whom he can trust. He wants to confide in the cute girl from class, but fears she'll confirm he's crazy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then a mysterious man begins following Aaron. He knows about Aaron's troubled past and his new powers. And he has a message for Aaron: As the son of a mortal and an angel, Aaron has been chosen to redeem the Fallen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aaron tries to dismiss the news and resists his supernatural abilities. But he must accept his newfound heritage — and quickly. For the dark powers are gaining strength, and are hell-bent on destroying him....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Throughout my captivity, I was never told what was going to happen next or why. This lack of knowledge was used my Master to maintain a continuous element of fear and control over me. Anytime I was taken out of the box, I never knew what to expect. Fear of the unknown was always with me as I was kept in the dark both physically and mentally. This lack of knowledge may have been a good thing in one sense. If I had known the length of my entombment after returning from Riverside, I'm not sure I would have survived. Of course, I'm not sure even Master knew how long he was going to keep me in the box.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few days passed then a few more. Then weeks passed followed by months. Months slowly turned into years. I would spend the next three years of my life (1981-1984) in the box sleeping, dreaming, and praying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to assume my lengthy confinement in the box came about because Master was concerned he had given me too much freedom. Maybe he felt he was losing control of his slave. Too many neighbors had seen me, and questions about my status in the Hooker household were surely to arise. A fast thinking family member in Riverside may have copied down his vehicle tag number. What if the police knocked on his door on day looking for Colleen Stan? What if they searched the mobile home? Would anyone think to look under a waterbed for the girl in the box? Master wanted to keep me out of sight until the heat had passed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other reason for putting me into storage was Ma'am. I'm sure she wanted me out of her life, out of her children's lives, and out of her husband's life. Master was not ready to let his slave go. Cloistering was the only answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My daily routine soon became predictiveas I was allowed out late in the evening after the girls had gone to bed. I emptied my bedpan, drank a large glass of water, and ate cold leftovers in the front bathroom. Sometimes the leftovers were true leftovers that had been out all day and the family didn't want.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kristina Douglas’s sexy new series introduces a realm of fallen angels and ruthless demons, where an eternal rebellion is brewing . . . and one unsuspecting woman can change the fate of the Fallen forever.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She was just an ordinary mortal . . .&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re dead” is &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;not what Allie Watson wants to hear. Unfortunately, it explains a lot. Like the dark, angelically handsome man who ferried her to this strange, hidden land. The last thing she remembers is stepping off a curb in front of a crosstown bus. Now she’s surrounded by gorgeous fallen angels with an unsettling taste for blood—and they really don’t want her around. Not exactly how she pictured heaven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. . . until death catapulted her into a seductive world she never imagined.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raziel is unsure why he rescued Allie from hellfire against Uriel’s orders, but she stirs in him a longing he hasn't felt in centuries. Now the Fallen are bracing for the divine wrath brought by his disobedience, and they blame Allie for the ferocious Nephilim clawing at the kingdom’s shrouded gates. Facing impossible odds at every turn, the two must work together to survive. Raziel will do anything to defend his spirited lover against the forces of darkness—because Allie may be the Fallen’s only salvation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Shandee finds a friendly arm at a granite quarry. Ned drops down a hole in a golf course. Luna meets a man made of light bulbs at a tanning parlor. So begins Nicholson Baker&amp;amp;#8217;s fuse-blowing, sex-positive escapade, &lt;em&gt;House of Holes&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;amp;nbsp; Baker, the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Mezzanine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Fermata&lt;/em&gt;, who &amp;amp;#8220;writes like no one else in America&amp;amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;), returns to erotic territory with a gleefully over-the-top novel set in a pleasure resort, where normal rules don&amp;amp;#8217;t apply. Visitors, pulled in via their drinking straws or the dryers in laundromats, can undergo crotchal transfers . . . make love to trees . . . visit the Groanrooms and the twelve-screen Porndecahedron . . . or pussy-surf the White Lake. It&amp;amp;#8217;s very expensive, of course, but there are work-study programs. In charge of day-to-day operations is Lila, a former hospital administrator whose breast milk has unusual regenerative properties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brimful of good-nature, wit, and surreal sexual vocabulary, &lt;em&gt;House of Holes&lt;/em&gt; is a modern-day Hieronymous Boschian bacchanal that is sure to surprise, amuse, and arouse.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Sybil: a name that conjures up enduring fascination for legions of obsessed fans who followed the nonfiction blockbuster from 1973 and the TV movie based on it—starring Sally Field and Joanne Woodward—about a woman named Sybil with sixteen different personalities. &lt;em&gt;Sybil &lt;/em&gt;became both a pop phenomenon and a revolutionary force in the psychotherapy industry. The book rocketed multiple personality disorder (MPD) into public consciousness and played a major role in having the diagnosis added to the psychiatric bible, &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;p&gt;But what do we really know about how &lt;em&gt;Sybil &lt;/em&gt;came to be? In her news-breaking book &lt;em&gt;Sybil Exposed, &lt;/em&gt;journalist Debbie Nathan gives proof that the allegedly true story was largely fabricated. The actual identity of Sybil (Shirley Mason) has been available for some years, as has the idea that the book might have been exaggerated. But in &lt;em&gt;Sybil Exposed, &lt;/em&gt;Nathan reveals what really powered the legend: a trio of women—the willing patient, her ambitious shrink, and the imaginative journalist who spun their story into bestseller gold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From horrendously irresponsible therapeutic practices—Sybil’s psychiatrist often brought an electroshock machine to Sybil’s apartment and climbed into bed with her while administering the treatment— to calculated business decisions (under an entity they named Sybil, Inc., the women signed a contract designating a three-way split of profits from the book and its spin-offs, including board games, tee shirts, and dolls), the story Nathan unfurls is full of over-the-top behavior. Sybil’s psychiatrist, driven by undisciplined idealism and galloping professional ambition, subjected the young woman to years of antipsychotics, psychedelics, uppers, and downers, including an untold number of injections with Pentothal, once known as “truth serum” but now widely recognized to provoke fantasies. It was during these “treatments” that Sybil produced rambling, garbled, and probably “false-memory”–based narratives of the hideous child abuse that her psychiatrist said caused her MPD. &lt;em&gt;Sybil Exposed &lt;/em&gt;uses investigative journalism to tell a fascinating tale that reads like fiction but is fact. Nathan has followed an enormous trail of papers, records, photos, and tapes to unearth the lives and passions of these three women. The &lt;em&gt;Sybil &lt;/em&gt;archive became available to the public only recently, and Nathan examined all of it and provides proof that the story was an elaborate fraud—albeit one that the perpetrators may have half-believed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before &lt;em&gt;Sybil &lt;/em&gt;was published, there had been fewer than 200 known cases of MPD; within just a few years after, more than 40,000 people would be diagnosed with it. Set across the twentieth century and rooted in a time when few professional roles were available to women, this is a story of corrosive sexism, unchecked ambition, and shaky theories of psychoanalysis exuberantly and drastically practiced. It is the story of how one modest young woman’s life turned psychiatry on its head and radically changed the course of therapy, and our culture, as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A long lost letter arrives in the post and Edie Burchill finds herself on a journey to Milderhurst Castle, a great but moldering old house, where the Blythe spinsters live and where her mother was billeted 50 years before as a 13 year old child during WWII. The elder Blythe sisters are twins and have spent most of their lives looking after the third and youngest sister, Juniper, who hasn’t been the same since her fiance jilted her in 1941.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inside the decaying castle, Edie begins to unravel her mother’s past. But there are other secrets hidden in the stones of Milderhurst, and Edie is about to learn more than she expected. The truth of what happened in ‘the distant hours’ of the past has been waiting a long time for someone to find it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morton once again enthralls readers with an atmospheric story featuring unforgettable characters beset by love and circumstance and haunted by memory, that reminds us of the rich power of storytelling.</description>

  <description>On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester's Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener's hand is severed as "the dome" comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when -- or if -- it will go away.  &lt;p&gt; Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens -- town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician's assistant at the hospital, a select-woman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing -- even murder -- to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn't just short. It's running out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Daelyn Rice is broken beyond repair, and after a string of botched suicide attempts, she’s determined to get her death right. She starts visiting a website for “completers”— www. through-the-light.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she’s on the site, Daelyn blogs about her life, uncovering a history of bullying that goes back to kindergarten. When she’s not on the Web, Daelyn’s at her private school, where she’s known as the freak who doesn’t talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a boy named Santana begins to sit with her after school while she’s waiting to for her parents to pick her up. Even though she’s made it clear that she wants to be left alone, Santana won’t give up. And it’s too late for Daelyn to be letting people into her life... isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Book Award finalist Julie Anne Peters shines a light on how bullying can push young people to the very edge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Rachel gave up seeking a Master years ago. After a failed marriage and terrible tragedy, she's walled her soul against going down that dangerous path again. Then Jon joins her yoga class. He's thirteen years younger than she, but his Dominant nature threatens her shields from the moment she recognizes it. Not only does he understand what her body wants-he knows what her soul craves. Part of the five-man executive team of Kensington &amp;amp; Associates, Jon uses his calm, philosophical nature to defuse volatile acquisition negotiations. He can compel opponents to willingly surrender when he draws the sword that closes the deal. As a sexual Dominant, he employs that same expertise. A spiritually driven Master who enjoys connecting with a woman's soul, he wins her utter submission with his skills. But with Rachel, it goes beyond that. She's the submissive his own soul has always hungered to have, and he won't hesitate to use his talents, as well as that of the other four K&amp;amp;A men, to claim her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Not a great place to visit, and you wouldn't want to live there&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Monroes have gone on vacation, leaving Harold and Chester at Chateau Bow-Wow -- not exactly a four-star hotel. On the animals' very first night there, the silence is pierced by a peculiar wake-up call -- an unearthly howl that makes Chester observe that the place should be called Howliday Inn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But the mysterious cries in the night (Chester is convinced there are werewolves afoot) are just the beginning of the frightening goings-on. Soon animals start disappearing, and there are whispers of murder. Is checkout time at Chateau Bow-Wow going to come earlier than Harold and Chester anticipated?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you don't wake up. But if you happen to, you know things will never be the same.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three lives, three different paths to the same destination: Aspen Springs, a psychiatric hospital for those who have attempted the ultimate act -- suicide.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vanessa is beautiful and smart, but her secrets keep her answering the call of the blade.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tony, after suffering a painful childhood, can only find peace through pills.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Conner, outwardly, has the perfect life. But dig a little deeper and find a boy who is in constant battle with his parents, his life, himself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one instant each of these young people decided enough was enough. They grabbed the blade, the bottle, the gun -- and tried to end it all. Now they have a second chance, and just maybe, with each other's help, they can find their way to a better life -- but only if they're strong and can fight the demons that brought them here in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Lily Casey Smith, this novel's feisty Texas protagonist, is a frontier teacher, a rancher, a rodeo rider, a poker player, and bootlegger. In &lt;em&gt;Half Broke Horses,&lt;/em&gt; she survives droughts, tornados, floods, poverty, and whatever else fate can throw against her. Based on author Jeannette Walls's grandmother, Lily is a plausible character because she has a voice that synchronizes with her history. This novel lives up to the still gathering acclaim for Walls's novel &lt;em&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Narcissism &lt;/strong&gt;-- &lt;em&gt;a very positive and inflated view of the self&lt;/em&gt; -- is everywhere. It's what you have if you're a politician and you've strayed from your wife, and it's why five times as many Americans undergo plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures today than did just ten years ago. It's the value that parents teach their children with song lyrics like "I am special. Look at me," the skill teenagers and young adults obsessively hone on Facebook and MySpace, and the reason high school students physically beat classmates and then broadcast their violence on YouTube for all to see. It's the message preached by prosperity gospel and the vacuous ethos spread by celebrity newsmakers. And it's what's making people depressed, lonely, and buried under piles of debt.&lt;p&gt;Jean M. Twenge's influential and controversial first book, &lt;em&gt;Generation Me&lt;/em&gt;, generated a national debate with its trenchant depiction of the challenges twenty- and thirtysomethings face emotionally and professionally in today's world -- and the fallout these issues create for older generations as well as employers. Now, Dr. Twenge is on to a new incendiary topic that has repercussions for every age-group and class: the pernicious spread of narcissism in today's culture and its catastrophic effects. Dr. Twenge joins forces with W. Keith Campbell, Ph.D., a nationally recognized expert on narcissism, for &lt;em&gt;The Narcissism Epidemic&lt;/em&gt;, their eye-opening exposition of the alarming rise of narcissism -- and they show how to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, you encounter the real costs of narcissism: in your relationships and family, in the workplace and the economy at large, in schools that fail to teach necessary skills, in culture, and in politics. Even the world economy has been damaged by risky, unrealistic overconfidence. Filled with arresting anecdotes that illustrate the hold narcissism has on us today -- from people hiring fake paparazzi in order to experience feeling famous to college students who won't leave a professor's office until their B+ becomes an A -- &lt;em&gt;The Narcissism Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; is at once a riveting window into the consequences of narcissism, a probing analysis of the culture at large, and a prescription to combat the widespread problems caused by narcissism. As a society, we have a chance to slow the epidemic of narcissism once we learn to identify it, minimize the forces that sustain and transmit it, and treat it where we find it. Drawing on their own extensive research as well as decades of other experts' studies, Drs. Twenge and Campbell show us how.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Philippa Gregory presents the first of a new series set amid the deadly feuds of England known as the Wars of the Roses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brother turns on brother to win the ultimate prize, the throne of England, in this dazzling account of the wars of the Plantagenets. They are the claimants and kings who ruled England before the Tudors, and now Philippa Gregory brings them to life through the dramatic and intimate stories of the secret players: the indomitable women, starting with Elizabeth Woodville, the White Queen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The White Queen&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a woman of extraordinary beauty and ambition who, catching the eye of the newly crowned boy king, marries him in secret and ascends to royalty. While Elizabeth rises to the demands of her exalted position and fights for the success of her family, her two sons become central figures in a mystery that has confounded historians for centuries: the missing princes in the Tower of London whose fate is still unknown. From her uniquely qualified perspective, Philippa Gregory explores this most famous unsolved mystery of English history, informed by impeccable research and framed by her inimitable storytelling skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The White Queen&lt;/em&gt;, Philippa Gregory brings the artistry and intellect of a master writer and storyteller to a new era in history and begins what is sure to be another bestselling classic series from this beloved author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The man who revolutionized the way we think about baseball now examines our cultural obsession with murder&amp;amp;#8212;delivering a unique, engrossing, brilliant history of tabloid crime in America. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celebrated writer and contrarian Bill James has voraciously read true crime throughout his life and has been interested in writing a book on the topic for decades. Now, with &lt;em&gt;Popular Crime, &lt;/em&gt;James takes readers on an epic journey from Lizzie Borden to the Lindbergh baby, from the Black Dahlia to O. J. Simpson, explaining how crimes have been committed, investigated, prosecuted and written about, and how that has profoundly influenced our culture over the last few centuries&amp;amp;#8212; even if we haven&amp;amp;#8217;t always taken notice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exploring such phenomena as serial murder, the fluctuation of crime rates, the value of evidence, radicalism and crime, prison reform and the hidden ways in which crimes have shaped, or reflected, our society, James chronicles murder and misdeeds from the 1600s to the present day. James pays particular attention to crimes that were sensations during their time but have faded into obscurity, as well as still-famous cases, some that have never been solved, including the Lindbergh kidnapping, the Boston Strangler and JonBenet Ramsey. Satisfyingly sprawling and tremendously entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Popular Crime &lt;/em&gt;is a professed amateur&amp;amp;#8217;s powerful examination of the incredible impact crime stories have on our society, culture and history.</description>

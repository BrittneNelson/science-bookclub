  <description>In this brilliantly perceptive novel, a middle aged professor living in California is alienated from his students by differences in age and nationality, and from the rest of society by his homosexuality. Isherwood explores the depths of the human soul and its ability to triumph over loneliness, alienation and loss.</description>

  <description>In 1897, an aspiring politician is mysteriously murdered in the rural area of Alabama known as Mitcham Beat. His outraged friends -- —mostly poor cotton farmers -- form a secret society, Hell-at-the-Breech, to punish the townspeople they believe responsible. The hooded members wage a bloody year-long campaign of terror that culminates in a massacre where the innocent suffer alongside the guilty. Caught in the maelstrom of the Mitcham war are four people: the aging sheriff sympathetic to both sides; the widowed midwife who delivered nearly every member of Hell-at-the-Breech; a ruthless detective who wages his own war against the gang; and a young store clerk who harbors a terrible secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on incidents that occurred a few miles from the author's childhood home, &lt;em&gt;Hell at the Breech&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the events of dark days that led the people involved to discover their capacity for good, evil, or for both.</description>

  <description>Based on his own experience of the Great War, Henri Barbusse's novel is a powerful account of one of the greatest horrors mankind has inflicted on itself. For the group of ordinary men in the French Sixth Battalion, thrown together from all over France and longing for home, war is simply a matter of survival, lightened only by the arrival of their rations or a glimpse of a pretty girl or a brief reprieve in the hospital. Reminiscent of classics like Hemingway's &lt;em&gt;A Farewell to Arms&lt;/em&gt; and Remarque's &lt;em&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Under Fire&lt;/em&gt; (originally published in French as &lt;em&gt;La Feu&lt;/em&gt;) vividly evokes life in the trenches: the mud, stench, and monotony of waiting while constantly fearing for one's life in an infernal and seemingly eternal battlefield.&lt;br&gt;  </description>

  <description>Ethan Frome works his unproductive farm and struggles to maintain a bearable existence with his difficult, suspicious, and hypochondriac wife, Zeenie. But when Zeenie's vivacious cousin enters their household as a "hired girl", Ethan finds himself obsessed with her and with the possibilities for happiness she comes to represent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one of American fiction's finest and most intense narratives, Edith Wharton moves this ill-starred trio toward their tragic destinies. Different in both tone and theme from Wharton's other works, Ethan Frome has become perhaps her most enduring and most widely read novel.</description>

  <description>Baldwin's haunting and controversial second novel is his most sustained treatment of sexuality, and a classic of gay literature. In a 1950s Paris swarming with expatriates and characterized by dangerous liaisons and hidden violence, an American finds himself unable to repress his impulses, despite his determination to live the conventional life he envisions for himself. After meeting and proposing to a young woman, he falls into a lengthy affair with an Italian bartender and is confounded and tortured by his sexual identity as he oscillates between the two. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Examining the mystery of love and passion in an intensely imagined narrative, Baldwin creates a moving and complex story of death and desire that is revelatory in its insight.</description>

  <description>If Powers were an American writer of the nineteenth century he'd probably be the Herman Melville of Moby-Dick. His picture is that big," wrote Margaret Atwood (New York Review of Books). Indeed, since his debut in 1985 with Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance, Richard Powers has been astonishing readers with novels that are sweeping in range, dazzling in technique, and rich in their explorations of music, art, literature, and technology. In Orfeo, Powers tells the story of a man journeying into his past as he desperately flees the present. Composer Peter Els opens the door one evening to find the police on his doorstep. His home microbiology lab the latest experiment in his lifelong attempt to find music in surprising patterns has aroused the suspicions of Homeland Security. Panicked by the raid, Els turns fugitive. As an Internet-fueled hysteria erupts, Els the "Bioterrorist Bach" pays a final visit to the people he loves, those who shaped his musical journey. Through the help of his ex-wife, his daughter, and his longtime collaborator, Els hatches a plan to turn this disastrous collision with the security state into a work of art that will reawaken its audience to the sounds all around them. The result is a novel that soars in spirit and language by a writer who may be America s most ambitious novelist (Kevin Berger, San Francisco Chronicle).</description>

  <description>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     This is the twelfth expedition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Their group is made up of four women: an anthropologist; a surveyor; a psychologist, the de facto leader; and our narrator, a biologist. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers—they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding—but it’s the surprises that came across the border with them, and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another, that change everything.</description>

  <description>Denis Hillier is an aging British agent based in Yugoslavia. His old school friend Roper has defected to the USSR to become one of the evil empire's great scientific minds. Hillier must bring Roper back to England or risk losing his fat retirement bonus. As thoughtful as it is funny, this morality tale of a Secret Service gone mad features sex, gluttony, violence, treachery, and religion. Anthony Burgess's cast of astonishing characters includes Roper's German prostitute wife; Miss Devi and her Tamil love treatise; and the large Mr. Theodorescu, international secret monger and lascivious gourmand. A rare combination of the deadly serious and the absurd, the lofty and the lusty, Tremor of Intent will hold you in its thrall.</description>

&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the National Book Award for Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An American Library Association Notable Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonathan Franzen's third novel, &lt;em&gt;The Corrections&lt;/em&gt;, is a great work of art and a grandly entertaining overture to our new century: a bold, comic, tragic, deeply moving family drama that stretches from the Midwest at mid-century to Wall Street and Eastern Europe in the age of greed and globalism. Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy. With &lt;em&gt;The Corrections&lt;/em&gt;, Franzen emerges as one of our premier interpreters of American society and the American soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enid Lambert is terribly, terribly anxious. Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality.  Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts. More and more often, he doesn't seem to understand a word Enid says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble is also brewing in the lives of Enid's children. Her older son, Gary, a banker in Philadelphia, has turned cruel and materialistic and is trying to force his parents out of their old house and into a tiny apartment. The middle child, Chip, has suddenly and for no good reason quit his exciting job as a professor at D------ College and moved to New York City, where he seems to be pursuing a "transgressive" lifestyle and writing some sort of screenplay.  Meanwhile the baby of the family, Denise, has escaped her disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man--or so Gary hints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enid, who loves to have fun, can still look forward to a final family Christmas and to the ten-day Nordic Pleasurelines Luxury Fall Color Cruise that she and Alfred are about to embark on. But even these few remaining joys are threatened by her husband's growing confusion and unsteadiness. As Alfred enters his final decline, the Lamberts must face the failures, secrets, and long-buried hurts that haunt them as a family if they are to make the corrections that each desperately needs.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Color of Water &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Song Yet Sung &lt;/em&gt;comes the story of a young boy born a slave who joins John Brown’s antislavery crusade—and who must pass as a girl to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Henry Shackleford is a young slave living in the Kansas Territory in 1857, when the region is a battleground between anti- and pro-slavery forces. When John Brown, the legendary abolitionist, arrives in the area, an argument between Brown and Henry’s master quickly turns violent. Henry is forced to leave town—with Brown, who believes he’s a girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Over the ensuing months, Henry—whom Brown nicknames Little Onion—conceals his true identity as he struggles to stay alive. Eventually Little Onion finds himself with Brown at the historic raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859—one of the great catalysts for the Civil War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An absorbing mixture of history and imagination, and told with McBride’s meticulous eye for detail and character, &lt;em&gt;The Good Lord Bird &lt;/em&gt;is both a rousing adventure and a moving exploration of identity and survival.</description>

  <description>In the novels that make up the &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt;trilogy—&lt;em&gt;The 42nd Parallel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;1919&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Big Money&lt;/em&gt;—Dos Passos creates an unforgettable collective portrait of America, shot through with sardonic comedy and brilliant social observation. He interweaves the careers of his characters and the events of their time with a narrative verve and breathtaking technical skill that make &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; among the most compulsively readable of modern classics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A startling range of experimental devices captures the textures and background noises of 20th-century life: "Newsreels" with blaring headlines; autobiographical "Camera Eye" sections with poetic stream-of-consciousness; "biographies" evoking emblematic historical figures like J.P. Morgan, Henry Ford, John Reed, Frank Lloyd Wright, Thorstein Veblen, and the Unknown Soldier. Holding everything together is sheer storytelling power, tracing dozens of characters from the Spanish-American War to the onset of the Depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; trilogy is filled with American speech: labor radicals and advertising executives, sailors and stenographers, interior decorators and movie stars. Their crisscrossing destinies take in wars and revolutions, desperate love affairs and harrowing family crises, corrupt public triumphs and private catastrophes, in settings that include the trenches of World War I, insurgent Mexico, Hollywood studios in the silent era, Wall Street boardrooms, and the tumultuous streets of Boston just before the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti.</description>

  <description>Weary of her storybook, one "without pictures or conversations," the young and imaginative Alice follows a hasty hare underground--to come face-to-face with some of the strangest adventures and most fantastic characters in all of literature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ugly Duchess, the Mad Hatter, the weeping Mock Turtle, the diabolical Queen of Hearts, the Cheshire Cat--each more eccentric than the last--could only have come from that master of sublime nonsense, Lewis Carroll. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In penning this brilliant burlesque of children's literature, Carroll has written a farcical satire of rigid Victorian society, an arresting parody of the fears, anxieties, and complexities of growing up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carroll was one of the few adult writers to successfully enter the children's world of make-believe: where the impossible becomes possible, the unreal--real, and where the height of adventure is limited only by the depths of imagination.</description>

  <description>The year is 1878, peak of the Texas cattle trade. The place is Dodge City, Kansas, a saloon-filled cow town jammed with liquored-up adolescent cowboys and young Irish hookers. Violence is random and routine, but when the burned body of a mixed-blood boy named Johnnie Sanders is discovered, his death shocks a part-time policeman named Wyatt Earp. And it is a matter of strangely personal importance to Doc Holliday, the frail twenty-six-year-old dentist who has just opened an office at No. 24, Dodge House.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully educated, born to the life of a Southern gentleman, Dr. John Henry Holliday is given an awful choice at the age of twenty-two: die within months in Atlanta or leave everyone and everything he loves in the hope that the dry air and sunshine of the West will restore him to health. Young, scared, lonely, and sick, he arrives on the rawest edge of the Texas frontier just as an economic crash wrecks the dreams of a nation. Soon, with few alternatives open to him, Doc Holliday is gambling professionally; he is also living with Mária Katarina Harony, a high-strung Hungarian whore with dazzling turquoise eyes, who can quote Latin classics right back at him. Kate makes it her business to find Doc the high-stakes poker games that will support them both in high style. It is Kate who insists that the couple travel to Dodge City, because “that’s where the money is.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that is where the unlikely friendship of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp really begins—before Wyatt Earp is the prototype of the square-jawed, fearless lawman; before Doc Holliday is the quintessential frontier gambler; before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral links their names forever in American frontier mythology—when neither man wanted fame or deserved notoriety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authentic, moving, and witty, Mary Doria Russell’s fifth novel redefines these two towering figures of the American West and brings to life an extraordinary cast of historical characters, including Holliday’s unforgettable companion, Kate. First and last, however, &lt;em&gt;Doc &lt;/em&gt;is John Henry Holliday’s story, written with compassion, humor, and respect by one of our greatest contemporary storytellers. </description>

  <description>It was almost as if time had not touched the village of Cornwall Coombe. The quiet, peaceful place was straight out of a bygone era, with well-cared-for Colonial houses, a white-steepled church fronting a broad Common. Ned and Beth Constantine chanced upon the hamlet and immediately fell in love with it. This was exactly the haven they dream of. Or so they thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Ned and his family, Cornwall Coombe was to become a place of ultimate horror.</description>

  <description>Describes the author's experiences in Vietnam as a war correspondent for &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt; magazine. First published in 1977, &lt;em&gt;Dispatches&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first pieces of American literature that allowed Americans to understand the experiences of soldiers in the Vietnam War. At a time when many veterans would say little about their experiences during the war, &lt;em&gt;Dispatches&lt;/em&gt; allowed for an experience and understanding of the war like no other source to date. The book is noted for a visceral, literary style which distinguishes it from more mundane and accurate historical accounts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He seems to have brought to this book the ear of a musician and the eye of a painter . . . the premier war correspondence of Vietnam."--Washington Post. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The best book I have ever read on men and war in our time."--John le Carre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" . . . &lt;em&gt;Dispatches&lt;/em&gt; puts the rest of us in the shade."--Hunter S. Thompson.</description>

  <description>A new Sheriff Walt Longmire mystery from the author of the acclaimed "The Cold Dish" &lt;br&gt; With his debut novel, "The Cold Dish," Craig Johnson proved himself a strong new voice in the realm of literary mystery. In his newest work, Johnson again takes us to Sheriff Walt Longmire's Absaroka County, Wyoming. When Mari Baroja is found poisoned at the Durant Home for Assisted Living, Sheriff Longmire is drawn into an investigation of her death that proves to be as dramatic as her life. Her connections to the Basque community, the lucrative coal-bed methane industry, and the personal life of the previous sheriff, Lucian Connally, lead to a complex web of half-truths and assumed allegiances. As the specter of Mari's abusive husband arises, Sheriff Longmire, aided by his friend Henry Standing Bear, Deputy Victoria Moretti, and newcomer Santiago Saizarbitoria, must connect the past to the present to find the killer among them. "Death Without Company" is a riveting tale of the unspeakable viciousness that can lurk in the most beautiful and unlikely of places.</description>

  <description>Any book-length interview with Alfred Hitchcock is valuable, but considering that this volume's interlocutor is François Truffaut, the conversation is remarkable indeed. Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active, Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. It's difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock's art, interests, and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master's impressions of a classic like &lt;em&gt;Rear Window&lt;/em&gt; ("I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged"), his technical insight into &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt;'s shower scene ("the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]"), and his ruminations on flops such as &lt;em&gt;Under Capricorn&lt;/em&gt; ("If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!'"). This is one of the most delightful film books in print. &lt;em&gt;--Raphael Shargel&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Over Barbara Pym's 30-year writing career her primary subject was the intricate rituals of English life, which she observed with a sharp but understanding eye. Her novels now enjoy a devoted following and belated recognition as classics of the British comic novel. In &lt;em&gt;The Sweet Dove Died&lt;/em&gt;, first published in 1978, she sardonically uncovers the sometimes troubling truths behind relationships. A chance encounter over a Victorian flower book brings together Humphrey, an antique dealer, James, his nephew, and Leonora. Although she is considerably older, Leonora develops a fondness for James. She's determined to keep him under her spell, until she realizes that she has to contend with the bookish Phoebe. When Ned, a wicked young American, appears on the scene, the book begins to live up to its droll title, taken from John Keats. </description>

  <description>From the author of national bestseller Citizens of London comes a new book-this time set in America-that examines the years 1939 to 1941, as Hitler's troops overwhelmed Europe while the U.S. watched from the sidelines. In Those Angry Days, Lynne Olson describes the vicious internal struggle that tore the country apart as Americans fought over whether or not to join the war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lynne Olson's last book, Citizens of London, told the story of three prominent Americans who supported Britain during the dark early years of World War II when Britain alone in Europe held out against Hitler. Those Angry Days views these years of crisis from the American side, as the country divided into interventionist and isolation factions who fought in Washington, in the press, even in the streets to express their vehement convictions. Personifying this bitter struggle were FDR, in support of the British, and Charles Lindbergh, America's most outspoken isolationist. Their high-profile battles add to the drama and poignancy of this crucial two-year period of U.S. history.</description>

When Charles Arrowby, over sixty, a demi god of the theatre -- director, playwright and actor -- retires from his glittering London world in order to 'abjure magic and become a hermit', it is to the sea that he turns. He hopes at least to escape from 'the woman' -- but unexpectedly meets one whom he loved long ago. His buddhist cousin, James, also arrives. he is menaced by a monster from the deep. Charles finds his 'solitude' peopled by the drama of his own fantasies and obsessions.</description>

  <description>On the last night of 1937, twenty-five-year-old Katey Kontent is in a second-rate Greenwich Village jazz bar with her boardinghouse roommate stretching three dollars as far as it will go when Tinker Grey, a handsome banker with royal blue eyes and a tempered smile, happens to sit at the neighboring table. This chance encounter and its startling consequences propel Katey on a yearlong journey from a Wall Street secretarial pool toward the upper echelons of New York society and the executive suites of Condé Nast--rarefied environs where she will have little to rely upon other than a bracing wit and her own brand of cool nerve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wooed in turn by a shy, principled multi-millionaire and an irrepressible Upper East Side ne'er-do-well, befriended by a single-minded widow who is a ahead of her time,and challenged by an imperious mentor, Katey experiences firsthand the poise secured by wealth and station and the failed aspirations that reside just below the surface. Even as she waits for circumstances to bring Tinker back into her life, she begins to realize how our most promising choices inevitably lay the groundwork for our regrets.</description>

  <description>Thirty years after the Civil War's Battle of the Wilderness left him maimed, Abel Truman has found his way to the edge of the continent, the rugged, majestic coast of Washington State, where he lives alone in a driftwood shack with his beloved dog. &lt;em&gt;Wilderness&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Abel, now an old and ailing man, and his heroic final journey over the snowbound Olympic Mountains. It's a quest he has little hope of completing but still must undertake to settle matters of the heart that predate even the horrors of the war.As Abel makes his way into the foothills, the violence he endures at the hands of two thugs who are after his dog is crosscut with his memories of the horrors of the war, the friends he lost, and the savagery he took part in and witnessed. And yet, darkness is cut by light, especially in the people who have touched his life-from Jane Dao-Ming Poole, the daughter of murdered Chinese immigrants, to Hypatia, an escaped slave who nursed him back to life, and finally to the unbearable memory of the wife and child he lost as a young man. Haunted by tragedy, loss, and unspeakable brutality, Abel has somehow managed to hold on to his humanity, finding way stations of kindness along his tortured and ultimately redemptive path.In its contrasts of light and dark, wild and tame, brutal and tender, and its attempts to reconcile a horrific war with the great evil it ended, Wilderness tells not only the moving tale of an unforgettable character, but a story about who we are as human beings, a people, and a nation. Lance Weller's immensely impressive debut immediately places him among our most talented writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Gaslit London is brought to its knees in David Morrell's brilliant historical thriller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas De Quincey, infamous for his memoir &lt;em&gt;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, &lt;/em&gt;is the major suspect in a series of ferocious mass murders identical to ones that terrorized London forty-three years earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blueprint for the killings seems to be De Quincey's essay "On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts." Desperate to clear his name but crippled by opium addiction, De Quincey is aided by his devoted daughter Emily and a pair of determined Scotland Yard detectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Murder as a Fine Art,&lt;/em&gt; David Morrell plucks De Quincey, Victorian London, and the Ratcliffe Highway murders from history. Fogbound streets become a battleground between a literary star and a brilliant murderer, whose lives are linked by secrets long buried but never forgotten.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fifty years after its original publication, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catch-22 &lt;/em&gt;remains a cornerstone of American literature and one of the funniest—and most celebrated—novels of all time. In recent years it has been named to “best novels” lists by &lt;em&gt;Time, Newsweek, &lt;/em&gt;the Modern Library, and the London &lt;em&gt;Observer&lt;/em&gt;. Set in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy—it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. Since its publication in 1961, no novel has matched &lt;em&gt;Catch-22&lt;/em&gt;’s intensity and brilliance in depicting the brutal insanity of war. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; personal essays on the genesis of the novel by the author; a wealth of critical responses and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and a selection of advertisements from the original publishing campaign that helped turn &lt;em&gt;Catch-22 &lt;/em&gt;into a cultural phenomenon. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.</description>

  <description>The path to the throne is broken - only the broken may walk it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reach the throne requires that a man journey. Even a path paved with good intentions can lead to hell, and my intentions were never good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hundred converge for Congression to politic upon the corpse of Empire, and while they talk the Dead King makes his move, and I make mine. The world is cracked, time has run through, leaving us clutching at the end days, the future so bright that those who see it are the first to burn. These are the days that have waited for us all our lives. These are my days. I will stand before the Hundred and they will listen. I will take the throne whoever seeks to thwart me, living or dead, and if I must be the last emperor then I will make of it such an ending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is where the wise man turns away. This is where the holy kneel and call on God. These are the last miles, my brothers. Don't look to me to save you. Don't think I will not spend you. Run if you have the wit. Pray if you have the soul. Stand your ground if courage is yours. But don't follow me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow me, and I will break your heart.</description>

  <description>Watch a video&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read discussion questions for &lt;em&gt;The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Mayflower&lt;/em&gt; sheds new light on one of the iconic stories of the American West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custer's Last Stand, the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the Spartans' defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches the two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political savvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George Armstrong Custer, one of the Union's greatest cavalry officers and a man with a reputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand for the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the government's Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their ground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all the major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great Plains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. &lt;em&gt;The Last Stand&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that continues to haunt our collective imagination.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;That’s War&lt;/em&gt; is a diary of the authentic experiences of Lt. William Arthur Sirmon from January 1, 1918 to November 12, 1918. In this account of a regular soldier in the 82nd Division, 325th Infantry, you are led through ten chapters of a heartfelt, attention-grabbing journey. It starts out at Ft. Gordon, Georgia, where Sirmon was in charge of training soldiers. His story takes you across the beautiful, yet run down, terrain of France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William Arthur Sirmon spent more than four years prior to 1917 as an officer of the Philippine Constabulary, serving primarily in Mindanao, the “Island of Blood”. He was the most highly decorated soldier from Georgia, and it is believed, of the entire Great War. In February of 1919, only he and Sergeant Alvin York were awarded The Legion of Honor of France, Distinguished Service Cross and the Croix de Guerre with Palm by General Pershing. These accolades made him an honorary citizen of France.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This diary is not completely blood and guts, but surprisingly light for the most part. It describes the day-to-day life of typical American doughboys and the obstacles they faced through the entire war. &lt;em&gt;That’s War&lt;/em&gt; is a great read filled with excitement and humor, with education and entertainment throughout.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;In Harm's Way&lt;/em&gt; comes a true-life story of American soldiers overcoming great odds to achieve a stunning military victory.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horse Soldiers&lt;/em&gt; is the dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan following 9/11 and rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy across mountainous terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential if they were to defeat the Taliban. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators, and overjoyed Afghans thronged the streets. Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed. Dangerously outnumbered, they fought for their lives in the city's immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the effort to defeat the Taliban might be doomed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As the Americans struggled to hold the fortress, they faced some of the most intense urban warfare of our time. But until now the full story of the Horse Soldiers has never been told. Doug Stanton received unprecedented cooperation from the U.S. Army's Special Forces soldiers and Special Operations helicopter pilots, as well as access to voluminous after-battle reports. In addition, he interviewed more than one hundred participants and walked every inch of the climactic battleground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This exciting story is filled with unforgettable characters: brave Special Forces soldiers, tough CIA operatives, cunning Afghan warlords, anxious stateside soldiers' wives who do not know where their husbands have gone, and humble Afghan boys spying on the Taliban. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton's account of America's quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The Horse Soldiers combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat. Moreover, their careful effort to win the hearts of local townspeople and avoid civilian casualties proved a valuable lesson for America's ongoing efforts in Afghanistan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horse Soldiers&lt;/em&gt; is a big-hearted and thrilling read, with an epic story that reaches not just across the cold mountains of Afghanistan but into the homes of small-town America, and confirms Doug Stanton as one of our country's preeminent storytellers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Major New Translation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Red and the Black&lt;/strong&gt;, Stendhal’s masterpiece, is the story of Julien Sorel, a young dreamer from the provinces, fueled by Napoleonic ideals, whose desire to make his fortune sets in motion events both mesmerizing and tragic. Sorel’s quest to find himself, and the doomed love he encounters along the way, are delineated with an unprecedented psychological depth and realism. At the same time, Stendhal weaves together the social life and fraught political intrigues of post–Napoleonic France, bringing that world to unforgettable, full-color life. His portrait of Julien and early-nineteenth-century France remains an unsurpassed creation, one that brilliantly anticipates modern literature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neglected during its time, &lt;strong&gt;The Red and the Black&lt;/strong&gt; has assumed its rightful place as one of the world’s great books, and Burton Raffel’s extraordinary new translation, coupled with an enlightening Introduction by Diane Johnson, helps it shine more brightly than ever before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Frans Gunnar Bengtsson’s &lt;em&gt;The Long Ships&lt;/em&gt; resurrects the fantastic world of the tenth century AD when the Vikings roamed and rampaged from the northern fastnesses of Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean. Bengtsson’s hero, Red Orm—canny, courageous, and above all lucky—is only a boy when he is abducted from his Danish home by the Vikings and made to take his place at the oars of their dragon-prowed ships. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orm is then captured by the Moors in Spain, where he is initiated into the pleasures of the senses and fights for the Caliph of Cordova. Escaping from captivity, Orm washes up in Ireland, where he marvels at those epicene creatures, the Christian monks, and from which he then moves on to play an ever more important part in the intrigues of the various Scandinavian kings and clans and dependencies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, Orm contributes to the Viking defeat of the army of the king of England and returns home an off-the-cuff Christian and a very rich man, though back on his native turf new trials and tribulations will test his cunning and determination. Packed with pitched battles and blood feuds and told throughout with wit and high spirits, Bengtsson’s book is a splendid adventure that features one of the most unexpectedly winning heroes in modern fiction.</description>

  <description>One day you know more dead people that live ones...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jess Walter is a writer with a rare talent for finding humanity and emotional truths in lives lived on both sides of the law. With his third novel, &lt;em&gt;Citizen Vince,&lt;/em&gt; Walter has crafted a story as inventive as it is suspenseful -- an irresistible tale about the price of freedom and the mystery of salvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the fall of 1980, eight days before a presidential election that pits the downtrodden Jimmy Carter against the suspiciously sunny Ronald Reagan ("Are you better off than you were four years ago?"). In a quiet house in Spokane, Washington, Vince Camden wakes up at 1:59 a.m., pockets his weekly stash of stolen credit cards, and drops in on an all-night poker game with his low-life friends on his way to his witness-protection job dusting crullers at Donut Make You Hungry. This is the sum of Vince's new life: donuts, forged credit cards, marijuana smuggled in jars of volcanic ash, and a neurotic hooker girlfriend who dreams of being a real estate agent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a familiar face shows up in town, Vince realizes that no matter how far you think you've run from your past . . . it's always close behind you. Over the course of the next unforgettable week, on the run from Spokane to New York's Lower East Side, Vince Camden will negotiate a maze of obsessive cops, eager politicians, and emerging mobsters, only to find that redemption might just exist in -- of all places -- a voting booth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkly funny and surprisingly hopeful, &lt;em&gt;Citizen Vince&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a charming crook chasing the biggest score of his life: a second chance.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Following the success of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Ghost Train to the Eastern Star&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Great Railway Bazaar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Last Train to Zona Verde&lt;/em&gt; is an ode to the last African journey of the world's most celebrated travel writer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Happy again, back in the kingdom of light,” writes Paul Theroux as he sets out on a new journey through the continent he knows and loves best. Theroux first came to Africa as a twenty-two-year-old Peace Corps volunteer, and the pull of the vast land never left him. Now he returns, after fifty years on the road, to explore the little-traveled territory of western Africa and to take stock both of the place and of himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His odyssey takes him northward from Cape Town, through South Africa and Namibia, then on into Angola, wishing to head farther still until he reaches the end of the line. Journeying alone through the greenest continent, Theroux encounters a world increasingly removed from both the itineraries of tourists and the hopes of postcolonial independence movements. Leaving the Cape Town townships, traversing the Namibian bush, passing the browsing cattle of the great sunbaked heartland of the savanna, Theroux crosses “the Red Line” into a different Africa: “the improvised, slapped-together Africa of tumbled fences and cooking fires, of mud and thatch,” of heat and poverty, and of roadblocks, mobs, and anarchy. After 2,500 arduous miles, he comes to the end of his journey in more ways than one, a decision he chronicles with typically unsparing honesty in a chapter called “What Am I Doing Here?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivid, witty, and beautifully evocative, &lt;em&gt;The Last Train to Zona Verde&lt;/em&gt; is a fitting final African adventure from the writer whose gimlet eye and effortless prose have brought the world to generations of readers.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Lucifer's War, which damned legions of angels to Hell, is an ancient and bitter memory shrouded in the smoke and ash of the Inferno. The Fallen, those banished demons who escaped the full wrath of Heaven, have established a limitless and oppressive kingdom within the fiery confines of Hell. Lucifer has not been seen since the Fall and the mantle of rulership has been passed to the horrific Prince Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Demons Major, Heaven's former warriors, have become the ruling class. They are the equivalent to landed lords, each owing allegiance to the de facto ruler of Hell. They reign over their fiefdoms, tormenting the damned souls and adding to their wealth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One Demon Major, however, who has not forgotten his former life in Heaven. The powerful Lord Sargatanas is restless. For millennia Sargatanas has ruled dutifully but unenthusiastically, building his city, Adamantinarx, into the model of an Infernal metropolis. But he has never forgotten what he lost in the Fall--proximity to God. He is sickened by what he has become.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Now, with a small event--a confrontation with one of the damned souls--he makes a decision that will reverberate through every being in Hell. Sargatanas decides to attempt the impossible, to rebel, to endeavor to go Home and bring with him &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; who chooses to follow . . . be they demon or soul. He will stake everything on this chance for redemption.</description>

  <description>Zombies have infested a fallen America. A young girl named Temple is on the run. Haunted by her past and pursued by a killer, Temple is surrounded by death and danger, hoping to be set free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty-five years, civilization has survived in meager enclaves, guarded against a plague of the dead. Temple wanders this blighted landscape, keeping to herself and keeping her demons inside her heart. She can't remember a time before the zombies, but she does remember an old man who took her in and the younger brother she cared for until the tragedy that set her on a personal journey toward redemption. Moving back and forth between the insulated remnants of society and the brutal frontier beyond, Temple must decide where ultimately to make a home and find the salvation she seeks.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The transmutation of sensation into sentiment, the ebb tide of memory, waves of emotion such as desire, jealousy, and artistic euphoria--this is the material of this enormous and yet singularly light and translucid work. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--VLADIMIR NABOKOV &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the overture to &lt;em&gt;Swann's Way&lt;/em&gt;, the themes of the whole of &lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time&lt;/em&gt; are introduced, and the narrator's childhood in Paris and Combray is recalled, most  memorably in the evocation of the famous maternal good-night kiss. The  recollection of the narrator's love for Swann's daughter Gilberte leads to an account  of Swann's passion for Odette and the rise of the nouveaux riches Verdurins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final volume of a new, definitive text of &lt;em&gt;A la recherche du temps perdu&lt;/em&gt; was published by the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade in 1989. For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin's acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff's translation to take into account the new French editions.</description>

  <description>Alexander the Great, perhaps the most commanding leader in history, united his empire and his army by the titanic force of his will. His death at the age of thirty-two spelled the end of that unity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story of Alexander’s conquest of the Persian empire is known to many readers, but the dramatic and consequential saga of the empire’s collapse remains virtually untold. It is a tale of loss that begins with the greatest loss of all, the death of the Macedonian king who had held the empire together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his demise, it was as if the sun had disappeared from the solar system, as if planets and moons began to spin crazily in new directions, crashing into one another with unimaginable force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexander bequeathed his power, legend has it, “to the strongest,” leaving behind a mentally damaged half brother and a posthumously born son as his only heirs. In a strange compromise, &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; figures—Philip III and Alexander IV—were elevated to the kingship, quickly becoming prizes, pawns, fought over by a half-dozen Macedonian generals. Each successor could confer legitimacy on whichever general controlled him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the book’s center is the monarch’s most vigorous defender; Alexander’s former Greek secretary, now transformed into a general himself. He was a man both fascinating and entertaining, a man full of tricks and connivances, like the enthroned ghost of Alexander that gives the book its title, and becomes the determining factor in the precarious fortunes of the royal family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James Romm, brilliant classicist and storyteller, tells the galvanizing saga of the men who followed Alexander and found themselves incapable of preserving his empire. The result was the undoing of a world, formerly united in a single empire, now ripped apart into a nightmare of warring nation-states struggling for domination, the template of our own times.</description>

  <description>With his U.S.A. trilogy, comprising THE 42nd PARALLEL, 1919, and THE BIG MONEY, John Dos Passos is said by many to have written the great American novel. While Fitzgerald and Hemingway were cultivating what Edmund Wilson once called their "own little corners," John Dos Passos was taking on the world. Counted as one of the best novels of the twentieth century by the Modern Library and by some of the finest writers working today, U.S.A. is a grand, kaleidoscopic portrait of a nation, buzzing with history and life on every page. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trilogy opens with THE 42nd PARALLEL, where we find a young country at the dawn of the twentieth century. Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold. Mac, Janey, Eleanor, Ward, and Charley are caught on the storm track of this parallel and blown New Yorkward. As their lives cross and double back again, the likes of Eugene Debs, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Carnegie make cameo appearances.</description>

  <description>Lincoln is the cornerstone of Gore Vidal's fictional American chronicle, which includes Burr, 1876, Washington, D.C., Empire &amp;amp; Hollywood. It opens early on a frozen winter morning in 1861, when President-elect Abraham Lincoln slips into Washington, flanked by two bodyguards. The future president is in disguise, for there's talk of a plot to murder him. During the next four years there will be numerous plots to murder this man who has sworn to unite a disintegrating nation. Isolated in a ramshackle White House in the center of a proslavery city, Lincoln presides over a fragmenting government as Lee's armies beat at the gates. In this profoundly moving novel, a work of epic proportions &amp;amp; intense human sympathy, Lincoln is observed by his loved ones &amp;amp; his rivals. The cast of characters is almost Dickensian: politicians, generals, White House aides, newspapermen, Northern &amp;amp; Southern conspirators, amiably evil bankers &amp;amp; a wife slowly going mad. Vidal's portrait of the president is at once intimate &amp;amp; monumental, stark &amp;amp; complex, drawn with the wit, grace &amp;amp; authority of one of the great historical novelists.</description>

  <description>In Sicily in 1860, as Italian unification grows inevitable, the smallest of gestures seems dense with meaning and melancholy, sensual agitation and disquiet: "Some huge irrational disaster is in the making." All around him, the prince, Don Fabrizio, witnesses the ruin of the class and inheritance that already disgust him. His favorite nephew, Tancredi, proffers the paradox, "If we want things to stay as they are, they will have to change," but Don Fabrizio would rather take refuge in skepticism or astronomy, "the sublime routine of the skies."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giuseppe di Lampedusa, also an astronomer and a Sicilian prince, was 58 when he started to write The Leopard, though he had had it in his mind for 25 years. E. M. Forster called his work "one of the great lonely books." What renders it so beautiful and so discomfiting is its creator's grasp of human frailty and, equally, of Sicily's arid terrain--"comfortless and irrational, with no lines that the mind could grasp, conceived apparently in a delirious moment of creation; a sea suddenly petrified at the instant when a change of wind had flung waves into frenzy." The author died at the age of 60, soon after finishing The Leopard, though he did live long enough to see it rejected as unpublishable.</description>

  <description>In J. L. Carr's deeply charged poetic novel, Tom Birkin, a veteran of the Great War and a broken marriage, arrives in the remote Yorkshire village of Oxgodby where he is to restore a recently discovered medieval mural in the local church. Living in the bell tower, surrounded by the resplendent countryside of high summer, and laboring each day to uncover an anonymous painter's depiction of the apocalypse, Birkin finds that he himself has been restored to a new, and hopeful, attachment to life. But summer ends, and with the work done, Birkin must leave. Now, long after, as he reflects on the passage of time and the power of art, he finds in his memories some consolation for all that has been lost.</description>

  <description>Willie Sutton was born in the squalid Irish slums of Brooklyn, in the first year of the twentieth century, and came of age at a time when banks were out of control. If they weren't failing outright, causing countless Americans to lose their jobs and homes, they were being propped up with emergency bailouts. Trapped in a cycle of panics, depressions and soaring unemployment, Sutton saw only one way out, only one way to win the girl of his dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So began the career of America's most successful bank robber. Over three decades Sutton became so good at breaking into banks, and such a master at breaking out of prisons, police called him one of the most dangerous men in New York, and the FBI put him on its first-ever Most Wanted List.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the public rooted for Sutton. He never fired a shot, after all, and his victims were merely those bloodsucking banks. When he was finally caught for good in 1952, crowds surrounded the jail and chanted his name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending vast research with vivid imagination, Pulitzer Prize winner J.R. Moehringer brings Willie Sutton blazing back to life. In Moehringer's retelling, it was more than poverty or rage at society that drove Sutton. It was one unforgettable woman. In all Sutton's crimes and confinements, his first love (and first accomplice) was never far from his thoughts. And when Sutton finally walked free - a surprise pardon on Christmas Eve, 1969 - he immediately set out to find her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poignant, comic, fast-paced and fact-studded, Sutton tells a story of economic pain that feels eerily modern, while unfolding a story of doomed love that is forever timeless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(overview via Barnes and Noble)</description>

  <description>Tautly narrated and excruciatingly suspenseful, &lt;strong&gt;Double Indemnity&lt;/strong&gt; gives us an X-ray view of guilt, of duplicity, and of the kind of obsessive, loveless love that devastates everything it touches. First published in 1935, this novel reaffirmed James M. Cain as a virtuoso of the &lt;em&gt;roman noir&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Nobel Prize–winning author José Saramago, a magnificent, mesmerizing parable of loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A city is hit by an epidemic of "white blindness" that spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides her charges—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and their procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. As &lt;em&gt;Blindness&lt;/em&gt; reclaims the age-old story of a plague, it evokes the vivid and trembling horrors of the twentieth century, leaving readers with a powerful vision of the human spirit that's bound both by weakness and exhilarating strength.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The second book in the Broken Empire series, Lawrence takes his young anti-hero one step closer to his grand ambition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To reach greatness you must step on bodies, and many brothers lie trodden in my wake. I’ve walked from pawn to player and I’ll win this game of ours, though the cost of it may drown the world in blood…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The land burns with the fires of a hundred battles as lords and petty kings fight for the Broken Empire. The long road to avenge the slaughter of his mother and brother has shown Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath the hidden hands behind this endless war. He saw the game and vowed to sweep the board. First though he must gather his own pieces, learn the rules of play, and discover how to break them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A six nation army, twenty thousand strong, marches toward Jorg's gates, led by a champion beloved of the people. Every decent man prays this shining hero will unite the empire and heal its wounds. Every omen says he will. Every good king knows to bend the knee in the face of overwhelming odds, if only to save their people and their lands. But King Jorg is not a good king.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faced by an enemy many times his strength Jorg knows that he cannot win a fair fight. But playing fair was never part of Jorg’s game plan.</description>

  <description>We’ve all been around a couple who can engulf the attention of an entire room merely by occupying it. Harry and Madeleine Winslow are that set; the natural ease between them is palpable and their chemistry is almost tangible. He is a recent National Book Award winner with a promising career ahead of him, and she is blessed with family money, but radiates beauty, elegance, and humility. Whether they are abroad in Italy after he receives the Rome Prize, in their ambrosial East Hampton home, or in gritty Manhattan, they are always surrounded by close friends and those who wish to penetrate their inner circle. During a summer spent at the beach, they meet 26 year-old Claire and, as the summer blazes on, she is slowly inducted into their world. Claire can’t help but fall in love with Harry and Maddy and at the end of the summer, it is no longer enough to just be one of their hangers-on. Told through the omniscient eyes of Maddy’s childhood friend Walter, Indiscretion is a juicy, page turning novel with writing that is sophisticated and lyrical. Deeply textured, full of light and darkness, and overwhelmingly sensual, this book will be the sexiest, most intimate story you read all year.</description>

  <description>This tale of a troubled man hired to care for a remote mountain resort over the winter, his loyal wife, and their uniquely gifted son slowly but steadily unfolds as secrets from the Overlook Hotel's past are revealed, and the hotel itself attempts to claim the very souls of the Torrance family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shining stands as a cultural icon of modern horror, a searing study of a family torn apart, and a nightmarish glimpse into the dark recesses of human weakness and dementia.</description>

  <description>In this outstanding first novel, Craig Johnson draws on his background in law enforcement and his deep attachment to the American West to produce a literary mystery of stunning authenticity, and full of memorable characters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Walt Longmire, sheriff of Wyoming's Absaroka County, knows he's got trouble when Cody Pritchard is found dead. Two years earlier, Cody and three accomplices had been given suspended sentences for raping a Northern Cheyenne girl. Is someone seeking vengeance? Longmire faces one of the more volatile and challenging cases in his twenty-four years as sheriff and means to see that revenge, a dish that is best served cold, is never served at all.</description>

  <description>Six months after her husband's sudden death, Leonora Galloway sets off for a holiday in Paris with her daughter Penelope. At last the time has come when secrets can be shared and explanations begin... Their journey starts with an unscheduled stop at the imposing Thiepval Memorial to the dead of the Battle of the Somme near Amiens. Amongst those commemorated is Leonora's father. The date of his death is recorded as 30th April, 1916. But Leonora wasn't born until 14th March 1917. Penelope at once supposes a simple wartime illegitimacy as the clue to her mother's unhappy childhood and the family's sundered connections with her aristocratic heritage, about which she has always known so little. But nothing could have prepared her, or the reader, for the extraordinary story that is about to unfold.</description>

  <description>Few novels of the last ten years have stirred up so much partisanship and violent controversy as Arthur Koestler's &lt;em&gt;Darkness at Noon&lt;/em&gt;. Its champions have proclaimed it as a penetrating study of revolutionary psychology and the compulsions which lead to the catharsis of confession; its adversaries, first to admit its overwhelming power, attack it on the ground of its political implications. Both agree that Arthur Koestler is a novelist of the foremost rank and a man with the courage of his strong and brilliant convictions.</description>

  <description>Ben Davenant is a merchant mariner, rebel, drifter, a man who takes love and life as it comes and wants no part of the world.  During the war, the world returns the favor.  When his ship is blown up in the South Pacific, Ben is stripped of every shred of his personal identity--his face, his name, his fingerprints--and cast into the sea like a piece of wreckage.  Rescued almost against his will, Ben must at last choose who and what he wants to be.  But it is a choice he refuses to make until a dark-haired woman walks into his hospital room and says that he is her husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MacDonald Harris has written a provocative novel, a wry narrative that moves with the exciting power of an adventure story.  In scenes that range from waterfront bars and brothels to the rarefied atmosphere of the California gold coast, he creates men and women who vibrate with a life uniquely their own.  His compelling story of a man's triumphant search for something or someone to care about evokes the humor, the sadness and the absurdity of a world that we all must somehow survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;“A unique crime writer whose fictional world was brutal, realistic and harrowing in the extreme.”—&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;When a middle-aged alcoholic is found brutally battered to death on a roadside in West London, the case is assigned to a tough-talking cynic from the Department of Unexplained Deaths. Our narrator must piece together the history of his blighted existence and discover the agents of its cruel end. What he doesn’t expect is that digging for the truth will demand plenty of lying. The first volume in the Factory series, &lt;em&gt;He Died with His Eyes Open&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping introduction to Raymond’s bleak, nihilistic world.</description>

  <description>Intense, powerful, and compelling, &lt;em&gt;Matterhorn&lt;/em&gt; is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer’s &lt;em&gt;The Naked and the Dead&lt;/em&gt; and James Jones’s &lt;em&gt;The Thin Red Line&lt;/em&gt;. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written by a highly decorated Marine veteran over the course of thirty years, &lt;em&gt;Matterhorn&lt;/em&gt; is a spellbinding and unforgettable novel that brings to life an entire world—both its horrors and its thrills—and seems destined to become a classic of combat literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Featuring George Smiley, this &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller is the first installment in John le Carré’s acclaimed Karla Trilogy. From the author of &lt;em&gt;A Delicate Truth &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The man he knew as "Control" is dead, and the young Turks who forced him out now run the Circus. But George Smiley isn't quite ready for retirement—especially when a pretty, would-be defector surfaces with a shocking accusation: a Soviet mole has penetrated the highest level of British Intelligence. Relying only on his wits and a small, loyal cadre, Smiley recognizes the hand of Karla—his Moscow Centre nemesis—and sets a trap to catch the traitor.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; The Oscar-nominated feature film adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&lt;/em&gt; is directed by Tomas Alfredson (&lt;em&gt;Let the Right One In&lt;/em&gt;) and features Gary Oldman as Smiley, Academy Award winner Colin Firth (&lt;em&gt;The King's Speech&lt;/em&gt;), and Tom Hardy (&lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; With an introduction by the author.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The captivating return of Yashim, the eunuch investigator from the intelligent, elliptical and beguilingly written" &lt;/em&gt;(The Times, London)&lt;em&gt; bestseller&lt;/em&gt; The Janissary Tree&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a French archaeologist arrives in 1830s Istanbul determined to track down a lost Byzantine treasure, the local Greek communities are uncertain how to react; the man seems dangerously well informed. Yashim Togalu, who so brilliantly solved the mysterious murders in &lt;em&gt;The Janissary Tree&lt;/em&gt;, is once again enlisted to investigate. But when the archaeologist’s mutilated body is discovered outside the French embassy, it turns out there is only one suspect: Yashim himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;celebrated &lt;em&gt;The Janissary Tree &lt;/em&gt;as “the perfect escapist mystery,” and &lt;em&gt;The Daily Telegraph &lt;/em&gt;called it “[A] tremendous first novel . . . Beautifully written, perfectly judged, humane, witty and captivating.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Snake Stone&lt;/em&gt;, Jason Goodwin delights us with another transporting romp through the back streets of nineteenth-century Istanbul. Yashim finds himself racing against time once again, to uncover the startling truth behind a shadowy society dedicated to the revival of the Byzantine Empire, encountering along the way such vibrant characters as Lord Byron’s doctor and the sultan’s West Indies–born mother, the Valide. Armed only with a unique sixteenth-century book, the dashing eunuch leads us into a world where the stakes are high, betrayal is death—and the pleasure to the reader is immense.</description>

  <description>Set at a boys' boarding school in New England during the early years of World War II, &lt;em&gt;A Separate Peace&lt;/em&gt; is a harrowing and luminous parable of the dark side of adolescence. Gene is a lonely, introverted intellectual. Phineas is a handsome, taunting, daredevil athlete. What happens between the two friends one summer, like the war itself, banishes the innocence of these boys and their world.  &lt;p&gt; A bestseller for more than thirty years, &lt;em&gt;A Separate Peace&lt;/em&gt; is John Knowles's crowning achievement and an undisputed American classic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On November 15, 1959, in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were savagely murdered by blasts from a shotgun held a few inches from their faces. There was no apparent motive for the crime, and there were almost no clues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Truman Capote reconstructs the murder and the investigation that led to the capture, trial, and execution of the killers, he generates both mesmerizing suspense and astonishing empathy. &lt;em&gt;In Cold Blood&lt;/em&gt; is a work that transcends its moment, yielding poignant insights into the nature of American violence.</description>

  <description>Winner of the 1947 Pulitzer Prize, All the King's Men is one of the most famous and widely read works in American fiction. Its original publication by Harcourt catapulted author Robert Penn Warren to fame and made the novel a bestseller for many seasons. Set in the 1930s, it traces the rise and fall of demagogue Willie Stark, a fictional Southern politician who resembles the real-life Huey "Kingfish" Long of Louisiana. Stark begins his career as an idealistic man of the people, but he soon becomes corrupted by success, caught between dreams of service and a lust for power.</description>

  <description>Suttree is the story of Cornelius Suttree, who has forsaken a life of privilege with his prominent family to live in a dilapidated houseboat on the Tennessee River near Knoxville.  Remaining on the margins of the outcast community there--a brilliantly imagined collection of eccentrics, criminals, and squatters--he rises above the physical and human squalor with detachment, humor, and dignity.</description>

  <description>"To call Going After Cacciato a novel about war is like calling Moby-Dick a novel about whales."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So wrote the New York Times of Tim O'Brien's now classic novel of Vietnam. Winner of the 1979 National Book Award, Going After Cacciato captures the peculiar mixture of horror and hallucination that marked this strangest of wars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a blend of reality and fantasy, this novel tells the story of a young soldier who one day lays down his rifle and sets off on a quixotic journey from the jungles of Indochina to the streets of Paris. In its memorable evocation of men both fleeing from and meeting the demands of battle, Going After Cacciato stands as much more than just a great war novel. Ultimately it's about the forces of fear and heroism that do battle in the hearts of us all.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;New in Paperback&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A postmodern literary masterpiece.” –&lt;em&gt;The Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two hundred years after civilization ended in an event known as the Blast, Benedikt isn’t one to complain. He’s got a job—transcribing old books and presenting them as the words of the great new leader, Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe—and though he doesn’t enjoy the privileged status of a Murza, at least he’s not a serf or a half-human four-legged Degenerator harnessed to a troika. He has a house, too, with enough mice to cook up a tasty meal, and he’s happily free of mutations: no extra fingers, no gills, no cockscombs sprouting from his eyelids. And he’s managed—at least so far—to steer clear of the ever-vigilant Saniturions, who track down anyone who manifests the slightest sign of Freethinking, and the legendary screeching Slynx that waits in the wilderness beyond.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Tatyana Tolstaya’s &lt;em&gt;The Slynx&lt;/em&gt; reimagines dystopian fantasy as a wild, horripilating amusement park ride. Poised between Nabokov’s &lt;em&gt;Pale Fire&lt;/em&gt; and Burgess’s &lt;em&gt;A Clockwork Orange&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Slynx&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliantly inventive and shimmeringly ambiguous work of art: an account of a degraded world that is full of echoes of the sublime literature of Russia’s past; a grinning portrait of human inhumanity; a tribute to art in both its sovereignty and its helplessness; a vision of the past as the future in which the future is now.</description>

  <description>Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, &lt;em&gt;On the Nature of Things&lt;/em&gt;, by Lucretius—a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The copying and translation of this ancient book—the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age—fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the Modern Library’s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner—also available are &lt;em&gt;Snopes, As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Selected Short Stories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First published in 1936, &lt;em&gt;Absalom, Absalom!&lt;/em&gt; is William Faulkner’s ninth novel and one of his most admired. It tells the story of Thomas Sutpen and his ruthless, single-minded attempt to forge a dynasty in Jefferson, Mississippi, in 1830. Although his grand design is ultimately destroyed by his own sons, a century later the figure of Sutpen continues to haunt young Quentin Compson, who is obsessed with his family legacy and that of the Old South. “Faulkner’s novels have the quality of being lived, absorbed, remembered rather than merely observed,” noted Malcolm Cowley. “&lt;em&gt;Absalom, Absalom!&lt;/em&gt; is structurally the soundest of all the novels in the Yoknapatawpha series—and it gains power in retrospect.” This edition follows the text of &lt;em&gt;Absalom, Absalom! &lt;/em&gt;as corrected in 1986 under the direction of Faulkner expert Noel Polk and features a new Foreword by John Jeremiah Sullivan.</description>

  <description>Tony Chu is a detective with a secret. A weird secret. Tony Chu is cibopathic, which means he gets psychic impressions from whatever he eats. It also means he's a hell of a detective - as long as he doesn't mind nibbling on the corpse of a murder victim to figure out whodunit and why. He's been brought on by the Special Crimes Division of the FDA, the most powerful law enforcement agency on the planet, to investigate their strangest, sickest and most bizarre cases. This gorgeous, oversized edition loaded with extras follows Tony for the first ten issues of IGN.com's pick for "Best Indie Series of 2009," and MTV Splash Page's "Best New Series of 2009." Collects the New York Times' best seller "Taster's Choice," as well as the follow-up story-arc "International Flavor."</description>

  <description>William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Williams's luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.</description>

When an industrial accident unleashes an "airborne toxic event," a lethal black chemical cloud floats over their lives. The menacing cloud is a more urgent and visible version of the "white noise" engulfing the Gladneys-radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, ultrasonic appliances, and TV murmurings-pulsing with life, yet suggesting something ominous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A brilliant satire of mass culture and numbing effects of technology, &lt;em&gt;White Noise&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Jack Gladney, a teacher of Hitler studies at a liberal arts college in Middle America. Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism. Then a lethal black chemical cloud, unleashed by an industrial accident, floats over their lives, an “airborne toxic event” that is a more urgent and visible version of the white noise engulfing the Gladneys—the radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, and TV murmurings that constitute the music of American magic and dread.</description>

  <description>Vampires are not sexy or sensitive. Hungry, bloody and stinking of the grave, they hunt the dry Kansas plains, taking what they want until they cross rancher Keith Harris. Keith is a damaged man who's always made the hard decisions others couldn't. As the two forces battle for survival, the lines between man and monster begin to blur. How much of a community's burden of sin can one man take on before becoming a monster himself? With Burden Kansas, Alan Ryker provides a contemporary novella of vampire horror written in the minimal voice of the western. Burden Kansas is more entertaining, disturbing and thought-provoking than you thought a vampire western could be.</description>

  <description>Awe and exhilaration—along with heartbreak and mordant wit—abound in &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt;, Nabokov's most famous and controversial novel, which tells the story of the aging Humbert Humbert's obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze. &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America. Most of all, it is a meditation on love—love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.</description>

  <description>Tokyo, 1912. The closed world of the ancient aristocracy is being breached for the first time by outsiders - rich provincial families, a new and powerful political and social elite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kiyoaki has been raised among the elegant Ayakura family - members of the waning aristocracy - but he is not one of them. Coming of age, he is caught up in the tensions between old and new, and his feelings for the exquisite, spirited Satoko, observed from the sidelines by his devoted friend Honda. When Satoko is engaged to a royal prince, Kiyoaki realises the magnitude of his passion.</description>

  <description>The mystery of Ryhope Wood, Britain's last fragment of primeval forest, consumed George Huxley's entire, and long, life. Now, after his death, his sons have taken up his work. But what they discover is beyond what they could have expected. For the Wood is a realm where myths gain flesh and blood, tapping primal fears and desires subdued through the millennia. A realm where love and beauty haunt your dreams -- and may drive you insane. Mythago Wood won the World Fantasy Award on its first publication in 1984, and secured Robert Holdstock's reputation as one of the major fantasy writers of our time. Now it returns to print in America for the first time in nearly a decade.</description>

  <description>From one of our most esteemed historical novelists, a remarkable retelling of the Watergate scandal, as seen through a kaleidoscope of its colorful perpetrators and investigators.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For all the monumental documentation that Watergate generated—uncountable volumes of committee records, court transcripts, and memoirs—it falls at last to a novelist to perform the work of inference (and invention) that allows us to solve some of the scandal’s greatest mysteries (who &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; erase those eighteen-and-a-half minutes of tape?) and to see this gaudy American catastrophe in its human entirety. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Watergate, &lt;/em&gt;Thomas Mallon conveys the drama and high comedy of the Nixon presidency through the urgent perspectives of seven characters we only thought we knew before now, moving readers from the private cabins of Camp David to the klieg lights of the Senate Caucus Room, from the District of Columbia jail to the Dupont Circle mansion of Theodore Roosevelt’s sharp-tongued ninety-year-old daughter (“The clock is dick-dick-dicking”), and into the hive of the Watergate complex itself, home not only to the Democratic National Committee but also to the president’s attorney general, his recklessly loyal secretary, and the shadowy man from Mississippi who pays out hush money to the burglars.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Praised by Christopher Hitchens for his “splendid evocation of Washington,” Mallon achieves with &lt;em&gt;Watergate &lt;/em&gt;a scope and historical intimacy that surpasses even what he attained in his previous novels, as he turns a “third-rate burglary” into a tumultuous, first-rate entertainment.</description>

  <description>If you had the chance to change the course of history, would you? Would the consequences be what you hoped?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Epping, 35, teaches high-school English in Lisbon Falls, Maine, and cries reading the brain-damaged janitor's story of childhood Halloween massacre by their drunken father. On his deathbed, pal Al divulges a secret portal to 1958 in his diner back pantry, and enlists Jake to prevent the 11/22/1963 Dallas assassination of American President John F. Kennedy. Under the alias George Amberson, our hero joins the cigarette-hazed full-flavored world of Elvis rock'n'roll, Negro discrimination, and freeway gas-guzzlers without seat belts. Will Jake lurk in impoverished immigrant slums beside troubled loner Lee Harvey Oswald, or share small-town friendliness with beautiful high school librarian Sadie Dunhill, the love of his life?</description>

  <description>Left by harrowing circumstances to fend for herself in the great capital of a foreign country, Lucy Snowe, the narrator and heroine of "Villette", achieves by degrees an authentic independence from both outer necessity and inward grief. Charlotte Brontë's last novel, published in 1853, has a dramatic force comparable to that of her other masterpriece &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a striking modernity of psychological insight, and a revolutionary understanding of human loneliness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;With an introduction by Lucy Hughes-Hallett&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The Rev. Thomas Marshfield has been packed off to an establishment for disordered clergymean where he is to devote a month to tracking down the nature of his own disgrace.&lt;br&gt;What a smokscreen of wit and irreverance he throws up to start with! And indeed, the story of the way in which he upset his congegation (except for those female members of it whom he delighted) could hardly be told with a straight face. But each Sunday he breaks off to write a sermon: words which reveal the underlying reasons for his running wild. Thus he fights his way back through his frivoloity and pain to the roots of his faith. Perhaps his congregation might still be shocked by his conclusions, but he is finally able to trust that God may find them acceptable.</description>

  <description>The acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The Princes in the Tower&lt;/em&gt; now brilliantly investigates another of Britain’s notorious unsolved mysteries: the murder of Lord Darnley, second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tall, handsome, accomplished, and charming, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, had it all, including a strong claim to the English throne, a fact that threatened the already insecure Elizabeth I. She therefore opposed any plan for Darnley to marry her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, who herself claimed to be Queen of England. But in 1565 Mary met and fell in love with Darnley—and defied Elizabeth by marrying him. It was not long before she discovered that her new husband was weak and vicious, and interested only in securing sovereign power for himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On February 10, 1567, an explosion at his lodgings left Darnley dead. There were many who might have had a motive for murdering him, not least Mary herself. The intrigue thickened after it was discovered that apparently he had been suffocated before the blast. Emerging from the tragedy were more mysteries than any historian has ever satisfactorily solved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary and Darnley’s marriage had been an adulterous disaster. After Darnley’s death, Mary showed favor to the powerful Earl of Bothwell, causing her enemies to accuse her of being his partner in both infidelity and murder. Mary insisted that the murder conspiracy had been aimed at her, and that she had escaped only by changing her plans at the last minute. It has even been suggested that Darnley himself had planned the explosion in order to kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The murder of Darnley ultimately led to Mary’s ruin. After her deposition, there conveniently came to light a box of documents—the notorious Casket Letters—that her enemies claimed were proof of her guilt. But Mary was never allowed to see them, and they disappeared in 1584. The question of their authenticity has haunted historians ever since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After exhaustive reexamination and reevaluation of the source material, Alison Weir has come up with a solution to this enduring mystery that can be substantiated by contemporary evidence, and in the process has shattered many of the misconceptions about Mary, Queen of Scots. Employing once more the bright writing and stunning characterizations that have made her a favorite writer of popular history, Weir has written one of her most engaging excursions into Britain’s bloodstained, power-obsessed past.</description>

  <description>No set of novels so richly recreates the last days of India under British rule--"two nations locked in an imperial embrace"--as Paul Scott's historical tour de force, " The Raj Quartet." "The Jewel in the Crown" opens in 1942 as the British fear both Japanese invasion and Indian demands for independence. On the night after the Indian Congress Party votes to support Gandhi, riots break out and an ambitious police sargeant arrests a young Indian for the alleged rape of the woman they both love.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A SWEEPING TALE OF TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY AMERICA AND THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCES THAT BROUGHT TWO MEN TOGETHER ONE FATEFUL DAY&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In 1901, as America tallied its gains from a period of unprecedented imperial expansion, an assassin’s bullet shattered the nation’s confidence. The shocking murder of President William McKinley threw into stark relief the emerging new world order of what would come to be known as the American Century. &lt;em&gt;The President and the Assassin&lt;/em&gt; is the story of the momentous years leading up to that event, and of the very different paths that brought together two of the most compelling figures of the era: President William McKinley and Leon Czolgosz, the anarchist who murdered him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two men seemed to live in eerily parallel Americas. McKinley was to his contemporaries an enigma, a president whose conflicted feelings about imperialism reflected the country’s own. Under its popular Republican commander-in-chief, the United States was undergoing an uneasy transition from a simple agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse spreading its influence overseas by force of arms. Czolgosz was on the losing end of the economic changes taking place—a first-generation Polish immigrant and factory worker sickened by a government that seemed focused solely on making the rich richer. With a deft narrative hand, journalist Scott Miller chronicles how these two men, each pursuing what he considered the right and honorable path, collided in violence at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, readers meet a veritable who’s who of turn-of-the-century America: John Hay, McKinley’s visionary secretary of state, whose diplomatic efforts paved the way for a half century of Western exploitation of China; Emma Goldman, the radical anarchist whose incendiary rhetoric inspired Czolgosz to dare the unthinkable; and Theodore Roosevelt, the vainglorious vice president whose 1898 charge up San Juan Hill in Cuba is but one of many thrilling military adventures recounted here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rich with relevance to our own era, &lt;em&gt;The President and the Assassin&lt;/em&gt; holds a mirror up to a fascinating period of upheaval when the titans of industry grew fat, speculators sought fortune abroad, and desperate souls turned to terrorism in a vain attempt to thwart the juggernaut of change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The President and the Assassin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “[A] panoramic tour de force . . . Miller has a good eye, trained by years of journalism, for telling details and enriching anecdotes.”—The Washington Independent Review of Books&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Even without the intrinsic draw of the 1901 presidential assassination that shapes its pages, Scott Miller’s &lt;em&gt;The President and the Assassin &lt;/em&gt;[is] absorbing reading. . . . What makes the book compelling is [that] so many circumstances and events of the earlier time have parallels in our own.”—&lt;em&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “A marvelous work of history, wonderfully written.”—Fareed Zakaria, author of &lt;em&gt;The Post-American World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “A real triumph.”—&lt;em&gt;BookPage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Fast-moving and richly detailed.”—&lt;em&gt;The Buffalo News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “[A] compelling read.”—&lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;’s 10 Must-Read Summer Books&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Four decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/em&gt;, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;A Splendor of Letters, &lt;/em&gt;Nicholas A. Basbanes continues the lively, richly anecdotal exploration of book people, places, and culture he began in 1995 with A Gentle Madness (a finalist that year for the National Book Critics Circle Award) and expanded in 2001 with Patience &amp;amp; Fortitude, a companion work that prompted the two-time Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and biographer David McCullough to proclaim him "the leading authority of books about books."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basbanes now offers a consideration of the many pressing issues that surround the role of books in contemporary society, such as the willful destruction of books and libraries in Sarajevo, Tibet, and Cambodia, and the spirited efforts to restore them. The matter of "discards" at various libraries takes on an entirely new dimension as well, with fully researched stories about the kind of attitudes that may lead to the loss of “last copies” of important works.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In vivid detail, Basbanes examines the many materials that have been used over the centuries to record information -- among them clay tablets, papyrus scrolls, slabs of stone, palm leaves, animal skins, and hammered sheets of gold and copper. Also discussed are the various debates that continue to rage about preservation, which may mean saving and storing books on paper indefinitely, or as electronic data, which are by nature ephemeral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this beautifully packaged edition, Nicholas Basbanes brings to a close his wonderful trilogy on the remarkable world of books and bibliophiles.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Brothers Karamazov&lt;/em&gt;, Dostoevsky’s last and greatest novel, published just before his death in 1881, chronicles the bitter love-hate struggle between the outsized Fyodor Karamazov and his three very different sons. It is above all the story of a murder, told with hair-raising intellectual clarity and a feeling for the human condition unsurpassed in world literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dostoevsky’s towering reputation as one of the handful of thinkers who forged the modern sensibility has sometimes obscured the purely novelistic virtues–brilliant characterizations, flair for suspense and melodrama, instinctive theatricality–that made his work so immensely popular in nineteenth-century Russia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;This award-winning translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky–the definitive version in English–magnificently captures the rich and subtle energies of Dostoevsky’s masterpiece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Book Jacket Status: Jacketed)</description>

  <description>James A. Garfield was one of the most extraordinary men ever elected president. Born into abject poverty, he rose to become a wunderkind scholar, a Civil War hero, and a renowned and admired reformist congressman. Nominated for president against his will, he engaged in a fierce battle with the corrupt political establishment. But four months after his inauguration, a deranged office seeker tracked Garfield down and shot him in the back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the shot didn’t kill Garfield. The drama of what hap­pened subsequently is a powerful story of a nation in tur­moil. The unhinged assassin’s half-delivered strike shattered the fragile national mood of a country so recently fractured by civil war, and left the wounded president as the object of a bitter behind-the-scenes struggle for power—over his administration, over the nation’s future, and, hauntingly, over his medical care. A team of physicians administered shockingly archaic treatments, to disastrous effect. As his con­dition worsened, Garfield received help: Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, worked around the clock to invent a new device capable of finding the bullet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meticulously researched, epic in scope, and pulsating with an intimate human focus and high-velocity narrative drive, &lt;em&gt;The Destiny of the Republic&lt;/em&gt; will stand alongside &lt;em&gt;The Devil in the White City&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Professor and the Madman&lt;/em&gt; as a classic of narrative history.</description>

  <description>Quentin Coldwater is brillant but miserable. He's a senior in high school, and a certifiable genius, but he's still secretly obsessed with a series of fantasy novels he read as a kid, about the adventures of five children in a magical land called Fillory. Compared to that, anything in his real life just seems gray and colorless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes when Quentin finds himself unexpectedly admitted to a very secret, very exclusive college of magic in upstate New York, where he receives a thorough and rigorous education in the practice of modern sorcery. He also discovers all the other things people learn in college: friendship, love, sex, booze, and boredom. But something is still missing. Magic doesn't bring Quentin the happiness and adventure he though it would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, after graduation, he and his friends make a stunning discovery: Fillory is real.</description>

  <description>A Angoulême, David Séchard, un jeune poète idéaliste, embauche dans son imprimerie un ami de collège, Lucien Chardon, qui prendra bientôt le nom de sa mère, Rubempré. Poète lui aussi, il bénéficie d'une sorte de gloire locale et fréquente le salon de Louise de Bargeton à qui le lie bientôt une intrigue sentimentale qui fait tant jaser que tous les deux partent pour Paris. Voilà bientôt Lucien lancé dans le monde des lettres aussi bien que de la haute société, mais si Paris est la ville des " gens supérieurs ", ce sera également pour lui celle des désillusions. C'est bien la figure de Lucien, en effet, qui donne surtout son unité aux Illusions perdues qui ont d'abord été, de 1837 à 1843, une suite de trois romans devenus plus tard les trois parties de celui que nous lisons, quand Balzac eut conçu le projet de La Comédie humaine et décidé de faire de sa trilogie l'une des Scènes de la vie de province. Car si Paris reste bien au cœur du triptyque, c'est à Angoulême, néanmoins, que se noue le destin des héros, à Angoulême encore qu'il s'assombrit. Revenu dans sa ville natale, Lucien n'est pas loin d'y sombrer - avant une véritable ascension dont Balzac fera le récit dans un autre grand livre: Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes.</description>

  <description>Craig is 16 when he returns from a drug-fueled visit with his dad in Miami to find his mom leaving town with her 23 year-old boyfriend. In the same moment, his dreams of settling down with his pregnant girlfriend are dashed when she is moved off to Texas by her parents. Left alone in small town Oklahoma, he embarks on a deranged, cross-country quest for a family of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;STILL LIFE WITH BRASS POLE is Craig Machen’s funny, debauched and heartfelt memoir about young love and coming of age in the titillation business. And how a roaring White Knight Complex, an eccentric comedy club owner, and a trio of unpredictable striptease artists conspire to help him achieve his aims.</description>

  <description>Dark allegory describes the narrator’s journey up the Congo River and his meeting with, and fascination by, Mr. Kurtz, a mysterious personage who dominates the unruly inhabitants of the region. Masterly blend of adventure, character development, psychological penetration. Considered by many Conrad’s finest, most enigmatic story.</description>

  <description>The Fellowship was scattered. Some were bracing hopelessly for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to be destroyed in Mordor–the dark Kingdom where Sauron was supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, slave to the corruption of the Ring. Thus continues the magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in The Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring climax in The Return of the King.</description>

  <description>Concluding the story begun in The Hobbit, this is the final part of Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The armies of the Dark Lord are massing as his evil shadow spreads ever wider. Men, Dwarves, Elves and Ents unite forces to do battle agains the Dark. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam struggle further into Mordor in their heroic quest to destroy the One Ring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Impossible to describe in a few words, JRR Tolkien's great work of imaginative fiction has been labelled both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves through countless changes of scene and character in an imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail. Tolkien created a vast new mythology in an invented world which has proved timeless in its appeal.</description>

  <description>A fantastic starter set for new Tolkien fans or readers interested in rediscovering the magic of Middle-earth, this three-volume box set features paperback editions of the complete trilogy -- &lt;em&gt;The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt; -- each with art from the New Line Productions feature film on the cover.&lt;br&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien's &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy is a genuine masterpiece. The most widely read and influential fantasy epic of all time, it is also quite simply one of the most memorable and beloved tales ever told. Originally published in 1954, &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; set the framework upon which all epic/quest fantasy since has been built. Through the urgings of the enigmatic wizard Gandalf, young hobbit Frodo Baggins embarks on an urgent, incredibly treacherous journey to destroy the One Ring. This ring -- created and then lost by the Dark Lord, Sauron, centuries earlier -- is a weapon of evil, one that Sauron desperately wants returned to him. With the power of the ring once again his own, the Dark Lord will unleash his wrath upon all of Middle-earth. The only way to prevent this horrible fate from becoming reality is to return the Ring to Mordor, the only place it can be destroyed. Unfortunately for our heroes, Mordor is also Sauron's lair. &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy is essential reading not only for fans of fantasy but for lovers of classic literature as well...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: this edition shares an ISBN with the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18190993-the-lord-of-the-rings"&gt;2004 edition&lt;/a&gt; published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Paul Bäumer enlisted with his classmates in the German army of World War I. Youthful, enthusiastic, they become soldiers. But despite what they have learned, they break into pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. And as horrible war plods on year after year, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principles of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against each other --- if only he can come out of the war alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure."&lt;br&gt;THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</description>

  <description>"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this  startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his masterpiece, The  Metamorphosis.  &lt;br&gt;It is the story of a  young man who, transformed overnight into a giant  beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to  his family, an outsider in his own home, a  quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing -- though  absurdly comic -- meditation on human feelings of  inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one  of the most widely read and influential works of  twentieth-century fiction. &lt;br&gt;As W.H. Auden wrote,  "Kafka is important to us because his predicament  is the predicament of modern man." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Summary by the publisher</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance.  Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from "the good fight," &lt;em&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/em&gt;.  The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal.  In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in &lt;em&gt;The Sun Also Rises &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Farewell to Arms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Dandelion Wine is a 1957 semi-autobiographical novel by Ray Bradbury, taking place in the summer of 1928 in the fictional town of Green Town, Illinois — a pseudonym for Bradbury's childhood home of Waukegan, Illinois. The novel developed from the short story "Dandelion Wine" which appeared in the June 1953 issue of Gourmet magazine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The title refers to a wine made with dandelion petals and other ingredients, commonly citrus fruit. In the story, dandelion wine, as made by the protagonist's grandfather, serves as a metaphor for packing all of the joys of summer into a single bottle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main character of the story is Douglas Spaulding, a 12-year-old boy loosely patterned after Bradbury. Most of the book is focused upon the routines of small-town America, and the simple joys of yesteryear.</description>

  <description>When he was nine, he watched as his mother and brother were killed before him. At thirteen, he led a band of bloodthirsty thugs. By fifteen, he intends to be king... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's time for Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath to return to the castle he turned his back on, to take what's rightfully his. Since the day he hung pinned on the thorns of a briar patch and watched Count Renar's men slaughter his mother and young brother, Jorg has been driven to vent his rage. Life and death are no more than a game to him--and he has nothing left to lose. But treachery awaits him in his father's castle. Treachery and dark magic. No matter how fierce his will, can one young man conquer enemies with power beyond his imagining?</description>

      <![CDATA[It has been decades since I've read a Simenon.  For whatever reason, who knows it could have been a mention in something else I was reading or just a random thought out of the murky muck of my reader's brain, but I have recently developed an interest in Simenon.  He has the reputation of a ladies m...]]>

  <description>Michael Dibdin’s veteran Italian police officer is back. The newest addition to this remarkable series -- consistently galvanizing as much for its revelation of the subtle complexities of Italian life as for its page-turning suspense -- is a novel of long-held secrets set against a sweeping background of political and passionate intrigue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a group of Austrian cavers exploring a network of abandoned military tunnels in the Italian Alps comes across human remains at the bottom of a deep shaft, everyone assumes the death was accidental. Until, that is, the still-unidentified body is stolen from the morgue and the Defense Ministry puts a news blackout on the case. And is the recent car bombing in Campione D’Italia, a tiny tax haven surrounded on all sides by Switzerland, somehow related? The whole affair has the whiff of political corruption. That’s enough to interest Aurelio Zen’s boss at the Interior Ministry, who wants to know who is hiding what from whom, and why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The search for the truth leads Zen back into the murky history of postwar Italy and the obscure corners of modern-day society to uncover the truth about a crime that everyone thought was as dead and buried as its victim.</description>

  <description>"Then she opened her mouth to scream--and recognised me. It was what I'd been waiting for. She froze. She looked into my eyes. She said, "It's you."&lt;br&gt;"&lt;br&gt;Meet Jake. A bit on the elderly side (he turns 201 in March), but you'd never suspect it. Nonstop sex and exercise will do that for you--and a diet with lots of animal protein. Jake is a werewolf, and after the unfortunate and violent death of his one contemporary, he is now the last of his species. Although he is physically healthy, Jake is deeply distraught and lonely. &lt;br&gt;Jake's depression has carried him to the point where he is actually contemplating suicide--even if it means terminating a legend thousands of years old. It would seem to be easy enough for him to end everything. But for very different reasons there are two dangerous groups pursuing him who will stop at nothing to keep him alive. &lt;br&gt;Here is a powerful, definitive new version of the werewolf legend--mesmerising and incredibly sexy. In Jake, Glen Duncan has given us a werewolf for the twenty-first century--a man whose deeds can only be described as monstrous but who is in some magical way deeply human. &lt;br&gt;One of the most original, audacious, and terrifying novels in years.</description>

No Love Potions, Endless Purses, or Other Entertainment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Business has been slow.  Okay, business has been dead.  And not even of the undead variety.  You would think Chicago would have a little more action for the only professional wizard in the phone book.  But lately, Harry Dresden hasn't been able to dredge up any kind of work--magical &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; mundane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just when it looks like he can't afford his next meal, a murder comes along that requires his particular brand of supernatural expertise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brutally mutilated corpse.  Strange-looking paw prints.  A full moon.  Take three guesses--and the first two don't count...</description>

  <description>The remarkable story of one English family during the tumultuous seventeenth century, as revealed through their original letters and documents, which paint an extraordinarily accurate and detailed picture of life in England, Europe, and even the American colonies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "To know the Verneys is to know the seventeenth century," Adrian Tinniswood writes in this brilliant new book. The Verney family's centuries-long practice of saving every piece of paper that came into their possession-amassing some 100,000 pages of family and estate letters and documents-resulted in the largest and most complete private collection of seventeenth-century correspondence in the Western world to date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Given exclusive access to these documents, Tinniswood draws a sweeping portrait of the Verneys and the world among Buckinghamshire gentry in which they lived. In vivid detail Tinniswood introduces us to generations of the family: We meet Edmund Verney, King Charles I's standard bearer, who died in battle during the English Civil War in 1642 (his hand still clutching the king's standard). Edmund's son and heir, Ralph, struggled to hold the family together after his father's death, but lost the respect of his brothers and sisters because he alone of the family supported the Parliamentarian cause. Parliament, however, suspicious of his royalist connections, hounded him and his family into exile. Ralph's sons fared both better and worse than their father: Jack went to Syria and made a fortune, while Edmund married a girl who was rich, beautiful, and deeply in love with him-but within months of the marriage she succumbed to insanity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Rigorously researched, intensely insightful, and alive with drama, &lt;em&gt;The Verneys&lt;/em&gt; is narrative history at its very best: fascinating, surprising, and enthralling.</description>

  <description>Meet Lennon, a mute Irish getaway driver who has fallen in with the wrong heist team on the wrong day at the wrong bank. Betrayed, his money stolen and his battered carcass left for dead, Lennon is on a one-way mission to find out who is responsible--and to get back his loot. But the robbery has sent a violent ripple effect through the streets of Philadelphia. And now a dirty cop, the Russian and Italian mobs, the mayor's hired gun, and a keyboard player in a college rock band maneuver for position as this adrenaline-fueled novel twists and turns its way toward its explosive conclusion.&lt;br&gt;One thing's for sure: This cast of characters wakes up in a much different world by novel's end--if they wake up at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In the near future, at a moment no one will notice, all the dazzling technology that runs our world will unite and turn against us. Taking on the persona of a shy human boy, a childlike but massively powerful artificial intelligence known as Archos comes online and assumes control over the global network of machines that regulate everything from transportation to utilities, defense and communication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the months leading up to this, sporadic glitches are noticed by a handful of unconnected humans – a single mother disconcerted by her daughter’s menacing “smart” toys, a lonely Japanese bachelor who is victimized by his domestic robot companion, an isolated U.S. soldier who witnesses a ‘pacification unit’ go haywire – but most are unaware of the growing rebellion until it is too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Robot War ignites -- at a moment known later as Zero Hour -- humankind will be both decimated and, possibly, for the first time in history, united. Robopocalypse is a brilliantly conceived action-filled epic, a terrifying story with heart-stopping implications for the real technology all around us…and an entertaining and engaging thriller unlike anything else written in years.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's been a year since Nick Traver's search for the lost recording of blues phantom Robert Johnson in Crossroad Blues. He has grown comfortable playing his harp at JoJo's in the French Quarter and teaching blues history at Tulane. A difficult case was the last thing on the blues tracker's mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When new details on the mysterious death of a blues record producer surface from a legendary guitarist over a bottle of Crown Royal, Nick becomes intrigued. In 1959, Billy Lyons' body was found stabbed with an ice pick and floating in Lake Michigan. His lover, a blues singer named Ruby Walker, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder. But even after Ruby was sentenced, rumors emerged of a gambling debt to the black mafia or a possible hit called by Lyons' partner, Moses Jordan, who moved on to immortality with another label. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After arriving at Chicago's Union Station, Travers learns there are still those who'd like Billy Lyons' murder to remain unsolved. He soon has fresh blood splattered on his boots and he's running in the blackened snow from a rogues gallery of killers that include a 6-foot-5, 300 pound breathing ball of hate named Stagger Lee Jordan and a beautiful pair of sociopaths--Butcher Knife-Totin' Annie and Fast-Lovin' Fannie--two women with respective talents for love and death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His quest for Lyons' killer retraces the route of the Delta greats during the Great Migration of blacks after World War II. From the historic Maxwell Street Market to the South Side's Checkerboard Lounge, take a hint from Robert Johnson when he sang, &lt;em&gt;"C'mon. Baby don't you want to go. Back to that same old place--My Sweet Home Chicago." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Greece, 1940. Not sunny vacation Greece: northern Greece, Macedonian Greece, Balkan Greece--the city of Salonika. In that ancient port, with its wharves and warehouses, dark lanes and Turkish mansions, brothels and tavernas, a tense political drama is being played out. On the northern border, the Greek army has blocked Mussolini's invasion, pushing his divisions back to Albania--the first defeat suffered by the Nazis, who have conquered most of Europe. But Adolf Hitler cannot tolerate such freedom; the invasion is coming, it's only a matter of time, and the people of Salonika can only watch and wait. &lt;br&gt;At the center of this drama is Costa Zannis, a senior police official, head of an office that handles special "political" cases. As war approaches, the spies begin to circle, from the Turkish legation to the German secret service. There's a British travel writer, a Bulgarian undertaker, and more. Costa Zannis must deal with them all. And he is soon in the game, securing an escape route--from Berlin to Salonika, and then to a tenuous safety in Turkey, a route protected by German lawyers, Balkan detectives, and Hungarian gangsters. And hunted by the Gestapo. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, as war threatens, the erotic life of the city grows passionate. For Zannis, that means a British expatriate who owns the local ballet academy, a woman from the dark side of Salonika society, and the wife of a local shipping magnate. &lt;br&gt;Declared "an incomparable expert at his game" by "The New York Times," Alan Furst outdoes even his own finest novels in this thrilling new book. With extraordinary authenticity, a superb cast of characters, and heart-stopping tension as it moves from Salonika to Paris to Berlin and back, Spies of the Balkans is a stunning novel about a man who risks everything to right--in many small ways--the world's evil.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Finalist for the 2002 National Book Award, Young People's Literature&lt;br&gt;Honor book for the 2003 &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe/Horn Book&lt;/em&gt; Award (Fiction category)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave New World&lt;/em&gt; takes a romantic teen twist in this disarming, engrossing novel set in a hyper-computerized future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spending time partying on the moon and riding around in his "upcar," Titus is an average teen of the future, complete with a computer chip implant -- the "Feed" -- that lets corporate marketers and government agencies broadcast directly into his brain. Then Titus meets Violet, and an anti-Feed hacker shuts down their Feeds for a short time; but when Violet's Feed is seriously damaged, she begins spouting some radical ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;M. T. Anderson has predicted the future, and it's startling indeed. Although Titus is a good, well-meaning kid, his blissful ignorance of the control over him leaves readers thinking twice about the destiny of earth's citizens. Beneath the book's techno-veneer, however, lies a romantic tale between a boy who gives into the system and a girl who sees beyond it. All told, &lt;em&gt;Feed&lt;/em&gt; is a "meg" remarkable work of science fiction, and once readers begin, they'll be caught up in its powerful grip. &lt;em&gt;Matt Warner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I know this is considered a young adult book, but I didn't feel like I was reading a young adult book.  I first thought, wow this is an off shoot of William Gibson's Neuromancer, but as I read more it reminded me more and more of Bret Easton Ellis's Less than Zero.  I'm a fan of both those books an...]]>

  <description>"I've been mythicized, Mick-icized, eulogized and fooligized, I've been Cole-Portered and farmer's-daughtered, I've been Led Zepped and 12-stepped. I'm a rhyming fool and so cool that me, Fritz the Cat, and Mohair Sam are the baddest cats that am. I have so many outrageous stories, too many, and I'm gonna tell 'em all. All the unexpurgated, brain-jangling tales of debauchery, sex &amp;amp; drugs, transcendence &amp;amp; chemical dependence you will ever want to hear." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The son of a classical pianist straight out of the Bronx of old Archie comics, Steven Tyler was born to be a rock star. Weaned on Cole Porter, Nat King Cole, Mick—and his beloved Janis Joplin—Tyler began tearing up the streets and the stage as a teenager before finally meeting his "mutant twin" and legendary partner Joe Perry. In this addictively readable memoir, told in the playful, poetic voice that is uniquely his own, Tyler unabashedly recounts the meteoric rise, fall, and rise of Aerosmith over the last three decades and riffs on the music that gives it all meaning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tyler tells what it's like to be a living legend and the frontman of one of the world's most revered and infamous bands—the debauchery, the money, the notoriety, the fights, the motels and hotels, the elevators, limos, buses and jets, the rehab. He reveals the spiritual side that "gets lost behind the stereotype of the Sex Guy, the Drug Guy, the Demon of Screamin', the Terror of the Tropicana." And he talks about his epic romantic life and his relationship with his four children. As dazzling, bold, and out-on-the-edge as the man himself, Does the Noise in My Head Bother You? is an all-access backstage pass into this extraordinary showman's life.</description>

      <![CDATA[I'm not really sure what most of the reviewers/readers of this book expected.  They are complaining about the adolescent, egotistical, drug abusing, sex indulgent lifestyle of a rock star.

  <description>When a brutal murder shocks Istanbul's rundown Jewish quarter, the Turkish police force unleashes their best weapon - the chain-smoking, brandy-swilling Inspector Cetin Ikmen, husband to a strict Muslim woman (who disapproves of his drinking) and loving father of eight (with another on the way). With such a colorful personality and unrivaled investigative powers, Ikmen will surely join the ranks of beloved foreign cops Aureilo Zen and Guido Brunetti.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>From the wildly imaginative storyteller behind Punktown and other strange worlds, comes the novella BEYOND THE DOOR.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two strangers meet in a train station, and begin swapping stories—stories that eerily interweave, and grow more and more disturbing and bizarre. The headless undead, a gruesome flea circus, flesh-eating insects, and a menacing house that won’t stay put. These are just some of the tales that will reveal as much about the teller as they do the mysteries behind that frayed curtain we call reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEYOND THE DOOR is a story about how we connect with one another through storytelling—and tantalize ourselves with the unknown.</description>

  <description>"This is a bawdy tale. Herein you will find gratuitous shagging, murder, spanking, maiming, treason, and heretofore unexplored heights of vulgarity and profanity, as well as nontraditional grammar, split infinitives, and the odd wank . . . If that's the sort of thing you think you might enjoy, then you have happened upon the perfect story!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verily speaks Christopher Moore, much beloved scrivener and peerless literary jester, who hath writteneth much that is of grand wit and belly-busting mirth, including such laurelled bestsellers of the &lt;em&gt;Times of Olde Newe Yorke&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;Lamb&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Dirty Job&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;You Suck&lt;/em&gt; (no offense). Now he takes on no less than the legendary Bard himself (with the utmost humility and respect) in a twisted and insanely funny tale of a moronic monarch and his deceitful daughters—a rousing story of plots, subplots, counterplots, betrayals, war, revenge, bared bosoms, unbridled lust . . . and a ghost (there's always a bloody ghost), as seen through the eyes of a man wearing a codpiece and bells on his head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fool&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man of infinite jest, Pocket has been Lear's cherished fool for years, from the time the king's grown daughters—selfish, scheming Goneril, sadistic (but erotic-fantasy-grade-hot) Regan, and sweet, loyal Cordelia—were mere girls. So naturally Pocket is at his brainless, elderly liege's side when Lear—at the insidious urging of Edmund, the bastard (in every way imaginable) son of the Earl of Gloucester—demands that his kids swear their undying love and devotion before a collection of assembled guests. Of course Goneril and Regan are only too happy to brownnose Dad. But Cordelia believes that her father's request is kind of . . . well . . . stupid, and her blunt honesty ends up costing her her rightful share of the kingdom and earns her a banishment to boot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, now the bangers and mash have really hit the fan. The whole damn country's about to go to hell in a handbasket because of a stubborn old fart's wounded pride. And the only person who can possibly make things right . . . is Pocket, a small and slight clown with a biting sense of humor. He's already managed to sidestep catastrophe (and the vengeful blades of many an offended nobleman) on numerous occasions, using his razor-sharp mind, rapier wit . . . and the equally well-honed daggers he keeps conveniently hidden behind his back. Now he's going to have to do some very fancy maneuvering—cast some spells, incite a few assassinations, start a war or two (the usual stuff)—to get Cordelia back into Daddy Lear's good graces, to derail the fiendish power plays of Cordelia's twisted sisters, to rescue his gigantic, gigantically dim, and always randy friend and apprentice fool, Drool, from repeated beatings . . . and to shag every lusciously shaggable wench who's amenable to shagging along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pocket may be a fool . . . but he's definitely not an idiot.</description>

      <![CDATA[Okay I laughed out loud numerous times reading this book.  Bawdy, witty, a mishmash of various Shakespearean plays.  Packet, the fool, is the main character and he rains barbed insults down on everybody from King Lear to the laundress (with spectacular breasts). This dangerous need to express himse...]]>

  <description>In a world still uneasy after the financial turmoil of 2008, Justin Cartwright puts a human face on the dishonesties and misdeeds of the bankers who imperiled us. Tubal and Co. is a small, privately owned bank in England. As the company's longtime leader, Sir Harry Tubal, slips into senility, his son Julian takes over the reins-and not all is well. The company's hedge fund now owns innumerable toxic assets, and Julian fears what will happen when their real value is discovered. &lt;br&gt;Artair Macleod, an actor manager whose ex-wife, Fleur, was all but stolen by Sir Harry, discovers that his company's monthly grant has not been paid by Tubal. Getting no answers from Julian, he goes to the local press, and an eager young reporter begins asking questions. Bit by bit, the reporter discovers that the grant money is in fact a payoff from Fleur, written off by the bank as a charitable donation, and a scandal breaks. Julian's temperament and judgment prove a bad fit for the economic forces of the era, and the family business plunges into chaos as he tries to hide the losses and massage the balance sheet.&lt;br&gt;A story both cautionary and uncomfortably familiar, "Other People's Money "is not a polemic but a tale of morality and hubris, with the Tubal family ultimately left searching only for closure. Bold, humane, urbane, full of rich characters, and effortlessly convincing, this is a novel that reminds us who we are and how we got ourselves here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  I thought there was a chance that I would read a few pages and chuck it on to the "some other time" pile, but Justin Cartwright, first of all, is a wonderful writer. The plot was crisply handled and the book was the perfect length at 258 pages. I like...]]>

  <description>In the intersection of the 15th and 16th centuries, a Dwarf (Big "D" to show respect) goes from the mean streets of Rome to walk with the giants of that world. Madsen remarkably gives us a tour of Europe, Italy, Rome, the Vatican, the papacy, Gnosticism, side-shows, sex, gore and love - always love. The Inquisition is in bloom and heretics are treated in ways that are described in detail, with questioning normal Christian or Roman Catholic beliefs as well as intimate descriptions of sex or be exposed to visceral scenes. The book is very well written and flows smoothly.</description>

  <description>When you've lost everything, the only thing left is vengeance. Invaders from another world have used demonic technology to raise an unholy conquering army of the living dead. These "necros" destroyed Jubal Slate's home and everyone he loved. Now the only thing that matters to Slate is payback. No matter how far he has to go or how many undead warriors he must slaughter, Slate and his motley band of followers will stop at nothing to end the reign of the aliens.</description>

  <description>Michel Renault is a human void. Following the death of the father he barely knew, he endures his civil service job while eking out an existence of prepackaged pleasure, hollow friendships, TV dinners, and pornography. On a group holiday in Thailand, however, he meets the shyly compelling Valérie, who soon pursues an agenda that Michel himself could never have thought possible: his own humanization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in Paris, they plunge into an affair that strays into S&amp;amp;M, public sex, and partner swapping, even as they devise a scheme to save Valérie’s ailing travel company by capitalizing on the only trade Michel has seen flourish in the Third World. Before long, he quits his job, and their business model for “sex tourism” is gradually implemented. But when they return to Thailand, where Michel’s philosophy will be put into practice, he discovers that sex is neither the most consuming nor dangerous of passions...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a suburbanized West crippled by hate crime to an East subsumed by materialism, Michel Houellebecq explores—with characteristic provocativeness, but also with surprising tenderness—the emotions that seem most resilient to any influence: love and hate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platform&lt;/em&gt; is, as Anita Brookner has written, “a brilliant novel, casting a prescient eye on the abuses and inequalities that lead to wider trouble.”</description>

  <description>There’s only so much room on the Island, only so much blood, and Manhattan’s Vampyre Clans aren’t interested in sharing. So when the Vyrus-infected dregs of New York’s outer boroughs start creeping across the bridges and through the tunnels, the Clans want to know why. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad luck for PI and general hard case Joe Pitt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See, Joe used to be a Rogue, used to work off his own dime, picked his own gigs, but tight times and a terminally ill girlfriend pushed him into the arms of the renegade Society Clan. Now he has all the cash and blood he needs, but at a steep price. The price tonight is crossing the bridge, rolling to Coney Island, finding the Freak Clan, and figuring out what’s driving that bunch of savages to scratch at the Society’s door. No need to look far. The answer lies around the corner in Gravesend. Convenient, all those graves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From uptown to the boardwalk, war drums are beating. Murderous family feuds and personal grudges are being drawn and brandished, along with the long knives. Blood will spill and, big surprise, Joe’s in the middle. But hey, why should this night be different from any other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunset to sunrise: put off a war, keep your head attached to your neck, and save your girl. Check. Joe’s on the case.</description>

  <description>Andrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson’s election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson’s presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama–the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers–that shaped Jackson’s private world through years of storm and victory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will–or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House–from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman–have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe–no matter what it took. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jon Meacham in &lt;em&gt;American Lion&lt;/em&gt; has delivered the definitive human portrait of a pivotal president who forever changed the American presidency–and America itself.</description>

  <description>When Hackberry Holland became sheriff of a tiny Texas town near the Mexican border, he'd hoped to leave certain things behind: his checkered reputation, his haunted dreams, and his obsessive memories of the good life with his late wife, Rie. But the discovery of the bodies of nine illegal aliens, machine-gunned to death and buried in a shallow grave behind a church, soon makes it clear that he won't escape so easily. As Hack and Deputy Sheriff Pam Tibbs attempt to untangle the threads of this complex and grisly case, a damaged young Iraq veteran, Pete Flores, and his girlfriend, Vikki Gaddis, are running for their lives, hoping to outwit the bloodthirsty criminals who want to kill Pete for his involvement in the murders. The only trouble is, Pete doesn't know who he's running from: drunk and terrified, he fled the scene of the crime when the shooting began. And there's a long list of people who want Pete and Vikki dead: crime boss Hugo Cistranos, who hired Pete for the operation; Nick Dolan, a strip club owner and small-time gangster with revenge on his mind; and a mysterious God-fearing serial-killer-for-hire known as Preacher Jack Collins, with enigmatic motives of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and a host of cold-blooded killers on Pete and Vikki's trail, it's up to Sheriff Holland to find them first and figure out who's behind the mass murder before anyone else ends up dead. In this thrilling and intricate work, James Lee Burke has once again proven himself a master storyteller and a perceptive chronicler of the darkest corners of the human heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unabridged Compact Disk Includes a Bonus MP3 CD of James Lee Burke's "Cimarron Rose"!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Supernatural fantasy has a new antihero.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life sucks, and then you die. Or, if you're James Stark, you spend eleven years in Hell as a hitman before finally escaping, only to land back in the hell-on-earth that is Los Angeles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Stark's back, and ready for revenge. And absolution, and maybe even love. But when his first stop saddles him with an abusive talking head, Stark discovers that the road to absolution and revenge is much longer than you'd expect, and both Heaven and Hell have their own ideas for his future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resurrection sucks. Saving the world is worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkly twisted, irreverent, and completely hilarious, &lt;em&gt;Sandman Slim&lt;/em&gt; is the breakthrough novel by an acclaimed author.</description>

The hotel Santa has been stabbed to death, and Erlendur and his fellow detectives find no shortage of suspects between the hotel staff and the international travelers staying for the holidays.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An extraordinary debut novel of love that survives the fires of hell and transcends the boundaries of time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The narrator of &lt;em&gt;The Gargoyle&lt;/em&gt; is a very contemporary cynic, physically beautiful and sexually adept, who dwells in the moral vacuum that is modern life. As the book opens, he is driving along a dark road when he is distracted by what seems to be a flight of arrows. He crashes into a ravine and suffers horrible burns over much of his body. As he recovers in a burn ward, undergoing the tortures of the damned, he awaits the day when he can leave the hospital and commit carefully planned suicide — for he is now a monster in appearance as well as in soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A beautiful and compelling, but clearly unhinged, sculptress of gargoyles by the name of Marianne Engel appears at the foot of his bed and insists that they were once lovers in medieval Germany. In her telling, he was a badly injured mercenary and she was a nun and scribe in the famed monastery of Engelthal who nursed him back to health. As she spins their tale in Scheherazade fashion and relates equally mesmerizing stories of deathless love in Japan, Iceland, Italy, and England, he finds himself drawn back to life — and, finally, in love. He is released into Marianne's care and takes up residence in her huge stone house. But all is not well. For one thing, the pull of his past sins becomes ever more powerful as the morphine he is prescribed becomes ever more addictive. For another, Marianne receives word from God that she has only twenty-seven sculptures left to complete — and her time on earth will be finished.</description>

  <description>Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world. &lt;em&gt;Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse&lt;/em&gt; begins nine years later, when he emerges into a bizarre landscape filled with hollow reminders of an America that no longer exists. The highways are lined with abandoned automobiles; electricity is generated by indentured servants pedaling stationary bicycles. What little civilization remains revolves around Joey Armageddon's Sassy A-Go-Go strip clubs, where the beer is cold, the lap dancers are hot, and the bouncers are armed with M16s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Accompanied by his cowboy sidekick Buffalo Bill, the gorgeous stripper Sheila, and the mountain man Ted, Mortimer journeys to the lost city of Atlanta -- and a showdown that might determine the fate of humanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch—and there's always a catch—is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Oryx and Crake&lt;/strong&gt; is at once an unforgettable love story and a compelling vision of the future. Snowman, known as Jimmy before mankind was overwhelmed by a plague, is struggling to survive in a world where he may be the last human, and mourning the loss of his best friend, Crake, and the beautiful and elusive Oryx whom they both loved. In search of answers, Snowman embarks on a journey with the help of the green-eyed Children of Crake through the lush wilderness that was so recently a great city, until powerful corporations took mankind on an uncontrolled genetic engineering ride. Margaret Atwood projects us into a near future that is both all too familiar and beyond our imagining.</description>

  <description>Watch out Alexander McCall Smith! Here comes the first novel by the highly acclaimed writer Tarquin Hall in an entrancing new mystery series set in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The portly Vish Puri is India’s most accomplished detective, at least in his own estimation, and is also the hero of an irresistible new mystery series set in hot, dusty Delhi. Puri’s detective skills are old-fashioned in a Sherlock Holmesian way and a little out of sync with the tempo of the modern city, but Puri is clever and his methods work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Case of the Missing Servant &lt;/strong&gt;shows Puri (“Chubby” to his friends) and his wonderfully nicknamed employees (among them, Handbrake, Flush, and Handcream) hired for two investigations. The first is into the background of a man surprisingly willing to wed a woman her father considers unmarriageable, and the second is into the disappearance six months earlier of a servant to a prominent Punjabi lawyer, a young woman known only as Mary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Most Private Investigator novels offer a delicious combination of ingenious stories, brilliant writing, sharp wit, and a vivid, unsentimental picture of contemporary India. And from the first to the last page run an affectionate humour and intelligent insights into both the subtleties of Indian culture and the mysteries of human behaviour.</description>

  <description>In the dead of night, beside a fading fire deep in the cold woods, a solitary man sits on a magician’s old theatrical trunk…planning the hideous death of Wilson Kemp. The trunk is battered and cracked, its garish paint peeling, but its contents are very special—Wilson Kemp’s worst fear, come back to haunt him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kemp thought he could escape his past. As time went by he actually began to hope he could leave the nightmares behind him. But he is about to discover that some nightmares have no end and no escape. It’s taken years of patient, inexorable searching, but his past has finally caught up with him. And only his blood will satisfy it.</description>

  <description>Winner of the 1974 National Book Award&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A screaming comes across the sky. . .” A few months after the Germans’ secret V-2 rocket bombs begin falling on London, British Intelligence discovers that a map of the city pinpointing the sexual conquests of one Lieutenant Tyrone Slothrop, U.S. Army, corresponds identically to a map showing the V-2 impact sites. The implications of this discovery will launch Slothrop on an amazing journey across war-torn Europe, fleeing an international cabal of military-industrial superpowers, in search of the mysterious Rocket 00000, through a wildly comic extravaganza that has been hailed in The New Republic as “the most profound and accomplished American novel since the end of World War II.”</description>

  <description>Meet Dexter, a polite wolf in sheep’s clothing...a monster who cringes at the site of blood...a serial killer whose one golden rule makes him immensely likable: “he only kills bad people.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dexter Morgan isn’t exactly the kind of man you’d bring home to Mom. Though he’s playful and has a wonderfully ironic sense of humor, Dexter’s one character flaw (his proclivity for murder) can be off-putting. But at heart Dexter is the perfect gentleman, supportive of his sister, Deb, a Miami cop, and interested only in doing away with people who really deserve his special visit. Dex is quite good-looking but totally indifferent to (and, frankly, a bit puzzled by) the attentions paid to him by women. Despite the fact that he can’t stand the sight of blood, he works as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami police department, a job that allows him to keep tabs on the latest crimes and keep an eye open for his next quarry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dexter’s well-organized life is suddenly disrupted when a second, much more visible serial killer appears in Miami. Dex is intrigued, even delighted, by the fact that the other killer appears to have a style reminiscent of his own. Yet he can’t help but feel that the mysterious new arrival is not merely invading his turf, but reaching out to him as well. This new killer seems to be doing more than copying Dexter—he seems to be saying, “Come out and play.” Dexter’s secret life makes for a lonely existence...even a lovable monster can be intrigued by the prospect of finding a friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introducing one of the most witty and original narrators in years, Jeff Lindsay’s &lt;em&gt;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh, surprising, and brilliantly executed novel that is sure toreceive wide acclaim.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban and rural collide in this wry, inspiring memoir of a woman who turned a vacant lot in downtown Oakland into a thriving farm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Novella Carpenter loves cities-the culture, the crowds, the energy. At the same time, she can't shake the fact that she is the daughter of two back-to-the-land hippies who taught her to love nature and eat vegetables. Ambivalent about repeating her parents' disastrous mistakes, yet drawn to the idea of backyard self-sufficiency, Carpenter decided that it might be possible to have it both ways: a homegrown vegetable plot as well as museums, bars, concerts, and a twenty-four-hour convenience mart mere minutes away. Especially when she moved to a ramshackle house in inner city Oakland and discovered a weed-choked, garbage-strewn abandoned lot next door. She closed her eyes and pictured heirloom tomatoes, a beehive, and a chicken coop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What started out as a few egg-laying chickens led to turkeys, geese, and ducks. Soon, some rabbits joined the fun, then two three-hundred-pound pigs. And no, these charming and eccentric animals weren't pets; she was a farmer, not a zookeeper. Novella was raising these animals for dinner. Novella Carpenter's corner of downtown Oakland is populated by unforgettable characters. Lana (&lt;em&gt;anal&lt;/em&gt; spelled backward, she reminds us) runs a speakeasy across the street and refuses to hurt even a fly, let alone condone raising turkeys for Thanksgiving. Bobby, the homeless man who collects cars and car parts just outside the farm, is an invaluable neighborhood concierge. The turkeys, Harold and Maude, tend to escape on a daily basis to cavort with the prostitutes hanging around just off the highway nearby. Every day on this strange and beautiful farm, urban meets rural in the most surprising ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For anyone who has ever grown herbs on their windowsill, tomatoes on their fire escape, or obsessed over the offerings at the local farmers' market, Carpenter's story will capture your heart. And if you've ever considered leaving it all behind to become a farmer outside the city limits, or looked at the abandoned lot next door with a gleam in your eye, consider this both a cautionary tale and a full-throated call to action.&lt;em&gt; Farm City&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettably charming memoir, full of hilarious moments, fascinating farmers' tips, and a great deal of heart. It is also a moving meditation on urban life versus the natural world and what we have given up to live the way we do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>"There's no bullshit in a Joe Lansdale book. There's everything a good story needs, and nothing it doesn't. &lt;br&gt;Joe pulls up the truck, says, 'Get in the back, we're going for a ride.'You know it might get a little &lt;br&gt;scary and it might get a little crazy, but you get in, because you know in the end, it's going to &lt;br&gt;be a fun ride."--Christopher Moore, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestselling Author of&lt;em&gt; A Dirty Job&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Fool&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this Texas-sized thriller, Hap Collins and Leonard Pine—best friends, freelance troublemakers, and tough guys with good intentions—find themselves in the crosshairs of the Dixie Mafia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hap is an East Texas smart mouth with a weakness for southern women. Leonard is a gay, black veteran pining for a lost love. They’re not the makings of your typical dynamic duo, but never underestimate the power of a shared affinity for stirring up trouble and causing mayhem. When an old friend asks Leonard to rescue his daughter from an abusive, no-good drug dealer, he gladly agrees and, of course, invites Hap along for the fun. Even though the dealer may be lowly, he &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;on the bottom rung of the Dixie Mafia, and when Hap and Leonard come calling, the Mafia feels a little payback is in order. Cars crash, shotguns blast, and people die, but Hap and Leonard come out on top. Unfortunately for them, now they’re facing not only jail time but also the legendary—and lethal—Vanilla Ride, who is still out to claim the price on their heads. Full of twists and turns, gunfire and gaffes, this hilarious, rip-roaring novel will have readers turning the pages faster than a Texas tornado.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;The Winter King &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Enemy of God &lt;/em&gt;Bernard Cornwell demonstrated his astonishing ability to make the oft-told legend of King Arthur fresh and new for our time. Now, in this riveting final volume of The Warlord Chronicles, Cornwell tells the unforgettable tale of Arthur's final struggles against the Saxons and his last attempts to triumph over a ruined marriage and ravaged dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the tale not only of a broken love remade, but also of forces both earthly and unearthly that threaten everything Arthur stands for. Peopled by princesses and bards, by warriors and magicians, &lt;em&gt;Excalibur &lt;/em&gt;is the story of love, war, loyalty, and betrayal-the work of a magnificent storyteller at the height of his powers.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The first major biography of the Borgias in thirty years, Christopher Hibbert's latest history brings the family and the world they lived in—the glittering Rome of the Italian Renaissance—to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name Borgia is synonymous with the corruption, nepotism, and greed that were rife in Renaissance Italy. The powerful, voracious Rodrigo Borgia, better known to history as Pope Alexander VI, was the central figure of the dynasty. Two of his seven papal offspring also rose to power and fame—Lucrezia Borgia, his daughter, whose husband was famously murdered by her brother, and that brother, Cesare, who served as the model for Niccolò Machiavelli's &lt;em&gt;The Prince&lt;/em&gt;. Notorious for seizing power, wealth, land, and titles through bribery, marriage, and murder, the dynasty's dramatic rise from its Spanish roots to its occupation of the highest position in Renaissance society forms a gripping tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erudite, witty, and always insightful, Hibbert removes the layers of myth around the Borgia family and creates a portrait alive with his superb sense of character and place.</description>

  <description>The year is 1862, and the Civil War rages through the South. On a Virginia tobacco plantation, another kind of battle soon begins. There, Cassius Howard, a skilled carpenter and slave, risks everything--punishment, sale to a cotton plantation, even his life--to learn the truth concerning the murder of Emoline, a freed black woman, a woman who secretly taught him to read and once saved his life. It is clear that no one cares about her death in the midst of a brutal and hellish war. No one but Cassius, who braves horrific dangers to escape the plantation and avenge her loss. As Cassius seeks answers about Emoline's murder, he finds an unexpected friend and ally in Quashee, a new woman brought over from another plantation; and a formidable adversary in Hoke Howard, the master he has always obeyed. With subtlety and beauty, &lt;em&gt;Sweetsmoke&lt;/em&gt; captures the daily indignities and harrowing losses suffered by slaves, the turmoil of a country waging countless wars within its own borders, and the lives of those people fighting for identity, for salvation, and for freedom.</description>

  <description>“A scathing satire of Spanish society, hilarious dialogue, all beautifully dressed up as a crime novel.”—&lt;em&gt;Krimi-Couch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A first novel that’s spread like wildfire by word of mouth.”—&lt;em&gt;El Avui&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Teresa Solana is great proof of the vitality of the roman noir in Catalan. . . . A wonderfully ironic hymn to the city of Barcelona.”—&lt;em&gt;Diari de Balears&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another day in Barcelona, another slimy politician’s wife is suspected of infidelity. Lluis Font discovers a portrait of his wife in an exhibition that leads him to conclude he is being cuckolded by the artist. Concerned only about the potential political fallout, he hires twins Eduard and Pep, private detectives with a supposed knack for helping the wealthy with their “dirty laundry.” Their office is adorned with false doors leading to nonexistent private rooms, a mysterious secretary who is always away, and a broken laptop computer picked up on the street. The case turns ugly when Font’s wife is found poisoned by a &lt;em&gt;marron glacé &lt;/em&gt;from a box of sweets delivered anonymously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a deftly plotted, bitingly funny mystery novel. A satire of Catalan politics and a fascinating insight into the life and habits of Barcelona’s inhabitants, diurnal and nocturnal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teresa Solana &lt;/strong&gt;lives in Barcelona. Born in 1962, she studied philosophy and worked as a literary translator and essayist. She has written several novels kept quietly in her drawer. &lt;em&gt;A Not So Perfect Crime&lt;/em&gt;, her first published title, won the 2007 Brigada 21 Prize for the best Catalan mystery novel.</description>

  <description>EMBARK ON A TURBULENT JOURNEY THROUGH A RAVAGED COUNTRYSIDE... WITH ONLY LIARS FOR COMPANY. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this extraordinary novel, Karen Maitland delivers a dazzling reinterpretation of Chaucer's&lt;/em&gt; The Canterbury Tales-- &lt;em&gt;an ingenious alchemy of history, mystery, and powerful human drama.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The years is 1348. The Black Plague grips the country. In a world ruled by faith and fear, nine desperate strangers, brought together by chance, attempt to outrun the certain death that is running inexorably toward them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each member of this motley company has a story to tell. From Camelot, the relic-seller who will become the group's leader, the Cygnus, the one-armed storyteller...from the strange silent child called Narigorn to a painter and his pregnant wife, each has a secret. None are what they seems. And one among them conceals the darkest secret of all--propelling these liars to a destiny they never saw coming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magical, heart-quickening, and raw, &lt;em&gt;Company of Liars&lt;/em&gt; is a work of vaulting imagination from a powerful new voice in historical fiction.</description>

  <description>Despite being a founder of both the United States and the French Republic, the creator of the phrase United States of America, and the author of three of the biggest bestsellers of the eighteenth century, Thomas Paine is perhaps the least well known  and the most controversial  of the American founding fathers. Unlike such friends and allies as Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, and John Adams, the world's first crusader for the public good has always remained a somewhat indistinct figure. How this lower- class British tradesman managed not only to have written the cornerstone of American democracy, &lt;em&gt;Common Sense&lt;/em&gt;, but become a revered citizen of the world are questions that have challenged historians for centuries, and have more often than not left us with biographies that are more monumental than illuminating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Craig Nelson's &lt;em&gt;Thomas Paine&lt;/em&gt; we now have a rich and vivid portrait that does justice to this towering figure of our history, one that brings him to life against the dramatic backdrop of the Revolutionary era and the heady intellectual exhilaration of the Age of Enlightenment. Nelson traces Paine's path from his years as a struggling London mechanic to his journey to seek his fortune in the New World (in which he arrived on a stretcher, after a nearly deadly bout of shipboard typhus); from his early career as a crusading pamphleteer to his emergence as the heroic voice of revolutionary fervor on two continents; from his miraculous escape from execution in Paris during The Terror to his final years in America, where the once-lionized patriot spent his final days nearly impoverished and in the throes of dementia. Throughout his insightful portrait Nelson takes full account of this paradoxical figure, whom some contemporaries judged as brilliant and charismatic and others disparaged as abrasive and egotistical, a cherished patriot who was nonetheless dismissed by John Adams as a disastrous meteor and Teddy Roosevelt as a dirty little atheist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Five years in the making, drawing on both the most recent scholarship and the archives of Philadelphia, Washington, New York, Paris, London, Lewes, and Thetford, &lt;em&gt;Thomas Paine&lt;/em&gt; restores this often misunderstood man to the stature that he deserves, and reveals him, a man who famously asserted that we have it in our power to begin the world over again, to be as much a man of our own time as a paragon of the Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Second in the Kurt Wallander series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweden, winter, 1991. Inspector Kurt Wallander and his team receive an anonymous tip-off. A few days later a life raft is washed up on a beach. In it are two men, dressed in expensive suits, shot dead. The dead men were criminals, victims of what seems to have been a gangland hit. But what appears to be an open-and-shut case soon takes on a far more sinister aspect. Wallander travels across the Baltic Sea, to Riga in Latvia, where he is plunged into a frozen, alien world of police surveillance, scarcely veiled threats, and lies. Doomed always to be one step behind the shadowy figures he pursues, only Wallander's obstinate desire to see that justice is done brings the truth to light</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From a beloved master of crime fiction, &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper&lt;/em&gt; is one of many classic novels featuring Travis McGee, the hard-boiled detective who lives on a houseboat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; He had done a big favor for her husband, then for the lady herself. Now she’s dead, and Travis McGee finds that Helena Pearson Trescott had one last request of him: to find out why her beautiful daughter Maureen keeps trying to kill herself. But what can a devil-may-care beach bum do for a young troubled mind?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The Travis McGee novels are among the finest works of fiction ever penned by an American author.”—Jonathan Kellerman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; McGee makes his way to the prosperous town of Fort Courtney, Florida, where he realizes pretty quickly that something’s just not right. Not only has Maureen’s doctor killed herself, but a string of murders and suicides are piling up—and no one seems to have any answers.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Just when it seems that things can’t get any stranger, McGee becomes the lead suspect in the murder of a local nurse. As if Maureen didn’t have enough problems, the man on a mission to save her will have to save himself first—before time runs out.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features a new Introduction by Lee Child&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s been called a journeyman. Even Paul wouldn’t dispute that classification. Regardless, Bill Simmons, ESPN.com’s “The Sports Guy,” has said of Paul Shirley, “We could finally have an answer to the question ‘What would it be like if one of our friends was an NBA player?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no denying that Paul Shirley is the closest thing pro basketball’s got to Odysseus. In Homeric fashion, he has logged time practically everywhere in the roundball universe, from six NBA cities to pro leagues in Spain and Greece to North America’s pro ball Siberia, the minor leagues. Hell, he’s even played in the real Siberia. And in Can I Keep My Jersey?, Shirley finally puts down roots long enough to deliver one of the great locker-room chronicles of the modern age. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With sharp elbows and an even sharper wit, Shirley–whose writings have been described as “wildly entertaining” by The Wall Street Journal–drops hilarious commentary, revealing which teams have the best cheerleaders (he’s spent many a time-out watching them ply their trade), why Christ is rapidly becoming every team’s “sixth man,” and even the best ways to get bloodstains out of your game uniform, using only an ordinary bar of soap and a hotel bathroom sink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From sharing the court with Kobe and Shaq to perusing the food court at some mall in a bush-league burg; from taking pregame layups to getting laid out by a stray knee from an NBA power forward; from hopping a limo to the team’s charter jet to dashing to catch the van home from a B-league game in Tijuana, Shirley dishes on what it’s like to try to make it as a professional athlete. Can I Keep My Jersey? is a rollicking, thoughtful, even thought-provoking insider’s look at a pro baller’s life on the fringe. Like Jim Bouton’s Ball Four or John Feinstein’s A Season on the Brink, Shirley’s odyssey deserves to find a home on every sports fan’s bookshelf.</description>

  <description>Stewart O'Nan has been called the bard of the working class and has now crafted a frank and funny yet emotionally resonant tale set within a vivid workaday world seldom seen in contemporary fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perched in the far corner of a run-down New England mall, the Red Lobster hasn't been making its numbers and headquarters has pulled the plug. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But manager Manny DeLeon of this New Britain Connecticut restaurant still needs to navigate a tricky last shift. With only four shopping days left until Christmas, Manny must convince his near-mutinous staff to hunker down and serve the final onslaught of hungry retirees, lunatics, and holiday office parties. All the while, he's wondering how to handle the waitress he's still in love with, his pregnant girlfriend at home, and the perfect present he still needs to buy.</description>

  <description>Felix Castor has reluctantly returned to exorcism after a successful case convinces him that he really can do some good with his abilities---"good," of course, being a relative term when dealing with the undead. His friend Rafi is still possessed, the succubus Ajulutsikael (Juliet to her friends) still technically has a contract on him, and he's still dirt poor. &lt;br&gt; Doing some consulting for the local cops helps pay the bills, but Castor needs a big private job to really fill the hole in his bank account. That's what he &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt;. What he &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt; is a seemingly insignificant "missing ghost" case that inexorably drags him and his loved ones into the middle of a horrific plot to raise one of hell's fiercest demons. &lt;br&gt; When satanists, stolen spirits, sacrifice farms, and haunted churches all appear on the same police report, the name Felix Castor can't be too far behind...</description>

  <description>This is not your typical Zen book. Brad Warner, a young punk who grew up to be a Zen master, spares no one. This bold new approach to the "Why?" of Zen Buddhism is as strongly grounded in the tradition of Zen as it is utterly revolutionary. Warner's voice is hilarious, and he calls on the wisdom of everyone from punk and pop culture icons to the Buddha himself to make sure his points come through loud and clear. As it prods readers to question everything, "Hardcore Zen" is both an approach and a departure, leaving behind the soft and lyrical for the gritty and stark perspective of a new generation. &lt;br&gt;The subtitle says it all: there has never been a book like this.</description>

  <description>At a lush villa on the sun-soaked island of Madeira, Martin Radford is given a second chance. His life ruined by scandal, Martin holds in his hands the leather-bound journal of another ruined man, former British cabinet minister Edwin Strafford. What’s more, Martin is being offered a job—to return to England and investigate the rise and fall of Strafford, an ambitious young politician whose downfall, in 1910, is as mysterious as the strange deaths that still haunt his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Martin is intrigued by Strafford’ s story, by the man’s overwhelming love for a beautiful suffragette, by her inexplicable rejection of him and their love affair’s political repercussions. But as he retraces Strafford’s ruination, Martin realizes that Strafford did not fall by chance; he was pushed. Suddenly Martin, who has not cared for many people in his life, cares desperately—about a man’s mysterious death and a family’s terrible secret, about a love beyond reckoning and betrayal beyond imagining. Most of all Martin cares because the story he is uncovering is not yet over—and among the men and women still caught in its web, Martin himself may be the most vulnerable of all….</description>

  <description>Lieutenant Mario Conde is suffering from a terrible New Year's Eve hangover. Though it's the middle of a weekend, he is asked to urgently investigate the mysterious disappearance of Rafael Morin, a high-level business manager in the Cuban nomenklatura. Conde remembered Morin from their student days: good-looking, brilliant, a 'reliable comrade' who always got what he wanted, including Tamara, the girl Conde was after. But Rafael Morin's exemplary rise from a poor barrio and picture-perfect life hides more than one suspicious episode worthy of investigation. While pursuing the case in a decaying but adored Havana, Conde confronts his lost love for Tamara and the dreams and illusions of his generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for the Havana Quartet:&lt;/strong&gt; “Overlaid with a rich smoky patina, an atmosphere that reeks of slums and riches, cigar smoke and exotic perfumes. Havana Black is a strong tasting book, a rich feast of wit and feeling.”—&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Drenched with that beguiling otherness so appealing to fans of mysteries of other cultures, it will also appeal to those who appreciate the sultry lyricism of James Lee Burke.”—&lt;em&gt;Booklist &lt;br&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;A great plot, perfectly executed with huge atmosphere. You can almost smell the cigar smoke, rum and cheap women.&lt;em&gt;”—Daily Mirror &lt;br&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Havana Red, another winner from Bitter Lemon Press.”—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>America, 1787. Ethan Saunders, once among General Washington’s most valued spies, is living in disgrace after an accusation of treason cost him his reputation. But an opportunity for redemption comes calling when Saunders’s old enemy, Alexander Hamilton, draws him into a struggle with bitter rival Thomas Jefferson over the creation of the Bank of the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, on the western Pennsylvania frontier, Joan Maycott and her husband, a Revolutionary War veteran, hope for a better life and a chance for prosperity. But the Maycotts’ success on an isolated frontier attracts the brutal attention of men who threaten to destroy them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their causes intertwine, Joan and Saunders–both patriots in their own way–find themselves on opposing sides of a plot that could tear apart a fragile new nation.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Anathem&lt;/em&gt;, the latest invention by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Baroque Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, is a magnificent creation: a work of great scope, intelligence, and imagination that ushers readers into a recognizable—yet strangely inverted—world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside "saecular" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside—the Extramuros—for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates—at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious "extras" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was "collected." But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros—a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose—as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world—as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.</description>

  <description>The most successful may not be the smartest or hardest working. Shift rather to where they are from. What is their culture, family, generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing? Where and when were they born? From Asian maths students  to the British Beatles, stereotypes can be addressed through different eyes.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mean streets of New York City meet the brutality of Irish gangland in Ken Bruen and Jason Starr's &lt;em&gt;Bust,&lt;/em&gt; the first collaboration ever between these two crime fiction icons. As cold-hearted as it is darkly comedic, this noir mystery has it all: illicit sex, blackmail, double-crossing, and a virtual cornucopia of unsuspecting murder victims. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max Fisher, aging CEO of NetWorld, is not a happy man. But if he can somehow figure out a way to get rid of his nagging wife, he'll be able to carry on with his wildly self-indulgent, Viagra-fueled existence of drunken business meetings, excursions to seedy strip joints, and, most important, his ongoing affair with his executive assistant -- an Irish-American bombshell named Angela. Fisher hires a hit man, a former IRA thug nicknamed Popeye, to kill the "redundant" wife; but what the balding chief executive doesn't realize is that Popeye is secretly Angela's boyfriend -- and the murder they're planning is another one altogether. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard Case Crime Editor Charles Ardai describes &lt;em&gt;Bust:&lt;/em&gt; "In anyone else's hands (except maybe the late Charles Willeford's), I'm not sure this very dark black comedy would've come off -- there is not one likable character in the entire book (well, maybe one, but he doesn't last long) and the selfishness and viciousness with which the assorted heels and sociopaths pursue their catastrophic schemes at each other's expense is breathtaking." Who says sleazy crime fiction can't be fun? &lt;em&gt;Bust&lt;/em&gt; is an absolute gem of a novel -- a must-read. &lt;em&gt;Paul Goat Allen&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Throughout the centuries, royal mistresses have been worshiped, feared, envied, and reviled. They set the fashions, encouraged the arts, and, in some cases, ruled nations. Eleanor Herman's Sex with Kings takes us into the throne rooms and bedrooms of Europe's most powerful monarchs. Alive with flamboyant characters, outrageous humor, and stirring poignancy, this glittering tale of passion and politics chronicles five hundred years of scintillating women and the kings who loved them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiously, the main function of a royal mistress was not to provide the king with sex but with companionship. Forced to marry repulsive foreign princesses, kings sought solace with women of their own choice. And what women they were! From Madame de Pompadour, the famous mistress of Louis XV, who kept her position for nineteen years despite her frigidity, to modern-day Camilla Parker-Bowles, who usurped none other than the glamorous Diana, Princess of Wales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The successful royal mistress made herself irreplaceable. She was ready to converse gaily with him when she was tired, make love until all hours when she was ill, and cater to his every whim. Wearing a mask of beaming delight over any and all discomforts, she was never to be exhausted, complaining, or grief-stricken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True, financial rewards for services rendered were of royal proportions -- some royal mistresses earned up to $200 million in titles, pensions, jewels, and palaces. Some kings allowed their mistresses to exercise unlimited political power. But for all its grandeur, a royal court was a scorpion's nest of insatiable greed, unquenchable lust, and vicious ambition. Hundreds of beautiful women vied to unseat the royal mistress. Many would suffer the slings and arrows of negative public opinion, some met with tragic ends and were pensioned off to make room for younger women. But the royal mistress often had the last laugh, as she lived well and richly off the fruits of her "sins."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the dawn of time, power has been a mighty aphrodisiac. With diaries, personal letters, and diplomatic dispatches, Eleanor Herman's trailblazing research reveals the dynamics of sex and power, rivalry and revenge, at the most brilliant courts of Europe. Wickedly witty and endlessly entertaining, Sex with Kings is a chapter of women's history that has remained unwritten -- until now.</description>

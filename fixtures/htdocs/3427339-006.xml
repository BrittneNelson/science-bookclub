  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Optimist's Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is a compact and inward-looking  little novel, a Pulitzer Prize winner that's slight of page yet big of heart.  The optimist in question is 71-year-old Judge McKelva, who has come to a  New Orleans hospital from Mount Salus, Mississippi, complaining of a "disturbance" in his vision. To his daughter, Laurel, it's as rare for  him to admit "self-concern" as it is for him to be sick, and she  immediately flies down from Chicago to be by his side. The subsequent operation on  the judge's eye goes well, but the recovery does not. He lies still with both eyes  heavily bandaged, growing ever more passive until finally--with some help from the shockingly vulgar Fay, his wife of two years--he simply dies. Together Fay and Laurel travel to Mount Salus to bury him, and the novel begins the inward spiral that leads Laurel to  the moment when "all she had found had found her," when the "deepest spring  in her heart had uncovered itself" and begins to flow again.&lt;p&gt;  Not much actually &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt; in the rest of the book--Fay's  low-rent relatives arrive for the funeral, a bird flies down the chimney and is trapped in the hall--and yet Welty manages to compress the richness of  an entire life within its pages. This is a world, after all, in which a  set of complex relationships can be conveyed by the phrase "I know his whole family" or by the criticism "When he brought her here to your house,  she had very little idea of how to separate an egg."  Does such a place  exist anymore? It is vanishing even from this novel, and the personification of its vanishing is none other than Fay--petulant, graceless, childish, with neither the passion nor the imagination to love. Welty expends a  lot of vindictive energy on Fay and her kin, who must be the most  small-minded, mean-mouthed clan since the Snopeses hit Frenchman's Bend. There's more than just class snobbery at work here (though that surely comes into it too). As Welty sees it, they are a special historical tribe who exult  in grieving because they have come to be good at it, and who seethe with resentment from the day they are born. They have come "out of all times  of trouble, past or future--the great, interrelated family of those who  never know the meaning of what has happened to them." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Fay belongs to the future, as she makes clear; it's Laurel who belongs  to the past--Welty's own chosen territory. In her fine memoir, &lt;em&gt;One Writer's Beginnings&lt;/em&gt;, Welty described the way art could shine a light back "as when your train makes a curve, showing that there has  been a mountain of meaning rising behind you on the way you've come." Here, in one of her most autobiographical works, the past joins seamlessly with  the present in a masterful evocation of grief, memory, loss, and love.  Beautifully written, moving but never mawkish, &lt;em&gt;The Optimist's Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is Eudora Welty's greatest achievement--which is high  praise indeed. &lt;em&gt;--Mary Park&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Return of the Native&lt;/em&gt; combines all of the great themes of Thomas Hardy's works. Wonderful descriptions of the English countryside underscore a rural tale of doomed love, passion, and melancholy. The novel opens with the famous portrait of Egdon Heath, the wild, haunted Wessex moor that D. H. Lawrence called 'the real stuff of tragedy' of the book. The heath's changing face mirrors the fortunes of the farmers, innkeepers, sons, mothers, and lovers that populate the novel. The 'native' is Clym Yeobright, coming home from a successful, cosmopolitan life in Paris, a place far removed from the unforgiving landscape of Egdon Heath. He finds that his cousin, Thomasin, is about to marry Damon Wildeve, a rakish and confused man with a lover, Eustacia Vye, whom he cannot forget. Eustacia is willful, ambitious, and dangerously alluring. Hardy describes her as 'the raw material of a divinity. . . . She had Pagan eyes, full of nocturnal mysteries.' As the characters are drawn together, they scheme and maneuver, often under the eye of Diggory Venn, the reddleman whose relentless virtue must find its reward at the violent climax of the novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Return of the Native&lt;/em&gt; was first published in Belgravia magazine in twelve parts in 1878 and revised by Hardy in 1895 and in 1912, when he produced the definitive Wessex Edition of all of his novels. Described on publication by Harper's magazine as 'delightful reading,' it has retained its power to move and absorb the reader and stands with &lt;em&gt;The Mayor of Casterbridge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Jude the Obscure&lt;/em&gt; among the finest of Hardy's works.</description>

  <description>Almost Transparent Blue is a brutal tale of lost youth in a Japanese port town close to an American military base. Murakami's image-intensive narrative paints a portrait of a group of friends locked in a destructive cycle of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll. The novel is all but plotless, but the raw and often violent prose takes us on a rollercoaster ride through reality and hallucination, highs and lows, in which the characters and their experiences come vividly to life. Trapped in passivity, they gain neither passion nor pleasure from their adventures. Yet out of the alienation, boredom and underlying rage and grief emerges a strangely quiet and almost equally shocking beauty. Ryu Murakami's first novel, Almost Transparent Blue won the coveted Akutagawa literary prize and became an instant bestseller. Representing a sharp and conscious turning away from the introspective trend of postwar Japanese literature, it polarized critics and public alike and soon attracted international attention as an alternative view of modern Japan.</description>

  <description>Ellis Hock never believed that he would return to Africa. He runs an old-fashioned menswear store in a small town in Massachusetts but still dreams of his Eden, the four years he spent in Malawi with the Peace Corps, cut short when he had to return to take over the family business. When his wife leaves him, and he is on his own, he realizes that there is one place for him to go: back to his village in Malawi, on the remote Lower River, where he can be happy again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arriving at the dusty village, he finds it transformed: the school he built is a ruin, the church and clinic are gone, and poverty and apathy have set in among the people. They remember him—the White Man with no fear of snakes—and welcome him. But is his new life, his journey back, an escape or a trap?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interweaving memory and desire, hope and despair, salvation and damnation, this is a hypnotic, compelling, and brilliant return to a terrain about which no one has ever written better than Theroux.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The novel that inspired the now-classic film &lt;em&gt;The Caine Mutiny&lt;/em&gt; and the hit Broadway play &lt;em&gt;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&lt;/em&gt;, Herman Wouk's boldly dramatic, brilliantly entertaining novel of life-and mutiny-on a Navy warship in the Pacific theater was immediately embraced, upon its original publication in 1951, as one of the first serious works of American fiction to grapple with the moral complexities and the human consequences of World War II. In the intervening half century, &lt;em&gt;The Caine Mutiny&lt;/em&gt; has become a perennial favorite of readers young and old, has sold millions of copies throughout the world, and has achieved the status of a modern classic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"A lost world, man-eating tribesmen, lush impenetrable jungles, stranded American fliers (one of them a dame with great gams, for heaven's sake), a startling rescue mission. This is a true story made in heaven for a writer as talented as Mitchell Zuckoff. Whew--what an utterly compelling &amp;amp; deeply satisfying read!"--Simon Winchester&lt;br&gt;Former Boston Globe reporter Mitchell Zuckoff unleashes the exhilarating, untold story of an extraordinary World War II rescue mission, where a plane crash in the South Pacific plunged a trio of U.S. military personnel into a land that time forgot. Fans of Hampton Sides' Ghost Soldiers, Marcus Luttrell's Lone Survivor &amp;amp; David Grann's The Lost City of Z will be captivated by Zuckoff's masterfully recounted, all-true story of danger, daring, determination &amp;amp; discovery in jungle-clad New Guinea during the final days of WWII.</description>

  <description>Upon the orders of Kemal Ataturk, the fez replaced the turban as Turkey's national headdress. Outlawed completely in 1925, the turban is viewed as a symbol of Turkish backwardness. While living and teaching in Turkey for several years, Jeremy Seals developed an obsession for the fez, a hat he believes has come to symbolize the soul of the country. Through interviews with villagers and historical essays, Seals chronicles his journey through Turkey, to areas both metropolitan and remote, to find the heart of the country as embodied by its national head gear. </description>

  <description>Over the course of his 60 years, Christopher Hitchens has been a citizen of both the United States and the United Kingdom. He has been both a socialist opposed to the war in Vietnam and a supporter of the U.S. war against Islamic extremism in Iraq. He has been both a foreign correspondent in some of the world's most dangerous places and a legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable thirst for alcohol and literature. He is a fervent atheist, raised as a Christian, by a mother whose Jewish heritage was not revealed to him until her suicide. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In other words, Christopher Hitchens contains multitudes. He sees all sides of an argument. And he believes the personal is political.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is the story of his life, lived large.</description>

  <description>The long-awaited new novel from Margaret Atwood. "The Year of the Flood" is a dystopic masterpiece and a testament to her visionary power. &lt;br&gt;The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible. &lt;br&gt;Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers . . . &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away . . . &lt;br&gt;By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, "The Year of the Flood" is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive.</description>

  <description>A phenomenal worldwide bestseller for more than forty years, Richard Adams's &lt;em&gt;Watership Down&lt;/em&gt; is a timeless classic and one of the most beloved novels of all time. Set in England's Downs, a once idyllic rural landscape, this stirring tale of adventure, courage and survival follows a band of very special creatures on their flight from the intrusion of man and the certain destruction of their home. Led by a stouthearted pair of brothers, they journey forth from their native Sandleford Warren through the harrowing trials posed by predators and adversaries, to a mysterious promised land and a more perfect society.</description>

  <description>"Gentleman Jim" Scott was a brilliant magnetic general. Like a lot of people, he believed the President was ruining the country. Unlike anyone else, he had the power to do something about it, something unprecedented and terrifying. Colonel "Jiggs" Casey was the marine who accidentally stumbled onto the plot. At first he refused to believe it; then he risked his life and career to inform the President. Jordan Lyman was President of the United States. By the time he was finally able to convince himself of the appalling truth, he had only seven days left to stop a brilliant, seemingly irresistible military plot to seize control of the government of the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven Days in May is a political thriller novel written by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II and published in 1962. It was made into a motion picture in 1964, with a screenplay by Rod Serling, directed by John Frankenheimer, and starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story is said to have been influenced by the right-wing anti-Communist political activities of General Edwin A. Walker after he resigned from the military. The author, Knebel, got the idea for the book after interviewing then-Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay.</description>

  <description>It's the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune--and remarkable power--to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved--that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt--among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life--and love--in the real world he's always been so desperate to escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world at stake. &lt;br&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize. &lt;br&gt;Are you ready?</description>

  <description>Tom Franklin's narrative power and flair for characterization have been compared to the likes of Harper Lee, Flannery O'Connor, Elmore Leonard, and Cormac McCarthy. &lt;p&gt;Now the Edgar Award-winning author returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far; an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas "32" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the county— and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>This remarkable collection of stories, first published in 1872, includes Green Tea, The Familiar, Mr. Justice Harbottle, The Room in the Dragon Volant, and Carmilla. The five stories are purported to be cases by Dr. Hesselius, a 'metaphysical' doctor, who is willing to consider the ghosts both as real and as hallucinatory obsessions. The reader's doubtful anxiety mimics that of the protagonist, and each story thus creates that atmosphere of mystery which is the supernatural experience. This new annotated edition includes an introduction, notes on the text, and explanatory notes.</description>

  <description>Hyenas marks the always-welcome return of Joe R. Lansdale’s most indelible fictional creations: Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. Once again, the embattled but resilient duo find themselves enmeshed in a web of danger, duplicity, and escalating mayhem. The result is a tightly compressed novella that is at once harrowing, hilarious, and utterly impossible to put down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story begins with a barroom brawl that is both brutal and oddly comic. The ensuing drama encompasses abduction, betrayal, robbery, and murder, ending with a lethal confrontation in an East Texas pasture. Along the way, readers are treated to moments of raucous, casually profane humor and to scenes of vivid, crisply described violence, all related in that unmistakable Lansdale voice. An essential addition to an already imposing body of work, Hyenas shows us both the author and his signature characters at their inimitable best. It doesn’t get better than this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hyenas also includes the bonus Hap Collins short story, “The Boy Who Became Invisible”.</description>

  <description>Mix hundreds of millions of dollars in petroleum reserves; rapacious oil barons and crooked politicians; under-the-table payoffs; murder, suicide, and blackmail; White House cronyism; and the excesses of the Jazz Age. The result: the granddaddy of all American political scandals, Teapot Dome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Teapot Dome Scandal&lt;/em&gt;, acclaimed author Laton McCartney tells the amazing, complex, and at times ribald story of how Big Oil handpicked Warren G. Harding, an obscure Ohio senator, to serve as our twenty-third president. Harding and his so-called “oil cabinet” made it possible for the oilmen to secure vast oil reserves that had been set aside for use by the U.S. Navy. In exchange, the oilmen paid off senior government officials, bribed newspaper publishers, and covered the GOP campaign debt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When news of the scandal finally emerged, the consequences were disastrous for the nation and for the principles in the plot to bilk the taxpayers: Harding’s administration was hamstrung; Americans’ confidence in their government plummeted; Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall was indicted, convicted, and incarcerated; and others implicated in the affair suffered similarly dire fates. Stonewalling by members of Harding’s circle kept a lid on the story–witnesses developed “faulty” memories or fled the country, and  important documents went missing–but contemporary records newly made available to McCartney reveal a shocking, revelatory picture of just how far-reaching the affair was, how high the stakes, and how powerful the conspirators.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In giving us a gimlet-eyed but endlessly entertaining portrait of the men and women who made a tempest of Teapot Dome, Laton McCartney again displays his gift for faithfully rendering history with the narrative touch of an accomplished novelist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/em&gt;, Flannery O’Connor’s astonishing and haunting first novel, is a classic of twentieth-century literature. It is a story of Hazel Motes, a twenty-two-year-old caught in an unending struggle against his innate, desperate faith. He falls under the spell of a "blind" street preacher named Asa Hawks and his degenerate fifteen-year-old daughter, Lily Sabbath. In an ironic, malicious gesture of his own non-faith, and to prove himself a greater cynic than Hawkes, Hazel Motes founds The Church of God Without Christ, but is still thwarted in his efforts to lose God. He meets Enoch Emery, a young man with "wise blood," who leads him to a mummified holy child, and whose crazy maneuvers are a manifestation of Hazel's existential struggles. This tale of redemption, retribution, false prophets, blindness, blindings, and wisdoms gives us one of the most riveting characters in twentieth-century American fiction.</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates &lt;/em&gt;comes the unforgettable life of John Cheever (1912–1982), a man who spent much of his career impersonating a perfect suburban gentleman, the better to become one of the foremost chroniclers of postwar America. “I was born into no true class,” Cheever mused in his journal, “and it was my decision, early in life, to insinuate myself into the middle class, like a spy, so that I would have an advantageous position of attack, but I seem now and then to have forgotten my mission and to have taken my disguises too seriously.” Written with unprecedented access to essential sources—including Cheever’s massive journal, only a fraction of which has ever been published—Blake Bailey’s biography reveals the troubled but strangely lovable man behind the disguises, an artist who delighted in the everyday radiance of the world while yearning, above all, “to be illustrious.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheever’s was a soul in conflict: he was a proud Yankee who flaunted his lineage while deploring the provincialism of his Quincy, Massachusetts, family circle; a high-school dropout who published his first story at eighteen; a pioneer of suburban realist fiction who continually pushed the boundaries of realism; a dire alcoholic who recovered to write the great novel &lt;em&gt;Falconer;&lt;/em&gt; a secret bisexual who struggled with his longings and his fierce homophobia in a revolving door of self-loathing and hedonism. We see a man who concealed his anxieties behind the mask of a genial Westchester squire—a paterfamilias in Brooks Brothers clothes whose world was peopled by legendary writers and beautiful women (Malcolm Cowley, Saul Bellow, William Maxwell, Hope Lange, and John Updike, among them); whose groundbreaking work landed him on the covers of &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Newsweek;&lt;/em&gt; a man whose demons and desperation were never quite vanquished by the joy he found in his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blake Bailey has written a luminous biography, a revelation of a writer of timeless fiction and of the man behind the page.</description>

  <description>On June 19, 1953, Harry Truman got up early, packed the trunk of his Chrysler New Yorker, and did something no other former president has done before or since: he hit the road. No Secret Service protection. No traveling press. Just Harry and his childhood sweetheart Bess, off to visit old friends, take in a Broadway play, celebrate their wedding anniversary in the Big Apple, and blow a bit of the money he’d just received to write his memoirs. Hopefully incognito. In this lively history, author Matthew Algeo meticulously details how Truman’s plan to blend in went wonderfully awry. Fellow diners, bellhops, cabbies, squealing teenagers at a Future Homemakers of America convention, and one very by-the-book Pennsylvania state trooper--all unknowingly conspired to blow his cover. Algeo revisits the Trumans’ route, staying at the same hotels and eating at the same diners, and takes readers on brief detours into topics such as the postwar American auto industry, McCarthyism, the nation’s highway system, and the decline of Main Street America. By the end of the 2,500-mile journey, you will have a new and heartfelt appreciation for America’s last citizen-president.</description>

  <description>In About Schmidt, Albert Schmidt, last of New York's white shoe lawyers, was almost down for the count. After the untimely death of the wife who was the anchor in his life, he was pushed out of his firm and into early retirement -- with not a little help from the crass yuppie his beloved, perfectly bred daughter had mercilessly decided to marry. The only glimmer of salvation was his unlikely, and mysteriously dangerous, love affair with Carry, a Puerto Rican waitress younger than his daughter.Now in Schmidt Delivered, Louis Begley revisits his anti-hero -- triumphantly back from the brink -- to give us a winning story of the tables turned. Within the modest luxury of his East Hampton home, Schmidtie rediscovers domestic bliss with Carrie. He keeps his own hours and selects his own society, even as he becomes increasingly ensnared by the odd oriental billionaire Michael Mansour, who seeks Schmidtie's worldly expertise in his plots to better the universe. Among his other satisfactions: the cold dish of "I told you so" he serves himself as his humorless daughter's marriage to the base Jon Riker hits the skids. Where will it all lead? Can May and December remain on the same calendar as the sun sets? Can the irrepressible Schmidtie remain content in his deck chair indefinitely?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all the elegance and mordant wit we have come to expect of him, Louis Begley has created a magnificent story of recovery from late-life disaster.</description>

  <description>Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? Award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi delivers one of the most highly acclaimed science fiction novels of the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>Widely regarded as the precursor of the modern mystery and suspense novels, The Moonstone tells of the events surrounding the disappearance of a mysterious (and cursed) yellow diamond. T. S. Eliot called it 'the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels'. It contains a number of ideas which became common tropes of the genre, including a crime being investigated by talented amateurs who happen to be present when it is committed, and two police officers who exemplify respectively the 'Scotland Yard bungler' and the skilled, professional detective.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Part noir, part psychedelic romp, all Thomas Pynchon- private eye Doc Sportello comes, occasionally, out of a marijuana haze to watch the end of an era as free love slips away and paranoia creeps in with the L.A. fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's been awhile since Doc Sportello has seen his ex-girlfriend. Suddenly out of nowhere she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. Easy for her to say. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that "love" is another of those words going around at the moment, like "trip" or "groovy," except that this one usually leads to trouble. Despite which he soon finds himself drawn into a bizarre tangle of motives and passions whose cast of characters includes surfers, hustlers, dopers and rockers, a murderous loan shark, a tenor sax player working undercover, an ex-con with a swastika tattoo and a fondness for Ethel Merman, and a mysterious entity known as the Golden Fang, which may only be a tax dodge set up by some dentists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this lively yarn, Thomas Pynchon, working in an unaccustomed genre, provides a classic illustration of the principle that if you can remember the sixties, you weren't there . . . or . . . if you were there, then you . . . or, wait, is it . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Far in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone harbouring an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his &lt;br&gt;distress...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huxley's ingenious fantasy of the future sheds a blazing light on the present and is considered to be his most enduring masterpiece.</description>

  <description>What could he tell her now, now that he was forty and she was no longer seventeen?.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is a failed writer turned diplomat, an anarchist learning the value of discipline. He moves in a world which takes him from the Australian wilderness to the conference rooms of Vienna and Geneva; from the whore-house to warzone he feels the pull of the genetic spiral of his ancestry. At the sharp axis of his mid-life he scans the memorabilia of his feelings in the hope of giving answers..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His story is told with characteristic Moorhouse style - candid, wryly insightful and morbidly comic - and, in this resonant and acclaimed book achieves a new virtuosity.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of &lt;strong&gt;The Tortilla Curtain&lt;/strong&gt;, T.C. Boyle blends idealism and satire in a story that addresses the universal questions of human love and the survival of the species. In the year 2025 global warming is a reality, the biosphere has collapsed, and 75-year-old environmentalist Ty Tierwater is eking out a living as care-taker of a pop star's private zoo when his second ex-wife re-enters his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Both gritty and surreal, &lt;strong&gt;A Friend of the Earth&lt;/strong&gt; represents a high-water mark in Boyle's career-his deep streak of social concern is effortlessly blended here with genuine compassion for his characters and the spirit of sheer exhilarating playfulness readers have come to expect from his work.</description>

  <description>James Lee Burke's eagerly awaited new novel finds Detective Dave Robicheaux back in New Iberia, Louisiana, and embroiled in the most harrowing and dangerous case of his career. Seven young women in neighboring Jefferson Davis Parish have been brutally murdered. While the crimes have all the telltale signs of a serial killer, the death of Bernadette Latiolais, a high school honor student, doesn't fit: she is not the kind of hapless and marginalized victim psychopaths usually prey upon. Robicheaux and his best friend, Clete Purcel, confront Herman Stanga, a notorious pimp and crack dealer whom both men despise. When Stanga turns up dead shortly after a fierce beating by Purcel, in front of numerous witnesses, the case takes a nasty turn, and Clete's career and life are hanging by threads over the abyss. Adding to Robicheaux's troubles is the matter of his daughter, Alafair, on leave from Stanford Law to put the finishing touches on her novel. Her literary pursuit has led her into the arms of Kermit Abelard, celebrated novelist and scion of a once prominent Louisiana family whose fortunes are slowly sinking into the corruption of Louisiana's subculture. Abelard's association with bestselling ex-convict author Robert Weingart, a man who uses and discards people like Kleenex, causes Robicheaux to fear that Alafair might be destroyed by the man she loves. As his daughter seems to drift away from him, he wonders if he has become a victim of his own paranoia. But as usual, Robicheaux's instincts are proven correct and he finds himself dealing with a level of evil that is greater than any enemy he has confronted in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against the backdrop of an Edenic paradise threatened by pernicious forces, James Lee Burke's "The Glass Rainbow "is already being hailed as perhaps the best novel in the Robicheaux series.</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;The Yellow-Lighted Bookshop&lt;/em&gt;, Buzbee, a former bookseller and sales representative, celebrates the unique experience of the bookstore--the smell and touch of books, getting lost in the deep canyons of shelves, and the silent community of readers. He shares his passion for books, which began with ordering through &lt;em&gt;The Weekly Reader&lt;/em&gt; in grade school. Interwoven throughout is an historical account of the bookseller's trade--from the great Alexandria library with an estimated one million papyrus scrolls to Sylvia Beach's famous Paris bookstore, Shakespeare and Company, which led to the effort to publish and sell James Joyce's &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; during the 1920s.</description>

  <description>Praise for David Downing: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“[Downing]’s excellent at building suspense . . . and shows a keen eye for describing people and places.”—&lt;em&gt;Sacramento Bee&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“An extraordinary evocation of Nazi Germany on the eve of war, the smell of cruelty seeping through the clean modern surface.”—C. J. Sansom, author of &lt;em&gt;Sovereign&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summer, 1939. British journalist John Russell has just been granted American citizenship in exchange for agreeing to work for American intelligence when his girlfriend Effi is arrested by the Gestapo. Russell hoped his new nationality would let him safely stay in Berlin with Effi and his son, but now he’s being blackmailed. To free Effi, he must agree to work for the Nazis. They know he has Soviet connections and want him to pass them false intelligence. Russell consents, but secretly offers his services to the Soviets instead—not for anything too dangerous, though, and only if they’ll sneak him and Effi out of Germany if necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a good plan, but soon things become complicated. A Jewish girl has vanished, and Russell feels compelled to search for her. A woman from his past, a communist, reappears, insisting he help her reconnect with the Soviets, who turn out to demand more than Russell hoped. Meanwhile, Europe lurches toward war, and he must follow the latest stories—to places where American espionage assignments await him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Downing&lt;/strong&gt; is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction for adults and children, including &lt;em&gt;Zoo Station&lt;/em&gt;, the first novel featuring John Russell. He lives in Guildford, England.</description>

  <description>Catherine Blake is the model war widow. Ever since she lost her RAF pilot husband in the Battle of Britain, this beautiful aristocrat has kept a stiff upper lip while caring for victims of the blitz in London's hospitals. The problem is that Catherine Blake is also a deep-cover Nazi spy, charged by Hitler with uncovering the details of D-Day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her nemesis is Alfred Vicary, a fumbling professor of history barely able to remember where he placed his threadbare tweed jacket, let alone sustain a relationship. But Vicary is also a confidant of Winston Churchill's, who has chosen this reclusive don to run England's critical counterintelligence operations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against this backdrop comes Daniel Silva's The Unlikely Spy, a sophisticated and altogether exceptional World War II thriller. Based on fact, Silva's fast-paced novel moves effortlessly from the Berlin High Command's espionage centers to the U-boat-infested North Sea, from the privileged playgrounds of Long Island to Hyde Park's shadowy paths -- a grand canvas of intrigue that sweeps the reader along in a breathtaking race against time. If Catherine escapes to Germany, the Nazis will know the Allied invasion will be at Normandy; and if Vicary doesn't stop her, all of Britain's greatest wartime deceptions and ploys will have been for naught.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why does it seem as if Vicary's superiors want him to fail?</description>

  <description>By an acclaimed writer at the height of his powers, &lt;em&gt;The Sense of an Ending&lt;/em&gt; extends a streak of extraordinary books that began with &lt;em&gt;Arthur &amp;amp; George&lt;/em&gt; and continued with &lt;em&gt;Nothing to Be Frightened Of&lt;/em&gt; and, most recently, &lt;em&gt;Pulse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; This short, intense new novel follows a middle-aged man as he contends with a past he never much thought about--until his closest childhood friends return with a vengeance, one of them from the grave, another maddeningly present. Tony Webster thought he'd left all this behind as he built a life for himself, and by now his career has delivered him into a secure retirement much as an amicable divorce has left him still fond of his ex-wife and daughter, who now has a family of her own. But suddenly Tony is presented with a mysterious legacy that obliges him to reconsider a variety of things he thought he'd understood all along, and to revise his estimation of his own nature and place in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In this novel, Sharon Kay Penman brings to life a dark period in English history, painting a canvas rich in the textures and colors of the era. Here is the pain and suffering of the innocents, the conniving and duplicity of the barons; here is the terrible reality of lawlessness - the burning towns, ravaged countryside, weary people. But above all, here are two extraordinary adversaries: A woman whose courage outran her common sense, who found that her skirts bound her more tightly than any rope. And a man of inordinate charm, as valiant in battle as he was able in friendship - but a man whose life was based on a broken oath and a treacherous lie, tragic flaws that would destroy him. Beginning as friends, they ended in the bitterest enmity, their bloodiest wounds self-inflicted. And if Stephen lost the crown, Maude would never wear it. But in a final irony for both, Maude would indeed be the mother of kings, for it was her eldest, Henry, who would establish the Plantagenet dynasty and, with Eleanor of Aquitaine, electrify the medieval world.</description>

  <description>“DeKok’s maverick personality certainly makes him a compassionate judge of other outsiders and an astute analyst of antisocial behavior.”—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Baantjer has created an odd police detective who roams Amsterdam interacting with the widest possible range of antisocial types. This series is the answer to an insomniac’s worst fears.”—&lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Baantjer’s laconic, rapid-fire storytelling has spun out a surprisingly complex web of mysteries.”—&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“DeKok is a careful, compassionate policeman in the -tradition of Maigret; crime fans will enjoy this . . .” —&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s easy to understand the appeal of Amsterdam police detective DeKok.”—&lt;em&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Renowned mystery author A.C. Baantjer brings to life Inspector DeKok in another stirring potboiler full of suspenseful twists and unusual conclusions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Geese of Death&lt;/em&gt;, DeKok takes on Igor Stablinsky, a man accused of bludgeoning a wealthy old man and his wife. To DeKok’s unfailing eye the killing urge is visibly present in the suspect during questioning, but did he commit this particular crime?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All signs point to one of the few remaining estates in Holland. The answer lies within a strange family, suspicions of incest, deadly geese and a horrifying mansion. Baantjer’s perceptive style brings to light the essences of his characters, touching his audience with subtle wit and irony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.C. Baantjer&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most widely read authors in the Netherlands. A former detective inspector of the Amsterdam Police, his fictional characters reflect the depth and personality of individuals encountered during his 38-year career in law enforcement.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;  19th-century Europe—from Turin to Prague to Paris—abounds with the ghastly and the mysterious. Conspiracies rule history. Jesuits plot against Freemasons. Italian republicans strangle priests with their own intestines. French criminals plan bombings by day and celebrate Black Masses at night. Every nation has its own secret service, perpetrating forgeries, plots, and massacres. From the unification of Italy to the Paris Commune to the Dreyfus Affair to &lt;em&gt;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&lt;/em&gt;, Europe is in tumult and everyone needs a scapegoat. But what if, behind all of these conspiracies both real and imagined, lay one lone man? What if that evil genius created its most infamous document?　 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eco takes his readers here on an unforgettable journey through the underbelly of world-shattering events. This is Eco at his most exciting, a book immediately hailed as his masterpiece. 　&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>In the tradition of 'The Orchid Thief', a compelling narrative set within the strange and genteel world of rare-book collecting: the true story of an infamous book thief, his victims, and the man determined to catch him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rare-book theft is even more widespread than fine-art theft. Most thieves, of course, steal for profit. John Charles Gilkey steals purely for the love of books. In an attempt to understand him better, journalist Allison Hoover Bartlett plunged herself into the world of book lust and discovered just how dangerous it can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gilkey is an obsessed, unrepentant book thief who has stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of rare books from book fairs, stores, and libraries around the country. Ken Sanders is the self-appointed "bibliodick" (book dealer with a penchant for detective work) driven to catch him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bartlett befriended both outlandish characters and found herself caught in the middle of efforts to recover hidden treasure. With a mixture of suspense, insight, and humor, she has woven this entertaining cat-and-mouse chase into a narrative that not only reveals exactly how Gilkey pulled off his dirtiest crimes, where he stashed the loot, and how Sanders ultimately caught him but also explores the romance of books, the lure to collect them, and the temptation to steal them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Immersing the reader in a rich, wide world of literary obsession, Bartlett looks at the history of book passion, collection, and theft through the ages, to examine the craving that makes some people willing to stop at nothing to possess the books they love.</description>

  <description>It's the first day of summer in a small American town. We meet a school teacher, his wife, and their young son, Billy. One thing, one seemingly minor thing, goes wrong. And all that was safe and ordinary slowly unravels into nightmare. This familiar premise for the contemporary horror novel has rarely, if ever, been developed so brilliantly as in Bentley Little's The Mailman. A tall, pale postal carrier with carrot-red hair may seem an unlikely candidate for the embodiment of evil, but Little reveals the personality behind the mailman's ever-present smile with such finesse, you'll be more than happy to fall under his spell. By the time the frightened town folk are chanting, "No mail! No mail! No mail! No mail!"--and Billy ends up half-naked in a dark room, next to a soiled wedding dress--you'll be jumping right out of your skin.</description>

  <description>Hard Times is the name of a town in the barren hills of the Dakota Territory. To this town there comes one day one of the reckless sociopaths who wander the West to kill and rape and pillage. By the time he is through and has ridden off, Hard Times is a smoking ruin. The de facto mayor, Blue, takes in two survivors of the carnage–a boy, Jimmy, and a prostitute, Molly, who has suffered unspeakably–and makes them his provisional family. Blue begins to rebuild Hard Times, welcoming new settlers, while Molly waits with vengeance in her heart for the return of the outlaw. Here is E. L. Doctorow’s debut novel, a searing allegory of frontier life that sets the stage for his subsequent classics.</description>

  <description>Sex, lies and murder. The aspiring authors of the Manchester Mystery writers' circle don't just write about these vices. They commit them...There's been a murder at the Manchester Mystery Writers' circle. A publisher with a sordid reputation turns up dead at their Friday night meeting. A single shot to the forehead. A cold-blooded execution. And a hotel full of suspects.It's a major inconvenience for some. And a golden opportunity for others.The circle's five aspiring mystery authors try to work out whodunit.A policeman, a gangster, a pensioner, a psychopath and a femme fatale.Each hopes to solve the mystery in his or her own distinctive style. The correct solution could land one of them the publishing contract of their dreams. And all of them try to unravel the crime without exposing their own torrid involvement.Excerpt: The interview room was a grey cell. As small as life and twice as bleak. Grey walls. Grey ceiling. Grey floor. Grey table. Annabel sat in a grey chair facing a grey-faced Detective Sergeant Cassidy. A grey tape-recorder whispered softly in the background, quietly catching every word she hadn't spoken.For the sake of the record. Cassidy's Manchester accent disappeared while he spoke into the tape recorder. Clearly anxious to sound important on the recording he enunciated with the round and plummy tones of a BBC radio announcer from the 1940s. .it should be noted here that Annabel Blake has refused legal representation.Cassidy made no mention of the fact that, before he had turned the tape recorder on, he had said the only suspects who demanded a solicitor present were those with something to hide. She was not naive enough to believe that was true. She felt slightly insulted that he thought so little of her intelligence as to use the line. Nevertheless, because she felt sure she could conceal the truth, Annabel agreed to be interviewed without a solicitor present.He cast a glance toward the clock on the wall and said, The time is now 1:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 9. We are recommencing the interview begun at 10:00 p.m. on Friday, November 8. Those present are myself, Detective Sergeant Franklin Cassidy. Constable Mary Elizabeth Watcham. He paused. The uniformed constable muttered, Present....and the interviewee, Annabel Blake.Feeling a response was needed from her, she said, Present.And then, save for the hiss of the tape recorder and the whisper of its turning spools, there was more silence. Constable Mary Elizabeth Watcham, with her hands behind her back and her breasts thrust boldly into the chest of her flak jacket, studied the clock. Cassidy glowered at Annabel.And Annabel stared at the table. Because she wasn't under arrest-because she was only helping the officers with their enquiries-she had been allowed to keep her possessions. She rummaged through her coat and retrieved the three things that were always in her pockets. A tube of L'Oreal grape lipstick, a stainless steel compact mirror, and her Zippo lighter.Cassidy pointed toward a NO SMOKING sign, the only decoration in the room aside from the clock. She nodded silent understanding of the gesture. But she couldn't stop herself from tracing a finger over the raised image of the skull and cross bones.Come on, Ms Blake. Cassidy's tone was gentle and avuncular. The suggestion of a rare smiled teased his thin lips. It was obvious his mouth was not used to forming the expression. You're a member of The Great Northern's writers' circle. You're a storyteller. Tell us a story.</description>

      <![CDATA[It is always hard to know exactly how to rate a book like this.  Is this comparable to The Great Gatsby or Look Homeward Angel?  Of course not, but this book set out to be entertaining and had no pretensions to be a literary masterpiece. I decided on four stars because it accomplished exactly what...]]>

  <description>The long-awaited crime caper so outlandish, so maniacal, so wickedly funny, it could have only come from the mind that brought you Artemis Fowl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel McEvoy has a problem. Well, really, he has several, but for this Irish ex-pat bouncer at a seedy, small-time casino the fact that his girlfriend was just murdered in the parking lot is uppermost in his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is until lots of people around him start dying, and not of natural causes. Suddenly Daniel's got half the New Jersey mob, dirty cops and his man-crazy upstairs neighbor after him and he still doesn't know what's going on. Bullets are flying, everybody's on the take and it all may be more than Daniel's new hair plugs can handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Daniel's got to find the guy who put in those hair plugs--or at least his body--and fast, or else he'll never get that voice out of his head. Head-spinning plot twists, breakneck pacing and some of the best banter this side of Elmore Leonard's Detroit, will keep you on the edge of your seat and itching for more.</description>

  <description>The first installment in a wonderful new series that follows the exploits of Benoît Courrèges, a policeman in a small French village where the rituals of the café still rule. Bruno—as he is affectionately nicknamed—may be the town’s &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; municipal policeman, but in the hearts and minds of its denizens, he is chief of police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruno is a former soldier who has embraced the pleasures and slow rhythms of country life—living in his restored shepherd’s cottage; patronizing the weekly market; sparring with, and basically ignoring, the European Union bureaucrats from Brussels. He has a gun but never wears it; he has the power to arrest but never uses it. But then the murder of an elderly North African who fought in the French army changes everything and galvanizes Bruno’s attention: the man was found with a swastika carved into his chest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of the case’s potential political ramifications, a young policewoman is sent from Paris to aid Bruno with his investigation. The two immediately suspect militants from the anti-immigrant National Front, but when a visiting scholar helps to untangle the dead man’s past, Bruno’s suspicions turn toward a more complex motive. His investigation draws him into one of the darkest chapters of French history—World War II, a time of terror and betrayal that set brother against brother. Bruno soon discovers that even his seemingly perfect corner of &lt;em&gt;la belle France&lt;/em&gt; is not exempt from that period’s sinister legacy.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruno, Chief of Police&lt;/em&gt; is deftly dark, mesmerizing, and totally engaging.</description>

  <description>A young woman is in love with a successful surgeon, a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing. His mistress, a free-spirited artist, lives her life as a series of betrayals--while her other lover, earnest, faithful, and good, stands to lose everything because of his noble qualities. In a world where lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and fortuitous events, and everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence we feel "the unbearable lightness of being."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A major achievement from one of the world's truly great writers, Milan Kundera's magnificent novel of passion and politics, infidelity and ideas, encompasses the extremes of comedy and tragedy, illuminating all aspects of human existence.</description>

  <description>This is the story of a man who said that he would stop the motor of the world—and did. Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators? Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor—and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life—from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy—to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction—to the philosopher who becomes a pirate—to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph—to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad—to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions. This is a mystery story, not about the murder of a man’s body, but about the murder—and rebirth—of man’s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the first of your premises to check.</description>

  <description>Awe and exhilaration—along with heartbreak and mordant wit—abound in &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt;, Nabokov's most famous and controversial novel, which tells the story of the aging Humbert Humbert's obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze. &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America. Most of all, it is a meditation on love—love as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.</description>

  <description>This is the life and times of T. S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her times. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes--even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with "lunacy and sorrow"; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than thirty languages, in more than forty countries--with more than ten million copies in print--this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: "In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World According to Garp&lt;/em&gt; is a comic and compassionate coming-of-age novel that established John Irving as one of the most imaginative writers of his generation. A worldwide bestseller since its publication in 1978, Irving's classic is filled with stories inside stories about the life and times of T. S. Garp, novelist and bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her time. Beyond that, &lt;em&gt;The World According to Garp&lt;/em&gt; virtually defies synopsis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(From author's website: &lt;a href="http://www.john-irving.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.john-irving.com&lt;/a&gt;)</description>

  <description>Bret Easton Ellis’s debut, &lt;em&gt;Less Than Zero,&lt;/em&gt; is one of the signal novels of the last thirty years, and he now follows those infamous teenagers into an even more desperate middle age.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clay, a successful screenwriter, has returned from New York to Los Angeles to help cast his new movie, and he’s soon drifting through a long-familiar circle. Blair, his former girlfriend, is married to Trent, an influential manager who’s still a bisexual philanderer, and their Beverly Hills parties attract various levels of fame, fortune and power. Then there’s Clay’s childhood friend Julian, a recovering addict, and their old dealer, Rip, face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than in his notorious past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Clay’s own demons emerge once he meets a gorgeous young actress determined to win a role in his movie. And when his life careens completely out of control, he has no choice but to plumb the darkest recesses of his character and come to terms with his proclivity for betrayal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A genuine literary event.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The iconic visionary returns with his first new novel since the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Spook Country&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever you do, because you are an artist, will bring you to the next thing of your own...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When she sang for The Curfew, Hollis Henry's face was known worldwide. She still runs into people who remember the poster. Unfortunately, in the post-crash economy, cult memorabilia doesn't pay the rent, and right now she's a journalist in need of a job. The last person she wants to work for is Hubertus Bigend, twisted genius of global marketing; but there's no way to tell an entity like Bigend that you want nothing more to do with him. That simply brings you more firmly to his attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Milgrim is clean, drug-free for the first time in a decade. It took eight months in a clinic in Basel. Fifteen complete changes of his blood. Bigend paid for all that. Milgrim's idiomatic Russian is superb, and he notices things. Meanwhile no one notices Milgrim. That makes him worth every penny, though it cost Bigend more than his cartel-grade custom-armored truck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The culture of the military has trickled down to the street- Bigend knows that, and he'll find a way to take a cut. What surprises him though is that someone else seems to be on top of that situation in a way that Bigend associates only with himself. Bigend loves staring into the abyss of the global market; he's just not used to it staring back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Watch a Video</description>

  <description>An international literary phenomenon, &lt;strong&gt;The Elementary Particles&lt;/strong&gt; is a frighteningly original novel–part Marguerite Duras and part Bret Easton Ellis-that leaps headlong into the malaise of contemporary existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruno and Michel are half-brothers abandoned by their mother, an unabashed devotee of the drugged-out free-love world of the sixties. Bruno, the older, has become a raucously promiscuous hedonist himself, while Michel is an emotionally dead molecular biologist wholly immersed in the solitude of his work. Each is ultimately offered a final chance at genuine love, and what unfolds is a brilliantly caustic and unpredictable tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Translated from the French by Frank Wynne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The literary event of the season: a new novel from Ian McEwan, as surprising as it is masterful. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Beard is a Nobel prize–winning physicist whose best work is behind him. Trading on his reputation, he speaks for enormous fees, lends his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions, and half-heartedly heads a government-backed initiative tackling global warming. While he coasts along in his professional life, Michael’s personal life is another matter entirely. His fifth marriage is crumbling under the weight of his infidelities. But this time the tables are turned: His wife is having an affair, and Michael realizes he is still in love with her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Michael’s personal and professional lives begin to intersect in unexpected ways, an opportunity presents itself in the guise of an invitation to travel to New Mexico. Here is a chance for him to extricate himself from his marital problems, reinvigorate his career, and very possibly save the world from environmental disaster. Can a man who has made a mess of his life clean up the messes of humanity? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A complex novel that brilliantly traces the arc of one man’s ambitions and self-deceptions, &lt;em&gt;Solar&lt;/em&gt; is a startling, witty, and stylish new work from one of the world’s great writers.</description>

  <description>James Rollins, the "New York Times" bestselling master of nail-biting suspense and historical mystery, combines cutting-edge biotechnology with a centuries-old secret in an apocalyptic story that reveals where humankind is truly headed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Doomsday Key"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Princeton University, a famed geneticist dies inside a biohazard lab. In Rome, a Vatican archaeologist is found dead in St. Peter's Basilica. In Africa, a U.S. senator's son is slain outside a Red Cross camp. The three murders on three continents bear a horrifying connection: all the victims are marked by a Druidic pagan cross burned into their flesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bizarre murders thrust Commander Gray Pierce and Sigma Force into a race against time to solve a riddle going back centuries, to a ghastly crime against humanity hidden within a cryptic medieval codex. The first clue is discovered inside a mummified corpse buried in an English peat bog--a gruesome secret that threatens America and the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aided by two women from his past--one his exlover, the other his new partner--Gray must piece together the horrifying truth. But the revelations come at a high cost, and to save the future, Gray will have to sacrifice one of the women at his side. That alone might not be enough, as the true path to salvation is revealed in a dark prophecy of doom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sigma Force confronts humankind's greatest threat in an adventure that races from the Roman Coliseum to the icy peaks of Norway, from the ruins of medieval abbeys to the lost tombs of Celtic kings. The ultimate nightmare is locked within a talisman buried by a dead saint--an ancient artifact known as the Doomsday Key.</description>

  <description>'His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.' With these words "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" draws to a close. And here, in this seventh and final book, Harry discovers what fate truly has in store for him as he inexorably makes his way to that final meeting with Voldemort. In this thrilling climax to the phenomenally bestselling series, J.K. Rowling will reveal all to her eagerly waiting readers.</description>

  <description>It should have been a simple job. But for Garrett, a human detective in a world of gnomes, tracking down the woman to whom his dead pal Danny left a fortune in silver is no slight task. Even with the aid of Morley, the toughest half-elf around, Garrett isn't sure he'll make it out alive from a land where magic can be murder, the dead still talk, and vampires are always hungry for human blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In the Darwin Centre at London’s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre’s prize specimen of a rare Architeuthis dux—better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy’s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens—human and otherwise—are adept in magic and murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity—and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC—the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit—a branch of London’s finest that fights sorcery with sorcery. There is Wati, a spirit from ancient Egypt who leads a ragtag union of magical familiars. There are the Londonmancers, who read the future in the city’s entrails. There is Grisamentum, London’s greatest wizard, whose shadow lingers long after his death. And then there is Goss and Subby, an ageless old man and a cretinous boy who, together, constitute a terrifying—yet darkly charismatic—demonic duo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of them—and others—are in pursuit of Billy, who inadvertently holds the key to the missing squid, an embryonic god whose powers, properly harnessed, can destroy all that is, was, and ever shall be.</description>

  <description>Two young British students, Nazim Jamal and Rafi Hassan vanish without a trace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The police tell their parents that the boys had been under surveillance, that it was likely they left the country to pursue their dangerous new ideals. Seven years later, Nazim’s grief-stricken mother is still unconvinced. Jenny Cooper is her last hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenny is finally beginning to settle into her role as Coroner for the Severn Vale; the ghosts of her past that threatened to topple her, banished to the sidelines once more. But as the inquest into Nazim's disappearance gets underway, the stink of corruption and conspiracy intensifies. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the pressure from above increases, a code of silence is imposed on the inquest and events begin to spiral out of all control, pushing Jenny to breaking point. For how could she have known that by unravelling the mysteries of the disappeared, she would begin to unearth her own buried secrets?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Three novellas of squishy-noir from Jordan Krall.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  On the surface, Thompson looks like any other blue collar New Jersey town. But beneath the working class exterior lies a bizarro world of fetishistic crime, sleazy motels, and squid. In these three bizarro-noir novellas, the reader is thrown into a world of murderers, drugs made from squid parts, deformed war veterans, and a mischievous apocalyptic donkey...  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;THE HABERDASHER&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Red Henry Hooper just got out on parole. He meets his friends, fellow small-time criminals Dix Hayden and Grant Minissi, in a cheap motel to drink a couple beers and perhaps plan another job. Things go sour when Grant takes some bad drugs. Meanwhile, in the next room, strange things are happening that will make Henry's day even worse: a woman is missing her feet and a notorious local gangster Robert Hapertas (aka The Haberdasher) is on his way. And he's not pleased...  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;THE LONGHEADS&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Tommy Pingpong knew it was a mistake sending his partner Jake into the meeting with their boss. Now they were on the run from Peachy, a diaper-wearing gangster who would like nothing better than to kill the both of them. On top of that, the deformed war veterans called the longheads are buying up all the guns in town, planning something big that'll have severe implications for the town of Thompson.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;THE APOCALYPSE DONKEY&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  When Simon Palmer took the black envelope from the tall man in the parking lot, he didn't know that this case of mistaken identity would make his day take such a weird turn for the worst. When the man finally realizes that he gave the envelope to the wrong guy, Simon is thrown into a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that finally leads to a sleazy carnival of squid violence...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.</description>

  <description>When their recently widowed father announces that he plans to remarry, sisters Vera and Nadezhda realize that they must learn to put aside a lifetime of bitter rivalry in order to save him. The new woman in his life is Valentina, a voluptuous gold-digger from Ukraine, fifty years his junior, with fabulous breasts and a proclivity for green satin underwear and boil-in-the-bag cuisine, who will stop at nothing in her single-minded pursuit of the luxurious Western lifestyle she dreams of. But separating their addled and annoyingly lecherous dad from his new love will prove to be no easy feat-in terms of sheer cold-eyed ruthlessness, the two sisters swiftly realize that they are rank amateurs. As Hurricane Valentina turns the old family house upside down, all the old secrets come falling out, including the most deeply buried one of them all, from the war, the one that explains much about why Nadezhda and Vera are so different. In the meantime, oblivious to it all, their father carries on with the great work of his dotage-a grand history of the tractor and its role in human progress, giving due credit to the crucial Ukrainian contribution. The story carries us back to prerevolutionary Ukraine, through wartime Germany, to contemporary England, taking in love and suffering, tanks and tractors, bitchiness, sibling rivalry, and, above all, the joys of growing old disgracefully. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A funny, enchanting novel about the belated healing of old family wounds under the most unlikely of circumstances and the trials and consolations of old age, &lt;em&gt;A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian&lt;/em&gt; manages both to transport us somewhere entirely fresh and to echo what we ourselves know in our hearts about how families work (and don't). Written with great and well-earned wit, empathy and grace, it is a debut worthy of full-throated celebration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A wise, tender, deeply funny novel about an eccentric elderly Ukrainian widower in England and the struggles of his two feuding daughters to thwart the voluptuous young gold-digger from the old country who sweeps him off his feet</description>

  <description>Absurd philosophies, dark surrealism, and the end of the human race . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God hates you. All of you. He closed the gates of Heaven and wants you to rot on Earth forever. Not only that, he is repossesing your souls and feeding them to a large vagina-like machine called the Walm - an interdimensional doorway that brings His New Children into the world. He loves these new children, but He doesn't love you. They are more interesting than you. They are beautiful, psychotic, magical, sex-crazed, and deadly. They are turning your cities into apocalyptic chaos, and there's nothing you can do about it ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring: a narrator who sees his body from a third-person perspective, a man whose flesh is dead but his body parts are alive and running amok, an overweight messiah, the personal life of the Grim Reaper, lots of classy sex and violence, and a motley group of squatter punks that team up with the devil to find their place in a world that doesn t want them anymore.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Her feet are already bleeding - if you like feet..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are places in the world where darkness rules, where it's unwise to walk. Sunshine knew that. But there hadn't been any trouble out at the lake for years, and she needed a place to be alone for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, she wasn't alone. She never heard them coming. Of course you don't, when they're vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They took her clothes and sneakers. They dressed her in a long red gown. And they shackled her to the wall of an abandoned mansion - within easy reach of a figure stirring in the moonlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows that he is a vampire. She knows that she's to be his dinner, and that when he is finished with her, she will be dead. Yet, as dawn breaks, she finds that he has not attempted to harm her. And now it is he who needs her to help him survive the day...</description>

      <![CDATA[I was put off by the narrative at the start of the book that explained what had happened before.  I'm never a big fan of those.  Fortunately that was a concise section and I was able to get into the story about Sunshine.  I loved the next 1/3 of the book.  It actually felt cosy learning about Sunshin...]]>

  <description>Hollywood's first sex symbol, the ' It ' girl, Clara Bow was born in the slums of Brooklyn in a family plagued with alcoholism and insanity. She catapulted to fame after winning Motion Picture magazine's 1921 " Fame and Fortune" contest. The greatest box-office draw of her day she once received 45,000 fan letters in a single month, Clara Bow's on screen vitality and allure that beguiled thousands, however, would be her undoing off-camera. David Stenn captures her legendary rise to stardom and fall from grace, her success marred by studio exploitation and sexual scandals.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After a flu pandemic, a large-scale terrorist attack, and the total collapse of Wall Street, New York City is reduced to a shadow of its former self. As the city struggles to dig itself out of the wreckage, a nameless, obsessive-compulsive veteran with a spotty memory, a love for literature, and a strong if complex moral code (that doesn’t preclude acts of extreme violence) has taken up residence at the main branch of the New York Public Library on 42nd Street.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dubbed "Dewey Decimal" for his desire to reorganize the library's stock, our protagonist (who will reappear in the next novel in this series) gets by as bagman and muscle for New York City's unscrupulous district attorney. Decimal takes no pleasure in this kind of civic dirty work. He'd be perfectly content alone amongst his books. But this is not in the cards, as the DA calls on Dewey for a seemingly straightforward union-busting job.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What unfolds throws Dewey into a bloody tangle of violence, shifting allegiances, and old vendettas, forcing him to face the darkness of his own past and the question of his buried identity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With its high body count and snarky dialogue, &lt;em&gt;The Dewey Decimal System&lt;/em&gt; pays respects to Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, and Jim Thompson. Healthy amounts of black humor and speculative tendencies will appeal to fans of Charlie Huston, Nick Tosches, Duane Swierczynski, Victor Gischler, Robert Ferrigno, and early Jonathan Lethem.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathan Larson&lt;/strong&gt; is best known as an award-winning film music composer, having created the scores for over thirty movies such as &lt;em&gt;Boys Don’t Cry&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dirty Pretty Things&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Messenger&lt;/em&gt;. In the 1990s he was the lead guitarist for the influential prog-punk outfit Shudder to Think. This is his first novel. Larson lives in Harlem, New York City, with his wife and son.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>In this captivating book, Stewart Lee Allen treks three-quarters of the way around the world on a caffeinated quest to answer these profound questions: Did the advent of coffee give birth to an enlightened western civilization? Is coffee, indeed, the substance that drives history? From the cliffhanging villages of Southern Yemen, where coffee beans were first cultivated eight hundred years ago, to a cavernous coffeehouse in Calcutta, the drinking spot for two of India’s three Nobel Prize winners . . . from Parisian salons and cafés where the French Revolution was born, to the roadside diners and chain restaurants of the good ol’ U.S.A., where something resembling brown water passes for coffee, Allen wittily proves that the world was wired long before the Internet. And those who deny the power of coffee (namely tea-drinkers) do so at their own peril.</description>

  <description>In London of 1840, the economy is sliding into recession; gangs of unemployed workers roam the streets; and a murderer prowls the capital's poor neighborhoods. Pyke, still grieving over the death of his wife and struggling to shoulder his responsibilities as a father, is in debtors' prison, having lost his home and reached the edge of bankruptcy. Fitzroy Tilling, now head of the new Metropolitan Police Force gives Pyke his freedom, but in return he must agree to investigate the brutal death of a young biracial woman, who was apparently working as a prostitute. It is not long before another woman turns up dead, and Pyke begins to suspect that he has stumbled on something more sinister, and more far-reaching than the murder of a couple of prostitutes. Pyke's investigation takes him from the London docks to the sugar plantations of Jamaica, from a fading colonial mansion to the backstreets of the East End in a struggle against ambitious and ruthless enemies, as well as demons of his own.</description>

  <description>"Sometimes you have to wonder how Robert B. Parker keeps his mojo working. . . . There is a trick to keeping the faith with an old hero. In an age of shifty heroes with shaky values, he has created a hero who can still stand up for himself-and us." ("The New York Times Book Review") &lt;br&gt; When fifty-one-year-old Nathan Smith, a once-confirmed bachelor, is found in his bed with a hole in his head made by a .38-caliber slug, it's hard not to imagine Nathan's young bride as the one with her finger on the trigger. Even her lawyer thinks she's guilty. But given that Mary Smith is entitled to the best defense she can afford-and thanks to Nathan's millions, she can afford plenty-Spenser hires on to investigate Mary's bona fides. Mary's alibi is a bit on the flimsy side: She claims she was watching television in the other room when the murder occurred. But the couple was seen fighting at a high-profile cocktail party earlier that evening, and the prosecution has a witness who says Mary once tried to hire him to kill Nathan. What's more, she's too pretty, too made-up, too blonde, and sleeps around-just the kind of person a jury loves to hate. &lt;br&gt; Spenser's up against a wall; leads go nowhere, no one knows a thing. Then a young woman, recently fired from her position at Smith's bank, turns up dead. Mary's vacant past suddenly starts looking meaner and darker-and Spenser's suddenly got to watch his back. &lt;br&gt; With lean, crackling dialogue, crisp action, and razor-sharp characters, "Widow's Walk" is another triumph.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In an Appalachian community haunted by the legacy of a Civil War massacre, a rebellious young man struggles to escape the violence that would bind him to the past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Travis Shelton is seventeen the summer he wanders onto a neighbor's property in the woods, discovers a crop of marijuana large enough to make him some serious money, and steps into the jaws of a bear trap. After hours of passing in and out of consciousness, Travis is discovered by Carlton Toomey, the wise and vicious farmer who set the trap to protect his plants, and Travis's confrontation with the subtle evils within his rural world has begun. &lt;br&gt; Before long, Travis has moved out of his parents' home to live with Leonard Shuler, a one-time schoolteacher who lost his job and custody of his daughter years ago, when he was framed by a vindictive student. Now Leonard lives with his dogs and his sometime girlfriend in a run-down trailer outside town, deals a few drugs, and studies journals from the Civil War. Travis becomes his student, of sorts, and the fate of these two outsiders becomes increasingly entwined as the community's terrible past and corrupt present bear down on each of them from every direction, leading to a violent reckoning--not only with Carlton, but with the legacy of the Civil War massacre that, even after a century, continues to divide an Appalachian community.&lt;br&gt; Vivid, harrowing, yet ultimately hopeful, &lt;em&gt;The World Made Straight&lt;/em&gt; offers a powerful exploration of the painful conflict between the bonds of home and the desire for independence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A gritty, bone-chilling masterpiece from the most acclaimed Scandinavian crime writer since Henning Mankell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's summer in Sweden. As the coastal city of Gothenburg suffers through a heat wave, Chief Inspector Erik Winter broods over a series of unsolved rape-murders. The crimes bear an eerie resemblance to a five-year-old case that the mercurial detective has refused to let go cold. Has the same rapist reemerged to taunt him, or is a copycat at work? And can Winter find a common thread among the victims before there are more of them? With &lt;em&gt;Never End&lt;/em&gt;, Åke Edwardson brings American readers another installment of the smart, suspenseful, atmospheric series that has won him legions of fans all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fiercely funny and touching debut novel about a young girl trying to find out the truth behind her sister’s death&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a sister who died. Did I tell you this already? I did but you don’t remember, you didn’t understand the code . . . She died a year ago, but in my mind sometimes it’s five minutes. In the morning sometimes it hasn’t even happened yet. For a second I’m confused, but then it all comes back. It happens again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Fear doesn’t come naturally to Mathilda Savitch. She prefers to look right at the things nobody else can bring themselves to mention: for example, the fact that her beloved older sister is dead, pushed in front of a train by a man still on the loose. Her grief-stricken parents have basically been sleepwalking ever since, and it is Mathilda’s sworn mission to shock them back to life. Her strategy? Being bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mathilda decides she’s going to figure out what lies behind the catastrophe. She starts sleuthing through her sister’s most secret possessions—e-mails, clothes, notebooks, whatever her determination and craftiness can ferret out. More troubling, she begins to apply some of her older sister’s magical charisma and powers of seduction to the unraveling situations around her. In a storyline that thrums with hints of ancient myth, Mathilda has to risk a great deal—in fact, has to leave behind everything she loves—in order to discover the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mathilda Savitch &lt;/em&gt;bursts with unforgettably imagined details: impossible crushes, devastating humiliations, the way you can hate and love your family at the same moment, the times when you and your best friend are so weak with laughter that you can’t breathe. Startling, funny, touching, odd, truthful, page-turning, and, in the end, heartbreaking, &lt;em&gt;Mathilda Savitch &lt;/em&gt;is an extraordinary debut. Once you make the acquaintance of Mathilda Savitch, you will never forget her.</description>

  <description>This is the story of the Allied forces--the U.S. 6th Army Group and French 1st Army--that landed in southern France on August 15th, 1944. The book follows the action from the French beaches to the Vosges Mountains, where the first Allied penetration along the entire Western front reached the Rhine River. First to the Rhine covers the vicious fighting during the German Nordwind counteroffensive in January 1945 and the French-American offensive to clear the Colmar Pocket. It then pursues the forces of the Third Reich across the Rhine to their ultimate destruction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike the forces landing in Normandy, these American divisions were hard-bitten veterans of the war in Italy, and, in the case of the 3d Infantry Division, North Africa. The French units included many veterans of the Italian campaign and comprised Frenchmen and Africans in almost equal numbers. As the campaign went on, the French ranks were swelled by tens of thousands of Free French Forces of the Interior, the famous maquis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The German forces arrayed against the Allies included the famed 11th Panzer Division, an Eastern front veteran known as the "Ghost Division," which would hit the Allied advance time and again only to slip away before it could be pinned and destroyed. This is the harrowing story First to the Rhine tells, from the strategic plane-down through the corps, division, and regimental levels to the personal experience of the men in combat, including the likes of Audie Murphy, Americas most decorated infantryman of the war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book features little-known battles, including one at Montelimar, when an ad hoc American armored command and the 36th Infantry Division came within a hairs breadth and several days of hard fighting of cutting off the entire German 19th Army. This is the first popular work in English to explore the French role in the fighting and the relationship between the U.S. Army and the French forces fighting under American command.</description>

  <description>"The year I turned ninety, I wanted to give myself the gift of a night of wild love with an adolescent virgin."  So begins &lt;em&gt;Memories of My Melancholy Whores&lt;/em&gt;, and it becomes even more unlikely as the novel unfolds.  This slim volume contains the story of the sad life of  an unnamed, only slightly talented Colombian journalist and teacher, never married, never in love, living in the crumbling family manse.  He calls Rosa Cabarcas, madame of the city's most successful brothel, to seek her assistance.  Rosa tells him his wish is impossible--and then calls right back to say that she has found the perfect girl.  &lt;p&gt;  The protagonist says of himself: "I have never gone to bed with a woman I didn't pay ... by the time I was fifty there were 514 women with whom I had been at least once ... My public life, on the other hand, was lacking in interest:  both parents dead, a bachelor without a future, a mediocre journalist ... and a favorite of caricaturists because of my exemplary ugliness."    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The girl is 14 and works all day in a factory attaching buttons in order to provide for her family.  Rosa gives her a combination of bromide and valerian to drink to calm her nerves, and when the prospective lover arrives, she is sound asleep.  Now the story really begins.  The nonagenarian is not a sex-starved adventurer; he is a tender voyeur.  Throughout his 90th year, he continues to meet the girl and watch her sleep.  He says, "This was something new for me. I was ignorant of the arts of seduction and had always chosen my brides for a night at random, more for their price than their charms, and we had made love without love, half-dressed most of the time and always in the dark, so we could imagine ourselves as better than we were ... That night I discovered the improbably pleasure of contemplating the body of a sleeping woman without the urgencies of desire or the obstacles of modesty."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Márquez's style never falters throughout this recounting of his life and his exploration of love, found at an unexpected time and place.  The erstwhile lover is still capable of being surprised--and fulfilled.  After an absence of ten years, it is a treat to have another parable from the master. &lt;em&gt;--Valerie Ryan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The Soviet Union 1956: after Stalin's death, a violent regime is beginning to fracture. It leaves behind a society where the police are the criminals, and the criminals are innocent. Stalin's successor Khrushchev pledges reform. But there are forces at work that are unable to forgive or forget the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leo Demidov, former MGB officer, is facing his own turmoil. The two young girls he and his wife Raisa adopted have yet to forgive him for his part in the brutal murder of their parents. They are not alone. Leo, Raisa and their family are in grave danger from someone with a grudge against Leo. Someone transformed beyond recognition into the perfect model of vengeance. Leo's desperate, personal mission to save his family will take him from the harsh Siberian Gulags, to the depths of the criminal underworld, to the centre of the Hungarian uprising—and into a hell where redemption is as brittle as glass.</description>

  <description>Simone Kirsch, private eye with a difference, always wanted to join the police force. She's smart, fit and wants to do good. But she has a problem. She has worked as a stripper for the last three years and the service won't let her in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, she enrols in an enquiry agent's course at a security college, tops the class and it looks like she might have some surveillance work coming up. It's all going to plan. But then her best friend Chloe - a fellow stripper who works at Melbourne's notorious The Red Room - is kidnapped by gangsters after its owner is murdered and Simone has two weeks to find the culprit and save Chloe's life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way she gets tangled up with Melbourne's most corrupt cop, some crazy strippers and a rockabilly band called Las Vegas Grind. She even manages to fall in and out of love - or is that lust - in the course of a fortnight, and sustains some pretty serious hangovers, all while racing the clock to rescue her best friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peepshow is sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, a wild ride that takes you inside Melbourne's adult cinemas and lap dancing clubs. Simone is a sexy, sassy Tart-Noir heroine, kind of like Cliff Hardy, but with open leg work.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;From the winner of the IMPAC Award and the Nobel Prize, a fierce novel about a young Romanian woman's discovery of betrayal in the most intimate reaches of her life&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I've been summoned. Thursday, ten sharp." Thus begins one day in the life of a young clothing-factory worker during Ceaucescu's totalitarian regime. She has been questioned before; this time, she believes, will be worse. Her crime? Sewing notes into the linings of men's suits bound for Italy. "Marry me," the notes say, with her name and address. Anything to get out of the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she rides the tram to her interrogation, her thoughts stray to her friend Lilli, shot trying to flee to Hungary, to her grandparents, deported after her first husband informed on them, to Major Albu, her interrogator, who begins each session with a wet kiss on her fingers, and to Paul, her lover, her one source of trust, despite his constant drunkenness. In her distraction, she misses her stop to find herself on an unfamiliar street. And what she discovers there makes her fear of the appointment pale by comparison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Herta Müller pitilessly renders the humiliating terrors of a crushing regime. Bone-spare and intense, &lt;em&gt;The Appointment&lt;/em&gt; confirms her standing as one of Europe's greatest writers.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>A new case for Chief Inspector Van Veeteren - the complicated history of a nearly perfect murder. On a sunny August day a man is released from prison. On a rainy April day children at play find his corpse. The fact that the dead man is Leopold Verhaven only becomes clear after some time because the mutilated corpse is without its head, legs and feet. Who would be interested in killing this man, a double murderer who spent 24 years in prison?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to let no case go unsolved, Chief Inspector Van Veeteren reopens the case. What he discovers is that Verhaven was a star sprinter before he went to prison for allegedly killing two of his lovers. However, he never confessed to the murders and spent a lifetime proclaiming his innocence. Was he killed because someone thought he had not been punished enough? Or was someone afraid of Verhaven's revenge? A terrible suspicion stalks Van Veeteren: had Verhaven been telling the truth? Was he really innocent?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Michael Chabon experiment with genre fiction -- a follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize winner, &lt;em&gt;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&lt;/em&gt; -- is marked by a notable  richness of character and playfulness of plot.  Set in sleepy southern England in 1944, the story introduces a nine-year-old refugee, clearly intelligent but mute, and his constant companion, an African Gray parrot who spouts strings of numbers in German.  Joining their ranks are a now-unbelieving Malayan minister and his underappreciated English wife, a few of their shady boardinghouse neighbors (one of whom turns up dead), and several inept police officers.  When the parrot goes missing, who better to sort out the mystery but a pipe-smoking, beekeeping, 89-year-old retired detective who just happens to live in the neighborhood?&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arthur Conan Doyle fans will remember the last Sherlock Holmes book, &lt;em&gt;The Final Problem&lt;/em&gt;, and get the reference right away.  Though Chabon never calls his elderly detective by name, Holmes's spirit is decidedly alive in these pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally published as a novella in the &lt;em&gt;Paris Review&lt;/em&gt;, the story is distinguished by its tightness and clean prose.  Chabon's knack for giving even the parrot a certain realness and spark (along with  a quirky insight that we would not expect) emerges as the real meat of this entertaining fiction.  &lt;em&gt;The Final Solution&lt;/em&gt; is a pleasing addition to the genre and a satisfying nod to Arthur Conan Doyle himself. &lt;em&gt;Elizabeth McMillan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>No figure in American public life has had such great expectations thrust upon him, or has responded so poorly. But Ted Kennedy -- the youngest of the Kennedy children and the son who felt the least pressure to satisfy his father's enormous ambitions -- would go on to live a life that no one could have predicted: dismissed as a spent force in politics by the time he reached middle age, Ted became the most powerful senator of the last half century and the nation's keeper of traditional liberalism.&lt;p&gt;As Peter S. Canellos and his team of "Boston Globe" reporters show in this revealing and intimate biography, the gregarious, pudgy, and least academically successful of the Kennedy boys has witnessed greater tragedy and suffered greater pressure than any of his siblings. At the age of thirty-six, Ted Kennedy found himself the last brother, the champion of a generation's dreams and ambitions. He would be expected to give the nation the confidence to confront its problems and to build a fairer society at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quickly failed in spectacular fashion. Late one night in the summer of 1969, he left the scene of a fatal automobile accident on Chappaquiddick Island. The death there of a young woman from his brother's campaign would haunt and ultimately doom his presidential ambitions. Political rivals turned his all-too-human failings -- drinking, philandering, and divorce -- into a condemnation of his liberal politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the presidency eluded his grasp, Kennedy was finally liberated from the expectations of others, free to become his own man. Once a symbol of youthful folly and nepotism, he transformed himself in his later years into a symbol of wisdom and perseverance. He built a deeply loving marriage with his second wife, Victoria Reggie. He embraced his role as the family patriarch. And as his health failed, he anointed the young and ambitious presidential candidate Barack Obama, whom many commentators compared to his brother Jack. The Kennedy brand of liberalism was rediscovered by a new generation of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceptive and carefully reported, drawing heavily from candid interviews with the Kennedy family and inner circle, "Last Lion" captures magnificently the life and historic achievements of Ted Kennedy, as well as the personal redemption that he found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Based on real events in Epping Forest on the edge of London around 1840, &lt;em&gt;The Quickening Maze&lt;/em&gt; centres on the first incarceration of the great nature poet John Clare. After years struggling with alcohol, critical neglect and depression, Clare finds himself in High Beach Private Asylum - an institution run on reformist principles which would later become known as occupational therapy. At the same time another poet, the young Alfred Tennyson, moves nearby and becomes entangled in the life and catastrophic schemes of the asylum's owner, the peculiar, charismatic Dr Matthew Allen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For John Clare, a man who had grown up steeped in the freedoms and exhilarations of nature, who thought 'the edge of the world was a day's walk away', a locked door is a kind of death. This intensely lyrical novel describes his vertiginous fall, through hallucinatory episodes of insanity and dissolving identity, towards his final madness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically accurate, but brilliantly imagined, the closed world of High Beach and its various inmates - the doctor, his lonely daughter in love with Tennyson, the brutish staff and John Clare himself - are brought vividly to life. Outside the walls is Nature, and Clare's paradise: the birds and animals, the gypsies living in the forest; his dream of home, of redemption, of escape. Rapturous yet precise, exquisitely written, rich in character and detail, this is a remarkable and deeply affecting book: a visionary novel which contains a world.</description>

  <description>The palette of history and horror mingle in the hues of crimson blood and blackest death. The ghosts of the past mourn for lives unfinished, vengeance unfulfilled, and loves lost. The heart beats in a cacophony of anticipation and fear, echoing with the memory of those that once were, once danced, once believed. &lt;br&gt; Hues of fear, of woe and dying. Shades of death, of blood and shadow. Fallen women, queens, and angels. Angry men, ghosts, and devils. Life is woven in a tapestry of joy and sorrow; painted in the colors of pain, and triumph, and love. What artistry is found within the soul of every man -- some perfection, some wretched -- painted words and pictures of things glorious and of things unspeakable. &lt;br&gt; Angeline Hawkes writes with the fatalistic poetry of unstoppable history gone disturbingly wrong. - John Everson, Bram Stoker Award winning author &lt;br&gt; Shades of Blood and Shadow represents only a taste of the hundreds of short stories penned by Bram Stoker Award nominated writer Angeline Hawkes. From ancient Mayans to the horrors at Chernobyl, she pulls you into the hearts and minds of fiendish creatures and tortured man. History offers up the wayward and the monstrous in this collection of ghoulish hues. &lt;br&gt; ""Angeline Hawkes's ... imagination seems to tend toward a Lovecraftian-meets-George Romero-in-a-dark-alley sensibility."" - Robert Butterfield, Necropsy: The Review of Horror Fiction &lt;br&gt; .".".Angeline Hawkes conducts an orchestra of creatures that are both bloody and sexy. You won't forget this tour through historical horror; it's a sumptuous smorgasbord for beasts craving variety."" - Gregory Lamberson, author of Johnny Gruesome and Personal Demons &lt;br&gt; .".".every story is unique, and every story works. Angeline Hawke's writing is sharp, elegant and satisfying in the most deliciously dark way."" - Jonathan Maberry, Bram Stoker Award winning author of Zombie CSU and Patient Zero &lt;br&gt; ""Angeline Hawkes...conjures dark and dangerous experiences, satisfyingly horrorific stories seasoned with sly humor, historical epics slipstreaming into alternate realities... hellishly inspiring, fantastically inventive, a collection of dark fiction impossible to forget!"" - C. Dean Andersson, Bram Stoker Award nominated author of I Am Dracula, Raw Pain Max, and the Bloodsong Saga &lt;br&gt; ""Deftly written, frequently surprising, always entertaining. Proof if we needed it that a lot of good fiction gets published in out of the way places."" - Don D'Ammassa &lt;br&gt; .".".intelligent horror, which doesn't mean it sacrifices emotional punch. Angeline Hawkes knows when to go for the gut, the jugular, or the heart; she does it with restraint and timing. There is a sense of place and purpose in her writing. She strikes the right balance between the blood and the shadow."" - Hellnotes</description>

  <description>Logen Ninefingers, infamous barbarian, has finally run out of luck. Caught in one feud too many, he’s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian – leaving nothing behind him but bad songs, dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobleman Captain Jezal dan Luthar, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends at cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a box. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendship. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of government, if he can stay alive long enough to follow it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter the wizard, Bayaz. A bald old man with a terrible temper and a pathetic assistant, he could be the First of the Magi, he could be a spectacular fraud, but whatever he is, he's about to make the lives of Logen, Jezal, and Glotka a whole lot more difficult. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood.</description>

  <description>Wilbur McCrum is not a lucky man. Actually, he's not lucky, period -- a fact that becomes obvious from the moment he first emerges, screaming, into the world -- for Wilbur's birth coincides with his sister's death. And as Wilbur (prone to fits and with a pathological fear of cows) grows, he subsequently loses his father, and is then in turn lost -- abandoned -- by his mother. Dispossessed and passed from pillar to post, he's eventually left with no choice but to take to the road, the wind at his back and 'lucky' potato in his pocket. As he searches for a place he can call home -- somewhere far away from cows (easier said than done in the Wild West) -- he encounters madmen, conmen, wenches and whores; embarks on a career robbing stagecoaches (initially unwittingly); falls in love, and into a well; escapes bounty hunters and body snatchers; and, erm, becomes a librarian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dazzling and inventive first novel set in gold-rush-era America, " The Swansong of Wilbur McCrum" tells the story of an unlikely and largely unlucky life, from birth to books with a few near brushes with death in-between.</description>

  <description>"It used to be Cliff and Vivian and now it isn't." With these words, Jim Harrison sends his sixty-something protagonist, divorced and robbed of his farm by a late-blooming real estate shark of an ex-wife, on a road trip across America, armed with a childhood puzzle of the United States and a mission to rename all the states and state birds to overcome the banal names men have given them. Cliff's adventures take him through a whirlwind affair with a former student from his high school-teacher days twenty-some years before, to a "snake farm" in Arizona owned by an old classmate; and to the high-octane existence of his son, a big-time movie producer in San Francisco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The English Major&lt;/em&gt; is the map of a man's journey into—and out of—himself, and it is vintage Harrison—reflective, big-picture American, and replete with wicked wit.</description>

  <description>A routine investigation into a Chinese art supplies company unearths a smuggling ring. The trail leads through a warehouse filled with looted antiquities in the boomtown of Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong; to the lair of a vicious ex-South Vietnamese general now living in Thailand; and finally to the murderous Khmer Rouge in the ancient temples and more recent killing fields of Cambodia. Based on the sordid facts of the illegal trade in stolen Cambodian art, GRAVE IMPORTS is a hotpot of high adventure in exotic locales, fascinating characters, international commerce, terrible crime and one mixed-up, reluctant hero trying to shed light into some of the darkest corners of Asia. Based on the facts of the trade in stolen Cambodian antiquities.</description>

  <description>Michael Chabon's sparkling first book of nonfiction is a love song in sixteen parts - a series of linked essays in praise of reading and writing, with subjects running from ghost stories to comic books, Sherlock Holmes to Cormac McCarthy. Throughout, Chabon energetically argues for a return to the thrilling, chilling origins of storytelling, rejecting the false walls around "serious" literature in favor of a wide-ranging affection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover art by Jordan Crane.</description>

  <description>Julian Donahue is in love with his iPod.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each song that shuffles through “that greatest of all human inventions” triggers a memory. There are songs for the girls from when he was single; there’s the one for the day he met his wife-to-be, and another for the day his son was born. But when his family falls apart, even music loses its hold on him, and he has nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until one snowy night in Brooklyn, when his life’s soundtrack–and life itself–starts to play again. He stumbles into a bar and sees Cait O’Dwyer, a flame-haired Irish rock singer, performing with her band, and a strange and unlikely love affair is ignited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next few months, Julian and Cait’s passion for music and each other is played out, though they never meet. In cryptic emails, text messages, cell-phone videos, and lyrics posted on Cait’s website, they find something in their bizarre friendship that they cannot find anywhere else. Cait’s star is on the rise, and Julian gently guides her along her path to fame–but always from a distance–and she responds to the one voice who understands her, more than a fan but still less than a lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their feelings grow more feverish, keeping a safe distance becomes impossible. What follows is a love story and a uniquely heartbreaking dark comedy about obsession and loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Called “one of the best writers in America” by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling author of &lt;strong&gt;Prague&lt;/strong&gt; delivers his finest work yet in&lt;strong&gt; The Song Is You&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a closely observed tale of love in the digital age that blurs the line between the longing for intimacy and the longing for oblivion.</description>

  <description>During the brief reign of the Queen Mary, Francis Walsingham was a Protestant exile in Italy. Returning home when Elizabeth assumed the throne, from 1570 he became a diplomat to the arch-pragmatist queen. He was often troubled by her inconsistent policy decisions and for allowing the exile in England of Mary Queen of Scots. His triumph came in 1587 when Mary was at last beheaded after the cunning defeat of the Babington plot. A powerful, if enigmatic figure, loathed by his adversaries and deeply admired by friends and allies, Walsingham became the master coordinator of a feared pan-European spy network. His spies underpinned his organization of national resistance to the Spanish Armada, but devotion and duty to Elizabeth was costly, and Walsingham died two years later in penury. Historian and storyteller Derek Wilson delves deeply into the life of a fascinating and highly influential figure, bringing us tales of deceit, betrayal, and loyalty along the way; popular history of the highest caliber.</description>

  <description>In this ingenious debut, Rory Clements introduces John Shakespeare, Elizabethan England's most remarkable investigator, and delivers a tale of murder and conspiracy that succeeds brilliantly as both historical fiction and a crime thriller. &lt;br&gt;In a burnt-out house, one of Queen Elizabeth's aristocratic cousins is found murdered, her young flesh marked with profane symbols. At the same time, a plot to assassinate Sir Francis Drake, England's most famous sea warrior, is discovered--a plot which, if successful, could leave the country utterly defenseless against a Spanish invasion. It's 1587, the Queen's reign is in jeopardy, and one man is charged with the desperate task of solving both cases: John Shakespeare. With the Spanish Armada poised to strike, Mary Queen of Scots awaiting execution, and the pikes above London Bridge decorated with the grim evidence of treachery, the country is in peril of being overwhelmed by fear and chaos. Following a trail of illicit passions and family secrets, Shakespeare travels through an underworld of spies, sorcerers, whores, and theater people, among whom is his own younger brother, the struggling playwright, Will. Shadowed by his rival, the Queen's chief torturer, who employs his own methods of terror, Shakespeare begins to piece together a complex and breathtaking conspiracy whose implications are almost too horrific to contemplate. For a zealous and cunning killer is stalking England's streets. And as Shakespeare threatens to reveal a madman's shocking identity, he and the beautiful woman he desires come ever closer to becoming the next martyrs to a passion for murder and conspiracy whose terrifying consequences might still be felt today....</description>

  &lt;em&gt;"Skilled fiction...tight and complex." - The New York Times&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Compelling... Complex and satisfying." - Publisher's Weekly &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hong Kong 1997 - only a few short months of British rule remain before the territory returns to Chinese rule. It's a febrile place. And in that claustrophobic environment of uncertainty and fear the spooks are hard at work, jostling for position and influence. So when an elderly man emerges from the seas off the New Territories, claiming to know secrets he will share only with the Governor himself, a young MI6 agent, Joe Lennox, sees an opportunity to make his reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the old man, a high-profile Chinese professor, is spirited away in the middle of the night by Joe's superiors, in collusion with the CIA, it's clear that there's a great deal more than a young spy's career at stake. The professor, it seems, holds the key to a sinister and ambitious plan that could have awesome and catastrophic repercussions for China in the 21st century."</description>

  <description>It is a time of wars and revolutions, conflict and intrigue. New Crobuzon is being ripped apart from without and within. War with the shadowy city-state of Tesh and rioting on the streets at home are pushing the teeming city to the brink. A mysterious masked figure spurs strange rebellion, while treachery and violence incubate in unexpected places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In desperation, a small group of renegades escapes from the city and crosses strange and alien continents in the search for a lost hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the blood and violence of New Crobuzon's most dangerous hour, there are whispers. It is the time of the Iron Council.…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bold originality that broke Miéville out as a new force of the genre is here once more in &lt;em&gt;Iron Council&lt;/em&gt;: the voluminous, lyrical novel that is destined to confirm his reputation as perhaps the edgiest mythmaker of the day.</description>

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Against the backdrop of a totalitarian &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;North Korea&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;, one man unwillingly uncovers the truth behind series of murders, and wagers his life in the process.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sit on a quiet hillside at dawn among the wildflowers; take a picture of a car coming up a deserted highway from the south&lt;/em&gt;. Simple orders for Inspector O, until he realizes they have led him far, far off his department's turf and into a maelstrom of betrayal and death. North Korea's leaders are desperate to hunt down and eliminate anyone who knows too much about a series of decades-old kidnappings and murders---and Inspector O discovers too late he has been sent into the chaos.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This is a world where nothing works as it should, where the crimes of the past haunt the present, and where even the shadows are real. A corpse in Pyongyang's main hotel---the Koryo---pulls Inspector O into a confrontation of bad choices between the devils he knows and those he doesn't want to meet. A blue button on the floor of a hotel closet, an ice blue Finnish lake, and desperate efforts by the North Korean leadership set Inspector O on a journey to the edge of a reality he almost can't survive. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Like Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy and the Inspector Arkady Renko novels, &lt;em&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/em&gt; introduces another unfamiliar world, a perplexing universe seemingly so alien that the rules are an enigma to the reader and even, sometimes, to Inspector O. Author James Church weaves a story with beautifully spare prose and layered descriptions of a country and a people he knows by heart after decades as an intelligence officer. This is a chilling portrayal that, in the end, leaves us wondering if what at first seemed unknowable may simply be too familiar for comfort.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Critical Acclaim for &lt;em&gt;The Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"This is a fine, intelligent, and exciting story that takes us into the netherworld of contemporary North Korean communism. It evokes the gray milieu without ever overstepping its mark, allowing us to see it from the inside rather than the outside, wherein the humanity of all the characters, both good and evil, is apparent. Inspector O is a particularly wonderful creation, a true mensch attempting to hold on to his humanity in a world where humanism is under constant attack. Subtlety is the method, and the result is fantastic work that should mark the beginning of a brilliant career for James Church." &lt;br&gt;---Olen Steinhauer, author of &lt;em&gt;Liberation Movements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"For over fifty years Americans have tried to understand the world of North Korea. James Church does a better job of describing the isolated, impoverished, corrupt, and out- of-touch life in the North than anything I have seen. This novel is a must-read for anyone who would understand how precarious the dictatorship is."&lt;br&gt;---Newt Gingrich, author of &lt;em&gt;Winning Back the Future&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Never Call Retreat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"A gripping story of mystery and intrigue. The laconic Inspector O follows in the traditions of Inspector Arkady Renko, operating in a world of complexity and danger we're meeting here for the first time." &lt;br&gt;---Don Oberdorfer, author of &lt;em&gt;Tet!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Church's debut thriller breaks new ground. O is an original. This is an expert take on a complex, brutal, and mystifying society. Immerse yourself in it." &lt;br&gt;---Marshall Browne, author of &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Abyss&lt;/em&gt; and the Inspector Anders series &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/em&gt; is a spellbinder. Bloody and chilling, yet subtle in its psychological detail, with an amazing understanding of North Korea." &lt;br&gt;---Ezra F. Vogel, Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences, Harvard University Asia Center&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"The (pseudonymous) author, a veteran intelligence officer, has intimate knowledge of Asian life and politics, and it shows: He gives the North Korea setting a feeling of palpable reality, depicting the nature of daily life under a totalitarian government not just with broad sociopolitical descriptions but also with specific everyday details. . . . There is also a little of Martin Cruz Smith's early Arkady Renko novels here. The writing is superb, too, well above the level usually associated with a first novel, richly layered and visually evocative." &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;---Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Paradise, Massachusetts, police chief Jesse Stone confronts a town�s darkest secrets in the shocking new novel from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;�bestselling author and �America�s greatest mystery writer� (&lt;em&gt;The New York Sun&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Things are getting strange in Paradise, Massachusetts. Police Chief Jesse Stone is called to the junior high school when reports of lewd conduct by the school�s principal, Betsy Ingersoll, filter into the station. Ingersoll claims she was protecting the propriety of her students when she inspected each girl�s undergarments in the locker room. Jesse would like nothing more than to see Ingersoll punished, but her high-powered attorney husband stands in the way. At the same time, the women of Paradise are faced with a threat to their sense of security with the emergence of a tormented voyeur, dubbed �The Night Hawk.� Initially, he�s content to peer through windows, but as times goes on, he becomes more reckless, forcing his victims to strip at gunpoint, then photographing them at their most vulnerable. And according to the notes he�s sending to Jesse, he�s not satisfied to stop there. It�s up to Jesse to catch the Night Hawk, before it�s too late.</description>

  <description>In Earthquake Weather, Terrill Lee Lankford mined his own experiences as a player in the glamorous, ruthless movie business to create a West Coast noir hailed by T. Jefferson Parker as “part Raymond Chandler and part Nathanael West.” Now get ready for another thrill ride down the Boulevard of Broken Dreams–where a wrong turn can lead to a very dead end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of work in The Industry, Mark Hayes decides he’s desperate enough to hitch his wagon to the dubious star of Clyde McCoy, a hard-drinking veteran screenwriter known only too well for being difficult. Clyde has secured the backing to produce his latest script, a noir homage called Blonde Lightning. With a popular action star and a sexy up-and-comer on board in the lead roles, he’s cleaning up his act, dusting off his director’s chair, and is determined to make the picture happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For investing the last of his savings into the production, Mark gets the title of associate producer. However, his real job is on-set troubleshooter–his duties ranging from keeping a randy old character actor on a short leash to caring for and feeding some very high-maintenance investors. But the real trouble starts when a crewmember is nearly electrocuted. Clyde suspects sabotage, compliments of Mace Thornburg, an industry bottom-feeder with a grudge against nearly everyone in Hollywood, including Clyde’s martial-arts-actress girlfriend. After she’s almost killed in another suspicious accident, Clyde and Mark resort to drastic measures to exact revenge. But when the payback plot takes an unscripted turn, the deadly drama is suddenly no longer in front of the cameras. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, trapped like a pawn in a classic double-cross scenario, Mark realizes the only way out is for him and Clyde to wade deeper into a violent nightmare of treachery, lies, and murder as black and inescapable as the La Brea tar pits. It’s a trip Clyde seems more than willing to take . . . and that Mark discovers is part of the high price for finally getting his name on the silver screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Alan Campbell has graced us with a 26,000 word novella, a prequel to his stunning fantasy debut, Scar Night, the first novel of the Deepgate Codex. Lye Street ends just where the novel picks up!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Greene family is cursed. Every fifty years Deepgate's scarred angel, Carnival, returns to murder another descendant. Now, five hundred years after the first victim's death, Sal Greene is facing his own doom. His time has almost run out. In a desperate attempt to break the chain of violence and save his family, he summons a demon to the chained city: a warrior he hopes is powerful enough to stand against the angel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet the creature which arrives in Deepgate is not quite the legendary mercenary Sal Greene was expecting.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;International Bestseller &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Internationally bestselling author Häkan Nesser makes his U.S. debut with this riveting tale of murder and suspense that reveals the deep humanity of the characters portrayed even as it sends chills up the spine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chief Inspector Van Veeteren is called to the sleepy coastal town of Kalbringen to assist the local police in the investigation of two recent ax murders. Soon the case turns from bad to worse when another body turns up and one of Van Veeteren’s colleagues, a young female detective, disappears without a trace. Now Van Veeteren must find the killer, and, it is hoped, his colleague, before anyone else comes to harm. Riveting and intellectually satisfying,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borkmann’s Point&lt;/strong&gt; unfolds like a chess match where each move could prove deadly.</description>

  <description>On a cold December night in 1920s Atlanta, a drunken white cop shoots a black gambler in one of the worst parts of town, and a cache of jewels goes missing from a mansion in one of the best. Joe Rose—rambler, gambler, and professional thief—has just hit the city. He soon finds himself caught in a three-sided puzzle that involves a black-hearted police officer called �the Captain,” the pimp and crapshooter Little Jesse Williams, and a wicked beauty named Pearl Spencer. Behind it all is Atlanta, the city once nothing but dust and ashes, now the richest, busiest metropolis in the South, mixing sin with success and vibrating with mayhem and music.  In his acclaimed Storyville series, David Fulmer brought the jazz-soaked streets of New Orleans to life. Now he brings us another absorbing mystery in a new setting raucous with music and rich with history.</description>

  <description>Detective Jack Yu grew up in Chinatown. Some of his friends are criminals now; some are dead. Jack has just been transferred to his old neighborhood, where 99 percent of the cops are white. Unlike the others, confused by the residents who speak another language even when they’re speaking English, Jack knows what’s going on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is confronted with a serial rapist who preys on young Chinese girls. Then Uncle Four, an elderly and respected leader of the charitable Hip Ching Society and member of the Hong Kong-based Red Circle Triad, is gunned down. Jack learns that benevolent Uncle Four had a gorgeous young mistress imported from Hong Kong. And she is missing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To solve these crimes, Jack turns to an elderly fortune teller, an old friend of his, in addition to employing modern police methods. This debut mystery power-fully conveys the sights, sounds, and smells of Chinatown, as well as the attitudes of its inhabitants.</description>

  <description>A movie producer hurtles to his death from the top of the Golden Gate Bridge, an apparent suicide that shocks the film community and puts a two hundred million dollar production in jeopardy. &lt;br&gt; His colleague, Grace, doesn't believe it was suicide and turns to private detec-tive Cape Weathers to find the truth. To solve the case, Cape and his friend Sally-an assassin raised by the Triads-take on the Russian mob, a major movie studio, and a recalcitrant police department by enlisting the help of rogue cops, computer hackers, and an investigative journalist who just doesn't give a damn. But with a sniper on their trail, the challenge will be staying alive long enough to find out the truth. &lt;br&gt; Praise for "Stealing the Dragon" &lt;br&gt; " . . . Maleeny gives readers a fresh and fast take that enthralls." "-Crimespree" &lt;br&gt; "Tough, original, compelling-a perfect thriller debut."-Lee Child, "New York Times" bestselling author of "The Hard Way"</description>

  <description>Waged almost six centuries ago, the Battle of Agincourt still captivates. It is the classic underdog story, and generations have wondered how the English--outmanned by the French six to one--could have succeeded so bravely and brilliantly. Drawing on a wide range of sources, Juliet Barker paints a gripping narrative of the October 1415 clash between the outnumbered English archers and the heavily armored French knights. Populated with chivalrous heroes, dastardly spies, and a ferocious and bold king, AGINCOURT is as earthshaking as its subject--and confirms Juliet Barker's status as both a historian and a storyteller of the first rank.</description>

  <description>Jason Steadman is a thirty-year-old sales executive living in Boston and working for a electronics giant, a competitor to Sony and Panasonic. He's a witty, charismatic guy who's well liked at the office, but he lacks the "killer instinct" necessary to move up the corporate ladder. To the chagrin of his ambitious wife, it looks as if his career has hit a ceiling. Jason's been sidelined.&lt;br&gt;But all that will change one evening when Jason meets Kurt Semko, a former Special Forces officer just back from Iraq. Looking for a decent pitcher for the company softball team, Jason gets Kurt, who was once drafted by the majors, a job in Corporate Security. Soon, good things start to happen for Jason - and bad things start to happen to Jason's rivals. His career suddenly takes off. He's an overnight success&lt;br&gt;Only too late does Jason discover that his friend Kurt has been secretly paving his path to the top by the most "efficient" - and ruthless - means available. After all, Kurt says, "Business is war, right?"&lt;br&gt;But when Jason tries to put a stop to it, he finds that his new best friend has become the most dangerous enemy imaginable. And now it's far more than just his career that lies in the balance.&lt;br&gt;A riveting tale of ambition, intrigue, and the price of success, &lt;em&gt;Killer Instinct&lt;/em&gt; is Joseph Finder at his best.</description>

  <description>Tim Winton is Australia’s best-loved novelist. His new work,&lt;em&gt;Breath&lt;/em&gt;, is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency, testing one’s limits against nature, finding like-minded souls, and discovering just how far one breath will take you. It’s a story of extremes—extreme sports and extreme emotions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos, a regimen of risk and challenge, where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs, pushing each other to the edges of endurance, courage, and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentor’s past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wife’s peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limits—in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior—there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome. Full of Winton’s lyrical genius for conveying physical sensation, &lt;em&gt;Breath &lt;/em&gt;is a rich and atmospheric coming-of-age tale from one of world literature’s finest storytellers.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Sarah Vowell travels through the American past and, in doing so, investigates the dusty, bumpy roads of her own life. In this insightful and funny collection of personal stories Vowell -- widely hailed for her inimitable stories on public radio's &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; -- ponders a number of curious questions: Why is she happiest when visiting the sites of bloody struggles like Salem or Gettysburg? Why do people always inappropriately compare themselves to Rosa Parks? Why is a bad life in sunny California so much worse than a bad life anywhere else? What is it about the Zen of foul shots? And, in the title piece, why must doubt and internal arguments haunt the sleepless nights of the true patriot? &lt;p&gt; Her essays confront a wide range of subjects, themes, icons, and historical moments: Ike, Teddy Roosevelt, and Bill Clinton; Canadian Mounties and German filmmakers; Tom Cruise and &lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;; twins and nerds; the Gettysburg Address, the State of the Union, and George W. Bush's inauguration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result is a teeming and engrossing book, capturing Vowell's memorable wit and her keen social commentary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Would it mark the Second Coming or initiate a chain reaction with disastrous consequences?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A master at combining historical and religious intrigue with edge-of-your-seat adventure, "New York Times" bestselling author James Rollins brings back SIGMA Force to battle a group of rogue scientists who've unleashed a bioengineering project that could bring about the extinction of humankind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Washington, D.C., a homeless man dies in Commander Gray Pierce's arms, shot by an assassin's bullet. But the death leaves behind a greater mystery: a bloody coin found clutched in the dead man's hand, an ancient relic that can be traced back to the Greek Oracle of Delphi. As ruthless hunters search for the stolen artifact, Gray Pierce discovers that the coin is the key to unlocking a plot that dates back to the Cold War and threatens the very foundation of humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An international think tank of scientists known as the Jasons has discovered a way to bioengineer autistic children who show savant talents--mathematical geniuses, statistical masterminds, brilliant conceptual artists--into something far greater and far more "frightening," in hopes of creating a world prophet for the new millennium, one to be manipulated to create a new era of global peace . . . a peace on their own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Halfway around the world, a man wakes up in a hospital bed with no memory of who he is, knowing only that he's a prisoner in a subterranean research facility. With the help of three unusual children, he makes his escape across a mountainous and radioactive countryside, pursued by savage hunters bred in the same laboratory. But his goal is not escape, nor even survival. In order to thwart a plot to wipe out a quarter of the world's population, he must sacrifice all, even the children who rescued him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From ancient Greek temples to glittering mausoleums, from the slums of India to the toxic ruins of Russia, two men must race against time to solve a mystery that dates back to the first famous oracle of history--the Greek Oracle of Delphi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one question remains: "Will the past be enough to save the future?"</description>

  <description>Combined for the first time here are Maus I: A Survivor's Tale and Maus II - the complete story of Vladek Spiegelman and his wife, living and surviving in Hitler's Europe. By addressing the horror of the Holocaust through cartoons, the author captures the everyday reality of fear and is able to explore the guilt, relief and extraordinary sensation of survival - and how the children of survivors are in their own way affected by the trials of their parents. A contemporary classic of immeasurable significance.</description>

  <description>“Writing is spooky. There is no routine of an office to keep you going, only the blank page each&lt;br&gt;morning, and you never know where your words are coming from, those divine words.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;The Spooky Art&lt;/strong&gt;, Norman Mailer discusses with signature candor the rewards and trials of the writing life, and recommends the tools to navigate it. Addressing the reader in a conversational tone, he draws on the best of more than fifty years of his own criticism, advice, and detailed observations about the writer’s craft. Mailer explores, among other topics, the use of first person versus third person, the pressing need for discipline, the pitfalls of early success, and the dire matter of coping with bad reviews. While &lt;strong&gt;The Spooky Art&lt;/strong&gt; offers a fascinating preview of what can lie in wait for the student and fledgling writer, the book also has a great deal to say to more advanced writers on the contrary demands of plot and character, the demon writer’s block, and the curious ins-and-outs of publishing. Throughout, Mailer ties in examples from his own career, and reflects on the works of his fellow writers, living and dead—Twain, Melville, Faulkner, Hemingway, Updike, Didion, Bellow, Styron, Beckett, and a host of others. In &lt;strong&gt;The Spooky Art&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; Mailer captures the unique untold suffering and exhilaration of the novelist’s daily life and, while plotting a clear path for other writers to follow, maintains reverence for the underlying mystery and power of the art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Invention of Curried Sausage&lt;/em&gt; is an ingenious, revealing, and delightful novel about the invention of a popular German sidewalk food. Uwe Timm has heard claims that currywurst first appeared in Berlin in the 1950s, but he seems to recall having eaten it much earlier, as a boy in his native Hamburg, at a stand owned and operated by Lena Brücker. He decides to check it out. Although the discovery of curried sausage is eventually explained, it is its prehistory - about how Lena Brücker met, seduced and held captive a German deserter in Hamburg, in April, 1945, just before the war's end-that is the tastiest part. Timm draws gorgeous details from Lena's fine-grained recollections, and the pleasure these provide her and the reader supply the tale's real charm.</description>

  <description>In the wake of a failed marriage and a misguided love affair, feisty academic Terry Williams moves from London to Oxford to resume her abandoned doctorate in detective fiction.  But her visions of a peaceful life in a sleepy university town are shattered when she discovers that her new home was once the scene of a savage sexual murder, the horrific consequences of which continue to resound in the present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soom Terry begins to uncover, hidden beneath the staid academic facade, dark secrets that suggest a mystery more brutal and elusive than any she has come across in her studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while the pieces slowly fall into place, a vicious killer walks the streets of Oxford protected by the night, bent on exacting bloody revenge for a crime of passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elegant yet chilling, assured yet profoundly disturbing, &lt;em&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/em&gt; is a breathtaking debut from a fresh new voice in suspense fiction.</description>

  <description>By 1939, Anglo-American journalist John Russell has spent fifteen years in Berlin, where his German-born son lives. He writes human-interest pieces for British and American papers, avoiding the investigative journalism that could get him deported. But as war approaches, he faces the prospect of having to leave his son and his longtime girlfriend. &lt;p&gt;Then, an acquaintance from his communist days approaches him to do some work for the Soviets. Russell is reluctant but ultimately unable to resist. He becomes involved in other dangerous activities, helping a Jewish family and an idealistic American reporter. When the British and the Nazis notice his involvement with the Soviets, Russell is dragged into the world of warring intelligence services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I don't encourage murder. I have no interest in one person killing another. I only want to draw out morbid desires, imprisoned deep in the unconscious. This lust, once freed, starts growing. Their imaginations run free, and they soon discover their potential... They are waiting for someone like me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spectral, nameless narrator haunts the lost and wounded of big-city Seoul, suggesting solace in suicide. Wandering through the bright lights of their high-urban existence, C and K are brothers who fall in love with the same woman - Se-yeon. As their lives intersect, they tear at each other in a struggle to find connection in their fast-paced, atomized world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreamlike and cinematic, &lt;em&gt;I Have the Right to Destroy Myself&lt;/em&gt; brilliantly affirms Young-ha Kim as Korea's leading young literary master.</description>

  <description>Punktown: established by Earth colonists on a faraway world, a crime-ridden megalopolis peopled by countless races. There is Stake, the private detective with chameleon-like abilities he can not control. There is his wealthy client, Fukuda, whose company mass produces life forms for labor and as playthings. There is Fukuda's beautiful teenage daughter, whose priceless one-of-a-kind living doll has been stolen. And there is the doll itself, growing in size and resentment. Meanwhile, at an abandoned apartment complex with a dark history, a tough street gang and a band of mutant squatters have been trapped inside by bioengineered life forms mindlessly bent on destroying them like an infestation of vermin. The destinies of all these individuals will converge and collide.</description>

  <description>At the age of twenty-five, Arthur Rimbaud—the infamous author of &lt;em&gt;A Season in Hell,&lt;/em&gt; the pioneer of modernism, the lover and destroyer of Verlaine, the "hoodlum poet" celebrated a century later by Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison—turned his back on poetry, France, and fame, for a life of wandering in East Africa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this compelling biography, Charles Nicholl pieces together the shadowy story of Rimbaud's life as a trader, explorer, and gunrunner in Africa. Following his fascinating journey, Nicholl shows how Rimbaud lived out that mysterious pronouncement of his teenage years: "Je est un autre"—I is somebody else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Rimbaud's fear of stasis never left him. 'I should like to wander over the face of the whole world,' he told his sister, Isobelle, 'then perhaps I'd find a place that would please me a little.' The tragedy of Rimbaud's later life, superbly chronicled by Nicholl, is that he never really did."—&lt;em&gt;London Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Nicholl has excavated a mosaic of semi-legendary anecdotes to show that they were an essential part of the poet's journey to become 'somebody else.' Not quite biography, not quite travel book, in the end &lt;em&gt;Somebody Else&lt;/em&gt; transcends both genres."—Sara Wheeler, &lt;em&gt;Daily Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"At the end of &lt;em&gt;Somebody Else&lt;/em&gt; Rimbaud is more interesting and more various than before: he is not less mysterious, but he is more real."—Susannah Clapp, &lt;em&gt;Observer Review&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Boston P.I. Spenser returns — heading west to the rich man's haven of Potshot, Arizona, a former mining town recently reborn as a paradise for Los Angeles millionaires looking for a place to escape the pressures of their high-flying lifestyles. When a band of modern-day mountain men, led by a charismatic individual known as The Preacher, takes over the town, even the local police are powerless to defend the residents in the face of the clever, dangerous gang. Spenser assembles a group of his own, including the redoubtable Hawk, to beat the gang at their own dangerous game and form the nucleus of a real police force to watch over the town when he's gone.</description>

  <description>At the age of 23, James Frey woke up on a plane to find his front teeth knocked out and his nose broken. He had no idea where the plane was headed nor any recollection of the past two weeks. An alcoholic for ten years and a crack addict for three, he checked into a treatment facility shortly after landing. There he was told he could either stop using or die before he reached age 24. This is Frey's acclaimed account of his six weeks in rehab.</description>

  <description>Six months after a crane crushes his pickup truck and his body self-made millionaire Edgar Freemantle launches into a new life. His wife asked for a divorce after he stabbed her with a plastic knife and tried to strangle her one-handed (he lost his arm and for a time his rational brain in the accident). He divides his wealth into four equal parts for his wife, his two daughters, himself and leaves Minnesota for Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily remote stretch of the Florida coast where he has rented a house. All of the land on Duma Key, and the few houses, are owned by Elizabeth Eastlake, an octogenarian whose tragic and mysterious past unfolds perilously. When Edgar begins to paint, his formidable talent seems to come from someplace outside him, and the paintings, many of them, have a power that cannot be controlled.</description>

  <description>Weiner spent a decade as a foreign correspondent reporting from such discontented locales as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Indonesia. Unhappy people living in profoundly unstable states, he notes, inspire pathos and make for good copy, but not for good karma. So Weiner, admitted grump and self-help book aficionado, undertook a year's research to travel the globe, looking for the "unheralded happy places." The result is this book, equal parts laugh-out-loud funny and philosophical, a journey into both the definition of and the destination for true contentment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, the happiest places on earth include, somewhat unexpectedly, Iceland, Bhutan, and India. Weiner also visits the country deemed most malcontent, Moldova, and finds real merit in the claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the question remains: What makes people happy? Is it the freedom of the West or the myriad restrictions of Singapore? The simple ashrams of India or the glittering shopping malls of Qatar?&lt;br&gt;From the youthful drunkenness of Iceland to the despond of Slough, a sad but resilient town in Heathrow's flight path, Weiner offers wry yet profound observations about the way people relate to circumstance and fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both revealing and inspirational, perhaps the best thing about this hilarious trip across four continents is that for the reader, the "geography of bliss" is wherever they happen to find themselves while reading it.</description>

This volume contains PREACHER #8-17.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this continuing saga of the bizarre life of a faithless Texas preacher, Jesse Custer heads to the south to confront the extremely dysfunctional family that abused him as a child and planted the original seeds of his disillusionment with the world. Now merged with a half angelic, half demonic being, the former preacher looks to exact revenge against those who simultaneously raised and destroyed him. Then after exorcising his personal demons, Jesse, his girlfriend Tulip, and their friend Cassidy, the Irish vampire, head west to a party of Babylonian proportions.</description>

  <description>From acclaimed journalist David Talbot comes a groundbreaking narrative account of one of the most tumultuous periods in our history: the Kennedy Administration &amp;amp; its dramatic aftermath. Tho many books have been written about the Kennedy men &amp;amp; their brief time in the White House, few have offered as many explosive revelations as this one. David Talbot describes a JFK administration more besieged by domestic enemies than has been previously realized, from within the Pentagon, the CIA, the FBI &amp;amp; the mob. It's against this dark backdrop that he charts the emotionally charged journey of Robert Kennedy, whose soul-scouring quest to find the origins of his brother’s murder led him, to his horror, back to the dark corners of American power that had been part of his portfolio: U.S. intelligence, Cuba &amp;amp; organized crime. From the Kennedy “band of brothers” to RFK’s hope of using executive power to solve Jack’s death once &amp;amp; for all, this probing work of history draws on more than 150 exclusive interviews to produce a bold look at power &amp;amp; vengeance. A topic of perennial interest, Brothers is a multilayered, complex tale of gut-wrenching history.</description>

  <description>One of the most celebrated comics titles of the late 1990s, PREACHER is a modern American epic of life, death, love and redemption also packed with sex, booze, blood and bullets - not to mention angels, demons, God, vampires and deviants of all stripes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first glance, the Reverend Jesse Custer doesn't look like anyone special-just another small-town minister slowly losing his flock and his faith. But he's about to come face-to-face with proof that God does indeed exist. Merging with a bizarre spiritual force called Genesis, Jesse now possesses the power of "the Word," an ability to make people do whatever he utters. He begins a violent and riotous journey across the country in search of answers from the elusive deity.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed author Arturo Perez-Reverte has earned a distinguished reputation as a master of the literary thriller with his international bestsellers The Club Dumas and The Queen of the South. Now, in this haunting new work, Perez-Reverte has written his most accomplished novel to date. "The Painter of Battles "is a captivating tale of love, war, art, and revenge. &lt;br&gt;Andres Faulques, a world-renowned war photographer, has retired to a life of solitude on the Spanish coast. On the walls of a tower overlooking the sea, he spends his days painting a huge mural that pays homage to history's classic works of war art and that incorporates a lifetime of disturbing images. &lt;br&gt;One night, an unexpected visitor arrives at Faulques' door and challenges the painter to remember him. As Faulques struggles to recall the face, the man explains that he was the subject of an iconic photo taken by Faulques in a war zone years ago. "And why have you come looking for me?" asks Faulques. The stranger answers, "Because I'm going to kill you." &lt;br&gt;This story transports Faulques to the time when he crossed continents to capture conflicts on film with his lover, Olvido, at his side. Until she walked into his life, Faulques muses, he had believed he would survive both war and women. &lt;br&gt;As the tense dialogue between Faulques and his visitor continues, the stakes grow ever higher. What they are grappling with quickly proves to be not just Faulques' fate but the very nature of human love and cruelty itself. &lt;br&gt;Arturo Perez-Reverte perfectly balances the shadows of the heart with the chaos of war in this stunning composition on morality. Superb and tautly written, "The Painter of Battles "is a deeply affecting novel about life and art.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Berlinski's mesmerizing first novel blurs the line between fact and fiction. A young American couple living the expatriate life in Thailand, Mischa and Rachel struggle to keep one step ahead of insolvency.  Rachel works as a first-grade teacher; Mischa is a freelance journalist.  When they meet up with a bibulous fellow expat who regales&lt;br&gt;Mischa with the tale of a mysterious California anthropologist --  Martiya van der Leun, who recently committed suicide while serving out a prison term for murder -- the plot takes an ominous turn.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to get Martiya's story out of his head, Mischa digs up some of her work, which is brilliant, and becomes obsessed with telling her story.  As a field worker with the remote Dyalo tribe, Martiya lived among her subjects, adopting their ways and falling deeply in love with a Dyalo man.  As it turns out, the murder victim was also a Dyalo expert, albeit with a very different mission.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mischa's fascination with Martiya takes him from the halls of academia in Berkeley to the hill tribes of Thailand, vividly recounting the mores, taboos, and religious and sexual rites of both worlds, as well as Martiya's increasingly desperate attempts to reconcile them.  A beautiful and credible craftsman, Berlinski is a sublime writer who has woven a complex plot with a diverse cast into an exceptional novel of wit, charm, and real intelligence.  (&lt;em&gt;Spring 2007 Selection&lt;/em&gt;)</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &lt;em&gt;March&lt;/em&gt;, the journey of a rare illuminated manuscript through centuries of exile and war&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1996, Hanna Heath, an Australian rare-book expert, is offered the job of a lifetime: analysis and conservation of the famed Sarajevo Haggadah, which has been rescued from Serb shelling during the Bosnian war. Priceless and beautiful, the book is one of the earliest Jewish volumes ever to be illuminated with images. When Hanna, a caustic loner with a passion for her work, discovers a series of tiny artifacts in its ancient binding - an insect wing fragment, wine stains, salt crystals, a white hair - she begins to unlock the book's mysteries. The reader is ushered into an exquisitely detailed and atmospheric past, tracing the book's journey from its salvation back to its creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Bosnia during World War II, a Muslim risks his life to protect it from the Nazis. In the hedonistic salons of fin-de-siècle Vienna, the book becomes a pawn in the struggle against the city's rising anti-Semitism. In inquisition-era Venice, a Catholic priest saves it from burning. In Barcelona in 1492, the scribe who wrote the text sees his family destroyed by the agonies of enforced exile. And in Seville in 1480, the reason for the Haggadah's extraordinary illuminations is finally disclosed. Hanna's investigation unexpectedly plunges her into the intrigues of fine art forgers and ultra-nationalist fanatics. Her experiences will test her belief in herself and the man she has come to love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by a true story, &lt;em&gt;People of the Book&lt;/em&gt; is at once a novel of sweeping historical grandeur and intimate emotional intensity, an ambitious, electrifying work by an acclaimed and beloved author.</description>

  <description>Jonah Caine, a lone survivor in a zombie-infested world, struggles to understand the apocalypse in which he lives. Unable to find a moral or sane reason for the horror that surrounds him, he is overwhelmed by violence and insignificance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After wandering for months, Jonah's lonely existence dramatically changes when he discovers a group of survivors. Living in a museum-turned-compound, they are led jointly by Jack, an ever-practical and efficient military man, and Milton, a mysterious, quizzical prophet who holds a strange power over the dead. Both leaders share Jonah's anguish over the brutality of their world, as well as his hope for its beauty. Together with others, they build a community that reestablishes an island of order and humanity surrounded by relentless ghouls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this newfound peace is short-lived, as Jonah and his band of refugees clash with another group of survivors who remind them that the undead are not the only—nor the most grotesque—horrors they must face.</description>

  <description>From the New York Times best-selling author Paul Theroux, Blinding Light is a slyly satirical novel of manners and mind expansion. Slade Steadman, a writer who has lost his chops, sets out for the Ecuadorian jungle with his ex-girlfriend in search of inspiration and a rare hallucinogen. The drug, once found, heightens both his powers of perception and his libido, but it also leaves him with an unfortunate side effect: periodic blindness. Unable to resist the insights that enable him to write again, Steadman spends the next year of his life in thrall to his psychedelic muse and his erotic fantasies, with consequences that are both ecstatic and disastrous.</description>

  <description>"ju-das strain, n. A scientific term for an organism that drives an entire species to extinction"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A master at combining historical and scientific intrigue with cutting-edge adventure, "New York Times" bestselling author of "Map of Bones" and "Black Order" James Rollins returns with his most relentless, high-octane thriller to date--a terrifying story of an ancient menace reborn to plague the modern world . . . and of an impossible hope that lies hidden in the most shocking place imaginable: "within the language of angels."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the depths of the Indian Ocean, a horrific plague has arisen to devastate humankind--a disease that's unknown, unstoppable . . . and deadly. But it is merely a harbinger of the doom that is to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aboard a cruise liner transformed into a makeshift hospital, Dr. Lisa Cummings and Monk Kokkalis--operatives of the shadowy covert organization SIGMA Force--search for answers to the bizarre affliction that has inexplicably washed ashore. But there are others with far less altruistic intentions. In a savage and sudden coup, terrorists hijack the vessel, turning a mercy ship into a floating bio-weapons lab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a Fourth of July celebration a world away, SIGMA's commander Gray Pierce thwarts the murderous schemes of a beautiful assassin--a would-be killer who holds the first clue to the discovery of a possible cure. With the fate of every man, woman, and child on Earth hanging in the balance, Pierce joins forces with the woman who wanted him dead, and together they embark upon an astonishing quest--one that winds through Venetian tombs, Byzantine cathedrals, and jungle-encrusted ruins--following the trail of the most fabled explorer in history: "Marco Polo."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But time is an enemy as a worldwide pandemic grows rapidly out of control. And as a relentless madman dogs their every step, Pierce and his unlikely ally are being pulled into an astonishing mystery buried deep in antiquity and in humanity's genetic code. And as the seconds tick closer to doomsday, Pierce will realize he can truly trust no one--not the bewitching enigma who runs at his side or even those who are closest to him--for any one of them could be . . . "a Judas."</description>

  <description>The incorrigible Jim Thompson tells the true story of his literary education, as he retraces his wild swath across America during the great Depression and World War II. Whether he's outrunning railroad bulls or getting drunk in a funeral home, shaking down debtors or drafting a manuscript with the help of a bighearted prostitute, Thompson is a mesmerizing guide to hard times -- his country's and his own.</description>

  <description>Suspended by chains over a seemingly bottomless abyss, the ancient city of Deepgate is home to a young angel, an assassin, and a psychotic murderer hungry for revenge—or redemption. But soon a shocking betrayal will unite all three in a desperate quest....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last of his line, Dill is descended from legendary Battle-archons who once defended the city. Forbidden to fly and untrained even to wield the great sword inherited from his forebears, he has become a figurehead for a dying tradition. Now he lives a sheltered existence in one of Deepgate’s crumbling temple spires under the watchful eye of the Presbyter who rules the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spine assassin Rachel Hael has better things to do than oversee the Presbyter’s angel. Each dark moon she must fight for her life among the city chains, hunting an immortal predator with a taste for blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a traitor brings enemies to Deepgate’s doorstep, Dill and Rachel are forced into an uneasy alliance with the city’s oldest and most dangerous foe. They must journey down into the uncharted chasm to save their sprawling metropolis—and themselves—from annihilation. Once they descend however, they learn that what lies below is far more sinister than what they’ve been taught to expect.</description>

  <description>Soon after an ancient talisman is smuggled out of Hong Kong, a container ship filled with Chinese refugees runs aground on Alcatraz, the crew murdered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chinese Triads suspect one of their own, a female assassin named Sally known to have a complex relationship with a San Francisco detective named Cape Weathers. But when Sally goes missing, Cape becomes the focus of the Triads’ attention, and soon the police and FBI have him on their radar. Cape quickly realizes he’s screwed if he doesn’t find out what really happened on board the ship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He soon seeks the aid of two neurotic cops, a drug lord, an autistic computer genius, a mayoral candidate, and a reporter with sentient hair. &lt;br&gt;From there, it all goes to Hell.</description>

  <description>Felix Castor is a freelance exorcist, and London is his stamping ground.  It may seem like a good ghost buster can charge what he likes and enjoy a hell of a lifestyle--but there's a risk: Sooner or later he's going to take on a spirit that's too strong for him.  While trying to back out of this ill-conceived career, Castor accepts a seemingly simple ghost-hunting case at a museum in the shadowy heart of London - just to pay the bills, you understand.  But what should have been a perfectly straightforward exorcism is rapidly turning into the Who Can Kill Castor First Show, with demons and ghosts all keen to claim the big prize.  That's OK: Castor knows how to deal with the dead.  It's the living who piss him off...</description>

  <description>Doc Ford faces his greatest challenge ever, in the stunning new novel by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling writer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Book after book, Randy Wayne White's audience and critical acclaim continue to grow. His most recent thriller, &lt;em&gt;Dark Light&lt;/em&gt;, was "one of his brightest novels" (&lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&lt;/em&gt;), "darkly marvelous" (The Miami Herald), "a compelling, readable tale in the justly celebrated Doc Ford series by one of this country's premier crime novelists" (&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;). With &lt;em&gt;Hunter's Moon&lt;/em&gt;, White is ready to take another giant leap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On a foggy, tropic October night, the full moon burning through the mist, I stopped paddling when I heard unexpected voices. Muted whispers, neither English nor Spanish, the voices of men moving in stealth. They shouldn't have been here. I shouldn't have been here. There were plausible explanations, but I didn't like any of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Ford saves from assassination a controversial former president of the United States who is staying on an island off Florida's west coast, he has no idea what he's just let himself in for. J. C. Wilson knows that he has only a short time to live, and he has a full agenda. In seven days, the United States is planning a secret strike on a Central American oil-rich nation, and Wilson intends to intercede-but he'll need help from certain people. One of them is an old adversary, the former dictator of the targeted country, long since disappeared and rumored to be a recluse. Another is a former lover, a woman of considerable influence and mystery. And the third is Doc Ford . . . whether he likes it or not. . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Rich with passion and vivid, pungent prose and some of the best characters found in suspense fiction today, &lt;em&gt;Hunter's Moon&lt;/em&gt; is White's most remarkable novel yet.</description>

  <description>Jane Charlotte has been arrested for murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She tells police that she is a member of a secret organization devoted to fighting evil; her division is called the Department for the Final Disposition of Irredeemable Persons—"Bad Monkeys" for short.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This confession earns Jane a trip to the jail's psychiatric wing, where a doctor attempts to determine whether she is lying, crazy—or playing a different game altogether. What follows is one of the most clever and gripping novels you'll ever read.</description>

  <description>"In the last days of the First World War, socialist revolution swept across Germany, sending Kaiser Wilhelm into exile and transforming Berlin into a battleground. But for Detective Inspector Nikolai Hoffner and his young assistant, Hans Fichte, the revolution is a mere inconvenience. Four women from the slums of Berlin have turned up dead, all with identical markings etched into their backs, and Hoffner and Fichte have spent the better part of six weeks trying to crack the bizarre case." "Things take a troubling turn when the political police begin to show an interest in Hoffner's investigation. Hoffner has no idea why the Polpo would want to get their hands dirty with a serial murderer, until he is shown the lifeless body of Rosa Luxemburg, the same eerie markings on her back. Rumors abound that Rosa, one of the leaders of the suppressed socialist uprising, was assassinated by an angry mob, but the pattern carved into her back tells a different story."</description>

  <description>Investigator Arkady Renko, the pariah of the Moscow prosecutor's office, has been assigned the thankless job of investigating a new phenomenon: late-night subway riders report seeing the ghost of Joseph Stalin on the platform of the Chistye Prudy Metro station. The illusion seems part political hocus-pocus and also part wishful thinking, for among many Russians Stalin is again popular; the bloody dictator can boast a two-to-one approval rating. Decidedly better than that of Renko, whose lover, Eva, has left him for Detective Nikolai Isakov, a charismatic veteran of the civil war in Chechnya, a hero of the far right and, Renko suspects, a killer for hire. The cases entwine, and Renko's quests become a personal inquiry fueled by jealousy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation leads to the fields of Tver outside of Moscow, where once a million soldiers fought. There, amidst the detritus, Renko must confront the ghost of his own father, a favorite general of Stalin's. In these barren fields, patriots and shady entrepreneurs -- the Red Diggers and Black Diggers -- collect the bones, weapons and personal effects of slain World War II soldiers, and find that even among the dead there are surprises.</description>

  <description>"As nearly perfect as any American fiction I know," is how Reynolds Price (&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) described this classic that has been a favorite of readers, both here and in Europe, for almost forty years. Set in provincial France in the 1960s, it is the intensely carnal story--part shocking reality, part feverish dream --of a love affair between a footloose Yale dropout and a young French girl. There is the seen and the unseen--and pages that burn with a rare intensity.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Waterman is no ordinary killer, but then Daniel Jacquot is no ordinary detective.&lt;/em&gt; Daniel Jacquot always jokes that he joined the police force so he could earn a living and still play rugby. And play he did, for France, scoring the winning try in a Five Nations final against the English. Nearly twenty years later, Daniel Jacquot is still remembered for his mighty victory. But now he's a chief inspector, working homicide with the Marseilles &lt;em&gt;judiciaire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; Like playing rugby, tracking down killers is a game that Jacquot understands. And Marseilles just happens to be Jacquot's own home ground. It's here, in this city by the sea, that a shadowy, elusive killer steps onto the field of play--drugging, raping, and drowning three young women. With a new partner, a rising body count, and only a three-word tattoo to work with, Daniel Jacquot gradually closes in on the methodical murderer whom the press have christened "The Waterman." Highly atmospheric and intensely gripping, &lt;em&gt;Jacquot and the Waterman&lt;/em&gt; introduces a stellar new writer to America's must-read mystery list.</description>

  <description>AN ACCIDENTAL VOYEUR...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Flood has a problem that hes long-since given up trying to solve. He's a success in business but a failure as a man. He doesn't even care anymore...until he sees the open window in the hotel room below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The open window...and the woman...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The door looks unassuming -- Room 415 -- but Flood knows what horrors rage behind it. Soon the sweat of his desire will be besmirched with butchers blood, and the moans of passion will grind down to throat-ripping screams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flood is about to walk hand in hand with the woman of his dreams, into the wide-open jaws of the lewdest nightmare, where love, longing, and desire collide with the unspeakable -- all in the middle of a night that bids the question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;JUST HOW SICK CAN YOU BE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knock on the door, turn the knob, and step across the threshold of...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ROOM 415</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In a hushed Vatican Reading Room, the scene is shocking: a crazed professor shot dead after brandishing evidence of a grisly crime. Moments later, two bodies are found in a nearby church, each with a gruesome calling card from their killer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Nic Costa is one of the first on the scene. A cop who barely looks his twenty-seven years, Nic soon meets a woman who will dominate both his thoughts—and his investigation. A cool, beautiful professor of early Christianity, Sara Farnese was in the Vatican Library on that fateful day, a witness to her colleague’s outburst and grotesque death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as more bodies are found, her role becomes even more baffling…because each victim had intimately known Sara, a woman whose history becomes more lurid and unfathomable with each revelation. Until the case takes a sudden, strange turn—and the secrets of a woman, a killer, and a city begin to unravel…with devastating consequences….</description>

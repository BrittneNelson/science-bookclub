  <description>Cannery Row is a book without much of a plot. Rather, it is an attempt to capture the feeling and people of a place, the cannery district of Monterey, California, which is populated by a mix of those down on their luck and those who choose for other reasons not to live "up the hill" in the more respectable area of town. The flow of the main plot is frequently interrupted by short vignettes that introduce us to various denizens of the Row, most of whom are not directly connected with the central story. These vignettes are often characterized by direct or indirect reference to extreme violence: suicides, corpses, and the cruelty of the natural world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The "story" of Cannery Row follows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweet Thursday is the sequel to Cannery Row.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I have been called a writer of the sea, of the tropics, a descriptive writer - and also a realist. But as a matter of fact all my concern has been with the 'ideal' value of things, events and people. That and nothing else&lt;/strong&gt; - Joseph Conrad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Willems stepped off the straight and narrow path of his own peculiar honesty he thought it would be &lt;em&gt;a short episode - a sentence in brackets, so to speak - in the flowing tale of his life&lt;/em&gt;. But Willems was wrong, for he was about to embark on a voyage of discovery and self-discovery that would change, if not destroy, the reset of his life. Marooned by his own people on the shore of a Malayan island, Willems is caught in the grip of his own vulnerability and corruption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Outcast of the Islands&lt;/strong&gt; was only Conrad's second novel, but in its theme, in its impressionistic use of scenery, and, and over all, in the enormous richness and power of the writing, it predicts Conrad's position as a literary figure of the highest rank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;he cover shows a detail from &lt;em&gt;Old Boathouse and Riverside Vegetation, Sarawak&lt;/em&gt; by Marianne North.</description>

Now in his mid-20s, his work is unfulfilling, his marriage is moribund, and he tries to find happiness with another woman. But happiness is more elusive than a medal, and Harry must continue to run--from his wife, his life, and from himself, until he reaches the end of the road and has to turn back....</description>

  <description>Suspicion and fear blow through the wizarding world as news of the Dark Lord's attack on the Ministry of Magic spreads. Harry has not told anyone about the future predicted by the prophecy in the Department of Mysteries, nor how deeply what happened to Sirius Black has affected him. He's desperate for Professor Dumbledore to arrive and take him away from the Dursleys - but Hogwarts may not be the safe haven from Voldemort's dark forces that it once was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his sixth year, the names Black, Malfoy, Lestrange and Snape will haunt Harry with shades of trust and treachery as he discover the secret behind the mysterious Half-Blood Prince - and Dumbledore prepares him to face his own terrifying destiny. . .</description>

  <description>The Prince of Darkness has been given one last shot at redemption, provided he can live out a reasonably blameless life on earth. Highly sceptical, naturally, the Old Dealmaker negotiates a trial period - a summer holiday in a human body, with all the delights of the flesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The body, however, turns out to be that of Declan Gunn, a depressed writer living in Clerkenwell, interrupted in his bath mid-suicide. Ever the opportunist, and with his main scheme bubbling in the background, Luce takes the chance to tap out a few thoughts - to straighten the biblical record, to celebrate his favourite achievements, to let us know just what it's like being him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither living nor explaining turns out to be as easy as it looks. Beset by distractions, miscalculations and all the natural shocks that flesh is heir to, the Father of Lies slowly begins to learn what it's like being us.</description>

  <description>The ancient order of the Knights Templar possessed untold wealth and absolute power over kings and popes . . . until the Inquisition, when they were wiped from the face of the earth, their hidden riches lost. But now two forces vying for the treasure have learned that it is not at all what they thought it was–and its true nature could change the modern world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cotton Malone, one-time top operative for the U.S. Justice Department, is enjoying his quiet new life as an antiquarian book dealer in Copenhagen when an unexpected call to action reawakens his hair-trigger instincts–and plunges him back into the cloak-and-dagger world he thought he’d left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It begins with a violent robbery attempt on Cotton’s former supervisor, Stephanie Nelle, who’s far from home on a mission that has nothing to do with national security. Armed with vital clues to a series of centuries-old puzzles scattered across Europe, she means to crack a mystery that has tantalized scholars and fortune-hunters through the ages by finding the legendary cache of wealth and forbidden knowledge thought to have been lost forever when the order of the Knights Templar was exterminated in the fourteenth century. But she’s not alone. Competing for the historic prize–and desperate for the crucial information Stephanie possesses–is Raymond de Roquefort, a shadowy zealot with an army of assassins at his command.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome or not, Cotton seeks to even the odds in the perilous race. But the more he learns about the ancient conspiracy surrounding the Knights Templar, the more he realizes that even more than lives are at stake. At the end of a lethal game of conquest, rife with intrigue, treachery, and craven lust for power, lies a shattering discovery that could rock the civilized world–and, in the wrong hands, bring it to its knees.</description>

Welcome to Low Town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the forgotten back alleys and flophouses that lie in the shadows of Rigus, the finest city of the Thirteen Lands, you will find Low Town. It is an ugly place, and its cham­pion is an ugly man. Disgraced intelligence agent. Forgotten war hero. Independent drug dealer. After a fall from grace five years ago, a man known as the Warden leads a life of crime, addicted to cheap violence and expensive drugs. Every day is a constant hustle to find new customers and protect his turf from low-life competition like Tancred the Harelip and Ling Chi, the enigmatic crime lord of the heathens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Warden’s life of drugged iniquity is shaken by his dis­covery of a murdered child down a dead-end street . . . set­ting him on a collision course with the life he left behind. As a former agent with Black House—the secret police—he knows better than anyone that murder in Low Town is an everyday thing, the kind of crime that doesn’t get investi­gated. To protect his home, he will take part in a dangerous game of deception between underworld bosses and the psy­chotic head of Black House, but the truth is far darker than he imagines. In Low Town, no one can be trusted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Polansky has crafted a thrilling novel steeped in noir sensibilities and relentless action, and set in an original world of stunning imagination, leading to a gut-wrenching, unforeseeable conclusion. &lt;em&gt;Low Town&lt;/em&gt; is an attention-grabbing debut that will leave readers riveted . . . and hun­gry for more.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is one of those books that I started reading as a palette cleanser between heavier, denser books.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the debut crime novel from the Booker-winning author, a Dublin pathologist follows the corpse of a mysterious woman into the heart of &lt;br&gt;a conspiracy among the city's high Catholic society &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not the dead that seem strange to Quirke. It's the living. One night, after a few drinks at an office party, Quirke shuffles down into the morgue where he works and finds his brother-in-law, Malachy, altering a file he has no business even reading. Odd enough in itself to find Malachy there, but the next morning, when the haze has lifted, it looks an awful lot like his brother-in-law, the esteemed doctor, was in fact tampering with a corpse--and concealing the cause of death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turns out the body belonged to a young woman named Christine Falls. And as Quirke reluctantly presses on toward the true facts behind her death, he comes up against some insidious--and very well-guarded--secrets of Dublin's high Catholic society, among them members of his own family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in Dublin and Boston in the 1950s, the first novel in the Quirke series brings all the vividness and psychological insight of Booker Prize winner John Banville's fiction to a thrilling, atmospheric crime story. Quirke is a fascinating and subtly drawn hero, &lt;em&gt;Christine Falls&lt;/em&gt; is a classic tale of suspense, and Benjamin Black's debut marks him as a true master of the form.</description>

  <description>The inimitable Quirke returns in another spellbinding crime novel, in which a young woman’s dubious suicide sets off a new string of hazards and deceptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years have passed since the events of the bestselling Christine Falls, and much has changed for Quirke, the irascible, formerly hard-drinking Dublin pathologist. His beloved Sarah is dead, his surrogate father lies in a convent hospital paralyzed by a devastating stroke, and Phoebe, Quirke’s long-denied daughter, has grown increasingly withdrawn and isolated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With much to regret from his last inquisitive foray, Quirke ought to know better than to let his curiosity get the best of him. Yet when an almost forgotten acquaintance comes to him about his beautiful young wife’s apparent suicide, Quirke’s “old itch to cut into the quick of things, to delve into the dark of what was hidden” is roused again. As he begins to probe further into the shadowy circumstances of Deirdre Hunt’s death, he discovers many things that might better have remained hidden, as well as grave danger to those he loves.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunting, masterfully written, and utterly mesmerizing in its nuance, The Silver Swan fully lives up to the promise of Christine Falls and firmly establishes Benjamin Black (a.k.a. John Banville) among the greatest of crime writers.</description>

  <description>When political intrigue drove Louis Morgon from a successful career at the State Department, he moved to a cottage in France, far from Washington and what he called “the sordid world.” He took up painting. He grew vegetables and flowers. He ate long, lovely meals on the terrace overlooking fields of sunflowers. He thought that he had found happiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day Louis’s past lands squarely on his doorstep. It does so in the shape of a dead man. His throat has been slit. He wears a cap with &lt;em&gt;liberte &lt;/em&gt;embroidered on it. Except for the local cop, Jean Renard, the police are strangely uninterested. This seems peculiar to Renard, but not to Louis. He knows who the murderer is. He also knows that he is likely to be the next victim. And there is very little he or Renard or anyone else can do. Each clue they find raises more questions than it answers. Nothing is as it appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Louis’s best hope is to turn the tables on his murderer. Instead of knowledge, he has only his intuition and his intelligence. Instead of power or influence, he has only his own past. Louis finds himself on a lonely and dangerous journey of self-discovery. He thought he was beyond surprises. But every turn of the road reveals new mysteries, and the resolution is a shock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A French Country Murder&lt;/em&gt; is a story of political intrigue, corruption and jealousy. It is also a story of love and friendship and, of course, France.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Liam Mulligan is as old school as a newspaper man gets. His beat is Providence, Rhode Island, and he knows every street and alley. He knows the priests and prostitutes, the cops and street thugs. He knows the mobsters and politicians—who are pretty much one and the same. Someone is systematically burning down the neighborhood Mulligan grew up in, people he knows and loves are perishing in the flames, and the public is on the verge of panic. With the whole city of Providence on his back, Mulligan must weed through a wildly colorful array of characters to find the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Publishers Weekly" hails Rogue Island as one of the best debut novels of 2010 and calls the main character "a masterpiece of irreverence and street savvy."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Kirkus Reviews" calls the book "a blistering debut."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astarred review in "Booklist" says it's "definitely one of the year's best."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Library Journal" says, "Boy does it deliver!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And rarely has a first novel received so much advance praise from the world’s crime fiction royalty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“With Rogue Island, Bruce DeSilva accomplishes something remarkable: he takes everything we love about the classic hardboiled detective novel and turns it into a story that’s fresh, contemporary, yet timeless. By turns gripping, funny, and touching, it’s a tale filled with characters so vivid they jump off the page. One of the best debuts I’ve read since Dennis Lehane’s A Drink Before the War.” &lt;br&gt;-- Joseph Finder, New York Times best-selling author of Vanished and Paranoia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogue Island is a tense, terrific thriller and a remarkably assured debut from Bruce DeSilva, an author to watch. &lt;br&gt;-- Dennis Lehane, best-selling author of Mystic River and Shutter Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rhode Island of Bruce DeSilva’s imagination is a claustrophobic little state where everyone knows your name, secrets are hard to keep, and corruption has ruled since the first colonial governor dined with Captain Kidd. In this vivid landscape peopled by colorful mobsters, brutal cops and sleazy politicians, a droll hero named Mulligan fights long odds to find a measure of justice. Rogue Island is a stunning debut in the noir tradition. &lt;br&gt;-- Harlan Coben, New York Times bestselling author of Long Lost and Hold Tight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rogue Island is a blast! Writing with genuine authority, a dose of cynical humor and a squinting eye on the world, Bruce DeSilva delivers a newspaper story that ranks with the best of them. &lt;br&gt;-- Michael Connelly, best-selling author of the Harry Bosch crime novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruce DeSilva puts it all out there: a gripping plot, memorable characters, and terrific writing. Rogue Island is a stunning debut, and DeSilva is a writer to watch. &lt;br&gt;-- Alafair Burke, author of 212. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not since Dennis Lehane's A Drink Before the War have I read a first novel as compelling and sure-handed as DeSilva's Rogue Island. Investigative reporter Liam Mulligan has the tough-talking charm, the old school street smarts, and sexy chivalry of a Marlowe or Spade. He needs all these skills to navigate a world where vigilantes prowl the neighborhood with baseball bats, and everyone from sleazy politicians to mafia losers are out to slice off their pound of flesh. I hope Mulligan is around for years to come. He’s funny, fallible, and real. &lt;br&gt;-- James W. Hall, Edgar-Award-winning author of Hell’s Bay and Magic City&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fans of Michael Connelly and Robert B. Parker, rejoice. L.S.A. Mulligan is on the case. Rogue Island is full of high spirits, low cunning and barbed wit. A wry and entertaining debut in the grand hard-boiled tradition from Bruce DeSilva.&lt;br&gt;-- Peter Blauner, critically acclaimed author of Slow Motion Riot and Slipping Into Darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruce DeSilva knows exactly how thrillers work, and he pulls out all the stops in this impressive debut. With a powerful and authentic sense of place, DeSilva peels back the curtain and shows us the real deal; a Providence as gritty and corrupt as any big city, and deadlier than most. &lt;br&gt;– Sean Chercover, award-winning author of Trigger City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cross me heart, I could have written a whole essay on how much I loved Rogue Island. Imagine Don Winslow peppered with Peter Dexter and you'd have the flavour and pace of this novel. The writing has a balanced poise that is perfectly suited to the narrative, there are no tidy solutions, and the ending leaves a fierce chill lingering. A terrific slow motion burn of a novel. &lt;br&gt;-- Ken Bruen, critically acclaimed Irish master of noir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the title to Bruce DeSilva's fiercely entertaining novel is a comic play on words. For Rogue Island is really Rhode Island, and no one knows that roguishness better than Mulligan, the Providence reporter who drifts just high enough above its moral squalor to glimpse its battered charm. A debut novel as witty as it is intelligent, smoothly written and wryly told, a gem. &lt;br&gt;-- Thomas H. Cook, critically acclaimed author of Red Leaves and Master of the Delta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bruce DeSilva handles a keyboard the way a samurai handles a sword. A stunning debut. Authentic, hilarious, and compelling. I’ve read hundreds of crime books, but this one bleeds the truth. I haven’t been so impressed with a crime novelist since I discovered some guy named Robert B. Parker. &lt;br&gt;-- Ace Atkins, critically acclaimed author of Devil’s Garden and Infamous&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't believe this is a debut -- DeSilva writes with a master's understanding of the genre. The dialogue is spot on, the humor is wry, and the world is gritty enough that I still have dirt under my fingernails. Rogue Island is a winner. &lt;br&gt;-- Marcus Sakey, bestselling author of The Amateurs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Rogue Island, Bruce DeSilva's sharp, polished debut, "Don't call me Liam" Mulligan is a Providence beat reporter stubbornly convinced that a ruthless firebug is at work. When it comes to fresh noir-on-wry, readers could not ask for more--except for the author to hurry up with Mulligan's next adventure. &lt;br&gt;-- Otto Penzler, dean of America's crime novel editors and owner of New York City's famous The Mysterious Bookshop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DeSilva is a welcome new "rogue" voice in American fiction, and his years of journalism shine through. The tight description, deft pacing and coming-alive-off-the-page characters will have me standing in line for the next one. &lt;br&gt;-- Tim Dorsey, best-selling author of the Storm Serge mysteries</description>

  <description>The legend of Joshua Miller has chilled residents of Miller's Grove for seven decades. The town's children all know about the man who sold his soul to the devil and his macabre death at the hands of outraged townspeople-- bound to a cross in a desecrated church, sealed away and left to rot.But he didn't rot. His skin withered and his body mummified until he resembled a twisted human scarecrow. And he didn't really die.   </description>

  <description>Suburbia. Shady, tree-lined streets, well-tended lawns and cozy homes. A nice, quiet place to grow up. Unless you are teenage Meg or her crippled sister, Susan. On a dead-end street, in the dark, damp basement of the Chandler house, Meg and Susan are left captive to the savage whims and rages of a distant aunt who is rapidly descending into madness. It is a madness that infects all three of her sons and finally the entire neighborhood. Only one troubled boy stands hesitantly between Meg and Susan and their cruel, torturous deaths. A boy with a very adult decision to make.</description>

  <description>“I present to you . . . the truth about this man’s death and my life.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baltimore, 1849. The body of Edgar Allan Poe has been buried in an unmarked grave. The public, the press, and even Poe’s own family and friends accept the conclusion that Poe was a second-rate writer who met a disgraceful end as a drunkard. Everyone, in fact, seems to believe this except a young Baltimore lawyer named Quentin Clark, an ardent admirer who puts his own career and reputation at risk in a passionate crusade to salvage Poe’s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Quentin explores the puzzling circumstances of Poe’s demise, he discovers that the writer’s last days are riddled with unanswered questions the police are possibly willfully ignoring. Just when Poe’s death seems destined to remain a mystery, and forever sealing his ignominy, inspiration strikes Quentin–in the form of Poe’s own stories. The young attorney realizes that he must find the one person who can solve the strange case of Poe’s death: the real-life model for Poe’s brilliant fictional detective character, C. Auguste Dupin, the hero of ingenious tales of crime and detection.&lt;br&gt;In short order, Quentin finds himself enmeshed in sinister machinations involving political agents, a female assassin, the corrupt Baltimore slave trade, and the lost secrets of Poe’s final hours. With his own future hanging in the balance, Quentin Clark must turn master investigator himself to unchain his now imperiled fate from that of Poe’s.</description>

  <description>Tom Braun is sitting in his neighborhood bar. His wife and his boy are at home in their apartment just a few blocks away. He's had yet another fight with her and is looking to steady his nerves and drown his sorrows and maybe--if he's lucky--snag a little something on the side. But the women in the bar are very strange tonight.</description>

  <description>Cherie Priest's much-anticipated steampunk debut has finally arrived in the form of a paperback original. Its plot features the sort of calibrated suspense that readers of her &lt;em&gt;Four and Twenty Blackbirds&lt;/em&gt; would expect. &lt;em&gt;Boneshaker&lt;/em&gt; derives its title from the Bone-Shaking Drill Engine, a device designed to give Russian prospectors a leg up in the race for Klondike gold. Unfortunately, there was one hitch: On its trial run, the Boneshaker went haywire and, long story short, turned much of Seattle into a city of the dead. Now, 16 years later, a teenage boy decides to find out what is behind that mysterious wall. Can his mother save him in time? Zombie lit of the first order.</description>

  <description>Dobson, New York, 1905.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Simon Ziele lost his fiancée in the General Slocum ferry disaster—a thousand perished on that summer day in 1904 when an onboard fire burned the boat down in the waters of the East River. Still reeling from the tragedy, Ziele transferred to a police department north of New York, to escape the city and all the memories it conjured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But only a few months into his new life in a quiet country town, he’s faced with the most shocking homicide of his career to date: Young Sarah Wingate has been brutally murdered in her own bedroom in the middle of an otherwise calm and quiet winter afternoon. After just one day of investigation, Simon’s contacted by Columbia University’s noted criminologist Alistair Sinclair, who offers a startling claim about one of his patients, Michael Fromley—that the facts of the murder bear an uncanny resemblance to Fromley’s deranged mutterings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what would have led Fromley, with his history of violent behavior and brutal fantasies, to seek out Sarah, a notable mathematics student and a proper young lady who has little in common with his previous targets? Is Fromley really a murderer, or is someone mimicking him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what Simon Ziele must find out, with the help of the brilliant but self-interested Alistair Sinclair—before the killer strikes again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this taut, atmospheric, and original story of a haunted man who must search for a killer while on the run from his own demons, Stefanie Pintoff’s &lt;em&gt;In the Shadow of Gotham&lt;/em&gt; marks the debut of an outstanding new talent, the inaugural winner of the Minotaur Books/Mystery Writers of America Best First Crime Novel Competition.</description>

  <description>The year is 1881. The United States of America ends at the Mississippi River. Beyond lies the Indian nations, where the magic of powerful Medicine Men has halted the advance of the Americans east of the river.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An American government desperate to expand its territory sends Thomas Alva Edison out West to the town of Tombstone, Arizona, on a mission to discover a scientific means of counteracting magic. Hired to protect this great genius, Wyatt Earp and his brothers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are plenty who would like to see the Earps and Edison dead. Riding to their aid are old friends Doc Holliday and Bat Masterson. Against them stand the Apache wizard Geronimo and the Clanton gang. Battle lines are drawn, and the Clanton gang, which has its own reasons for wanting Edison dead, sends for Johnny Ringo, the one man who might be Doc Holliday's equal in a gunfight. But what shows up instead is The Thing That Was Once Johnny Ringo, returned from the dead and come to Tombstone looking for a fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to a West like you've never seen before, where "Bat Masterson" hails from the ranks of the undead, where electric lights shine down on the streets of Tombstone, while horseless stagecoaches carry passengers to and fro, and where death is no obstacle to The Thing That Was Once Johnny Ringo. Think you know the story of the O.K. Corral? Think again, as five-time Hugo winner Mike Resnick takes on his first steampunk western tale, and the West will never be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Anthem&lt;/strong&gt; has long been hailed as one of &lt;strong&gt;Ayn Rand&lt;/strong&gt;'s classic novels, and a clear predecessor to her later masterpieces, &lt;strong&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/strong&gt;. In Anthem, Rand examines a frightening future in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. Equality 7-2521 lives in the dark ages of the future where all decisions are made by committee, all people live in collectives, and all traces of individualism have been wiped out. Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great "we" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--"I."</description>

  <description>In the summer of 1998, Walter Kirn--then a young novelist struggling with fatherhood and a dissolving marriage--set out on a peculiar, fateful errand: to personally deliver a crippled hunting dog from an animal shelter in Montana to the New York apartment of one Clark Rockefeller, a secretive young banker and art collector. Thus began a fifteen-year relationship that drew Kirn deep into the fun-house world of an outlandish, eccentric son of privilege who, one day, would be shockingly unmasked as a brazen serial impostor and brutal double-murderer. Kirn's one-of-a-kind story, already excerpted in The New Yorker, of being duped by a real-life Mr. Ripley, takes us on a bizarre and haunting journey from the posh private club rooms of Manhattan to the hard-boiled courtrooms and prisons of Los Angeles. In Blood Will Out, Kirn lays bare a Dreiseresque tale of class, self-invention, and the great American con.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;“Accursed! Accursed! You shall be accursed to the thirteenth generation!”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Iron King – Philip the Fair – is as cold and silent, as handsome and unblinking as a statue. He governs his realm with an iron hand, but he cannot rule his own family: his sons are weak and their wives adulterous; while his red-blooded daughter Isabella is unhappily married to an English king who prefers the company of men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A web of scandal, murder and intrigue is weaving itself around the Iron King; but his downfall will come from an unexpected quarter. Bent on the persecution of the rich and powerful Knights Templar, Philip sentences Grand Master Jacques de Molay to be burned at the stake, thus drawing down upon himself a curse that will destroy his entire dynasty…</description>

  <description>Nearly fifty years after being sworn in as president of the United States in the wake of John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Lyndon Baines Johnson remains a largely misunderstood figure. His force of personal­ity, mastery of power and the political process, and boundless appetite for social reform made him one of the towering figures of his time. But he was one of the most protean and paradoxical of presidents as well. Because of his flawed nature and inherent contradic­tions, some claimed there were as many LBJs as there were people who knew him. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Intent on fulfilling the promise of America, Johnson launched a revolution in civil rights, federal aid to education, and health care for the elderly and indigent, and expanded immigration and environ­mental protection. A flurry of landmark laws—he would sign an unparalleled 207 during his five years in office, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, Elementary and Second­ary Education Act, Head Start, and Medicare—are testaments to the triumph of his will. His War on Poverty alone brought the U.S. poverty rate down from 20 percent to 12 percent, the biggest one-time drop in American history. As president, he was known for getting things done. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the same time, Johnson’s presidency—and the fulfillment of its own promise—was blighted by his escalation of an ill-fated war in Vietnam that tore at the fabric of America and saw the loss of 36,000 U.S. troops by the end of his term. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Presidential historian Mark K. Updegrove offers an intimate portrait of the endlessly fas­cinating LBJ, his extraordinarily eventful presi­dency, and the turbulent times in which he served. We see Johnson in his many guises and dimen­sions: the virtuoso deal-maker using every inch of his six-foot-three-inch frame to intimidate his subjects, the relentless reformer willing to lose southern Democrats from his party for a generation in his pursuit of civil rights for all Americans, and the embattled commander in chief agonizing over the fate of his “boys” in Vietnam—including his two sons-in-law—yet steadfast in his determination to thwart Communist aggression through war, or an honorable peace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Through original interviews and personal accounts from White House aides and Cabinet members, political allies and foes, and friends and family—from Robert McNamara to Barry Goldwa­ter, Lady Bird Johnson to Jacqueline Kennedy—as well as through Johnson’s own candid reflections and historic White House telephone conversa­tions, &lt;em&gt;Indomitable Will &lt;/em&gt;reveals LBJ as never before. “ For it is through firsthand narrative more than anything,” writes Updegrove, “that Lyndon John­son—who teemed with vitality in his sixty-four years and remains enigmatic nearly four decades after his passing—comes to life.”</description>

  <description>From bestselling author Howard Blum comes a remarkable true story of a pivotal moment in American history when the nation’s first counterterrorism unit waged a secret war to stop a stealth army of German spies and saboteurs.&lt;br&gt;            In the early days of World War I, the German high command is outraged that supposedly "neutral" America is aggressively trading with the Allies, giving them a critical advantage in weapons and supplies. Desperate to disrupt the surreptitious support without pushing the United States into the conflict, German spymasters hatch a secret campaign of terrorism and sabotage on US soil.&lt;br&gt;Among the conspirators are an expert on germ warfare, a murderous Harvard professor, and a debonair German officer turned master spy. Their targets are ships, factories, livestock, and even captains of the military-industrial complex such as J. P. Morgan. Their tools are murder, assassination, bombs, and a germ warfare campaign instigated from a clandestine laboratory six miles from the White House. And their schemes include sabotaging American munitions factories and supply depots, planting bombs on, bombing the Capitol Building, and spreading deadly toxins.&lt;br&gt;            For Police Inspector Tom Tunney, a former NYPD bomb squad expert tasked with rooting out the spies, the immense challenge dwarf those that will be faced by his terror-fighting successors decades later. The Kaiser's spies are well-trained, well-funded, and inventive. Plus, they have the assistance of many of the nearly eight million German-Americans - a potential army of moles and fellow saboteurs.&lt;br&gt;            As Tunney enters the deep labyrinth of deception that the Germans have created, he begins to realize that the scope of the terrorists' plan is far greater than anyone suspected.  At stake is not only the fate of America’s allies, but America itself.&lt;br&gt;            At once an edge-of-the-seat spy thriller and an illuminating portrait of a unit that was, in effect, America’s&lt;em&gt; first&lt;/em&gt; department of homeland security, &lt;em&gt;Dark Invasion &lt;/em&gt;is a tour de force&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of narrative history.</description>

  <description>The story begins in 1962. On a rocky patch of the sun-drenched Italian coastline, a young innkeeper, chest-deep in daydreams, looks on over the incandescent waters of the Ligurian Sea and spies an apparition: a tall, thin woman, a vision in white, approaching him on a boat. She is an actress, he soon learns, an American starlet, and she is dying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the story begins again today, half a world away, when an elderly Italian man shows up on a movie studio's back lot-searching for the mysterious woman he last saw at his hotel decades earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What unfolds is a dazzling, yet deeply human, roller coaster of a novel, spanning fifty years and nearly as many lives. From the lavish set of Cleopatra to the shabby revelry of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Walter introduces us to the tangled lives of a dozen unforgettable characters: the starstruck Italian innkeeper and his long-lost love; the heroically preserved producer who once brought them together and his idealistic young assistant; the army veteran turned fledgling novelist and the rakish Richard Burton himself, whose appetites set the whole story in motion-along with the husbands and wives, lovers and dreamers, superstars and losers, who populate their world in the decades that follow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gloriously inventive, constantly surprising, Beautiful Ruins is a story of flawed yet fascinating people, navigating the rocky shores of their lives while clinging to their improbable dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a voice more powerful and compassionate than ever before, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Elizabeth Strout binds together thirteen rich, luminous narratives into a book with the heft of a novel, through the presence of one larger-than-life, unforgettable character: Olive Kitteridge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At the edge of the continent, Crosby, Maine, may seem like nowhere, but seen through this brilliant writer’s eyes, it’s in essence the whole world, and the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand human drama–desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, deplores the changes in her little town and in the world at large, but she doesn’t always recognize the changes in those around her: a lounge musician haunted by a past romance: a former student who has lost the will to live: Olive’s own adult child, who feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a curse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As the townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive is brought to a deeper understanding of herself and her life–sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless honesty. &lt;em&gt;Olive Kitteridge&lt;/em&gt; offers profound insights into the human condition–its conflicts, its tragedies and joys, and the endurance it requires.</description>

  <description>Europe, 1900�1914: a world adrift, a pulsating era of creativity and contradictions. The major topics of the day: terrorism, globalization, immigration, consumerism, the collapse of moral values, and the rivalry of superpowers. The twentieth century was not born in the trenches of the Somme or Passchendaele—but rather in the fifteen vertiginous years preceding World War I.In this short span of time, a new world order was emerging in ultimately tragic contradiction to the old. These were the years in which the political and personal repercussions of the Industrial Revolution were felt worldwide: Cities grew like never before as people fled the countryside and their traditional identities; science created new possibilities as well as nightmares; education changed the outlook of millions of people; mass-produced items transformed daily life; industrial laborers demanded a share of political power; and women sought to change their place in society—as well as the very fabric of sexual relations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the tremendous hope for a new century embodied in the 1900 World’s Fair in Paris to the shattering assassination of a Habsburg archduke in Sarajevo in 1914, historian Philipp Blom chronicles this extraordinary epoch year by year. Prime Ministers and peasants, anarchists and actresses, scientists and psychopaths intermingle on the stage of a new century in this portrait of an opulent, unstable age on the brink of disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully written and replete with deftly told anecdotes, &lt;em&gt;The Vertigo Years&lt;/em&gt; brings the wonders, horrors, and fears of the early twentieth century vividly to life.</description>

  <description>In 1966, Gregory Rabassa won the first National Book Award to recognize the work of a translator, for his English-language edition of &lt;em&gt;Hopscotch&lt;/em&gt;. Julio Cortazar was so pleased with Rabassa's translation of &lt;em&gt;Hopscotch&lt;/em&gt; that he recommended the translator to Gabriel García Márquez when García Márquez was looking for someone to translate his novel &lt;em&gt;One Hundred Years of Solitude&lt;/em&gt; into English. "Rabassa's &lt;em&gt;One Hundred Years of Solitude&lt;/em&gt; improved the original," according to García Márquez.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is highly influenced by Henry Miller’s reckless and relentless search for truth in post-decadent Paris and Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki’s modal teachings on Zen Buddhism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cortázar's employment of interior monologue, punning, slang, and his use of different languages is reminiscent of Modernist writers like Joyce, although his main influences were Surrealism and the French New Novel, as well as the "riffing" aesthetic of jazz and New Wave Cinema.</description>

  <description>In his most ambitious project to date, award-winning author Kim Stanley Robinson utilizes years of research &amp;amp; cutting-edge science in the 1st of a trilogy chronicling the colonization of Mars: For eons, sandstorms have swept the desolate landscape. For centuries, Mars has beckoned humans to conquer its hostile climate. Now, in 2026, a group of 100 colonists is about to fulfill that destiny. John Boone, Maya Toitavna, Frank Chalmers &amp;amp; Arkady Bogdanov lead a terraforming mission. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage &amp;amp; madness. For others it offers an opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. For the genetic alchemists, it presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life &amp;amp; death. The colonists orbit giant satellite mirrors to reflect light to the surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth. Massive tunnels, kilometers deep, will be drilled into the mantle to create stupendous vents of hot gases. Against this backdrop of epic upheaval, rivalries, loves &amp;amp; friendships will form &amp;amp; fall to pieces--for there are those who will fight to the death to prevent Mars from ever being changed.&lt;br&gt; Brilliantly imagined, breathtaking in scope &amp;amp; ingenuity, &lt;em&gt;Red Mars&lt;/em&gt; is an epic scientific saga, chronicling the next step in evolution, creating a world in its entirety. It shows a future, with both glory &amp;amp; tarnish, that awes with complexity &amp;amp; inspires with vision.</description>

  <description>Haya Tedeschi sits alone in Gorizia, in northeastern Italy, surrounded by a basket of photographs and newspaper clippings. Now an old woman, she waits to be reunited after sixty-two years with her son, fathered by an SS officer and stolen from her by the German authorities as part of Himmler’s clandestine &lt;em&gt;Lebensborn&lt;/em&gt; project. Haya reflects on her Catholicized Jewish family’s experiences, dealing unsparingly with the massacre of Italian Jews in the concentration camps of Trieste. Her obsessive search for her son leads her to photographs, maps, and fragments of verse, to testimonies from the Nuremberg trials and interviews with second-generation Jews, and to eyewitness accounts of atrocities that took place on her doorstep. From this broad collage of material and memory arises the staggering chronicle of Nazi occupation in northern Italy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in immensely powerful language and employing a range of astonishing conceptual devices, &lt;em&gt;Trieste&lt;/em&gt; is a novel like no other. Daša Drndić has produced a shattering contribution to the literature of twentieth-century history.</description>

  <description>A New York Review Books Original&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The distinguished Croatian journalist and publisher Slavko Goldstein says, “Writing this book about my family, I have tried not to separate what happened to us from the fates of many other people and of an entire country.” &lt;em&gt;1941: The Year That Keeps Returning&lt;/em&gt; is Goldstein’s astonishing historical memoir of that fateful year—when the Ustasha, the pro-fascist nationalists, were brought to power in Croatia by the Nazi occupiers of Yugoslavia. On April 10, when the German troops marched into Zagreb, the Croatian capital, they were greeted as liberators by the Croats. Three days later, Ante Pavelić, the future leader of the Independent State of Croatia, returned from exile in Italy and Goldstein’s father, the proprietor of a leftist bookstore in Karlovac—a beautiful old city fifty miles from the capital—was arrested along with other local Serbs, communists, and Yugoslav sympathizers. Goldstein was only thirteen years old, and he would never see his father again. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; More than fifty years later, Goldstein seeks to piece together the facts of his father’s last days. The moving narrative threads stories of family, friends, and other ordinary people who lived through those dark times together with personal memories and an impressive depth of carefully researched historic details. The other central figure in Goldstein’s heartrending tale is his mother—a strong, resourceful woman who understands how to act decisively in a time of terror in order to keep her family alive. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; From 1941 through 1945 some 32,000 Jews, 40,000 Gypsies, and 350,000 Serbs were slaughtered in Croatia. It is a period in history that is often forgotten, purged, or erased from the history books, which makes Goldstein’s vivid, carefully balanced account so important for us today—for the same atrocities returned to Croatia and Bosnia in the 1990s. And yet Goldstein’s story isn’t confined by geographical boundaries as it speaks to the dangers and madness of ethnic hatred all over the world and the urgent need for mutual understanding.</description>

  <description>In "The Sleepwalkers" acclaimed historian and author of Iron Kingdom, Christopher Clark, examines the causes of the First World War. Sunday Times Books of the Year 2012. The moments that it took Gavrilo Princip to step forward to the stalled car and shoot dead Franz Ferdinand and his wife were perhaps the most fateful of the modern era. An act of terrorism of staggering efficiency, it fulfilled its every aim: it would liberate Bosnia from Habsburg rule and it created a powerful new Serbia, but it also brought down four great empires, killed millions of men and destroyed a civilization. What made a seemingly prosperous and complacent Europe so vulnerable to the impact of this assassination? In "The Sleepwalkers" Christopher Clark retells the story of the outbreak of the First World War and its causes. Drawing on many fresh new sources, this account reveals a Europe very different from the familiar picture, putting Serbia and the Balkans at the centre of the story. Starting with the brutal assassination of Alexander I of Serbia in 1903, Clark shows how, far from being the place of enviable stability it appears to us, Europe was racked by chronic problems: a multipolar, fractured, multicultural world of clashing ideals, terrorism, militancy and instability, which was, fatefully, saddled with a conspicuously ineffectual set of political leaders. He shows how the rulers of Europe, who prided themselves on their modernity and rationalism, behaved like sleepwalkers, stumbling through crisis after crisis and finally convincing themselves that war was the only answer. Reviews: "Formidable ...one of the most impressive and stimulating studies of the period ever published". (Max Hastings, "Sunday Times"). "The arguments [Clark] sets out in this quite superb account of the causes of the First World War are so compelling that they effectively consign the old historical consensus to the bin ...a masterpiece. It's not often that one has the privilege of reading a book that reforges our understanding of one of the seminal events of world history". ("Mail Online"). "Impeccably researched, provocatively argued and elegantly written, his book is a model of scholarship". ("Sunday Times", Books of the Year 2012). "A brilliant contribution". ("Times Higher Education"). "Clark is fully alive to the challenges of the subject. Planting himself at the contingent end of the spectrum, he prefers to establish how the war happened rather than to explain why by means of hindsight ...It is a refreshing approach. He provides vivid portraits of leading figures ...[He] also gives a rich sense of what contemporaries believed was at stake in the crises leading up to the war". ("Irish Times"). About the author: Christopher Clark is Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St Catharine's College. He is the author of "The Politics of Conversion", "Kaiser Wilhelm II" and "Iron Kingdom". Widely praised around the world, "Iron Kingdom" became a major bestseller. He has been awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.</description>

  <description>First published in Vienna in the German language in 1937, this classic story of romance and adventure has been compared to &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Zhivago&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/strong&gt;.  Its mysterious author was recently the subject of a feature article in the &lt;strong&gt;New Yorker&lt;/strong&gt;, which has inspired a forthcoming biography. Out of print for nearly three decades until the hardcover re-release last year, &lt;strong&gt;Ali and Nino&lt;/strong&gt; is Kurban Said's masterpiece. It is a captivating novel as evocative of the exotic desert landscape as it is of the passion between two people pulled apart by culture, religion, and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the eve of World War I in Baku, Azerbaijan, a city on the edge of the Caspian Sea, poised precariously between east and west.  Ali Khan Shirvanshir, a Muslim schoolboy from a proud, aristocratic family, has fallen in love with the beautiful and enigmatic Nino Kipiani, a Christian girl with distinctly European sensibilities.   To be together they must overcome blood feud and scandal, attempt a daring horseback rescue, and travel from the bustling street of oil-boom Baku, through starkly beautiful deserts and remote mountain villages, to the opulent palace of Ali's uncle in neighboring Persia.  Ultimately the lovers are drawn back to Baku, but when war threatens their future, Ali is forced to choose between his loyalty to the beliefs of his Asian ancestors and his profound devotion to Nino.  Combining the exotic fascination of a tale told by Scheherazade with the range and magnificence of an epic, &lt;strong&gt;Ali and Nino&lt;/strong&gt; is a timeless classic of love in the face of war.</description>

  <description>The Inventive Peasant Arnaud du Tilh had almost persuaded the learned judges at the Parlement of Toulouse, when on a summer's day in 1560 a man swaggered into the court on a wooden leg, denounced Arnaud &amp;amp; reestablished his claim to the identity, property &amp;amp; wife of Martin Guerre. The astonishing case captured the imagination of the Continent. Told &amp;amp; retold over the centuries, the story of Martin Guerre became a legend, still remembered in the Pyrenean village where the impostor was executed over 400 years ago. Now a noted historian, who served as consultant for a French film on Martin Guerre, has searched archives &amp;amp; lawbooks to add new dimensions to a tale already abundant in mysteries. We're led to ponder how a common man could become an impostor in the 16th century, why Bertrande de Rols, an honorable peasant woman, would accept such a man as her husband, &amp;amp; why lawyers, poets &amp;amp; men of letters like Montaigne became so fascinated with the episode. Natalie Zemon Davis reconstructs the lives of ordinary people, in a way that reveals the hidden attachments &amp;amp; sensibilities of nonliterate 16th-century villagers. Here we see people trying to fashion their identities within a world of traditional ideas about property &amp;amp; family &amp;amp; of changing ideas about religion. We learn what happens when common people get involved in the workings of the criminal courts in the ancien régime, &amp;amp; how judges struggle to decide who a man was in the days before fingerprints &amp;amp; photos. We sense the secret affinity between the eloquent men of law &amp;amp; the honey-tongued village impostor, a rare identification across class lines. Deftly written for both the public &amp;amp; specialists, The Return of Martin Guerre will interest those who want to know more about ordinary families &amp;amp; especially women of the past &amp;amp; about the creation of literary legends. It's also a remarkable psychological narrative about where self-fashioning stops &amp;amp; lying begins.</description>

  <description>1631. The Empress of India Mumtaz Mahal has died. Yet, rather than anoint one of his several other wives to take her place as Empress of India, Mughal King Shah Jahan anoints his seventeen-year-old daughter Jahanara as the next Queen of India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bearing an almost identical resemblance to her mother, Jahanara is the first ever daughter of a sitting Mughal King to be anointed queen. She is reluctant to accept this title, but does so in hopes of averting the storm approaching her family and Mughal India. Her younger siblings harbor extreme personalities from a liberal multiculturalist (who views religion as an agent of evil) to an orthodox Muslim (who views razing non-Muslim buildings as divine will).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Jahanara struggles to come to terms with her own dark reality: as the daughter of a sitting King, she is forbidden to marry. Thus, while she lives in the shadow of her parents unflinching love story, she is devastated by the harsh reality that she is forbidden to share such a romance with another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mistress of the Throne narrates the powerful story of one of Indias most opulent and turbulent times through the eyes of an unsuspecting character: a Muslim queen. It uses actual historical figures to illuminate the complexity of an era that has often been called Indias Golden Age.</description>

  <description>In 1943, with the world convulsed by war and a Fascist defeat in Europe far from certain, a few visionaries—civilians and soldiers alike—saw past questions of life and death to realize that victory wasn’t the only thing at stake. So was the priceless cultural heritage of thousands of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the midst of the conflict, the Allied Forces appointed the monuments officers—a motley group of art historians, curators, architects, and artists—to ensure that the great masterworks of European art and architecture were not looted or bombed into oblivion. The journalist Ilaria Dagnini Brey focuses her spellbinding account on the monuments officers of Italy, quickly dubbed “the Venus Fixers” by bemused troops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on the front lines in conditions of great deprivation and danger, these unlikely soldiers stripped the great galleries of their incomparable holdings and sent them into safety by any means they could; when trucks could not be requisitioned or “borrowed,” a Tiepolo altarpiece might make its midnight journey across the countryside balanced in the front basket of a bicycle. They blocked a Nazi convoy of two hundred stolen paintings—including &lt;em&gt;Danae&lt;/em&gt;, Titian’s voluptuous masterpiece, an intended birthday present for Hermann Göring.They worked with skeptical army strategists to make sure air raids didn’t take out the heart of an ancient city, and patched up Renaissance palazzi and ancient churches whose lead roofs were sometimes melted away by the savagery of the attacks, exposing their frescoed interiors to the harsh Tuscan winters and blistering summers. Sometimes they failed. But to an astonishing degree, they succeeded, and anyone who marvels at Italy’s artistic riches today is witnessing their handiwork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the course of her research, Brey gained unprecedented access to private archives and primary sources, and the result is a book at once thorough and grandly entertaining—a revelatory take on a little-known chapter of World War II history. &lt;em&gt;The Venus Fixers &lt;/em&gt;is an adventure story with the gorgeous tints of a Botticelli landscape as its backdrop.</description>

  <description>Winner of the Lost Man Booker Prize&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1919: After surviving the Great War, Major Brendan Archer makes his way to Ireland, hoping to discover whether he is indeed betrothed to Angela Spencer, whose Anglo-Irish family owns the once-aptly-named Majestic Hotel in Kilnalough. But his fiancée is strangely altered and her family's fortunes have suffered a spectacular decline. The hotel's hundreds of rooms are disintegrating on a grand scale; its few remaining guests thrive on rumors and games of whist; herds of cats have taken over the Imperial Bar and the upper stories; bamboo shoots threaten the foundations; and piglets frolic in the squash court. Meanwhile, the Major is captivated by the beautiful and bitter Sarah Devlin. As housekeeping disasters force him from room to room, outside the order of the British Empire also totters: there is unrest in the East, and in Ireland itself the mounting violence of "the troubles."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Troubles is a hilarious and heartbreaking work by a modern master of the historical novel.</description>

  <description>As Mother India approaches her centenary, nine people are going about their business-a gangster, a cop, his wife, a politician, a stand-up comic, a set designer, a journalist, a scientist, and a dropout. And so is Aj-the waif, the mind reader, the prophet-when she one day finds a man who wants to stay hidden. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next few weeks, they will all be swept together to decide the fate of the nation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;River of Gods teems with the life of a country choked with peoples and cultures-one and a half billion people, twelve semi-independent nations, nine million gods. Ian McDonald has written the great Indian novel of the new millennium, in which a war is fought, a love betrayed, a message from a different world decoded, as the great river Ganges flows on.</description>

  <description>Oakley Hall's legendary &lt;em&gt;Warlock&lt;/em&gt; revisits and reworks the traditional conventions of the Western to present a raw, funny, hypnotic, ultimately devastating picture of American unreality. First published in the 1950s, at the height of the McCarthy era, Warlock is not only one of the most original and entertaining of modern American novels but a lasting contribution to American fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Tombstone, Arizona, during the 1880's is, in ways, our national Camelot: a never-never land where American virtues are embodied in the Earps, and the opposite evils in the Clanton gang; where the confrontation at the OK Corral takes on some of the dry purity of the Arthurian joust. Oakley Hall, in his very fine novel Warlock has restored to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity. Wyatt Earp is transmogrified into a gunfighter named Blaisdell who . . . is summoned to the embattled town of Warlock by a committee of nervous citizens expressly to be a hero, but finds that he cannot, at last, live up to his image; that there is a flaw not only in him, but also, we feel, in the entire set of assumptions that have allowed the image to exist. . . . Before the agonized epic of Warlock is over with—the rebellion of the proto-Wobblies working in the mines, the struggling for political control of the area, the gunfighting, mob violence, the personal crises of those in power—the collective awareness that is Warlock must face its own inescapable Horror: that what is called society, with its law and order, is as frail, as precarious, as flesh and can be snuffed out and assimilated back into the desert as easily as a corpse can. It is the deep sensitivity to abysses that makes &lt;em&gt;Warlock&lt;/em&gt; one of our best American novels. For we are a nation that can, many of us, toss with all aplomb our candy wrapper into the Grand Canyon itself, snap a color shot and drive away; and we need voices like Oakley Hall's to remind us how far that piece of paper, still fluttering brightly behind us, has to fall." —Thomas Pynchon</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;FIVE BODIES. ONE CLUE. NOT A TRACE OF THE KILLER. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;San Francisco antiques dealer Jim Brodie recently inherited a stake in his father&amp;amp;#8217;s Tokyo-based private investigation firm, which means the single father of six-year-old Jenny is living a busy intercontinental life, traveling to Japan to acquire art and artifacts for his store and con&amp;amp;#173;sulting on Brodie Security&amp;amp;#8217;s caseload at home and abroad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, an entire family is gunned down in San Francisco&amp;amp;#8217;s bustling Japantown neighbor&amp;amp;#173;hood, and Brodie is called on by the SFPD to decipher the lone clue left at the crime scene: a unique Japanese character printed on a slip of paper drenched in blood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brodie can&amp;amp;#8217;t read the clue. But he may have seen it before&amp;amp;#8212;at the scene of his wife&amp;amp;#8217;s death in a house fire four years ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his deep array of Asian connections and fluency in Japanese, Brodie sets out to solve a seemingly perfect crime and at the same time learn whether his wife&amp;amp;#8217;s tragic death was more than just an accident. And as he unravels a web of intrigue stretching back centuries and con&amp;amp;#173;nected to the murders in San Francisco, the Japantown killer retaliates with a new target: Brodie&amp;amp;#8217;s daughter.</description>

  <description>On October 16, 1859, John Brown led a raid on the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, leaving fifteen people dead. Viewed in the North as a saint of freedom and in the South as the devil incarnate, Brown was a visionary who not only foretold but made inevitable the bloody apocalypse of the Civil War. An intricate mosaic of alternating narrative voices, &lt;em&gt;Raising Holy Hell&lt;/em&gt; is an explosive, multitextured evocation of the prophetic madness of the man who saw an America damned by the sin of slavery. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>For more than a century, oil has been the engine of growth for a society that delivers an unprecedented standard of living to many. We now take for granted that economic growth is good, necessary, and even inevitable, but also feel a sense of unease about the simultaneous growth of complexity in the processes and institutions that generate and manage that growth. As societies grow more complex through the bounty of cheap energy, they also confront problems that seem to increase in number and severity. In this era of fossil fuels, cheap energy and increasing complexity have been in a mutually-reinforcing spiral. The more energy we have and the more problems our societies confront, the more we grow complex and require still more energy. How did our demand for energy, our technological prowess, the resulting need for complex problem solving, and the end of easy oil conspire to make the Deepwater Horizon oil spill increasingly likely, if not inevitable? This book explains the real causal factors leading up to the worst environmental catastrophe in U.S. history, a disaster from which it will take decades to recover.</description>

Til slutt gjør han hva som helst for å kunne fortsette spillet. Rebecca er livvakt, har stålkontroll på livet og karrieren. Den siste tiden er det noe som ødelegger den perfekte fasaden. Hun mottar anonyme brev og stadig ringer noen hennes telefonsvarer. Er det noen som leker med henne? Spiller et spill? Spillet får HPs og Rebeccas liv til å nærme seg hverandre og spenningen stiger ytterligere</description>

  <description>Menina Walker was a child of fortune. Rescued after a hurricane in South America, doomed to a life of poverty with a swallow medal as her only legacy, the orphaned toddler was adopted by an American family and taken to a new life. As a beautiful, intelligent woman of nineteen, she is in love, engaged, and excited about the future — until another traumatic event shatters her dreams. Menina flees to Spain to bury her misery in research for her college thesis about a sixteenth-century artist who signed his works with the image of a swallow — the same image as the one on Menina’s medal. But a mugging strands Menina in a musty, isolated Spanish convent. Exploring her surroundings, she discovers the epic sagas of five orphan girls who were hidden from the Spanish Inquisition and received help escaping to the New World. Is Menina’s medal a link to them, or to her own past? Did coincidence lead her to the convent, or fate? Both love story and historical thriller, The Sisterhood is an emotionally charged ride across continents and centuries.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Jack Kennedy&lt;/em&gt;—and Tip O’Neill’s former chief-of-staff—comes the firsthand, one-of-a-kind story of the friendship between President Reagan and the Speaker of the House.&lt;/strong&gt;They were the political odd couple—the two most powerful men in the country, a pair who, in author Chris Matthews’s words, “couldn’t be more different or more the same.” For six years Matthews was on the inside, watching the evolving relationship between President Ronald Reagan and Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill. Their philosophies were miles apart—Reagan intent on scaling back government, O’Neill fervent in defending it. Yet there was common ground too: long lunches shared on St. Patrick’s Day and a mutual respect—political and personal. Three days after Reagan’s shooting, Tip was the first outsider at the president’s bedside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing not only on his own remarkable knowledge but on extensive interviews with those closest to his subjects, Matthews brings this unlikely friendship to life in his unique voice, rendering as lively and novelistic a read as &lt;em&gt;Jack Kennedy &lt;/em&gt;and a timely object lesson in how bipartisan cooperation can work.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;America in the 1920s was a country alive with the wild fun of jazz, speakeasies, and a new kind of woman—the flapper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vera Abramowitz is determined to leave her gritty childhood behind and live a more exciting life, one that her mother never dreamed of. Bobbing her hair and showing her knees, the lipsticked beauty dazzles, doing the Charleston in nightclubs and earning the nickname “Dollface.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the ultimate flapper, Vera captures the attention of two high rollers, a handsome nightclub owner and a sexy gambler. On their arms, she gains entrée into a world filled with bootleg bourbon, wailing jazz, and money to burn.  She thinks her biggest problem is choosing between them until the truth comes out. Her two lovers are really mobsters from rival gangs during Chicago’s infamous Beer Wars, a battle Al Capone refuses to lose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The heady life she’s living is an illusion resting on a bedrock of crime and violence unlike anything the country has ever seen before. When the good times come to an end, Vera becomes entangled in everything from bootlegging to murder. And as men from both gangs fall around her, Vera must put together the pieces of her shattered life, as Chicago hurtles toward one of the most infamous days in its history, the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.</description>

  <description>WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Virginia Miner, a fifty-something, unmarried tenured professor, is in London to work on her new book about children’s folk rhymes. Despite carrying a U.S. passport, Vinnie feels essentially English and rather looks down on her fellow Americans. But in spite of that, she is drawn into a mortifying and oddly satisfying affair with an Oklahoman tourist who dresses more Bronco Billy than Beau Brummel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also in London is Vinnie’s colleague Fred Turner, a handsome, flat broke, newly separated, and thoroughly miserable young man trying to focus on his own research. Instead, he is distracted by a beautiful and unpredictable English actress and the world she belongs to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both American, both abroad, and both achingly lonely, Vinnie and Fred play out their confused alienation and dizzying romantic liaisons in Alison Lurie’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Smartly written, poignant, and witty, &lt;em&gt;Foreign Affairs&lt;/em&gt; remains an enduring comic masterpiece. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A splendid comedy, very bright, brilliantly written in a confident and original manner. The best book by one of our finest writers.”&lt;br&gt; –Elizabeth Hardwick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is no American writer I have read with more constant pleasure and sympathy. . . . &lt;em&gt;Foreign Affairs&lt;/em&gt; earns the same shelf as Henry James and Edith Wharton.”&lt;br&gt;–John Fowles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If you manage to read only a few good novels a year, make this one of them.”&lt;br&gt;–&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“An ingenious, touching book.”&lt;br&gt;–&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A flawless jewel.”&lt;br&gt;–&lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In 1927, the Mississippi River swept across an area roughly equal in size to Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont combined, leaving water as deep as thirty feet on the land stretching from Illinois and Missouri south to the Gulf of Mexico. Close to a million people - in a nation of 120 million - were forced out of their homes. Some estimates place the death toll in the thousands. The Red Cross fed nearly 700,000 refugees for months. Rising Tide is the story of this forgotten event, the greatest natural disaster this country has ever known. But it is not simply a tale of disaster. The flood transformed part of the nation and had a major cultural and political impact on the rest. Rising Tide is an American epic about science, race, honor, politics, and society. Rising Tide begins in the nineteenth century, when the first serious attempts to control the river began. The story focuses on engineers James Eads and Andrew Humphreys, who hated each other. Out of the collision of their personalities and their theories came a compromise river policy that would lead to the disaster of the 1927 flood yet would also allow the cultivation of the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta and create wealth and aristocracy, as well as a whole culture. In the end, the flood had indeed changed the face of America, leading to the most comprehensive legislation the government had ever enacted, touching the entire Mississippi valley from Pennsylvania to Montana. In its aftermath was laid the foundation for the New Deal of Franklin D. Roosevelt.</description>

  <description>Twenty miles south of the Arizona-Mexico border, the rugged, beautiful Sierra Madre mountains begin their dramatic ascent. Almost 900 miles long, the range climbs to nearly 11,000 feet and boasts several canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon. The rules of law and society have never taken hold in the Sierra Madre, which is home to bandits, drug smugglers, Mormons, cave-dwelling Tarahumara Indians, opium farmers, cowboys, and other assorted outcasts. Outsiders are not welcome; drugs are the primary source of income; murder is all but a regional pastime. The Mexican army occasionally goes in to burn marijuana and opium crops -- the modern treasure of the Sierra Madre -- but otherwise the government stays away. In its stead are the drug lords, who have made it one of the biggest drug-producing areas in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Fifteen years ago, journalist Richard Grant developed what he calls "an unfortunate fascination" with this lawless place. Locals warned that he would meet his death there, but he didn't believe them -- until his last trip. During his travels Grant visited a folk healer for his insomnia and was prescribed rattlesnake pills, attended bizarre religious rituals, consorted with cocaine-snorting policemen, taught English to Guarijio Indians, and dug for buried treasure. On his last visit, his reckless adventure spiraled into his own personal heart of darkness when cocaine-fueled Mexican hillbillies hunted him through the woods all night, bent on killing him for sport. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With gorgeous detail, fascinating insight, and an undercurrent of dark humor, &lt;em&gt;God's Middle Finger&lt;/em&gt; brings to vivid life a truly unique and uncharted world.</description>

  <description>Stephen James Napier Tennant (21 April 1906 - 28 February 1987) was a British aristocrat known for his decadent lifestyle. It is said, albeit apocryphally, that he spent most of his life in bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was born in England, the youngest son of a Scots peer, Lord Glenconner, and the former Pamela Wyndham, one of The Souls. His mother was also a cousin of Lord Alfred Douglas (1870-1945), Oscar Wilde's lover and a sonneteer. On his father's death, Tennant's mother married Lord Grey, a fellow bird-lover. Tennant's eldest brother was Edward - "Bim" - who was killed in the First World War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the twenties and thirties, Tennant was an important member - the "Brightest", it is said - of the "Bright Young People." His friends included Rex Whistler, Cecil Beaton, the Sitwells, Lady Diana Manners and the Mitford girls part of the set that made the Nordstrom Sisters popular at The Ritz in 1939. He is widely considered to be the model for Cedric Hampton in Nancy Mitford's novel &lt;em&gt;Love in a Cold Climate&lt;/em&gt;; one of the inspirations for Lord Sebastian Flyte in Waugh's &lt;em&gt;Brideshead Revisited&lt;/em&gt;, and a model for Hon. Miles Malpractice in some of his other novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also during the 1920s and 1930s, Tennant had an affair with the poet Siegfried Sassoon.  Prior to this he had proposed to a friend, the novelist Elizabeth Bowen, but had been rejected. (Hoare relates how Tennant discussed plans with Bowen about bringing his Nanny with them on their honeymoon.) His relationship with Sassoon, however, was to be his most important: it lasted some four years before Tennant off-handedly put an abrupt end to it. Sassoon was reportedly depressed afterwards for 3 months, until he married and became a father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For most of his life, Tennant tried to start or finish a novel - &lt;em&gt;Lascar&lt;/em&gt;. It is popularly believed that he spent the last 17 years of his life in bed at his family manor at Wilsford, Wiltshire, which he had redecorated by Syrie Maugham. Though undoubtedly idle, he was not truly lethargic: he made several visits to the United States and Italy, and struck up many new friendships, despite his later reputation as a recluse. This became increasingly true only towards the last years of his life. Yet even then, his life was not uneventful: he became landlord to V. S. Naipaul who immortalised Tennant in his novel &lt;em&gt;The Enigma of Arrival&lt;/em&gt;. When Tennant died in 1987, he had far outlived most of his contemporaries.</description>

  <description>Heartfelt, incisive &amp;amp; timeless, &lt;em&gt;The Confessions&lt;/em&gt; has captivated readers for over 1500 years. Retelling the story of his long struggle with faith &amp;amp; ultimate conversion--the first such spiritual memoir ever recorded--Augustine traces a story of sin, regret &amp;amp; redemption that is both deeply personal &amp;amp;, at the same time, universal. Starting with his early life, education &amp;amp; youthful indiscretions, &amp;amp; following his ascent to influence as a teacher of rhetoric in Hippo, Rome &amp;amp; Milan, he's brutally honest about his proud &amp;amp; ambitious youth. In time, his early loves grow cold &amp;amp; the luster of wordly success fades, leaving him filled with a sense of inner absence, until a movement toward Christian faith takes hold, eventually leading to conversion &amp;amp; the flourishing of a new life. Philosophically &amp;amp; theologically brilliant, sincere in its feeling, &amp;amp; both grounded in history &amp;amp; strikingly contemporary in its resonance, &lt;em&gt;The Confessions&lt;/em&gt; is a timeless class that will persist as long as humanity continues to long for meaning in life &amp;amp; peace of soul.</description>

  <description>In the beginning of the winter thaw, Lars Lennart Westin has learned that he has cancer and will not live through spring. Told through the journals of this schoolteacher turned apiarist, The Death of a Beekeeper, is his gentle, courageous, and sometimes comic meditation on living with pain. Westin has refused to surrender the time left him to the impersonation of a hospital, preferring to take his fate upon himself, to continue solitary, reflective life in the Swedish countryside. "I took little walks and noticed that in the last months the pain had actually colored the landscape in a peculiar way. Here and there is a tree where it really hurt, here and there is a fence against whose post I struck my hand in passing." His inner landscape is also re-forming: "This constant concern with an indefinite dangerous secret in one's own body, this feeling that some dramatic change is taking place, without one's being able to have any clarity about what really is... reminds me of prepuberty. I even recognize this gentle feeling of shame again." The relentlessly intimate burning in his gut provides a point of psychic detachment, rendering his survival "a unique art form whose level of difficulty is so high that no one exists who can practice it.” Yet he insists, "We begin again. We never give up."</description>

  <description>"Lev Nussimbaum was a Jew who transformed himself into a Muslim prince and became a bestselling author in Nazi Germany. Born in 1905 to a wealthy family in the oil-boom city of Baku, at the edge of the czarist empire, Lev escaped the Russian Revolution in a camel caravan. He found refuge in Germany, where, writing under the names Essad Bey and Kurban Said, his remarkable books about Islam, desert adventures, and global revolution became celebrated throughout fascist Europe. His enduring masterpiece, Ali and Nino - a story of love across ethnic and religious boundaries, published on the eve of the Holocaust - is still in print today." "But Lev's life grew wilder than his wildest stories. He married an international heiress who had no idea of his real identity - until she divorced him in a tabloid scandal. His closest friend in New York, George Sylvester Viereck, also a friend of Freud's and Einstein's, was arrested as the leading Nazi agent in the United States. Lev was invited to be Mussolini's official biographer - until the Fascists uncovered his true origins. Under house arrest in the Amalfi cliff town of Positano, Lev wrote his last book - scrawled in tiny print in half a dozen notebooks never before read by anyone - helped by a mysterious half-German salon hostess, an Algerian weapons smuggler, and the poet Ezra Pound." "Tom Reiss spent five years tracking down secret police records, love letters, diaries, and deathbed notebooks. Beginning with a yearlong investigation for The New Yorker magazine, he pursued Lev's story across ten countries and found himself caught up in encounters as dramatic and surreal - and sometimes as heartbreaking - as his subject's life." As he tracks down the pieces of Lev Nussimbaum's deliberately obscured life, Reiss discovers a series of shadowy worlds - of European pan-Islamists, nihilist assassins, anti-Nazi book smugglers, Baku oil barons, Jewish Orientalists - that have also been forgotten.</description>

  <description>A woman uses her incredible beauty to captivate both d'Albert, a young poet, and disguised as a man, his mistress, Rosette. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this shocking tale of sexual deception, Gautier draws readers into the bedrooms and boudoirs of a French château in a compelling exploration of desire and sexual intrigue, and gives voice to a longing which is larger in scope, namely, the wish for completeness in oneself.</description>

  <description>When the clock strikes midnight on the feast day of La Befana, Venice is aglow as a cascade of glittering fireworks bursts above the city. Masked figures crowd the vaporettos, the trattorias are humming with grappa-soaked gossip, and the possibility for random passion heats the frosty winter air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Across the Grand Canal, beneath the stunning white dome of one of Venice's grandest landmarks, Santa Maria della Salute, a body with two slugs in the back of the head has been pulled from the icy waters. The victim is a woman. To the dismay of the police, she is dressed in the sacred robes of a Catholic priest--a desecration known as the Abomination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working her first murder case, newly promoted Captain Kat Tapo of the Carabinieri embarks on a labyrinthine trail that soon proves as elusive and confusing as the city's twisting backstreets. Her investigation leads from a crumbling asylum on a deserted island to the impenetrable complex of American military bases ringing the medieval city--and deeper, into an eerie virtual Venice that is both alien and familiar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The influential and highly secretive simulated world of Carnivia.com holds the city's secrets, dark knowledge that reaches into the highest levels of government and the church, involving its most influential figures. The site's founder is a notorious hacker and the scion of one of Venice's oldest families--a man already convicted of cybercrimes whose life is threatened by an anonymous group determined to silence him and destroy his virtual city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when every lead seems to send a frustrated Kat in a new direction, the various trails go cold, evidence goes missing, and the case is officially shut down. What follows is the unraveling of a dark conspiracy whose roots go back seventy years, revelations that will test Kat's loyalties and remind the dedicated cop of a simple truth: that unless old crimes are punished, corrupt forces will continue to repeat their mortal sins. . . .</description>

  <description>When the Conways move into their ancestral home in Louisiana after the death of an estranged aunt, it is with the promise of a new beginning. But the house has a life of its own. Abandoned for the last forty years, surrounded by thick trees and a stifling sense of melancholy, the sprawling Victorian house seems to swallow up the sunlight. Deep within the cold cellar and etched into the very walls is a long, dark history of the Conway name--a grim bloodline poisoned by suicide, strange disappearances, voodoo rituals, and rumors of murder. But the family knows nothing of the soul-shattering secrets that snake through generations of their past. They do not know that terror awaits them. For with each generation of the Conways comes a hellish day of reckoning. . . .</description>

  <description>A woman about to lose her job as a professor of literature and history delivers a passionate, witty, and word-mad monologue in this inventive novel, which was called "brilliant" (The Listener), "dazzling" (The Guardian), "elegant, rueful and witty" (The Observer) upon its original publication in England in 1984.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;History and literature seem to be losing ground to the brave new world of electronic media and technology, and battle lines are being drawn between the humanities and technology, the first world and the third world, women and men. Narrator Mira Enketei erases those boundaries in her punning monologue, blurring the texts of Herodotus with the callers to a talk-radio program, and blending contemporary history with ancient: fairy-tale and literal/invented people (the kidnappers of capitalism, a girl-warrior from Somalia, a pop singer, a political writer), connected by an elaborate mock-genealogy stretching back to the Greek gods, move in and out of each other's stories. The narrator sometimes sees herself as Cassandra, condemned by Apollo to prophesize but never to be believed, enslaved by Agamemnon after the fall of Troy. Brooke-Rose amalgamates ancient literature with modern crises to produce a powerful novel about the future of culture.</description>

  <description>Thaliad, a book-length epic poem written in blank verse, tells the story of a group of children, survivors of an apocalypse, who make an arduous journey of escape and then settle in a deserted rural town on the shores of a beautiful lake. There, they must learn how to survive, using tools and knowledge they discover in the ruins of the town, but also how to live together. At the heart of the story is the young girl Thalia, who gradually grows to womanhood, and into the spiritual role for which she was destined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following in the great tradition of narrative poetry, Thaliad tells a gripping story populated with sharply-drawn, memorable characters whose struggles illuminate the complexity of human behavior from its most violent to most noble. At the same time, through its accessible language and style, the epic presents wholly contemporary questions about what is necessary not only for physical survival, but for the flourishing of the human spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thaliad is decorated throughout with original collages by the renowned Welsh artist Clive Hicks-Jenkins.</description>

  <description>After one of their own members repeatedly fails to live up to a pact with the Devil, a petty and morally bankrupt village community is terrorized by a succession of deadly black spiders. First published in 1842, this haunting cautionary novella shrewdly dissects the iniquitous social dynamics of rural life through the use of dark satire and realism.</description>

  <description>This is the true story of a young American couple, who decided one day to quit their jobs, sell their house and car, and spend three-and-a-half months of their life, traveling around the world. They made their way by cargo-passenger ships, half a dozen foreign airlines, by train, rickshaw, busses, and motor scooters. The story is told by way of letters written home and mailed from wherever their next stop happened to be. The year was 1956. Reading the letters now, we cannot help but be astonished by how much this world of ours, as well as traveling, has changed in such a relatively short time.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed Civil War historian, and coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the legendary battle: a brilliant new history--the most intimate and richly readable account we have had--that draws the reader into the muck and grime of Gettysburg alongside the ordinary soldier, and depicts, as never before, the combination of personalities and circumstances that produced one of the great battles of all time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the Battle of Gettysburg has been written about at length and thoroughly dissected in terms of strategic importance, never before has a book dived down so closely to the individual soldier to explore the experience of the three days of intense fighting for the people involved, or looked so closely at the way politics swayed military decisions, or placed the battle in the context of nineteenth-century military practice. Guelzo shows us the face, the sights and sounds of nineteenth-century combat: the stone walls and gunpowder clouds of Pickett's Charge; the reason that the Army of Northern Virginia could be smelled before it could be seen; the march of thousands of men from the banks of the Rappahannock in Virginia to the Pennsylvania hills. What emerges is a previously untold story: from the personal politics roiling the Union and Confederate officer ranks, to the peculiar character of artillery units. Through such scrutiny the cornerstone battle of the Civil War is given extraordinarily vivid new life. </description>

  <description>Arlette Farge’s &lt;em&gt;Le Goût de l’archive&lt;/em&gt; is widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. In &lt;em&gt;The Allure of the Archives&lt;/em&gt;, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Originally published in 1989, Farge’s classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France. At once a practical guide to research methodology and an elegant literary reflection on the challenges of writing history, this uniquely rich volume demonstrates how surrendering to the archive’s allure can forever change how we understand the past.</description>

  <description>At the height of the roaring ’20s, Swedish émigré Ivar Kreuger made a fortune raising money in America and loaning it to Europe in exchange for matchstick monopolies. His enterprise was a rare success story throughout the Great Depression.Yet after Kreuger’s suicide in 1932, the true nature of his empire emerged. Driven by success to adopt ever-more perilous practices, Kreuger had turned to shell companies in tax havens, fudged accounting figures, off-balance-sheet accounting, even forgery. He created a raft of innovative financial products— many of them precursors to instruments wreaking havoc in today’s markets. When his Wall Street empire collapsed, millions went bankrupt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frank Partnoy, a frequent commentator on financial disaster for the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, NPR, and CBS’s �60 Minutes,” recasts the life story of a remarkable yet forgotten genius in ways that force us to re-think our ideas about the wisdom of crowds, the invisible hand, and the free and unfettered market.</description>

  <description>Arthur (Art) Mumby and his irritating sister Myrtle live with their father in the huge and rambling house, Larklight, travelling through space on a remote orbit far beyond the Moon. One ordinary sort of morning they receive a correspondence informing them that a gentleman is on his way to visit, a Mr Webster. Visitors to Larklight are rare if not unique, and a frenzy of preparation ensues. But it is entirely the wrong sort of preparation, as they discover when their guest arrives, and a Dreadful and Terrifying (and Marvellous) adventure begins. It takes them to the furthest reaches of Known Space, where they must battle the evil First Ones in a desperate attempt to save each other - and the Universe. Recounted through the eyes of Art himself, Larklight is sumptuously designed and illustrated throughout.</description>

  <description>Sheikh Nuruddin is a dervish at a Sarajevo monastery in the eighteenth century during the Turkish occupation. When his brother is arrested, he descends into the Kafkaesque world of the Turkish authorities in order to find out what has happened. As he does so, he begins to question his relations with society as a whole and, eventually, his life choices in general. Hugely successful when published in the 1960s,&lt;em&gt; Death and the Dervish &lt;/em&gt;appears here in its first English translation.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>On September 8, 1941, eleven weeks after Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, his brutal surprise attack on the Soviet Union, Leningrad was surrounded. The siege was not lifted for two and a half years, by which time some three quarters of a million Leningraders had died of starvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna Reid's &lt;em&gt;Leningrad&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping, authoritative narrative history of this dramatic moment in the twentieth century, interwoven with indelible personal accounts of daily siege life drawn from diarists on both sides. They reveal the Nazis' deliberate decision to starve Leningrad into surrender and Hitler's messianic miscalculation, the incompetence and cruelty of the Soviet war leadership, the horrors experienced by soldiers on the front lines, and, above all, the terrible details of life in the blockaded city: the relentless search for food and water; the withering of emotions and family ties; looting, murder, and cannibalism- and at the same time, extraordinary bravery and self-sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stripping away decades of Soviet propaganda, and drawing on newly available diaries and government records, &lt;em&gt;Leningrad&lt;/em&gt; also tackles a raft of unanswered questions: Was the size of the death toll as much the fault of Stalin as of Hitler? Why didn't the Germans capture the city? Why didn't it collapse into anarchy? What decided who lived and who died? Impressive in its originality and literary style, &lt;em&gt;Leningrad&lt;/em&gt; gives voice to the dead and will rival Anthony Beevor's classic Stalingrad in its impact.</description>

  <description>The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 was just one dramatic episode in a long struggle by a stalwart band of Jewish resistance fighters to liberate Poland from the Nazis, the full story of which has never before been told in book form. With &lt;em&gt;Isaac’s Army,&lt;/em&gt; Matthew Brzezinski delivers the first-ever comprehensive narrative account of that struggle, following a group of dedicated young Jews—some barely out of their teens—who banded together to form one of the most daring underground movements of World War II.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Based on first-person accounts from diaries, interviews, and surviving relatives, &lt;em&gt;Isaac’s Army&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the extraordinary triumphs and devastating setbacks that befell the Jewish underground from its earliest acts of defiance in 1939 to the exodus to Palestine in 1946. This is the remarkable true story of the Jewish resistance from the perspective of those who led it: Isaac Zuckerman, the confident and charismatic twenty-four-year-old founder of the Jewish Fighting Organization; Simha Ratheiser, Isaac’s fifteen-year-old bodyguard, whose boyish good looks and seeming immunity to danger made him an ideal courier; and Zivia Lubetkin, the warrior queen of the underground who, upon hearing the first intimations of the Holocaust, declared: “We are going to defend ourselves.” Joined by allies on the left and right, they survived Gestapo torture chambers, smuggled arms, ran covert printing presses, opened illegal schools, robbed banks, executed collaborators, and fought in the two largest rebellions of the war.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Hunted by the Germans and bedeviled by the “Greasers”—roving bands of blackmailers who routinely turned in resistance fighters for profit—the movement was chronically short on firepower but long on ingenuity. Its members hatched plots in dank basements, never more than a door knock away from summary execution, and slogged through fetid sewers to escape the burning Ghetto to the forests surrounding the city. And after the initial uprising was ruthlessly put down by the SS, they gambled everything on a bold plan for a citywide revolt—of both Jews and Gentiles—that could end only in victory or total destruction. The money they raised helped thousands hide when the Ghetto was liquidated. The documents they forged offered lifelines to families desperate to escape the horror of the Holocaust. And when the war was over, they helped found the state of Israel.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; A story of secret alliances, internal rivalries, and undying commitment to a cause, &lt;em&gt;Isaac’s Army&lt;/em&gt; is history at its most heart-wrenching. Driven by an unforgettable cast of characters, it’s a true-life tale with the pulse of a great novel, and a celebration of the indomitable spirit of resistance.</description>

  <description>Vietnam, 1968. A nightmarish landscape blackened by napalm and littered with once-human debris. Where victories are measured in mountains of corpses and ordinary men are transformed into obsessive executioners. This is the brutally honest story of Cpl. Joker and his battle-hardened company, survivors of months of unimaginable horror--the crazy-tough and phony-brave, religiously counting the days until their release from the green prison of combat. But they all know one unspoken truth--that even though they're on their way out, their last few hours in Nam could become their last hours on earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Short-Timers&lt;/em&gt; is a semi-autobiographical novel by former U.S. Marine Gustav Hasford about his experiences in the Vietnam War. Along with Michael Herr and Stanley Kubrick, Hasford later adapted the novel for the film &lt;em&gt;Full Metal Jacket&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>More than half a million copies of &lt;em&gt;Chickenhawk&lt;/em&gt; have been sold since it was first published in 1983. Now with a new afterword by the author and photographs taken by him during the conflict, this straight-from-the-shoulder account tells the electrifying truth about the helicopter war in Vietnam. This is Robert Mason’s astounding personal story of men at war. A veteran of more than one thousand combat missions, Mason gives staggering descriptions that cut to the heart of the combat experience: the fear and belligerence, the quiet insights and raging madness, the lasting friendships and sudden death—the extreme emotions of a "chickenhawk" in constant danger.</description>

  <description>W.S. Merwin, one of the great contemporary English-language poets, turns to prose here in a brilliantly evocative re-creation of a distant past--as well as an exquisite rendering of his own romance with an abandoned farmhouse in the magical countryside of Southwest France. "The Mays of Ventadorn: Tales from Southwest France illuminates the origins of the famous 12th-century Provencal troubadours, beginning with the great Bernart de Ventadorn whose work Merwin first encountered as a young translator of the archaic language known as Old Occitan. The timeless beauty of the troubadours' pastoral songs and narrative poems has enabled them to survive for 900 years, far outlasting the language from which they sprang. As he reveals the lyrical pleasures in Southwest France' s medieval courts, Merwin also acquaints readers with the ruins of the chateau of Ventadorn, Bernart' s home, as well as the elegantly careworn farmhouse that the poet himself has owned for decades. Merwin brings a sense of historical continuity to his narrative as he writes of how the warm enchantments that distinguish the farmhouse, the local patois, and the area' s rural traditions are in many respects the direct progeny of the troubadours' storied culture and language of old.</description>

  <description>Over the years the motion picture industry has (sadly) gravitated to generating poorly cropped and heavily airbrushed posters that rely far too often on celebrity head shots. Thankfully, an underground network of graphic designers and artists has reinvigorated the art of the movie poster, crafting stunning pieces for classic and cult films. Here is the first comprehensive look at the movement, presenting this eclectic and dynamic medium through more than 200 eye-popping posters from over 100 cutting-edge artists, coupled with fascinating commentary and behind-the-scenes information. These new, underground posters have quickly become the most coveted by ardent moviegoers; they are typically produced in very limited runs, sell out within minutes, and command upwards of several hundred dollars each. With a smart, fresh visual perspective, alternative movie posters celebrate classics like Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining as well as cult favorites: The Big Lebowski, Blade Runner, and Pink Flamingos.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Visit HBO’s Generation Kill website here.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller—"one of the best books to come out of the second Iraq war." (&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within hours of 9/11, America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion, the first generation dispatched into open-ed combat since Vietnam. They were a new breed of American warrior unrecognizable to their forebears-soldiers raised on hip hop, Internet porn, Marilyn Manson, video games and The Real World, a band of born-again Christians, dopers, Buddhists, and New Agers who gleaned their precepts from kung fu movies and Oprah Winfrey. Cocky, brave, headstrong, wary, and mostly unprepared for the physical, emotional, and moral horrors ahead, the "First Suicide Battalion" would spearhead the blitzkrieg on Iraq, and fight against the hardest resistance Saddam had to offer. Generation Kill is the funny, frightening, and profane firsthand account of these remarkable men, of the personal toll of victory, and of the randomness, brutality, and camaraderie of a new American war. &lt;strong&gt;Read Evan Wright's posts on the Penguin Blog.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Pham Xuan An was a brilliant journalist and an even better spy. A friend to all the legendary reporters who covered the Vietnam War, he was an invaluable source of news and a font of wisdom on all things Vietnamese. At the same time, he was a masterful double agent. An inspired shape-shifter who kept his cover in place until the day he died, Pham Xuan An ranks as one of the preeminent spies of the twentieth century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Thomas A. Bass set out to write the story of An’s remarkable career for &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, fresh revelations arrived daily during their freewheeling conversations, which began in 1992. But a good spy is always at work, and it was not until An’s death in 2006 that Bass was able to lift the veil from his carefully guarded story to offer up this fascinating portrait of a hidden life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A masterful history that reads like a John le Carré thriller, &lt;em&gt;The Spy Who Loved Us&lt;/em&gt; offers a vivid portrait of journalists and spies at war.&lt;br&gt;  </description>

  <description>One of the great masterpieces of Russian literature, the &lt;em&gt;Red Cavalry&lt;/em&gt; cycle retains today the shocking freshness that made Babel's reputation when the stories were first published in the 1920s. Using his own experiences as a journalist and propagandist with the Red Army during the war against Poland, Babel brings to life an astonishing cast of characters from the exuberant, violent era of early Soviet history: commissars and colonels, Cossacks and peasants, and among them the bespectacled, Jewish writer/intellectual, observing it all and trying to establish his role in the new Russia. Drawn from the acclaimed, award-winning &lt;em&gt;Complete Works of Isaac Babel&lt;/em&gt;, this volume includes all of the &lt;em&gt;Red Cavalry&lt;/em&gt; cycle; Babel's 1920 diary, from which the material for the fiction was drawn; and his preliminary sketches for the stories—the whole constituting a fascinating picture of a great writer turning life into art.</description>

  <description>1845. New York City forms its first police force. The great potato famine hits Ireland. These two seemingly disparate events will change New York City. Forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timothy Wilde tends bar near the Exchange, saving every dollar and shilling in hopes of winning the girl of his dreams. But when his dreams literally incinerate in a fire devastating downtown Manhattan, he finds himself disfigured, unemployed, and homeless. His older brother obtains Timothy a job in the newly minted NYPD, but he is highly skeptical of this untested "police force." And he is less than thrilled that his new beat is the notoriously down-and-out Sixth Ward-at the border of Five Points, the world's most notorious slum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night while returning from his rounds, heartsick and defeated, Timothy runs into a little slip of a girl—a girl not more than ten years old—dashing through the dark in her nightshift . . . covered head to toe in blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timothy knows he should take the girl to the House of Refuge, yet he can't bring himself to abandon her. Instead, he takes her home, where she spins wild stories, claiming that dozens of bodies are buried in the forest north of 23rd Street. Timothy isn't sure whether to believe her or not, but, as the truth unfolds, the reluctant copper star finds himself engaged in a battle for justice that nearly costs him his brother, his romantic obsession, and his own life.</description>

  <description>When he was nine, he watched as his mother and brother were killed before him. At thirteen, he led a band of bloodthirsty thugs. By fifteen, he intends to be king... &lt;br&gt; It's time for Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath to return to the castle he turned his back on, to take what's rightfully his. Since the day he hung pinned on the thorns of a briar patch and watched Count Renar's men slaughter his mother and young brother, Jorg has been driven to vent his rage. Life and death are no more than a game to him--and he has nothing left to lose. But treachery awaits him in his father's castle. Treachery and dark magic. No matter how fierce his will, can one young man conquer enemies with power beyond his imagining?</description>

  <description>Between 1933 and 1939, representations of the Nazis and the full meaning of Nazism came slowly to Hollywood, growing more ominous and distinct only as the decade wore on. Recapturing what ordinary Americans saw on the screen during the emerging Nazi threat, Thomas Doherty reclaims forgotten films, such as "Hitler's Reign of Terror" (1934), a pioneering anti-Nazi docudrama by Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr.; "I Was a Captive of Nazi Germany" (1936), a sensational true tale of "a Hollywood girl in Naziland!"; and "Professor Mamlock" (1938), an anti-Nazi film made by German refugees living in the Soviet Union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doherty also recounts how the disproportionately Jewish backgrounds of the executives of the studios and the workers on the payroll shaded reactions to what was never simply a business decision. As Europe hurtled toward war, a proxy battle waged in Hollywood over how to conduct business with the Nazis, how to cover Hitler and his victims in the newsreels, and whether to address or ignore Nazism in Hollywood feature films. Should Hollywood lie low, or stand tall and sound the alarm?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doherty's history features a cast of charismatic personalities: Carl Laemmle, the German Jewish founder of Universal Pictures, whose production of "All Quiet on the Western Front" (1930) enraged the nascent Nazi movement; Georg Gyssling, the Nazi consul in Los Angeles, who read the Hollywood trade press as avidly as any studio mogul; Vittorio Mussolini, son of the fascist dictator and aspiring motion picture impresario; Leni Riefenstahl, the Valkyrie goddess of the Third Reich who came to America to peddle distribution rights for "Olympia" (1938); screenwriters Donald Ogden Stewart and Dorothy Parker, founders of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League; and Harry and Jack Warner of Warner Bros., who yoked anti-Nazism to patriotic Americanism and finally broke the embargo against anti-Nazi cinema with "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" (1939).</description>

  <description>Shrouds of Glory is Winston Groom's riveting account of General John Bell Hood's decisive actions in the western theater of operations during the final moments of the Civil War. Taking us on a journey through the ravaged Confederacy to the once-vibrant city of Nashville -- where General Hood makes a last, futile attempt to preserve the Confederacy -- Shrouds of Glory brings the reader into the general's tent, where Grant, Sherman, Lee, and others plot their often unorthodox strategies for winning the war. Groom paints vivid portraits of Hood and his nemeses, revealing the character, faults, emotions, and most of all the doubts that molded the course of conflict.</description>

  <description>Diderot's The Nun (La Religieuse) is the seemingly true story of a young girl forced by her parents to enter a convent and take holy orders. A novel mingling mysticism, madness, sadistic cruelty and nascent sexuality, it gives a scathing insight into the effects of forced vocations and the unnatural life of the convent. A succès de scandale at the end of the eighteenth century, it has attracted and unsettled readers ever since. For Diderot's novel is not simply a story of a young girl with a bad habit; it is also a powerfully emblematic fable about oppression and intolerance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new translation includes Diderot's all-important prefatory material, which he placed, disconcertingly, at the end of the novel, and which turns what otherwise seems like an exercise in realism into what is now regarded as a masterpiece of proto-modernist fiction.</description>

  <description>Fought in a tangled forest fringing the south bank of the Rapidan River, the Battle of the Wilderness marked the initial engagement in the climactic months of the Civil War in Virginia, and the first encounter between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee. In an exciting narrative, Gordon C. Rhea provides the consummate recounting of that conflict of May 5 and 6, 1864, which ended with high casualties on both sides but no clear victor. With its balanced analysis of events and people, command structures and strategies, The Battle of the Wilderness is operational history as it should be written.</description>

  <description>In 1889 two Russian immigrants, Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, met in a coffee shop on the Lower East Side. Over the next fifty years Emma and Sasha would be fast friends, fleeting lovers, and loyal comrades. This dual biography offers an unprecedented glimpse into their intertwined lives, the lasting influence of the anarchist movement they shaped, and their unyielding commitment to equality and justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Berkman shocked the country in 1892 with "the first terrorist act in America," the failed assassination of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick for his crimes against workers. Passionate and pitiless, gloomy yet gentle, Berkman remained Goldman's closest confidant though the two were often separated--by his fourteen-year imprisonment and by Emma's growing fame as the champion of a multitude of causes, from sexual liberation to freedom of speech. The blazing sun to Sasha's morose moon, Emma became known as "the most dangerous woman in America." Through an attempted prison breakout, multiple bombing plots, and a dramatic deportation from America, these two unrelenting activists insisted on the improbable ideal of a socially just, self-governing utopia, a vision that has shaped movements across the past century, most recently Occupy Wall Street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sasha and Emma" is the culminating work of acclaimed historian of anarchism Paul Avrich. Before his death, Avrich asked his daughter to complete his magnum opus. The resulting collaboration, epic in scope, intimate in detail, examines the possibilities and perils of political faith and protest, through a pair who both terrified and dazzled the world.</description>

  <description>Applause Books" It's Only a Movie is the best book ever written about my father. It really is amazing." Patricia Hitchcock North by Northwest. Psycho. Rear Window. The Birds. Vertigo. When it comes to murder and mayhem, shock and suspense, the films of Alfred Hitchcock can not be surpassed. For this book, Charlotte Chandler interviewed Hitchcock, his wife, daughter, film crew members, and many of the stars who appeared in his films, including Kim Novak, Janet Leigh, Cary Grant, Tippi Hedren and James Stewart.Throughout the book, Chandler shares Hitchcock's wit and wisdom. When actors took themselves too seriously, he would remind them, "it's only a movie." Chandler introduces us to the real Hitchcock, a devoted family man and notorious practical joker, who made suspenseful thrillers mixed with subtle humor and tacit eroticism.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;YOU ASK FOR MY NAME, THE REAL ONE, AND I CANNOT TELL. IT IS NOT FOR LACK OF EFFORT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1930, a great ocean wave blots out a Bengali village, leaving only one survivor, a young girl. As a maidservant in a British boarding school, Pom is renamed Sarah and discovers her gift for languages. Her private dreams almost die when she arrives in Kharagpur and is recruited into a secretive, decadent world. Eventually, she lands in Calcutta, renames herself Kamala, and creates a new life rich in books and friends. But although success and even love seem within reach, she remains trapped by what she is . . . and is not. As India struggles to throw off imperial rule, Kamala uses her hard-won skills&amp;amp;#8212;for secrecy, languages, and reading the unspoken gestures of those around her&amp;amp;#8212;to fight for her country&amp;amp;#8217;s freedom and her own happiness.</description>

  <description>Helps readers understand how the many languages of film work together to create meaning. Louis Giannetti organizes "Understanding Movies" around the key elements of filmmaking, including cintematography, Mise en Scene, movement, editing, sound, acting, drama, casting, story, screenwriting, ideology, and theory. He synthesizes every element through a complete case study: "Citizen Kane." This book's ideas are illuminated with hundreds of high-quality still photos, more than 70 in full color, taken from movies such as "The Matrix, Almost Famous, jackass the movie, Chicago, Lord of the Rings, Mystic River, and Traffic. New in this edition: a full section on contemporary special effects and computer generated imagery (CGI); up-to-the-minute information on new developments in film technology; more coverage of recent films and filmmakers; more ethnic diversity (including new material on the Islamic cinema); and more lavish use of color and high-quality paper. An updated Companion Website contains animations, video clips from interviews with movie professionals, and Research Navigator access to "New York Times"" film reviews. For everyone who wants to understand the artistry and meaning of the movies.</description>

  <description>First published in 1968, &lt;em&gt;Weimar Culture&lt;/em&gt; is one of the masterworks of Peter Gay's distinguished career. A study of German culture between the two wars, the book brilliantly traces the rise of the artistic, literary, and musical culture that bloomed ever so briefly in the 1920s amid the chaos of Germany's tenuous post-World War I democracy, and crashed violently in the wake of Hitler's rise to power. Despite the ephemeral nature of the Weimar democracy, the influence of its culture was profound and far-reaching, ushering in a modern sensibility in the arts that dominated Western culture for most of the twentieth century. Vivid and eminently readable, &lt;em&gt;Weimar Culture&lt;/em&gt; is the finest introduction for the casual reader and historian alike. "[A]n enormously rich, intriguing, and exciting essay.... A major contribution to the study..."—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In June 2010, Michael Hastings's extraordinary, uncensored "Rolling Stone "article, "The Runaway General," shocked the world and set off a series of events that culminated in the resignation of General Stanley McChrystal. Now, THE OPERATORS will lead us even deeper into the war, its politics, and its major players at a time when such insight is demanded and desperately needed. Based on exclusive reporting in Afghanistan, Europe, the Middle East, and Washington, DC, this landmark work of journalism will elucidate as never before the United States' involvement in Afghanistan in vivid, unforgettable detail. Part wild travelogue, part expos, and part sobering analysis, THE OPERATORS promises an unprecedented behind-the-scenes account of the war from the only journalist uniquely poised to tell it.</description>

  <description>From flying hot-blooded squirrels and diminutive kinglets to sleeping black bears and torpid turtles to frozen insects and frogs, the animal kingdom relies on staggering evolutionary innovations to survive winter. Unlike their human counterparts, who alter the environment to accommodate physicallimitations, most animals are adapted to an amazing range of conditions. In Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival, biologist, illustrator, and award-winning author Bernd Heinrich explores his local woods, where he delights in the seemingly infinite feats of animal inventiveness he discovers there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because winter drastically affects the mostelemental component of all life -- water -- radical changes in a creature's physiology and behavior must take place to match the demands of the environment. Some creatures survive by developing antifreeze; others must remain in constant motion to maintain their high body temperatures. Even if animals can avoid freezing to death, they must still manage to find food in a time of scarcity, or store it from a time of plenty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully illustrated throughout with the author's delicate drawings and infused by his inexhaustible enchantment with nature, &lt;em&gt;Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival&lt;/em&gt; awakens thewonders and mysteries by which nature sustains herself through winter's harsh, cruel exigencies.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed novelist Sayed Kashua, the creator of the groundbreaking Israeli sitcom, �Arab Labor,” has been widely praised for his literary eye and deadpan wit. His new novel is considered internationally to be his most accomplished and entertaining work yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner of the prestigious Bernstein Award, &lt;em&gt;Second Person Singular&lt;/em&gt; centers on an ambitious lawyer who is considered one of the best Arab criminal attorneys in Jerusalem. He has a thriving practice in the Jewish part of town, a large house, speaks perfect Hebrew, and is in love with his wife and two young children. One day at a used bookstore, he picks up a copy of Tolstoy’s The Kreutzer Sonata, and inside finds a love letter, in Arabic, in his wife’s handwriting. Consumed with suspicion and jealousy, the lawyer hunts for the book’s previous owner—a man named Yonatan—pulling at the strings that hold all their lives together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With enormous emotional power, and a keen sense of the absurd, Kashua spins a tale of love and betrayal, honesty and artifice, and questions whether it is possible to truly reinvent ourselves. Second Person Singular is a deliciously complex psychological mystery and a searing dissection of the individuals that comprise a divided society.</description>

  <description>When sixteen-year-old Alfred Rosenberg is called into his headmaster’s office for anti-Semitic remarks he made during a school speech, he is forced, as punishment, to memorize passages about Spinoza from the autobiography of the German poet Goethe. Rosenberg is stunned to discover that Goethe, his idol, was a great admirer of the Jewish seventeenth-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Long after graduation, Rosenberg remains haunted by this “Spinoza problem”: how could the German genius Goethe have been inspired by a member of a race Rosenberg considers so inferior to his own, a race he was determined to destroy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spinoza himself was no stranger to punishment during his lifetime. Because of his unorthodox religious views, he was excommunicated from the Amsterdam Jewish community in 1656, at the age of twenty-four, and banished from the only world he had ever known. Though his life was short and he lived without means in great isolation, he nonetheless produced works that changed the course of history. Over the years, Rosenberg rose through the ranks to become an outspoken Nazi ideologue, a faithful servant of Hitler, and the main author of racial policy for the Third Reich. Still, his Spinoza obsession lingered. By imagining the unexpected intersection of Spinoza’s life with Rosenberg’s, internationally bestselling novelist Irvin D. Yalom explores the mindsets of two men separated by 300 years. Using his skills as a psychiatrist, he explores the inner lives of Spinoza, the saintly secular philosopher, and of Rosenberg, the godless mass murderer.</description>

  <description>Of all the Plantagenet women, Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent, was the most beautiful. Overshadowed by her brilliant husband and by her wayward and ill-fated son, Joan might have been remembered only as the Black Prince's wife, Richard II's widowed mother. But her passionate love story was lived against such events as the victories of Crecy and Poitiers, at the brilliant court of Edward III, and among his proud and ambitious sons and daughters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LADY OF THE GARTER is the fourth of THE PLANTAGENETS, a series of historical novels which tell the story of the Plantagenet monarchs through the eyes of the men and women who served them, loved them, or betrayed them, and in so doing help shape the evens of English history.</description>

  <description>Jeff Winston was 43 and trapped in a tepid marriage and a dead-end job, waiting for that time when he could be truly happy, when he died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when he woke and he was 18 again, with all his memories of the next 25 years intact. He could live his life again, avoiding the mistakes, making money from his knowledge of the future, seeking happiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until he dies at 43 and wakes up back in college again...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;With the Animals&lt;/em&gt;, Noelle Revaz’s shocking debut, is a novel of mud and blood whose linguistic audaciousness is matched only by its brutality, misanthropy, and gallows humor which paint a portrait of masculinity gone mad.</description>

  <description>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tony Horwitz returned from years of traipsing through war zones as a foreign correspondent only to find that his childhood obsession with the Civil War had caught up with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Near his house in Virginia, he happened to encounter people who reenact the Civil War--men who dress up in period costumes and live as Johnny Rebs and Billy Yanks.  Intrigued, he wound up having some odd adventures with the "hardcores," the fellows who try to immerse themselves in the war, hoping to get what they lovingly term a "period rush."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horwitz spent two years reporting on why Americans are still so obsessed with the war, and the ways in which it resonates today. In the course of his work, he made a sobering side trip to cover a murder that was provoked by the display of the Confederate flag, and he spoke to a number of people seeking to honor their ancestors who fought for the Confederacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horwitz has a flair for odd details that spark insights, and &lt;em&gt;Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War&lt;/em&gt; is a thoughtful and entertaining book that does much to explain America's continuing obsession with the Civil War.</description>

  <description>When a private plane crashes in Florida in 1991, the surviving pilot makes the strangest of remarks. "It was World War II," he says. The National Transportation Safety Board attributes the accident to a collision with birds, but one stubborn investigator insists on going further. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before long, the investigator's inquiry reveals how the pilot's past had trailed him on his last flight and vividly brings to life a terrifying slice of history - the story of a German boy who grows up in Berlin before, during, and after the Second World War; sadistic teachers just call him &lt;em&gt;Five&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boy's father, an opponent of the Nazis, ends up in a concentration camp and later in a penal regiment that marches through Russian mine fields to clear the way for regular troops. In contrast, one of the boy's uncles is a fervent Nazi in charge of cleansing Berlin of every last Jew; another uncle revels in the governance of Paris. A favorite aunt, a confidential secretary at the Gestapo, is horrified by all she knows about the "final solution." The boy's mother is the one who keeps him sane when gunfire from a strafing Spitfire kills his best friend standing right next to him on a bridge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But worse is to come: bombings and firestorms, the senseless sacrifice of children and old men in the Battle of Berlin, the Soviet occupation, along with rape, murder, hunger, and disease, and then the emergence of a new kind of tyranny yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end, we come upon an unexpected twist that shows how the consequences of war can emerge decades later and in faraway places.</description>

  <description>In Dark Star Safari the wittily observant and endearingly irascible Paul Theroux takes readers the length of Africa by rattletrap bus, dugout canoe, cattle truck, armed convoy, ferry, and train. In the course of his epic and enlightening journey, he endures danger, delay, and dismaying circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gauging the state of affairs, he talks to Africans, aid workers, missionaries, and tourists. What results is an insightful mediation on the history, politics, and beauty of Africa and its people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a new postscript, Theroux recounts the dramatic events of a return to Africa to visit Zimbabwe.</description>

  <description>"Well, I finally got an idea. When he fails, do like me: think about free elephant ride through Africa for hundreds and hundreds of wonderful animals that nothing could be built - either a wall or a fence of barbed wire - passing large open spaces and crush everything in its path, and destroying everything - while they live, nothing is able to stop them - what freedom and! And even when they are no longer alive, who knows, perhaps continue to race elsewhere still free. So you begin to torment your claustrophobia, barbed wire, reinforced concrete, complete materialism imagine herds of elephants of freedom, follow them with his eyes never left them on their run and will see you soon feel better ... "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the novel ROOTS OF HEAVEN Gary gets first Goncourt Prize. Translated and republished in many countries around the world, he finally published in Bulgarian.

  <description>Patrick White's brilliant 1961 novel, set in an Australian suburb, intertwines four deeply different lives. An Aborigine artist, a Holocaust survivor, a beatific washerwoman, and a childlike heiress are each blessed—and stricken—with visionary experiences that may or may not allow them to transcend the machinations of their fellow men. Tender and lacerating, pure and profane, subtle and sweeping, &lt;em&gt;Riders in the Chariot&lt;/em&gt; is one of the Nobel Prize winner's boldest books.</description>

  <description>The No. 1 New York Times bestseller. Best nonfiction books of the year at Goodreads, Amazon.com, and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble. One of the New York Times critic Janet Maslin's 10 favorite books of 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Pulitzer Prize&lt;em&gt;–&lt;/em&gt;winning journalist Bill Dedman noticed in 2009 a grand home for sale, unoccupied for nearly sixty years, he stumbled through a surprising portal into American history. &lt;em&gt;Empty Mansions&lt;/em&gt; is a rich mystery of wealth and loss, connecting the Gilded Age opulence of the nineteenth century with a twenty-first-century battle over a $300 million inheritance. At its heart is a reclusive heiress named Huguette Clark, a woman so secretive that, at the time of her death at age 104, no new photograph of her had been seen in decades. Though she owned palatial homes in California, New York, and Connecticut, why had she lived for twenty years in a simple hospital room, despite being in excellent health? Why were her valuables being sold off? Was she in control of her fortune, or controlled by those managing her money?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Dedman has collaborated with Huguette Clark’s cousin, Paul Clark Newell, Jr., one of the few relatives to have frequent conversations with her. Dedman and Newell tell a fairy tale in reverse: the bright, talented daughter, born into a family of extreme wealth and privilege, who secrets herself away from the outside world.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Huguette was the daughter of self-made copper industrialist W. A. Clark, nearly as rich as Rockefeller in his day, a controversial senator, railroad builder, and founder of Las Vegas. She grew up in the largest house in New York City, a remarkable dwelling with 121 rooms for a family of four. She owned paintings by Degas and Renoir, a world-renowned Stradivarius violin, a vast collection of antique dolls. But wanting more than treasures, she devoted her wealth to buying gifts for friends and strangers alike, to quietly pursuing her own work as an artist, and to guarding the privacy she valued above all else.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; The Clark family story spans nearly all of American history in three generations, from a log cabin in Pennsylvania to mining camps in the Montana gold rush, from backdoor politics in Washington to a distress call from an elegant Fifth Avenue apartment. The same Huguette who was touched by the terror attacks of 9/11 held a ticket nine decades earlier for a first-class stateroom on the second voyage of the &lt;em&gt;Titanic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Empty Mansions&lt;/em&gt; reveals a complex portrait of the mysterious Huguette and her intimate circle. We meet her extravagant father, her publicity-shy mother, her star-crossed sister, her French boyfriend, her nurse who received more than $30 million in gifts, and the relatives fighting to inherit Huguette’s copper fortune. Richly illustrated with more than seventy photographs, &lt;em&gt;Empty Mansions&lt;/em&gt; is an enthralling story of an eccentric of the highest order, a last jewel of the Gilded Age who lived life on her own terms.</description>

  <description>Americans call the Second World War “The Good War.” But before it even began, America’s wartime ally Josef Stalin had killed millions of his own citizens—and kept killing them during and after the war. Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war’s end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.&lt;br&gt;Bloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Booklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there is an explanation for the political killing perpetrated in eastern Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, historian Snyder roots it in agriculture. Stalin wanted to collectivize farmers; Hitler wanted to eliminate them so Germans could colonize the land. The dictators wielded frightening power to advance such fantasies toward reality, and the despots toted up about 14 million corpses between them, so stupefying a figure that Snyder sets himself three goals here: to break down the number into the various actions of murder that comprise it, from liquidation of the kulaks to the final solution; to restore humanity to the victims via surviving testimony to their fates; and to deny Hitler and Stalin any historical justification for their policies, which at the time had legions of supporters and have some even today. Such scope may render Snyder’s project too imposing to casual readers, but it would engage those exposed to the period’s chronology and major interpretive issues, such as the extent to which the Nazi and Soviet systems may be compared. Solid and judicious scholarship for large WWII collections.</description>

  <description>After the Civil War, African Americans placed poignant "information wanted" advertisements in newspapers, searching for missing family members. Inspired by the power of these ads, Heather Andrea Williams uses slave narratives, letters, interviews, public records, and diaries to guide readers back to devastating moments of family separation during slavery when people were sold away from parents, siblings, spouses, and children. Williams explores the heartbreaking stories of separation and the long, usually unsuccessful journeys toward reunification.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Brandon Sanderson is one of the most significant fantasists to enter the field in a good many years. His ambitious, multi-volume epics (&lt;em&gt;Mistborn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Stormlight Archive&lt;/em&gt;) and his stellar continuation of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time series have earned both critical acclaim and a substantial popular following. In &lt;em&gt;Legion&lt;/em&gt;, a distinctly contemporary novella filled with suspense, humor, and an endless flow of invention, Sanderson reveals a startling new facet of his singular narrative talent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephen Leeds, AKA “Legion,” is a man whose unique mental condition allows him to generate a multitude of personae: hallucinatory entities with a wide variety of personal characteristics and a vast array of highly specialized skills. As the story begins, Leeds and his “aspects” are drawn into the search for the missing Balubal Razon, inventor of a camera whose astonishing properties could alter our understanding of human history and change the very structure of society. The action ranges from the familiar environs of America to the ancient, divided city of Jerusalem. Along the way, Sanderson touches on a formidable assortment of complex questions: the nature of time, the mysteries of the human mind, the potential uses of technology, and the volatile connection between politics and faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resonant, intelligent, and thoroughly absorbing, &lt;em&gt;Legion&lt;/em&gt; is a provocative entertainment from a writer of great originality and seemingly limitless gifts.</description>

  <description>Forced into a brutal concentration camp during a great war, Brodeck returns to his village at the war’s end and takes up his old job of writing reports for a governmental bureau. One day a stranger comes to live in the village. His odd manner and habits arouse suspicions: His speech is formal, he takes long, solitary walks, and although he is unfailingly friendly and polite, he reveals nothing about himself. When the stranger produces drawings of the village and its inhabitants that are both unflattering and insightful, the villagers murder him. The authorities who witnessed the killing tell Brodeck to write a report that is essentially a whitewash of the incident. &lt;br&gt;As Brodeck writes the official account, he sets down his version of the truth in a separate, parallel narrative. In measured, evocative prose, he weaves into the story of the stranger his own painful history and the dark secrets the villagers have fiercely kept hidden. &lt;br&gt;Set in an unnamed time and place, &lt;em&gt;Brodeck&lt;/em&gt; blends the familiar and unfamiliar, myth and history into a work of extraordinary power and resonance. Readers of J. M. Coetzee’s &lt;em&gt;Disgrace&lt;/em&gt;, Bernhard Schlink’s &lt;em&gt;The Reader&lt;/em&gt; and Kafka will be captivated by &lt;em&gt;Brodeck&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>The pilots of Flyboy, Inc., landed on the alien planet of Iaxo with a mission: In one year, quash an insurrection; exploit the ancient enmities of an indigenous, tribal society; and kill the hell out of one group of natives to facilitate negotiations with the surviving group ? all over 110 million acres of mixed terrain. At first, the double-hush, back-burner project went well. With a ten-century technological lead on the locals, the logistical support of a powerful private military company, and aid from other outfits on the ground, it was supposed to be an easy-in, easy-out mission that would make the pilots of Flyboy, Inc., very, very rich. But the natives of Iaxo had another plan ? and what was once a strategic slam-dunk has become a quagmire, leaving the pilots of Flyboy, Inc., on an embattled distant planet, waiting for support and a ride home that may never come? This dark debut novel tells the tale of a secret war ? and the struggle to stay sane in a world that makes no sense.</description>

  <description>Set in the Rift Valley in 1898, HELL'S GATE is about colonial expansion and political intrigue in the British East African Protectorate, which we now know as Kenya. Inspired by historical fact, HELL'S GATE is a tale of love, power amd man's inhumanity to man. It recalls the struggle and race to build a railway from the coast at Mombassa to the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda, known as the 'Jewel of Africa'. At the heart of this story is the beautiful Rift Valley and tented city of Nairobi camp where Major Web, commandant of the British East Africa Rifles struggles against overwhelming odds from the Masai hordes and the threat to his love for the beautiful Hannah from Reuben Cole, widowed farmer to whom she was indebted for saving her life.</description>

  <description>Two women talk, and what they say is explosive. One woman writes, and each part of her becomes a fragment set down in a different notebook. Torn apart by marriage, love affairs, children, and a neurotic society, the one woman, Anna, is going to pieces, breaking down--and finally coming to terms with herself as a total, complete human being...a woman who truly understands herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brilliant, complex, compelling work...an artistic vision of the struggles and joys that mark every free woman.</description>

As Jonas becomes a detective into his wife's death, the reader also begins to investigate Jonas himself, and the road his life has taken to reach this point, asking "How do the pieces of a life fit together?

  <description>As tattoo artist Star begins to ink her first client on a spring Sunday morning, something goes horribly wrong with the world... Belfast's hungover lapse into a deeper sleep than normal, their sudden deaths causing an unholy mess of crashing cars, smoldering televisions and falling aircraft. In the chaotic aftermath a group of post-apocalyptic survivors search for purpose in a devastated city. Ageing DJ Sean Magee and shifty-eyed Barry Rogan find drunken solace in a hotel bar. Ex-IRA operative Mairead Burns and RIR soldier Roy Beggs form an uneasy alliance to rebuild community life. Elsewhere, a mysterious Preacher Man lures shivering survivors out of the shadows with a promise of redemption. Choked by the smell of death, Irelands remaining few begin the journey toward a new life, fear and desperation giving rise to new tensions and dark old habits. But a new threat--as gorgeous as it is deadly--creeps slowly out of lifes wreckage. Fueled by feral hunger and a thirst for chaos, the corpses of the beautiful are rising]</description>

  <description>Sir William Garrow was born in Middlesex, England in 1760. He was called to the legal profession in 1783. He became the dominant figure at Old Bailey London's Central Criminal Court from 1783 to 1793. Later on, he was a Member of Parliament, a Solicitor-General, an Attorney-General, and, finally, a judge and a lawmaker within the English Common Law Tradition. With this book, as well as the BBC TV drama series Garrow's Law, many will be made aware of Sir William Garrow and his 'gifts to the world, ' as the originator of: the modern-day presumption of innocence, the right to universal legal representation and access to justice in a criminal court, expert cross examination, and early traces of human rights (among other things). Sir William Garrow: His Life, Times and Fight for Justice will be invaluable to anyone wishing to understand the development of the criminal trial and wanting to learn about legal history in the making.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;On November 2nd armed with a sheaf of visas...one suitcase...and my typewriter, I left humdrum London for the thrilling cities of the world...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1959, Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, was commissioned by the &lt;em&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; to explore fourteen of the world's most exotic cities. Fleming saw it all with a thriller writer's eye. From Hong Kong to Honolulu, New York to Naples, he left the bright main streets for the back alleys, abandoning tourist sites in favour of underground haunts, and mingling with celebrities, gangsters and geishas. The result is a series of vivid snapshots of a mysterious, vanished world.</description>

But now a diabolical killer is challenging Rhyme to a terrifying and ingenious duel of wits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With police detective Amelia Sachs by his side, Rhyme must follow a labyrinth of clues that reaches back to a dark chapter in New York City's past -- and reach further into the darkness of the mind of a madman who won't stop until he has stripped life down to the bone.</description>

  <description>The Joseph Roth revival has finally gone mainstream with the thunderous reception for &lt;em&gt;What I Saw&lt;/em&gt;, a book that has become a classic with five hardcover printings. Glowingly reviewed, &lt;em&gt;What I Saw&lt;/em&gt; introduces a new generation to the genius of this tortured author with its "nonstop brilliance, irresistible charm and continuing relevance" (Jeffrey Eugenides, &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;). As if anticipating Christopher Isherwood, the book re-creates the tragicomic world of 1920s Berlin as seen by its greatest journalistic eyewitness. In 1920, Joseph Roth, the most renowned German correspondent of his age, arrived in Berlin, the capital of the Weimar Republic. He produced a series of impressionistic and political essays that influenced an entire generation of writers, including Thomas Mann and the young Christopher Isherwood. Translated and collected here for the first time, these pieces record the violent social and political paroxysms that constantly threatened to undo the fragile democracy that was the Weimar Republic. Roth, like no other German writer of his time, ventured beyond Berlin's official veneer to the heart of the city, chronicling the lives of its forgotten inhabitants: the war cripples, the Jewish immigrants from the Pale, the criminals, the bathhouse denizens, and the nameless dead who filled the morgues. Warning early on of the dangers posed by the Nazis, Roth evoked a landscape of moral bankruptcy and debauched beauty—a memorable portrait of a city and a time of commingled hope and chaos. &lt;em&gt;What I Saw&lt;/em&gt;, like no other existing work, records the violent social and political paroxysms that compromised and ultimately destroyed the precarious democracy that was the Weimar Republic.</description>

  <description>Still bearing scars from the gulag, a freed POW traverses Russia to arrive at the Polish town of Lodz. In its massive "Hotel Savoy," he meets a surreal cast of characters, each eagerly awaiting the return from America of a rich man named Bloomfield. Like Europe itself in 1932, the hotel is the stage upon which characters follow fate to its tragic destination.</description>

  <description>Vienna of the late nineteenth century, with its contrasting images of pomp and profound melancholy, provides the backdrop for Joseph Roth's final novel, which he completed in exile, a few years before his tragic death in 1939. This brilliant, allegorical tale of seduction and personal and societal ruin, set amidst exquisite, wistful descriptions of a waning aristocratic age, provides an essential link to our understanding of Roth's extraordinary fictive powers. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Americans have long been taught that events such as the notorious My Lai massacre were isolated incidents in the Vietnam War, carried out by just a few “bad apples.” But as award-winning journalist and historian Nick Turse demonstrates in this groundbreaking investigation, violence against Vietnamese noncombatants was not at all exceptional during the conflict. Rather, it was pervasive and systematic, the predictable consequence of official orders to “kill anything that moves.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on more than a decade of research into secret Pentagon archives and extensive interviews with American veterans and Vietnamese survivors, Turse reveals for the first time the workings of a military machine that resulted in millions of innocent civilians killed and wounded—what one soldier called “a My Lai a month.” Devastating and definitive, Kill Anything That Moves finally brings us face-to-face with the truth of a war that haunts America to this day.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the last-chance moment of the war. In January 2007, President George W. Bush announced a new strategy for Iraq. He called it the surge. “Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not. Well, here are the differences,” he told a skeptical nation. Among those listening were the young, optimistic army infantry soldiers of the 2-16, the battalion nicknamed the Rangers. About to head to a vicious area of Baghdad, they decided the difference would be them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen months later, the soldiers returned home forever changed. Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reporter David Finkel was with them in Bagdad, and almost every grueling step of the way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What was the true story of the surge? And was it really a success? Those are the questions he grapples with in his remarkable report from the front lines. Combining the action of Mark Bowden’s &lt;em&gt;Black Hawk Down&lt;/em&gt; with the literary brio of Tim O’Brien’s &lt;em&gt;The Things They Carried&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Good Soldiers&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable work of reportage. And in telling the story of these good soldiers, the heroes and the ruined, David Finkel has also produced an eternal tale—not just of the Iraq War, but of all wars, for all time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>National Book Award-winning novelist Colum McCann delivers his most ambitious and beautiful novel yet, tying together a series of narratives that span 150 years and two continents in an outstanding act of literary bravura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1845 a black American slave lands in Ireland to champion ideas of democracy and freedom, only to find a famine unfurling at his feet. In 1919, two brave young airmen emerge from the carnage of World War One to pilot the very first transatlantic flight from Newfoundland to the west of Ireland. And in 1998 an American senator criss-crosses the ocean in search of a lasting Irish peace. Bearing witness to these history-making moments of Frederick Douglass, John Alcock and "Teddy" Brown, and George Mitchell, and braiding the story together into one epic tale, are four generations of women from a matriarchal clan, beginning with Irish housemaid Lily Duggan. In this story of dark and light, men and women, history and past, fiction and fact, National Book Award-winning novelist Colum McCann delivers a tour de force that is his most spectacular achievement to date.</description>

  <description>London, 1920. In the aftermath of the Great War and a devastating family tragedy, Laurence Bartram has turned his back on the world. But with a well-timed letter, an old flame manages to draw him back in. Mary Emmett’s brother John—like Laurence, an officer during the war—has apparently killed himself while in the care of a remote veterans’ hospital, and Mary needs to know why. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aided by his friend Charles—a dauntless gentleman with detective skills cadged from mystery novels—Laurence begins asking difficult questions. What connects a group of war poets, a bitter feud within Emmett’s regiment, and a hidden love affair? Was Emmett’s death really a suicide, or the missing piece in a puzzling series of murders? As veterans tied to Emmett continue to turn up dead, and Laurence is forced to face the darkest corners of his own war experiences, his own survival may depend on uncovering the truth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At once a compelling mystery and an elegant literary debut, &lt;em&gt;The Return of Captain John Emmett&lt;/em&gt; blends the psychological depth of Pat Barker’s Regeneration trilogy with lively storytelling from the golden age of British crime fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Widow&lt;/em&gt; is the story of two outcasts and their fatal encounter. One is the widow herself, Tati. Still young, she’s never had an easy time of it, but she’s not the kind to complain. Tati lives with her father-in-law on the family farm, putting up with his sexual attentions, working her fingers to the bone, improving the property and knowing all the time that her late husband’s sister is scheming to kick her out and take the house back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The other is a killer. Just out of prison and in search of a new life, Jean meets up with Tati, who hires him as a handyman and then takes him to bed. Things are looking up, at least until Jean falls hard for the girl next door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Widow&lt;/em&gt; was published in the same year as Camus’ &lt;em&gt;The Stranger&lt;/em&gt;, and André Gide judged it the superior book. It is Georges Simenon’s most powerful and disturbing exploration of the bond between death and desire.</description>

  <description>Jack Holmes and Will Wright arrive in New York in the calm before the storm of the 1960s. Coworkers at a cultural journal, they soon become good friends. Jack even introduces Will to the woman he will marry. But their friendship is complicated: Jack is also in love with Will. Troubled by his subversive longings, Jack sees a psychiatrist and dates a few women, while also pursuing short-lived liaisons with other men. But in the two decades of their friendship, from the first stirrings of gay liberation through the catastrophe of AIDS, Jack remains devoted to Will. And as Will embraces his heterosexual sensuality, nearly destroying his marriage, the two men share a newfound libertinism in a city that is itself embracing its freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving among beautifully delineated characters in a variety of social milieus, Edmund White brings narrative daring and an exquisite sense of life's submerged drama to this masterful exploration of friendship, sexuality, and sensibility during a watershed moment in history.</description>

  <description>Some called the city the "Splendor of the East"; others the "Whore of Asia". A melting pot of different nations, fused by war and commerce, this was the Shanghai of the 1920s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Great Powers are greedily exploiting China for its cheap labor and reaping the cruel rewards of the opium trade. However, as a flotilla of ships carrying the remnants of the defeated White Army enters Shanghai, the uneasy balance of this frenetic international marketplace comes under threat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the refugees is Klim Rogov, a journalist whose life and marriage have been destroyed by the Russian revolution - all he has left are his quick wits and a keen worldliness that will serve him well in navigating the lawless jungle of Shanghai. He finds work as a reporter in a British-run newspaper, rubbing shoulders with international gangsters while defying the intrigues of sinister communist agents, clinging all the time to the hope that someday he'll be reunited with his beloved wife, Nina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This complete English translation of Elvira Baryakina's White Shanghai reflects the greatest traditions of the Russian classics. Her years of research in libraries and archives around the world engendered a rare kind of literature which, by blending a multinational cast of exotic characters against the backdrop of the turbulence and fervor of the early 20th century, sends the reader on a breathless journey of passion, politics and crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The official website of the book is &lt;a href="http://whiteshanghai.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://whiteshanghai.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;There you can find beautiful illustrations, maps, vintage photographs and much more.</description>

  <description>The relationship between Henry Downing and his wife, Christine, was suffering due to her selfish attitude and her reluctance to accept his work responsibilities, which were part of this job as Senior Production Manger. This was exacerbated when Henry told her he was to lead a team of 14 on a business trip to America and Australia, and that it would be for at least two months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the women in the team was Elizabeth, and admin officer who already liked Henry, but her admiration of him increased after two encounters prior to leaving on the trip. While at the sister company in New York, Henry and Elizabeth found there was chemistry between them, both professional and personal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the flight to Australia, the privately chartered aircraft encountered an electrical storm and crashed in the sea near a remote island; there were 11 survivors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry’s wife meant everything to him; she was his love, his life, despite her treatment of him. With tension and dissention between the survivors, and a growing admiration between certain individuals, could Henry’s love provide him with the strength and staying power to remain hopeful of rescue, and faithful to his wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Island of Heartache is a short novel of approximately 53,000 words</description>

  <description>“The more you transform your life from the material to the spiritual domain, the less you become afraid of death.” Leo Tolstoy spoke these words, and they became Henry Stuart’s raison d’etre. &lt;em&gt;The Poet of Tolstoy Park &lt;/em&gt;is the unforgettable novel based on the true story of Henry Stuart’s life, which was reclaimed from his doctor’s belief that he would not live another year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry responds to the news by slogging home barefoot in the rain. It’s 1925. The place: Canyon County, Idaho. Henry is sixty-seven, a retired professor and a widower who has been told a warmer climate would make the end more tolerable. San Diego would be a good choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead, Henry chose Fairhope, Alabama, a town with utopian ideals and a haven for strong-minded individualists. Upton Sinclair, Sherwood Anderson, and Clarence Darrow were among its inhabitants. Henry bought his own ten acres of piney woods outside Fairhope. Before dying, underscored by the writings of his beloved Tolstoy, Henry could begin to “perfect the soul awarded him” and rest in the faith that he, and all people, would succeed, “even if it took eons.” Human existence, Henry believed, continues in a perfect circle unmarred by flaws of personality, irrespective of blood and possessions and rank, and separate from organized religion. In Alabama, until his final breath, he would chase these high ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But first, Henry had to answer up for leaving Idaho. Henry’s dearest friend and intellectual sparring partner, Pastor Will Webb, and Henry’s two adult sons, Thomas and Harvey, were baffled and angry that he would abandon them and move to the Deep South, living in a barn there while he built a round house of handmade concrete blocks. His new neighbors were perplexed by his eccentric behavior as well. On the coldest day of winter he was barefoot, a philosopher and poet with ideas and words to share with anyone who would listen. And, mysteriously, his “last few months” became years. He had gone looking for a place to learn lessons in dying, and, studiously advanced to claim a vigorous new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poet of Tolstoy Park &lt;/em&gt;is a moving and irresistible story, a guidebook of the mind and spirit that lays hold of the heart. Henry Stuart points the way through life’s puzzles for all of us, becoming in this timeless tale a character of such dimension that he seems more alive now than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Follow Kip, Rock and Steady, as they struggle to survive and stay completely shit-faced in the face of certain undead doom. These three unlikely heroes hold the key to humanity's salvation, but will they succeed being inebriated as they are? Not everyone who saves the world is a rocket scientist, a super hero, or a handsome actor turned politician. Sometimes people who save the world... they're fucking idiots.</description>

  <description>"[One morning] in the early spring, I woke up with the remembrance of a girl I'd once known, Sophie. It was a very vivid half-dream, half-revelation, and all of a sudden I realized that hers was a story I had to tell." That very day, William Styron began writing the first chapter of Sophie's Choice.&lt;br&gt;    First published in 1979, this complex and ambitious novel opens with Stingo, a young southerner, journeying north in 1947 to become a writer. It leads us into his intellectual and emotional entanglement with his neighbors in a Brooklyn rooming house: Nathan, a tortured, brilliant Jew, and his lover, Sophie, a beautiful Polish woman whose wrist bears the grim tattoo of a concentration camp...and whose past is strewn with death that she alone survived.&lt;br&gt;   "Sophie's Choice is a passionate, courageous book...a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the twentieth century," said novelist and critic John Gardner in The New York Times Book Review. "One of the reasons Styron succeeds so well in Sophie's Choice is that, like Shakespeare (I think the comparison is not too grand), Styron knows how to cut away from the darkness of his material, so that when he turns to it again it strikes with increasing force....Sophie's Choice is a thriller of the highest order, all the more thrilling for the fact that the dark, gloomy secrets we are unearthing one by one--sorting through lies and terrible misunderstandings like a hand groping for a golden nugget in a rattlesnake's nest--may be authentic secrets of history and our own human nature."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its &lt;br&gt;emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-&lt;br&gt;gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</description>

  <description>A new story collection, the first in six years, from one of our greatest living writers, MacArthur "genius grant" recipient and New Yorker contributor George Saunders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;George Saunders, one of our most important writers, is back with a masterful, deeply felt collection that takes his literary powers to a new level. In a recent interview, when asked how he saw the role of the writer, Saunders said: "To me, the writer's main job is to make the story unscroll in such a way that the reader is snared-she's right there, seeing things happen and caring about them. And if you dedicate yourself to this job, the meanings more or less take care of themselves." In Tenth of December, the reader is always right there, and the meanings are beautiful and profound and abundant. The title story is an exquisite, moving account of the intersection, at a frozen lake in the woods, of a young misfit and a middle-aged cancer patient who goes there to commit suicide, only to end up saving the boy's life. "Home" is the often funny, often poignant account of a soldier returning from the war. And "Victory Lap" is a taut, inventive story about the attempted abduction of a teenage girl. In all, Tenth of December is George Saunders at his absolute best, a collection of stories and characters that add up to something deep, irreducible, and uniquely American.</description>

  <description>H. G. Wells described The Old Wives' Tale as "by far the finest long novel written in English and in the English fashion". He was, of course, speaking for his own generation, and a hundred years later the opinion may seem somewhat exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that &lt;em&gt;The Old Wives' Tale&lt;/em&gt; is a superb novel of its kind, and it is still as readable and enjoyable as ever. First published in 1908, it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the lives of the sisters from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of the Staffordshire Potteries to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris. It was fascinating to learn from Bennett's journal how he saw an old lady in a cafe and was inspired to think of how her life might have been lived, how she must have once been young. The plot of the novel came to him fairly promptly, and, as they say, the rest is history. This novel was serialized on British television with great success circa 2000.</description>

  <description>Critically acclaimed as one of the greatest historical novels in English, The Cloister and the Hearth contains a meticulous recreation of 15th-century European life. Mingled with its cast of vividly drawn characters are various historical personages. The plot concerns Gerard Eliason, a young Dutch artist who abandons thought of the priesthood when he falls in love with Margaret Brandt. Gerard's father opposes their engagement and arranges to have his son kidnapped. The young lovers find each other, but Gerard is soon forced to flee.  --The Merriam-Webster Encylopedia of Literature&lt;br&gt;Set in the 15th century, it relates the story revolving about the travels of a young scribe and illuminator, Gerard Eliassoen, through several European countries. The Cloister and the Hearth often describes the events, people and their practices in minute detail. Its main theme is the struggle between man's obligations to family and to Church.  --Wikipedia</description>

  <description>When a Serbian-backed assassin gunned down Archduke Franz Ferdinand in late June 1914, the world seemed unmoved. Even Ferdinand’s own uncle, Franz Josef I, was notably ambivalent about the death of the Hapsburg heir, saying simply, "It is God’s will." Certainly, there was nothing to suggest that the episode would lead to conflict—much less a world war of such massive and horrific proportions that it would fundamentally reshape the course of human events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As acclaimed historian Sean McMeekin reveals in &lt;em&gt;July 1914&lt;/em&gt;, World War I might have been avoided entirely had it not been for a small group of statesmen who, in the month after the assassination, plotted to use Ferdinand’s murder as the trigger for a long-awaited showdown in Europe. The primary culprits, moreover, have long escaped blame. While most accounts of the war’s outbreak place the bulk of responsibility on German and Austro-Hungarian militarism, McMeekin draws on surprising new evidence from archives across Europe to show that the worst offenders were actually to be found in Russia and France, whose belligerence and duplicity ensured that war was inevitable. &lt;br&gt;Whether they plotted for war or rode the whirlwind nearly blind, each of the men involved—from Austrian Foreign Minister Leopold von Berchtold and German Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov and French president Raymond Poincaré—sought to capitalize on the fallout from Ferdinand’s murder, unwittingly leading Europe toward the greatest cataclysm it had ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A revolutionary account of the genesis of World War I, &lt;em&gt;July 1914&lt;/em&gt; tells the gripping story of Europe’s countdown to war from the bloody opening act on June 28th to Britain’s final plunge on August 4th, showing how a single month—and a handful of men—changed the course of the twentieth century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>On January 28, 1945, 121 hand-selected U.S. troops slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines. Their mission: March thirty rugged miles to rescue 513 POWs languishing in a hellish camp, among them the last survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March. A recent prison massacre by Japanese soldiers elsewhere in the Philippines made the stakes impossibly high and left little time to plan the complex operation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Ghost Soldiers&lt;/strong&gt; Hampton Sides vividly re-creates this daring raid, offering a minute-by-minute narration that unfolds alongside intimate portraits of the prisoners and their lives in the camp. Sides shows how the POWs banded together to survive, defying the Japanese authorities even as they endured starvation, tropical diseases, and torture. Harrowing, poignant, and inspiring, &lt;strong&gt;Ghost Soldiers&lt;/strong&gt; is the mesmerizing story of a remarkable mission. It is also a testament to the human spirit, an account of enormous bravery and self-sacrifice amid the most trying conditions.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Blood and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“Kit Carson’s role in the conquest of the Navajo during and after the Civil War remains one of the most dramatic and significant episodes in the history of the American West. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hampton Sides portrays Carson in the larger context of the conquest of the entire West, including his frequent and often lethal encounters with hostile Native Americans. Unusually, Sides gives full voice to Indian leaders themselves about their trials and tribulations in their dealings with the whites. Here is a national hero on the level of Daniel Boone, presented with all of his flaws and virtues, in the context of American people’s belief that it was their Manifest Destiny to occupy the entire West.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—Howard Lamar, Sterling Professor Emeritus of History, Yale University and editor of The New Encyclopedia of the American West&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The story of the American West has seldom been told with such intimacy and immediacy. Legendary figures like Kit Carson leap to life and history moves at a pulse-pounding pace—sweeping the reader along with it. Hampton Sides is a terrific storyteller.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—Candice Millard, author of &lt;em&gt;The River of Doubt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hampton Sides doesn't just write a book, he transports the reader to another time and place. With his keen sense of drama and his crackling writing style, this master storyteller has bequeathed us a majestic history of the Old West.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—James Bradley, author of &lt;em&gt;Flags of Our Fathers&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Flyboys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Blood and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; is a big-hearted book whose subject is as expansive as they come. Hampton Sides tackles it with naked pleasure and narrative cunning: In his telling, the vast saga of America’s westward push has a logical center. The dusty town of Santa Fe becomes the nexus around which swirl the fortunes and strategies of a mixed set of serious overachievers, from Kit Carson, the original mountain man, to James K. Polk, the enigmatic president whose achievements, in the dreaded name of Manifest Destiny, were almost biblical in scope. Sides is alive to the exuberance and alert to the tragedy of the taking of the West.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—Russell Shorto, author of &lt;em&gt;Island at the Center of the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For a huge percentage of us immigrant Americans (those whose ancestors arrived after 1492), Hampton Sides fills a gaping hole in our knowledge of American history—a vivid account of how ‘The New Men’ swept away the thriving civilizations of the Native Americans in their conquest of the West.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;—Tony Hillerman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"BLOOD AND THUNDER is a balanced, thoughtful summary of the American conquistadors in the 19th century Southwest. Hampton Sides has re-created violent events and such inflammatory figures as Kit Carson without bias. Carefully researched, thoroughly enjoyable."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Evan S. Connell, author of SON OF THE MORNING STAR, CUSTER AND THE LITTLE BIGHORN&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Magnificent History of How the West Was Really Won—a Sweeping Tale of Shame and Glory&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the fall of 1846 the venerable Navajo warrior Narbona, greatest of his people’s chieftains, looked down upon the small town of Santa Fe, the stronghold of the Mexican settlers he had been fighting his whole long life. He had come to see if the rumors were true—if an army of blue-suited soldiers had swept in from the East and utterly defeated his ancestral enemies. As Narbona gazed down on the battlements and cannons of a mighty fort the invaders had built, he realized his foes had been vanquished—but what did the arrival of these “New Men” portend for the Navajo?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Narbona could not have known that “The Army of the West,” in the midst of the longest march in American military history, was merely the vanguard of an inexorable tide fueled by a self-righteous ideology now known as “Manifest Destiny.” For twenty years the Navajo, elusive lords of a huge swath of mountainous desert and pasturelands, would ferociously resist the flood of soldiers and settlers who wished to change their ancient way of life or destroy them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hampton Sides’s extraordinary book brings the history of the American conquest of the West to ringing life. It is a tale with many heroes and villains, but as is found in the best history, the same person might be both. At the center of it all stands the remarkable figure of Kit Carson—the legendary trapper, scout, and soldier who embodies all the contradictions and ambiguities of the American experience in the West. Brave and clever, beloved by his contemporaries, Carson was an illiterate mountain man who twice married Indian women and understood and respected the tribes better than any other American alive. Yet he was also a cold-blooded killer who willingly followed orders tantamount to massacre. Carson’s almost unimaginable exploits made him a household name when they were written up in pulp novels known as “blood-and-thunders,” but now that name is a bitter curse for contemporary Navajo, who cannot forget his role in the travails of their ancestors.</description>

  <description>Ghosts, devils, grave-robbers, killers, lovers, pirates, and dead Rock-and-Rollers. These are only some of the inhabitants of Jason Phillip Reeser's short story collection Cities of the Dead. Each of these thirteen stories is set in one of the many above-ground cemeteries in New Orleans where the dead refuse to be buried. Not every story has a ghost, but every story is haunted by the inevitable ghosts that lurk in the shadows terrorizing our darkest corners: regret, guilt, fear, obsession, despair, failure, and loneliness.</description>

  <description>A comedy of manners and sexual identity by Henry Blake Fuller (1857-1929), who was compared with Henry James because of his irony and wit. When first published in 1919, its recognition of sexual complexity alarmed reviewers and readers. Reissued a few years ago, it was called an American classic. "Entertaining. . . eminently readable, distinguished by beautifully evoked period atmosphere and sly humor.”—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With penetrating insights for today, this vital history of the world economic collapse of the late 1920s offers unforgettable portraits of the four men whose personal and professional actions as heads of their respective central banks changed the course of the twentieth century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is commonly believed that the Great Depression that began in 1929 resulted from a confluence of events beyond any one person?s or government?s control. In fact, as Liaquat Ahamed reveals, it was the decisions taken by a small number of central bankers that were the primary cause of the economic meltdown, the effects of which set the stage for World War II and reverberated for decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Lords of Finance&lt;/em&gt;, we meet the neurotic and enigmatic Montagu Norman of the Bank of England, the xenophobic and suspicious Émile Moreau of the Banque de France, the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank, and Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whose façade of energy and drive masked a deeply wounded and overburdened man. After the First World War, these central bankers attempted to reconstruct the world of international finance. Despite their differences, they were united by a common fear?that the greatest threat to capitalism was inflation? and by a common vision that the solution was to turn back the clock and return the world to the gold standard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For a brief period in the mid-1920s they appeared to have succeeded. The world?s currencies were stabilized and capital began flowing freely across the globe. But beneath the veneer of boom-town prosperity, cracks started to appear in the financial system. The gold standard that all had believed would provide an umbrella of stability proved to be a straitjacket, and the world economy began that terrible downward spiral known as the Great Depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As yet another period of economic turmoil makes headlines today, the Great Depression and the year 1929 remain the benchmark for true financial mayhem. Offering a new understanding of the global nature of financial crises, &lt;em&gt;Lords of Finance&lt;/em&gt; is a potent reminder of the enormous impact that the decisions of central bankers can have, of their fallibility, and of the terrible human consequences that can result when they are wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>If Jason and Jennifer Reeser were going to indulge their life-long fantasy of visiting Paris, they weren't going to play by the rules; no hotels, no guided tours, and none of those four-day-and-three-night packages. They would live in the City of Light as if they belonged. Setting aside two weeks in April, they ignored the experts and set out to find a Room With Paris View.&lt;br&gt; "When you first encounter a city or a woman or a good book, you learn more about them, and fall in love with them the more you discover, but you will never quite match that moment when you first encountered them, knowing you had found something extraordinary and realizing how exciting it would be to explore the city or hold the woman in your arms or read the book to its very last page." —excerpt from Room With Paris View</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A tragic act of violence echoes through a small Minnesota town&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set on the Minnesota prairie in the late 1980s during a drought season that’s pushing family farms to the brink, &lt;em&gt;Little Wolves&lt;/em&gt; features the intertwining stories of a father searching for answers after his son commits a heinous murder, and a pastor’s wife (and washed-out scholar of early Anglo-Saxon literature) who has returned to the town for mysterious reasons of her own. A penetrating look at small-town America from the award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Night Birds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Little Wolves&lt;/em&gt; weaves together elements of folklore and Norse mythology while being driven by a powerful murder mystery; a page-turning literary triumph.</description>

  <description>Although Anais Nin found in her diaries a profound mode of self-creation and confession, she could not reveal this intimate record of her own experiences during her lifetime. Instead, she turned to fiction, where her stories and novels became artistic "distillations" of her secret diaries. A Spy in the House of Love, whose heroine Sabina is deeply divided between her drive for artistic and sexual expression, on the one hand, and social restrictions and self-created inhibitions, on the other, echoed Nin's personal struggle with sex, love, and emotional fragmentation. Written when Nin's own life was taut with conflicting loyalties, her protagonist Sabina repeatedly asks herself, can one indulge in one's sensual restlessness, the fantasies, the relentless need for adventure without devastating consequences?</description>

  <description>The Age of Kings is dead . . . and I have killed it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a bloody business overthrowing a king...&lt;br&gt;Field Marshal Tamas' coup against his king sent corrupt aristocrats to the guillotine and brought bread to the starving. But it also provoked war with the Nine Nations, internal attacks by royalist fanatics, and the greedy to scramble for money and power by Tamas's supposed allies: the Church, workers unions, and mercenary forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stretched to his limit, Tamas is relying heavily on his few remaining powder mages, including the embittered Taniel, a brilliant marksman who also happens to be his estranged son, and Adamat, a retired police inspector whose loyalty is being tested by blackmail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when gods are involved...&lt;br&gt;Now, as attacks batter them from within and without, the credulous are whispering about omens of death and destruction. Just old peasant legends about the gods waking to walk the earth. No modern educated man believes that sort of thing. But they should...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a rich, distinctive world that mixes magic with technology, who could stand against mages that control gunpowder and bullets? PROMISE OF BLOOD is the start of a new epic fantasy series from Brian McClellan.</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Despite a law banning him from performing surgery, Ravic--a German doctor and refugee living in Paris--has been treating some of the city's most elite citizens for two years on the behalf of two less-than-skillful French physicians.&lt;br&gt;Forbidden to return to his own country, and dodging the everyday dangers of jail and deportation, Ravic manages to hang on--all the while searching for the Nazi who tortured him back in Germany. And though he's given up on the possibility of love, life has a curious way of taking a turn for the romantic, even during the worst of times.</description>

  <description>This book recountsthe horror of World War II on the eastern front, as seen through the eyes of a teenaged German soldier. At first an exciting adventure, young Guy Sajer s war becomes, as the German invasion falters in the icy vastness of the Ukraine, a simple, desperate struggle for survival against cold, hunger, and above all the terrifying Soviet artillery. As a member of the elite Gross Deutschland Division, he fought in all the great battles from Kursk to Kharkov.His German footsoldier s perspective makes "The Forgotten Soldier" a unique war memoir, the book that the "Christian Science Monitor" said "may well be the book about World War II which has been so long awaited." Now it has been handsomely republished as a hardcover containing fifty rare German combat photos of life and death at the eastern front. The photos of troops battling through snow, mud, burned villages, and rubble-strewn cities depict the hardships and destructiveness of war. Many are originally from the private collections of German soldiers and have never been published before. This volume is a deluxe edition of a true classic.</description>

  <description>Stefan Zweig (1881–1942) was a poet, novelist, and dramatist, but it was his biographies that expressed his full genius, recreating for his international audience the Elizabethan age, the French Revolution, the great days of voyages and discoveries. In this autobiography he holds the mirror up to his own age, telling the story of a generation that "was loaded down with a burden of fate as was hardly any other in the course of history." Zweig attracted to himself the best minds and loftiest souls of his era: Freud, Yeats, Borgese, Pirandello, Gorky, Ravel, Joyce, Toscanini, Jane Addams, Anatole France, and Romain Rolland are but a few of the friends he writes about.</description>

  <description>Published to international critical and popular acclaim, this intensely romantic yet stunningly realistic novel spans three generations and the unimaginable gulf between the First World War and the present. As the young Englishman Stephen Wraysford passes through a tempestuous love affair with Isabelle Azaire in France and enters the dark, surreal world beneath the trenches of No Man's Land, Sebastian Faulks creates a world of fiction that is as tragic as &lt;strong&gt;A Farewell to Arms&lt;/strong&gt; and as sensuous as &lt;strong&gt;The English Patient&lt;/strong&gt;. Crafted from the ruins of war and the indestructibility of love, &lt;strong&gt;Birdsong&lt;/strong&gt; is a novel that will be read and marveled at for years to come.</description>

  <description>Viking marauders descend on a much-plundered island, hoping some mayhem will shake off the winter blahs. A man is booted out of his home after his wife discovers that the print of a bare foot on the inside of his windshield doesn’t match her own. Teenage cousins, drugged by summer, meet with a reckoning in the woods. A boy runs off to the carnival after his stepfather bites him in a brawl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the stories of Wells Tower, families fall apart and messily try to reassemble themselves. His version of America is touched with the seamy splendor of the dropout, the misfit: failed inventors, boozy dreamers, hapless fathers, wayward sons. Combining electric prose with savage wit, &lt;em&gt;Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned&lt;/em&gt; is a major debut, announcing a voice we have not heard before.</description>

  <description>This retelling of the ancient &lt;em&gt;Saga of the People of Eyri&lt;/em&gt; is a modern classic. Absolutely gripping and compulsively readable, &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; said this book, "does what good historical fiction is supposed to do: put a face on history that is recognizable to all." And medieval expert Tom Shippey, writing for the &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt; said, "Sagas look like novels superficially, in their size and layout and plain language, but making their narratives into novels is a trick which has proved beyond most who have tried it. Janoda's &lt;em&gt;Saga&lt;/em&gt; provides a model of how to do it: pick out the hidden currents, imagine how they would seem to peripheral characters, and as with all historical novels, load the narrative with period detail drawn from the scholars. No better saga adaptation has been yet written."</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Saga of Eric Brighteyes&lt;/em&gt; is the title of an epic Viking novel by H. Rider Haggard, and concerns the adventures of its eponymous principal character in 10th century Iceland. The novel was first published in 1890 by Longmans, Green &amp;amp; Company. It was illustrated by Lancelot Speed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric Thorgrimursson (nicknamed "Brighteyes" for his most notable trait), strives to win the hand of his beloved, Gudruda the Fair. Her father Asmund, a priest of the old Norse gods, opposes the match, thinking Eric a man without prospects. But deadlier by far are the intrigues of Swanhild, Gudruda's half-sister and a sorceress who desires Eric for herself. She persuades the chieftain Ospakar Blacktooth to woo Gudrida, making the two men enemies. Battles, intrigues, and treachery follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novel was an early example (and Haggard's introduction implies it was the first) of modern efforts in English at pastiching Viking saga literature. It clearly shows the influence of the pioneering saga translations by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson in the late 1860s. While it is perhaps not quite a match for Frans Gunnar Bengtsson's genre-defining 1941 novel &lt;em&gt;Röde Orm&lt;/em&gt; (later expanded and better known as &lt;em&gt;The Long Ships&lt;/em&gt;), Bengtsson had the advantage of being culturally closer to his sources. For saga pastiches originating in English, &lt;em&gt;Eric Brighteyes&lt;/em&gt; set a standard of quality and fidelity to the saga style that remained unmatched until Poul Anderson's novel &lt;em&gt;The Broken Sword&lt;/em&gt;, sixty years later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A curious effect of Haggard's successful emulation of the terse, pithy style of saga prose is that the idiom of this novel actually seems rather less dated in the early 21st century than Haggard's other work or the general run of Victorian adventure fiction. Improvements in our understanding of the Viking period have done surprisingly little to falsify Haggard's imagination of its setting, and the book should still hold appeal to any reader interested in the period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its significance was recognized by its republication by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the second volume of the celebrated &lt;em&gt;Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library&lt;/em&gt; series in March, 1974.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Napoleon of Notting Hill&lt;/em&gt; is G. K. Chesterton's first novel. Published in 1904, it is set at the end of the twentieth century. London is still a city of gas lamps and horse-drawn vehicles, but democratic government has withered away, and a representative ordinary citizen is simply chosen for a list to be king.</description>

  <description>Faithful Shadow takes you beyond the splendor of nature to the terror that lies beneath, one that should have never been discovered. Yellowstone is suffering from the largest forest fire in the park's history. Ranger JOE RAND, once passionate about nature and now drowning in alcohol after the recent death of his son, notices something is very wrong within Yellowstone after a string of disappearances. But when a fireman is found dead in the Old Faithful Inn after falling into a hole earlier that day, his body mauled and deprived of all its fluids, Joe knows he has no choice but to set down his flask and investigate. Joe and Lieutenant DALE CAFFEY of the Billings Fire Department go into the woods to search the hole the fireman had fallen into. They discover a series of tunnels lined with bones, the air thick with smoke. Joe and Dale conclude that the creature that had killed the fireman had left its subterranean dwelling to flee the overwhelming smoke from the fire above. The creature takes shelter inside the Inn, concealing itself within the darkened crevices, emerging to feast on passersby. After staging an evacuation of the park, they lock themselves inside the Inn to hunt the creature. After just a short while it becomes frighteningly clear that it is, in fact, the creature that is hunting them.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;In me are the memories of a boy's life, spent in that realm of enchantments. These are the things I want to tell you.... &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Robert McCammon delivers "a tour de force of storytelling" (&lt;em&gt;BookPage&lt;/em&gt;) in his award-winning masterpiece, a novel of Southern boyhood, growing up in the 1960s, that reaches far beyond that evocative landscape to touch readers universally. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boy's Life&lt;/em&gt; is a richly imagined, spellbinding portrait of the magical worldview of the young -- and of innocence lost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Zephyr, Alabama, is an idyllic hometown for eleven-year-old Cory Mackenson -- a place where monsters swim the river deep and friends are forever. Then, one cold spring morning, Cory and his father witness a car plunge into a lake -- and a desperate rescue attempt brings his father face-to-face with a terrible, haunting vision of death. As Cory struggles to understand his father's pain, his eyes are slowly opened to the forces of good and evil that surround him. From an ancient mystic who can hear the dead and bewitch the living, to a violent clan of moonshiners, Cory must confront the secrets that hide in the shadows of his hometown -- for his father's sanity and his own life hang in the balance....</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;'Mr Vanstone's daughters are Nobody's Children'.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magdalen Vanstone and her sister Norah learn the true meaning of social stigma in Victorian England only after the traumatic discovery that their dearly loved parents, whose sudden deaths have left them orphans, were not married at the time of their birth. Disinherited by law and brutally ousted from Combe-Raven, the idyllic country estate which has been their peaceful home since childhood, the two young women are left to fend for themselves. While the submissive Norah follows a path of duty and hardship as a governess, her high-spirited and rebellious younger sister has made other decisions. Determined to regain her rightful inheritance at any cost, Magdalen uses her unconventional beauty and dramatic talent in recklessly pursuing her revenge. Aided by the audacious swindler Captain Wragge, she braves a series of trials leading up to the climactic test: can she trade herself in marriage to the man she loathes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in the early 1860s, between &lt;em&gt;The Woman in White&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Moonstone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Name&lt;/em&gt; was rejected as immoral by critics of its time, but is today regarded as a novel of outstanding social insight, showing Collins at the height of his powers.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From the first-edition dust jacket (1923):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;In full agreement with George Barrow's remark that "nobody would call a book a novel if he could call it anything else," Mr. Van Vechten prefers to describe this work, the action of which passes in New York, 1922, and the hero of which is the god Eros, as "a cartoon for a stained-glass window." He begs his readers to imagine the attitudes of his characters, now sketched rudely in black and white, as they will appear when clothed in their final brilliant and luminous colors. The book is not "romantic" or "realistic" or "life" or "art." Assuredly it is not "fantasy" or "satire." The author has sworn before a notary public that his only purpose in creating THE BLIND BOW-BOY was to &lt;em&gt;amuse&lt;/em&gt;. Readers, therefore, are especially warned against the danger of comparing this work with other books, written, apparently, in a somewhat different form, for it should be obvious that no purpose, beyond that just noted, actuated its construction, and no ideas are concealed beneath its surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novel begins: "Harold Prewett sat in the broad, black-walnut seat of an ambiguous piece of furniture which branched above, in spreading antlers, into a rack for coats and hats and which below, at either side, provided means for the disposition of canes and umbrellas. The mere presence of these heavy, sullen antlers was sufficiently dispiriting to increase the gloomy atmosphere which environed the young man. The room in which he sat waiting was a hallway."</description>

  <description>Dev is a smuggler with the perfect cover. He's in high demand as a guide for the caravans that carry legitimate goods from the city of Ninavel into the country of Alathia. The route through the Whitefire Mountains is treacherous, and Dev is one of the few climbers who knows how to cross them safely. With his skill and connections, it's easy enough to slip contraband charms from Ninavel - where any magic is fair game, no matter how dark - into Alathia, where most magic is outlawed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But smuggling a few charms is one thing; smuggling a person through the warded Alathian border is near suicidal. Having made a promise to a dying friend, Dev is forced to take on a singularly dangerous cargo: Kiran. A young apprentice on the run from one of the most powerful mages in Ninavel, Kiran is desperate enough to pay a fortune to sneak into a country where discovery means certain execution - and he'll do whatever it takes to prevent Dev from finding out the terrible truth behind his getaway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Kiran isn't the only one harboring a deadly secret. Caught up in a web of subterfuge and dark magic, Dev and Kiran must find a way to trust each other - or face not only their own destruction, but that of the entire city of Ninavel.</description>

  <description>When Adam Wolf retires from a killer career (one that Uncle Sam would deny existed) and resurrects himself as an author of young adult books, he soon discovers that no way in hell is the pen mightier than the sword; not when the mob slaps a verbal contract on your head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moments after reluctantly snuffing his 60th birthday candle, Wolf witnesses the snuffing of an ace crime reporter. Wolf's decision to testify against the shooter puts him, and the only woman he’s ever let close enough to imperil, in the crosshairs of a ruthless crime family and their outlaw biker hit men. The one problem his hunters didn’t count on is that their target is no ordinary senior citizen. Wolf is a black ops vet with a bloody backstory he can never tell. A shadow man who knows that at the end of the day…covert actions speak louder than words.</description>

  <description>In 1836 in East Texas, nine-year-old Cynthia Ann Parker was kidnapped by Comanches. She was raised by the tribe and eventually became the wife of a warrior. Twenty-four years after her capture, she was reclaimed by the U.S. cavalry and Texas Rangers and restored to her white family, to die in misery and obscurity. Cynthia Ann's story has been told and re-told over generations to become a foundational American tale. The myth gave rise to operas and one-act plays, and in the 1950s to a novel by Alan LeMay, which would be adapted into one of Hollywood's most legendary films, &lt;em&gt;The Searchers&lt;/em&gt;, "The Biggest, Roughest, Toughest... and Most Beautiful Picture Ever Made!" directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne. &lt;br&gt;Glenn Frankel, beginning in Hollywood and then returning to the origins of the story, creates a rich and nuanced anatomy of a timeless film and a quintessentially American myth. The dominant story that has emerged departs dramatically from documented history: it is of the inevitable triumph of white civilization, underpinned by anxiety about the sullying of white women by "savages." What makes John Ford's film so powerful, and so important, Frankel argues, is that it both upholds that myth and undermines it, baring the ambiguities surrounding race, sexuality, and violence in the settling of the West and the making of America.</description>

  <description>Boston, 1926. The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prohibition has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one--neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover--can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death. But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to the hilt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the sizzling streets of Cuba. Live by Night is a riveting epic layered with a diverse cast of loyal friends and callous enemies, tough rumrunners and sultry femmes fatales, Bible-quoting evangelists and cruel Klansmen, all battling for survival and their piece of the American dream. At once a sweeping love story and a compelling saga of revenge, it is a spellbinding tour de force of betrayal and redemption, music and murder, that brings fully to life a bygone era when sin was cause for celebration and vice was a national virtue.</description>

  <description>Set in Boston at the end of the First World War, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling author Dennis Lehane's long-awaited eighth novel unflinchingly captures the political and social unrest of a nation caught at the crossroads between past and future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Given Day&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of two families—one black, one white—swept up in a maelstrom of revolutionaries and anarchists, immigrants and ward bosses, Brahmins and ordinary citizens, all engaged in a battle for survival and power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beat cop Danny Coughlin, the son of one of the city's most beloved and powerful police captains, joins a burgeoning union movement and the hunt for violent radicals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luther Laurence, on the run after a deadly confrontation with a crime boss in Tulsa, works for the Coughlin family and tries desperately to find his way home to his pregnant wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, too, are some of the most influential figures of the era—Babe Ruth; Eugene O'Neill; leftist activist Jack Reed; NAACP founder W. E. B. DuBois; Mitchell Palmer, Woodrow Wilson's ruthless Red-chasing attorney general; cunning Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge; and an ambitious young Department of Justice lawyer named John Hoover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coursing through some of the pivotal events of the time—including the Spanish Influenza pandemic—and culminating in the Boston Police Strike of 1919, &lt;em&gt;The Given Day&lt;/em&gt; explores the crippling violence and irrepressible exuberance of a country at war with, and in the thrall of, itself. As Danny, Luther, and those around them struggle to define themselves in increasingly turbulent times, they gradually find family in one another and, together, ride a rising storm of hardship, deprivation, and hope that will change all their lives.</description>

  <description>**2013 Edgar Awards nominee in Critical/Biographical**&lt;br&gt;**2013 Anthony Award nominee in Best Critical Nonfiction**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join award-winning mystery editor Otto Penzler and a first-rate lineup of mystery writers as they go in pursuit of Spenser and the man who created him, Robert B. Parker. These are the writers who knew Parker best professionally and personally, sharing memories of the man, reflections on his impact on the genre, and insights into what makes Spenser so beloved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ace Atkins&lt;/strong&gt;, the author chosen to take up Parker’s pen and continue the Spenser series, relates the formative impact Spenser had on him as a young man; gourmet cook &lt;strong&gt;Lyndsay Faye&lt;/strong&gt; describes the pleasures of Spenser’s dinner table; &lt;strong&gt;Lawrence Block&lt;/strong&gt; explains the irresistibility of Parker’s literary voice; and more. &lt;em&gt;In Pursuit of Spenser&lt;/em&gt; pays tribute to Spenser, and Parker, with affection, humor, and a deep appreciation for what both have left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Includes a reprinted piece on Spenser from Robert B. Parker&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ace Atkins&lt;br&gt;Lawrence Block&lt;br&gt;Reed Farrel Coleman&lt;br&gt;Max Allan Collins&lt;br&gt;Matthew Clemens&lt;br&gt;Brendan DuBois&lt;br&gt;Loren D.

  <description>Tautly narrated and excruciatingly suspenseful, &lt;strong&gt;Double Indemnity&lt;/strong&gt; gives us an X-ray view of guilt, of duplicity, and of the kind of obsessive, loveless love that devastates everything it touches. First published in 1935, this novel reaffirmed James M. Cain as a virtuoso of the &lt;em&gt;roman noir&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>Nearly six hundred years ago, a short, genial, cannily alert man in his late thirties took a very old manuscript off a library shelf, saw with excitement what he had discovered, and ordered that it be copied. That book was the last surviving manuscript of an ancient Roman philosophical epic, &lt;em&gt;On the Nature of Things&lt;/em&gt;, by Lucretius—a beautiful poem of the most dangerous ideas: that the universe functioned without the aid of gods, that religious fear was damaging to human life, and that matter was made up of very small particles in eternal motion, colliding and swerving in new directions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The copying and translation of this ancient book—the greatest discovery of the greatest book-hunter of his age—fueled the Renaissance, inspiring artists such as Botticelli and thinkers such as Giordano Bruno; shaped the thought of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Road to Perdition&lt;/em&gt;, an explosive novel unraveling the conspiracy to murder immortal screen icon Marilyn Monroe&lt;/strong&gt;It’s 1962, and Twentieth Century Fox is threatening to fire Marilyn Monroe. The blond goddess hires Nate Heller, private eye to the stars, to tap her phone so she will have a record of their calls in case they take her to court. When Heller starts listening, he uncovers far more than nasty conversations. The CIA, the FBI, the Mafia—even the Russians—are involved in actions focused on Marilyn. She’s the quintessential American cultural icon, idolized by women, desired by men, but her private life is... complicated...and her connection to the Kennedys makes her an object of interest to some parties with sinister intentions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not long after Heller signs on, Marilyn winds up dead of a convenient overdose. The detective feels he owes her, and the Kennedys, with whom he busted up corrupt unions in the 1950s. But now, as Heller investigates all possible people—famous, infamous, or deeply cloaked—who might be responsible for Marilyn’s death, he realizes that what has become his most challenging assignment may also be the end of him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PI Nathan Heller returns in his first new novel in a decade, as Max Allan Collins brings to life a vivid star-studded cast, from JFK and RFK to Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford, from Jimmy Hoffa and Joe DiMaggio to Hugh Hefner and Sam Giancana. &lt;em&gt;Bye Bye, Baby &lt;/em&gt;is a Hollywood tale you never thought could happen…but probably did.</description>

  <description>Addy Hanlon has always been Beth Cassidy's best friend and trusted lieutenant. Beth calls the shots and Addy carries them out, a long-established order of things that has brought them to the pinnacle of their high-school careers. Now they're seniors who rule the intensely competitive cheer squad, feared and followed by the other girls -- until the young new coach arrives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cool and commanding, an emissary from the adult world just beyond their reach, Coach Colette French draws Addy and the other cheerleaders into her life. Only Beth, unsettled by the new regime, remains outside Coach's golden circle, waging a subtle but vicious campaign to regain her position as "top girl" -- both with the team and with Addy herself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a suicide focuses a police investigation on Coach and her squad. After the first wave of shock and grief, Addy tries to uncover the truth behind the death -- and learns that the boundary between loyalty and love can be dangerous terrain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The raw passions of girlhood are brought to life in this taut, unflinching exploration of friendship, ambition, and power. Award-winning novelist Megan Abbott, writing with what Tom Perrotta has hailed as "total authority and an almost desperate intensity," provides a harrowing glimpse into the dark heart of the all-American girl.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The shocking techno-thriller that cements Daniel Suarez’s status as the heir to Michael Crichton and Tom Clancy—a terrifying, breathtaking, and all-too-plausible vision of the world’s near future&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Unmanned weaponized drones already exist—they’re widely used by America in our war efforts in the Middle East. In &lt;em&gt;Kill Decision&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Daniel Suarez takes that fact and the real science behind it one step further, with frightening results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Linda McKinney is a myrmecologist, a scientist who studies the social structure of ants. Her academic career has left her entirely unprepared for the day her sophisticated research is conscripted by unknown forces to help run an unmanned—and thanks to her research, automated—drone army. Odin is the secretive Special Ops soldier with a unique insight into the faceless enemy who has begun to attack the American homeland with drones programmed to seek, identify, and execute targets without human intervention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Together, McKinney and Odin must slow this advance long enough for the world to recognize its destructive power, because for thousands of years the “kill decision” during battle has remained in the hands of humans—and off-loading that responsibility to machines will bring unintended, possibly irreversible, consequences. But as forces even McKinney and Odin don’t understand begin to gather, and death rains down from above, it may already be too late to save humankind from destruction at the hands of our own technology.</description>

  <description>Jack Veeder is dying. Soon. And that impending event brings his son Jimmy back to the Imperial Valley of southern California just north of the Calexico/Mexicali border. Jimmy hopes he can spend what time his father has left laughing and reminiscing. But Jack's got one dying request. He needs Jimmy to find a Mexican prostitute named Yolanda. Enlisting the help of his boyhood friend Bobby Maves, the pair stumbles through the violent, the exploited, and the corrupted of Mexicali. It doesn't take long before they?re in over their heads. And as Jimmy tries to survive the dangers of the Mexicali underworld, he unwittingly uncovers truths about his father he never imagined, forcing Jimmy to come to terms with the man he thought he knew, and to decide just what sort of man he wants to become. [Johnny Shaw] is excellent at creating a sense of place with a few deft strokes... he moves effortlessly between dark comedy and moments that pack a real emotional punch, and he's got a knack for off-kilter characters who are completely at home in their own personal corners of oddballdom.? ?

  <description>Iron Man. Thor. Captain America. The Wasp. Giant-Man. They are the world's newest heroes, brought together by the U.S. government to combat the world's growing wave of superhuman threats. But just because they have amazing powers doesn't also mean they don't have the inner problems that strike at us all. After the Hulk has rampaged through New York City, it's member against member as infighting among the Ultimates begins. With the city in ruins and immediate danger ahead, can they pull together to face their greatest threat yet?</description>

  <description>Super-hero school is in session! The world's No. 1 peacekeeping organization, S.H.I.E.L.D., is fed up with Spider-Man - specifically, the millions of dollars spent cleaning up his collateral damage. But instead of throwing the teenaged web-slinger in jail, they've settled on a far worse punishment: after-school super-hero training, courtesy of the Ultimates! While Spider-Man takes notes from his first tutor - his idol, Iron Man - Mysterio and the Black Cat vie for possession of a mysterious artifact from the archives of the former Kingpin of Crime. Can even Spider-Man and Iron Man, working together, contain the object's unimaginable power? Collecting ULTIMATE COMICS SPIDER-MAN (2009) #15 and #150-155</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The Oakland Athletics have a secret: a winning baseball team is made, not bought.In major league baseball the biggest wallet is supposed to win: rich teams spend four times as much on talent as poor teams. But over the past four years, the Oakland Athletics, a major league team with a minor league payroll, have had one of the best records. Last year their superstar, Jason Giambi, went to the superrich Yankees. It hasn't made any difference to Oakland: their fabulous season included an American League record for consecutive victories. Billy Beane, general manager of the Athletics, is putting into practice on the field revolutionary principles garnered from geek statisticians and college professors. Michael Lewis's brilliant, irreverent reporting takes us from the dugouts and locker rooms-where coaches and players struggle to unlearn most of what they know about pitching and hitting-to the boardrooms, where we meet owners who begin to look like fools at the poker table, spending enormous sums without a clue what they are doing. Combine money, science, entertainment, and egos, and you have a story that Michael Lewis is magnificently suited to tell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author of the bestsellers Liar's Poker, The New New Thing, and Next, Michael Lewis is also a columnist for Bloomberg News. He lives in Berkeley, California.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In Savages, Don Winslow introduced Ben and Chon, twenty-something best friends who risk everything to save the girl they both love, O. Among the most celebrated thrillers in recent memory—and now a major motion picture directed by Academy Award–winning filmmaker Oliver Stone—Savages was picked as a best book of the year by Stephen King in Entertainment Weekly, Janet Maslin in The New York Times, and Sarah Weinman in the Los Angeles Times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in this high-octane prequel, Winslow reaches back in time to tell the story of how Ben, Chon, and O became the people they are. Spanning from 1960s Southern California to the recent past, The Kings of Cool is a breathtakingly original saga of family in all its forms—fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, friends and lovers. As the trio at the center of the book does battle with a cabal of drug dealers and crooked cops, they come to learn that their future is inextricably linked with their parents’ history. A series of breakneck twists and turns puts the two generations on a collision course, culminating in a stunning showdown that will force Ben, Chon, and O to choose between their real families and their loyalty to one another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast-paced, provocative, and wickedly funny, The Kings of Cool is a spellbinding love story for our times from a master novelist at the height of his powers. It is filled with Winslow’s trademark talents—complex characters, sharp dialogue, blistering social commentary—that have earned him an obsessive following. The result is a book that will echo in your mind and heart long after you’ve turned the last page.</description>

Now <strong>THIS</strong> is how you do a prequel!<br /><br />Don Winslow’s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/107573144">Savages</a> instantly became one of my favorite crime novels, and I was a little worried about him doing another one that takes place before it.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Rage in Harlem&lt;/em&gt; is a ripping introduction to Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, patrolling New York City’s roughest streets in Chester Himes’s groundbreaking Harlem Detectives series. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For love of fine, wily Imabelle, hapless Jackson surrenders his life savings to a con man who knows the secret of turning ten-dollar bills into hundreds—and then he steals from his boss, only to lose the stolen money at a craps table. Luckily for him, he can turn to his savvy twin brother, Goldy, who earns a living—disguised as a Sister of Mercy—by selling tickets to Heaven in Harlem.  With Goldy on his side, Jackson is ready for payback.</description>

  <description>Hi. I see you're reading the back of my book. This tells me that you either:&lt;br&gt;A) are hoping to find a brief summary of what to expect from a how-to book by Sterling Archer, the world's greatest secret agent, or B) don't know how books work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If your answer was "A," your best bet is probably the table of contents, which is where you'll find the "contents" of this book listened in a convenient, easy-to-read "table" format. So maybe go check that out for a minute and then come back here. I'll wait...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pretty cool, right? What other book will teach you how to dress properly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how to drive an elephant? How to field strip an AK-47 properly &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how to haggle with a Thai prostitute--in her own native tongue? How to pilot an airboat &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how to make about a million delicious cocktails, including a Molotov one? How to kill a guy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how to prepare a fabulous brunch? Plus how to do tons of other stuff that I forgot, but that is nonetheless probably in this book (which, to be honest, I really only kinda skimmed). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So if you want to learn more about how to be more--or at all--like Sterling Archer, the world's greatest secret agent, quit smearing your greasy fingerprints all over this book and buy it. For one thing, I really need the royalties. For another thing, the last time I checked, this wasn't a damn library.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Note: If your answer was "B," this probably isn't the book you want to start with.)</description>

  <description>While trafficking in a bestselling sub-genre, AMERICAN VAMPIRE introduces a new strain of vampire — a more muscular and vicious species, born of the American West.It’s Las Vegas circa 1935, and Skinner Sweet and our gal Pearl are about to learn the hard way that the bloodsuckers in Hollywood were nothing compared to what awaits them in Sin City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In just a few short years, young police Chief Cash McCogan has watched his native city of Las Vegas go from cow-town to wild, glittering boomtown. And when the bodies of prominent businessmen start showing up drained of blood, Chief McCogan finds himself facing a threat much darker and deadlier than anything he could have imagined . . . and the only sure bet in town is that Skinner and Pearl are right in the thick of it.</description>

  <description>From Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;Narrator Jake Roedel is in his mid-teens when he joins the First Kansas Irregulars in 1861. During the next few years he sees, and commits, more than his share of Civil War atrocities. Most of the action takes place in Kansas and Missouri between the rebel Irregulars (bushwhackers) and the Union Jayhawkers, with some civilians caught in the crossfire. The studiedly cool Jake experiences loss (the deaths of his best friend, father and comrades) and love (the best friend's "widow"); he also learns about tolerance from his contact with a nobly reserved black Irregular. There's plenty of hard riding, drinking and shooting, most of it leading to bloodshed. Jake's loyalty to the "secesh" cause is unquestioning and doesn't quite gibe with his growing unease amid the gore, or with his departure in the midst of the war for Texas with wife and child. The prose is occasionally rather pretentious, but this is a generally enjoyable coming-of-age novel by the author of Under the Bright Lights. &lt;br&gt;Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following is description of the movie "Ride With the Devil."&lt;br&gt;Starring Skeet Ulrich, Tobey Maguire and recording artist Jewel, this major motion picture will be arriving in theaters April 16th. Set in the 1860s, in the last days of the Civil War, this is the coming-of-age story about the lawless universe of war as seen through the eyes of a young secessionist. Based on Woodrell's novel titled "Woe to Live On".</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Twelve timeless Ozarkian tales of those on the fringes of society, by a "stunningly original" (&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;) American master.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Woodrell is able to lend uncanny logic to harsh, even criminal behavior in this wrenching collection of stories. Desperation-both material and psychological--motivates his characters. A husband cruelly avenges the killing of his wife's pet; an injured rapist is cared for by a young girl, until she reaches her breaking point; a disturbed veteran of Iraq is murdered for his erratic behavior; an outsider's house is set on fire by an angry neighbor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also the tenderness and loyalty of the vulnerable in these stories--between spouses, parents and children, siblings, and comrades in arms-which brings the troubled, sorely tested cast of characters to vivid, relatable life. And, as ever, "the music coming from Woodrell's banjo cannot be confused with the sounds of any other writer" (Donald Harington, &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Journal Constitution&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>New York's a tough town. Hard to impress. Shrugs off hype, casts a cold eye on glitz. But once in a blue moon a killer with street smarts and a sense of theater will reach out and take the city by the throat. Maybe he'll write letters to a popular tabloid columnist, proclaiming himself the answer to a failed criminal justice system. Maybe he'll point a finger at the kind of villain the law can't touch. A child killer who got off on a technicality, say. A top mobster with decades of blood on his hands. A rabble-rouser who incites others to murder. Maybe he'll sign himself "Will, " as in "The Will of the People." Then suppose he takes aim at a respectable lawyer, a defense attorney with a roster of unpopular clients. Suppose the lawyer's a friend of Matt Scudder. Scudder is New York to the bone. He's as tough as the big town itself, as hard to impress. And now he's up against the self-styled Will of the People in a city with eight million ways to die, a city where not just the good guys but even the wicked get worse than they deserve.</description>

  <description>In this unforgettable work of fiction, Donald Ray Pollock peers into the soul of a tough Midwestern American town to reveal the sad, stunted but resilient lives of its residents. &lt;strong&gt;Knockemstiff &lt;/strong&gt;is a genuine entry into the literature of place.Spanning a period from the mid-sixties to the late nineties, the linked stories that comprise &lt;strong&gt;Knockemstiff &lt;/strong&gt;feature a cast of recurring characters who are irresistibly, undeniably real. A father pumps his son full of steroids so he can vicariously relive his days as a perpetual runner-up body builder. A psychotic rural recluse comes upon two siblings committing incest and feels compelled to take action. Donald Ray Pollock presents his characters and the sordid goings-on with a stern intelligence, a bracing absence of value judgments, and a refreshingly dark sense of bottom-dog humor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The time of reckoning has arrived. As a final genocidal Crusade threatens to enslave humanity forever, a new messiah has come of age. She is Aenea and she has undergone a strange apprenticeship to those known as the Others. Now her protector, Raul Endymion, one-time shepherd and convicted murderer, must help her deliver her startling message to her growing army of disciples. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But first they must embark on a final spectacular mission to discover the underlying meaning of the universe itself. They have been followed on their journey by the mysterious Shrike--monster, angel, killing machine--who is about to reveal the long-held secret of its origin and purpose. And on the planet of Hyperion, where the story first began, the final revelation will be delivered--an apocalyptic message that unlocks the secrets of existence and the fate of humankind in the galaxy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A ferocious debut that puts Frank Bill’s southern Indiana on the literary map next to Cormac McCarthy’s eastern Tennessee and Daniel Woodrell’s Missouri Ozarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C&lt;em&gt;rimes in Southern Indiana &lt;/em&gt;is the most blistering, vivid, flat-out fearless debut to plow into American literature in recent years. Frank Bill delivers what is both a wake-up call and a gut punch. Welcome to heartland America circa right about now, when the union jobs and family farms that kept the white on the picket fences have given way to meth labs, backwoods gunrunners, and bare-knuckle brawling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill’s people are pressed to the brink—and beyond. There is Scoot McCutchen, whose beloved wife falls terminally ill, leaving him with nothing to live for—which doesn’t quite explain why he brutally murders her and her doctor and flees, or why, after years of running, he decides to turn himself in. In the title story, a man who has devolved from breeding hounds for hunting to training them for dog-fighting crosses paths with a Salvadoran gangbanger tasked with taking over the rural drug trade, but who mostly wants to grow old in peace. As &lt;em&gt;Crimes in Sourthern Indiana &lt;/em&gt;unfolds, we witness the unspeakable, yet are compelled to find sympathy for the depraved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill’s southern Indiana is haunted with the deep, authentic sense of place that recalls the best of Southern fiction, but the interconnected stories bristle with the urban energy of a Chuck Palahniuk or a latter-day Nelson Algren and rush with the slam-bang plotting of pulp-noir crime writing à la Jim Thompson. Bill’s prose is gritty yet literary, shocking, and impossible to put down. A dark evocation of the survivalist spirit of the working class, this is a brilliant debut by an important new voice.</description>

  <description>When fourteen-year-old Mattie Sullivan asks Spenser to look into her mother’s murder, he’s not completely convinced by her claim that the police investigation four years ago was botched. Mattie is gruff, street-smart, and wise beyond her years, left to care for her younger siblings and an alcoholic grandmother in a dilapidated apartment in South Boston.  But her need for closure and her determination to make things right hit Spenser where he lives- they’re the very characteristics he abides by. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mattie believes the man convicted of the crime is innocent and points Spenser to the Southie toughs who she saw carrying her mother away hours before her murder. Neither the Boston PD nor the neighborhood thugs are keen on his dredging up the past, but as Spenser becomes more involved in the case, he starts to realize that Mattie may be onto something. Spenser will need Hawk’s help to find peace for Mattie – a job that’s more dangerous than he ever thought.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Knockemstiff&lt;/em&gt;—called “powerful, remarkable, exceptional” by the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;—comes a dark and riveting vision of America that delivers literary excitement in the highest degree. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Devil All the Time&lt;/em&gt;, Donald Ray Pollock has written a novel that marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stone’s &lt;em&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;/em&gt; with the religious and Gothic over­tones of Flannery O’Connor at her most haunting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, &lt;em&gt;The Devil All the Time&lt;/em&gt; follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s. There’s Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who can’t save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifi­cial blood he pours on his “prayer log.” There’s Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial kill­ers, who troll America’s highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. There’s the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte’s orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.</description>

  <description>“&lt;em&gt;Hearing the click behind him, Parker threw his glass straight back over his right shoulder, and dove off his chair to the left.&lt;/em&gt;” When a job looks like amateur hour, Parker walks away. But even a squad of seasoned professionals can't guarantee against human error in a high-risk scam. Can an art dealer with issues unload a truck of paintings with Parker’s aid? Or will the heist end up too much of a human interest story, as luck runs out before Parker can get in on the score?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Parker is refreshingly amoral, a thief who always gets away with the swag.”—Stephen King, &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.”—&lt;em&gt;Washington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The second of three high-energy thrillers arriving back-to-back from cult crime fiction sensation Duane Swierczynski.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Left for dead after an epic shootout that blew the lid off a billion-dollar conspiracy, ex-cop Charlie Hardie quickly realizes that when you're dealing with The Accident People, things can get worse. Drugged, bound and transported by strange operatives of unknown origin, Hardie awakens to find himself captive in a secret prison that houses the most dangerous criminals on earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then things get &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad. Because this isn't just any prison. It's a Kafkaesque nightmare that comes springloaded with a brutal catch-22: Hardie's the warden. And any attempt to escape triggers a "death mechanism" that will kill everyone down here--including a group of innocent guards. Faced with an unworkable paradox, and knowing that his wife and son could be next on the Accident People's hit list, Hardie has only one choice: fight his way to the heart of this hell hole and make a deal with the Devil himself.</description>

  <description>The agents at the IRS Regional Examination Center in Peoria, Illinois, appear ordinary enough to newly arrived trainee David Foster Wallace. But as he immerses himself in a routine so tedious and repetitive that new employees receive boredom-survival training, he learns of the extraordinary variety of personalities drawn to this strange calling. And he has arrived at a moment when forces within the IRS are plotting to eliminate even what little humanity and dignity the work still has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pale King&lt;/em&gt; remained unfinished at the time of David Foster Wallace's death, but it is a deeply compelling and satisfying novel, hilarious and fearless and as original as anything Wallace ever undertook. It grapples directly with ultimate questions--questions of life's meaning and of the value of work and society--through characters imagined with the interior force and generosity that were Wallace's unique gifts. Along the way it suggests a new idea of heroism and commands infinite respect for one of the most daring writers of our time.</description>

  <description>Recalling the moody violence of the early novels of Cormac McCarthy and Denis Johnson, a dark and visceral debut set along the seedy wastelands of Galveston by a young writer with a hard edge to his potent literary style. On the same day that Roy Cady is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he senses that his boss, a dangerous loan-sharking bar-owner, wants him dead. Known “without affection” to members of the boss’s crew as “Big Country” on account of his long hair, beard, and cowboy boots, Roy is alert to the possibility that a routine assignment could be a deathtrap. Which it is. Yet what the would-be killers do to Roy Cady is not the same as what he does to them, which is to say that after a smoking spasm of violence, they are mostly dead and he is mostly alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before Roy makes his getaway, he realizes there are two women in the apartment, one of them still breathing, and he sees something in her frightened, defiant eyes that causes a fateful decision. He takes her with him as he goes on the run from New Orleans to Galveston, Texas—an action as ill-advised as it is inescapable. The girl’s name is Rocky, and she is too young, too tough, too sexy—and far too much trouble. Roy, Rocky, and her sister hide in the battered seascape of Galveston’s country-western bars and fleabag hotels, a world of treacherous drifters, pickup trucks, and ashed-out hopes. Any chance that they will find safety there is soon lost. Rocky is a girl with quite a story to tell, one that will pursue and damage Roy for a very long time to come in this powerful and atmospheric thriller, impossible to put down. Constructed with maximum tension and haunting aftereffect, written in darkly beautiful prose, &lt;em&gt;Galveston &lt;/em&gt;announces the arrival of a major new literary talent.</description>

  <description>Spero Lucas has a new line of work. Since he returned home after serving in Iraq, he has been doing special investigations for a defense attorney. He's good at it, and he has carved out a niche: recovering stolen property, no questions asked. His cut is forty percent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A high-profile crime boss who has heard of Lucas's specialty hires him to find out who has been stealing from his operation. It's the biggest job Lucas has ever been offered, and he quickly gets a sense of what's going on. But before he can close in on what's been taken, he tangles with a world of men whose amorality and violence leave him reeling. Is any cut worth your family, your lover, your life? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spero Lucas is George Pelecanos's greatest creation, a young man making his place in the world one battle and one mission at a time. The first in a new series of thrillers featuring Spero Lucas, &lt;em&gt;The Cut&lt;/em&gt; is the latest confirmation of why George Pelecanos is "perhaps America's greatest living crime writer." (Stephen King)</description>

  <description>At Westish College, a small school on the shore of Lake Michigan, baseball star Henry Skrimshander seems destined for big league stardom. But when a routine throw goes disastrously off course, the fates of five people are upended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry’s fight against self-doubt threatens to ruin his future. College president Guert Affenlight, a longtime bachelor, has fallen unexpectedly and helplessly in love. Owen Dunne, Henry’s gay roommate and teammate, becomes caught up in a dangerous affair. Mike Schwartz, the Harpooners’ team captain and Henry’ best friend, realizes he has guided Henry’s career at the expense of his own. And Pella Affenlight, Guert’s daughter, returns to Westish after escaping an ill-fated marriage, determined to start a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the season counts down to its climactic final game, these five are forced to confront their deepest hopes, anxieties, and secrets. In the process they forge new bonds, and help one another find their true paths. Written with boundless intelligence and filled with the tenderness of youth, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Fielding&lt;/em&gt; is an expansive, warmhearted novel about ambition and its limits, about family and friendship and love, and about commitment—to oneself and to others.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dallas, 11/22/63: Three shots ring out.&lt;br&gt;President John F. Kennedy is dead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life can turn on a dime—or stumble into the extraordinary, as it does for Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in a Maine town. While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father’s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away . . . but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake’s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner’s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke. . . . Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten . . . and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful.</description>

The idea of Asgard now being in a field in Oklahoma continues to provide plenty of laughs as well as serious questions about what the various inhabitants are supposed to do in a humdrum realm like Earth....]]>

  <description>From writers Scott Snyder and Stephen King, AMERICAN VAMPIRE introduces a new strain of vampire – a more vicious species – and traces the creatures' bloodline through decades of American history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This first hardcover volume of the critically acclaimed series collects issues #1-5 and follows two stories: one written by Snyder and one written by King, both with art by future superstar Rafael Albuquerque. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Snyder's tale follows Pearl, a young woman living in 1920s Los Angeles, who is brutally turned into a vampire and sets out on a path of righteous revenge against the European monsters who tortured and abused her. And in King's story set in the days of America's Wild West, readers learn the origin of Skinner Sweet, the original American vampire – a stronger, faster creature than any vampire ever seen before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't miss out as Snyder and King set fire to the horror genre with this visionary, all-original take on one of the most popular monster stories!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This beautiful collection features a new introduction by Stephen King and bonus art including character sketches, variant covers and more!</description>

  <description>In this wry take on the post-apocalyptic horror novel, a pandemic has devastated the planet. The plague has sorted humanity into two types: the uninfected and the infected, the living and the living dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the plague is receding, and Americans are busy rebuild­ing civilization under orders from the provisional govern­ment based in Buffalo. Their top mission: the resettlement of Manhattan. Armed forces have successfully reclaimed the island south of Canal Street—aka Zone One—but pockets of plague-ridden squatters remain. While the army has eliminated the most dangerous of the infected, teams of civilian volunteers are tasked with clearing out a more innocuous variety—the “malfunctioning” stragglers, who exist in a catatonic state, transfixed by their former lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Spitz is a member of one of the civilian teams work­ing in lower Manhattan. Alternating between flashbacks of Spitz’s desperate fight for survival during the worst of the outbreak and his present narrative, the novel unfolds over three surreal days, as it depicts the mundane mission of straggler removal, the rigors of Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder, and the impossible job of coming to grips with the fallen world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then things start to go wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both spine chilling and playfully cerebral, &lt;em&gt;Zone One&lt;/em&gt; bril­liantly subverts the genre’s conventions and deconstructs the zombie myth for the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>The hunter becomes prey, as a heist goes sour and Parker finds himself trapped in a shuttered amusement park, besieged by a bevy of local mobsters. There are no exits from Fun Island. Outnumbered and outgunned, Parker can't afford a single miscalculation. He’s low on bullets—but, as anyone who’s crossed his path knows, that definitely doesn’t mean he’s defenseless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Nobody tops Stark in his objective portrayals of a world of total amorality.” —&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Energy and imagination light up virtually every page, as does some of the best hard-boiled prose ever to grace the noir genre.” —&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Douglas Pike is no longer the murderous hustler he was in his youth, but reforming hasn't made him much kinder. He's just living out his life in his Appalachian hometown, working odd jobs with his partner, Rory, hemming in his demons the best he can. And his best seems just good enough until his estranged daughter overdoses, and he takes in his 12-year-old granddaughter, Wendy. Just as the two are beginning to forge a relationship, Derrick Kreiger, a dirty Cincinnati cop, starts to take an unhealthy interest in the girl. Pike and Rory head to Cincinnati to learn what they can about Derrick and the death of Pike’s daughter, and the three men circle, evenly matched predators in a human wilderness of junkie squats, roadhouse bars, and homeless Vietnam vet encampments.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;By the author of &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The End of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;On October 7, 1949, dark-haired starlet Jean Spangler kissed her five-year-old daughter good-bye and left for a night shoot at a Hollywood studio. "Wish me luck," she said as she crossed her fingers, winked, and walked away. She was never seen again. The only clues left behind: a purse with a broken strap found in a nearby park, a cryptic note, and rumors about mobster boyfriends and ill-fated romances with movie stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing on this true-life missing person case, Megan Abbott&amp;amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Song Is You&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Gil "Hop" Hopkins, a smooth-talking Hollywood publicist whose career, despite his complicated personal life, is on the rise. It is 1951, two years after Jean Spangler&amp;amp;#8217;s disappearance, and Hop finds himself unwillingly drawn into the still unsolved mystery by a friend of Jean who blames Hop for concealing details about Jean&amp;amp;#8217;s whereabouts the night she vanished. Driven by guilt and fear of blackmail, Hop delves into the case himself, feverishly trying to stay one step ahead of an intrepid female reporter also chasing the story. Hop thought he&amp;amp;#8217;d seen it all, but what he uncovers both tantalizes and horrifies him as he plunges deeper and deeper into Hollywood&amp;amp;#8217;s substratum in his attempt to uncover the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the tradition of James Ellroy&amp;amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Black Dahlia&lt;/em&gt; and Joyce Carol Oates&amp;amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Blonde, The Song Is You&lt;/em&gt; conjures a heady brew of truth and speculation, of fact and pulp fiction, taking the reader on a dark tour of Tinseltown, from movie studios, gala premieres, and posh nightclubs to gangsters, blackmailing B-girls, and the darkest secrets that lie behind Hollywood&amp;amp;#8217;s luminous fa&amp;amp;#231;ade. At the center of it all is Hop, a man torn between cutthroat ambition and his own best intentions.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The thrilling new Virgil Flowers novel from the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The superstore chain PyeMart has its sights set on a Minnesota river town, but two very angry groups want to stop it: local merchants, fearing for their businesses, and environmentalists, predicting ecological disaster. The protests don't seem to be slowing the project, though, until someone decides to take matters into his own hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first bomb goes off on the top floor of PyeMart's headquarters. The second one explodes at the construction site itself. The blasts are meant to inflict maximum damage-and they do. Who's behind the bombs, and how far will they go? It's Virgil Flowers's job to find out . . . before more people get killed.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin's website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin's interview on Charlie Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch a Video Andrew Ross Sorkin delivers the first true behind-the-scenes, moment-by-moment account of how the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression developed into a global tsunami. From inside the corner office at Lehman Brothers to secret meetings in South Korea, and the corridors of Washington, &lt;em&gt;Too Big to Fail&lt;/em&gt; is the definitive story of the most powerful men and women in finance and politics grappling with success and failure, ego and greed, and, ultimately, the fate of the world’s economy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “We’ve got to get some foam down on the runway!” a sleepless Timothy Geithner, the then-president of the Federal Reserve of New York, would tell Henry M. Paulson, the Treasury secretary, about the catastrophic crash the world’s financial system would experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through unprecedented access to the players involved, &lt;em&gt;Too Big to Fail&lt;/em&gt; re-creates all the drama and turmoil, revealing neverdisclosed details and elucidating how decisions made on Wall Street over the past decade sowed the seeds of the debacle. This true story is not just a look at banks that were “too big to fail,” it is a real-life thriller with a cast of bold-faced names who themselves thought they were too big to fail.</description>

  <description>Four decades ago, Richard Forthrast, the black sheep of an Iowa family, fled to a wild and lonely mountainous corner of British Columbia to avoid the draft. Smuggling backpack loads of high-grade marijuana across the border into Northern Idaho, he quickly amassed an enormous and illegal fortune. With plenty of time and money to burn, he became addicted to an online fantasy game in which opposing factions battle for power and treasure in a vast cyber realm. Like many serious gamers, he began routinely purchasing virtual gold pieces and other desirables from Chinese gold farmers—young professional players in Asia who accumulated virtual weapons and armor to sell to busy American and European buyers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Richard, the game was the perfect opportunity to launder his aging hundred dollar bills and begin his own high-tech start up—a venture that has morphed into a Fortune 500 computer gaming group, Corporation 9592, with its own super successful online role-playing game, T’Rain. But the line between fantasy and reality becomes dangerously blurred when a young gold farmer accidently triggers a virtual war for dominance—and Richard is caught at the center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this edgy, 21st century tale, Neal Stephenson, one of the most ambitious and prophetic writers of our time, returns to the terrain of his cyberpunk masterpieces &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/em&gt;, leading readers through the looking glass and into the dark heart of imagination.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Deadly Edge &lt;/em&gt;bids a brutal adieu to the 1960s as Parker robs a rock concert, and the heist goes south. Soon Parker finds himself—and his woman, Claire—menaced by a pair of sadistic, drug-crazed hippies. Parker has a score to settle while Claire’s armed with her first rifle—and they’re both ready to usher in the end of the Age of Aquarius.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Richard Stark’s Parker novels . . . are among the most poised and polished fictions of their time and, in fact, of any time.” — John Banville, &lt;em&gt;Bookforum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Parkers read with the speed of pulp while unfolding with an almost Nabovokian wit and flair.” — Richard Rayner, &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>By the author of "Dare Me" and "The End of Everything" &lt;br&gt;""A young woman hired to keep the books at a down-at-the-heels nightclub is taken under the wing of the infamous Gloria Denton, a mob luminary who reigned during the Golden Era of Bugsy Siegel and Lucky Luciano. Notoriously cunning and ruthless, Gloria shows her eager young protegee the ropes, ushering her into a glittering demimonde of late-night casinos, racetracks, betting parlors, inside heists, and big, big money. Suddenly, the world is at her feet--as long as she doesn't take any chances, like falling for the wrong guy. As the roulette wheel turns, both mentor and protegee scramble to stay one step ahead of their bosses and each other.</description>

  <description>Far in the future, the World Controllers have created the ideal society. Through clever use of genetic engineering, brainwashing and recreational sex and drugs, all its members are happy consumers. Bernard Marx seems alone harbouring an ill-defined longing to break free. A visit to one of the few remaining Savage Reservations, where the old, imperfect life still continues, may be the cure for his &lt;br&gt;distress...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Huxley's ingenious fantasy of the future sheds a blazing light on the present and is considered to be his most enduring masterpiece.</description>

  <description>Believe it or not, some readers find &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;/em&gt; even more fun than Neal Stephenson's defining 1990s cyberpunk novel, &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;/em&gt; is set in Boston, and hero Sangamon Taylor (S. T.) ironically describes his hilarious exploits in the first person. S. T. is a modern superhero, a self-proclaimed Toxic Spiderman. With stealth, spunk, and the backing of GEE (a non-profit environmental group) as his weapons, S. T. chases down the bad guys with James Bond-like Zen.  &lt;p&gt; Cruising Boston Harbor with lab tests and scuba gear, S. T. rides in with the ecosystem cavalry on his 40-horsepower Zodiac raft. His job of tracking down poisonous runoff and embarrassing the powerful corporations who caused them becomes more sticky than usual; run-ins with a gang of satanic rock fans, a deranged geneticist, and a mysterious PCB contamination that may or may not be man-made--plus a falling-out with his competent ("I adore stress") girlfriend--all complicate his mission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephenson/S. T.'s irreverent, facetious, esprit-filled voice make this near-future tale a joy to read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While I was reading it, the water in the fish tank went mysteriously cloudy overnight despite being recently cleaned and our two goldfish who were like ten years old went belly up.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I was the Miracle Boy, once upon a time. Later on, the Milford Mute. The Golden Boy. The Young Ghost. The Kid. The Boxman. The Lock Artist. That was all me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you can call me Mike."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marked by tragedy, traumatized at the age of eight, Michael, now eighteen, is no ordinary young man. Besides not uttering a single word in ten years, he discovers the one thing he can somehow do better than anyone else. Whether it's a locked door without a key, a padlock with no combination, or even an eight-hundred pound safe ... he can open them all.  It's an unforgivable talent. A talent that will make young Michael a hot commodity with the wrong people and, whether he likes it or not, push him ever close to a life of crime. Until he finally sees his chance to escape, and with one desperate gamble risks everything to come back home to the only person he ever loved, and to unlock the secret that has kept him silent for so long. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steve Hamilton steps away from his Edgar Award-winning Alex McKnight series to introduce a unique new character, unlike anyone you've ever seen in the world of crime fiction.</description>

  <description>His name is etched on the door of his Manhattan office: LEONID McGILL, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. It’s a name that takes a little explaining, but he’s used to it. “Daddy was a communist and great-great- Granddaddy was a slave master from Scotland. You know, the black man’s family tree is mostly root. Whatever you see aboveground is only a hint at the real story.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ex-boxer, hard drinker, in a business that trades mostly in cash and favors: McGill’s an old-school P.I. working a city that’s gotten fancy all around him. Fancy or not, he has always managed to get by—keep a roof over the head of his wife and kids, and still manage a little fun on the side—mostly because he’s never been above taking a shady job for a quick buck. But like the city itself, McGill is turning over a new leaf, “decided to go from crooked to slightly bent.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; New York City in the twenty-first century is a city full of secrets—and still a place that reacts when you know where to poke and which string to pull. That’s exactly the kind of thing Leonid McGill knows how to do. As soon as &lt;em&gt;The Long Fall&lt;/em&gt; begins, with McGill calling in old markers and greasing NYPD palms to unearth some seemingly harmless information for a high-paying client, he learns that even in this cleaned-up city, his commitment to the straight and narrow is going to be constantly tested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And we learn that with this protagonist, this city, this time, Mosley has tapped a rich new vein that’s inspiring his best work since the classic &lt;em&gt;Devil in a Blue Dress&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch a trailer for this book:&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first of three explosive pulp thrillers arriving back-to-back from cult crime fiction sensation and Marvel Comics scribe Duane Swierczynski.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie Hardie, an ex-cop still reeling from the revenge killing of his former partner's entire family, fears one thing above all else: that he'll suffer the same fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Languishing in self-imposed exile, Hardie has become a glorified house sitter. His latest gig comes replete with an illegally squatting B-movie actress who rants about hit men who specialize in making deaths look like accidents. Unfortunately, it's the real deal. Hardie finds himself squared off against a small army of the most lethal men in the world: The Accident People.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's nothing &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt;-the girl just happens to be the next name on their list. For Hardie, though, it's &lt;em&gt;intensely&lt;/em&gt; personal. He's not about to let more innocent people die. Not on his watch.</description>

  <description>Bank robberies should run like clockwork, right? If your name’s Parker, you expect nothing less. Until, that is, one of your partners gets too greedy for his own good. The four-way split following a job leaves too small a take for George Uhl, who begins to pick off his fellow hoisters, one by one. The first mistake? That he doesn’t begin things by putting a bullet in Parker. That means he won’t get the chance to make a second. One of the darkest novels in the series, this caper proves the adage that no one crosses Parker and lives&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Whatever Stark writes, I read. He’s a stylist, a pro, and I thoroughly enjoy his attitude.”—Elmore Leonard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The non-hero: the ruthless, unrepentant, single-minded operator in a humorless and amoral world. . . . No one depicts this scene with greater clarity than Richard Stark.”—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>(6th Title in the Dortmunder series)&lt;br&gt;John Dortmunder's one of the slyest burglars going. But by God, he has bad luck! While fleeing the police during his latest caper, he falls through the roof of the Silent Sisterhood of St. Filumena -- and tumbles into the lap of trouble. It's an act of God, the sisters exclaim. Only the Creator himself could have sent this criminal just when they need him. Sure, they'll shelter him from the cops. But there's a price: He must help them to retrieve their youngest and newest member from her father's clutches. This promises to get sticky. Dear old dad hates the Sisterhood like the plague. And he happens to have an odd hobby: putting together mercenary armies. Why can't Dortmunder just catch a break? &lt;br&gt;"Westlake's most entertaining yet." (Publishers Weekly)</description>

  <description>In the dawning light of a late-summer morning, the people of lower Manhattan stand hushed, staring up in disbelief at the Twin Towers. It is August 1974, and a mysterious tightrope walker is running, dancing, leaping between the towers, suspended a quarter mile above the ground. In the streets below, a slew of ordinary lives become extraordinary in bestselling novelist Colum McCann’s stunningly intricate portrait of a city and its people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the Great World Spin &lt;/strong&gt;is the critically acclaimed author’s most ambitious novel yet: a dazzlingly rich vision of the pain, loveliness, mystery, and promise of New York City in the 1970s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corrigan, a radical young Irish monk, struggles with his own demons as he lives among the prostitutes in the middle of the burning Bronx. A group of mothers gather in a Park Avenue apartment to mourn their sons who died in Vietnam, only to discover just how much divides them even in grief. A young artist finds herself at the scene of a hit-and-run that sends her own life careening sideways. Tillie, a thirty-eight-year-old grandmother, turns tricks alongside her teenage daughter, determined not only to take care of her family but to prove her own worth.&lt;br&gt;Elegantly weaving together these and other seemingly disparate lives, McCann’s powerful allegory comes alive in the unforgettable voices of the city’s people, unexpectedly drawn together by hope, beauty, and the “artistic crime of the century.” A sweeping and radical social novel, &lt;strong&gt;Let the Great World Spin &lt;/strong&gt;captures the spirit of America in a time of transition, extraordinary promise, and, in hindsight, heartbreaking innocence. Hailed as a “fiercely original talent” (San Francisco Chronicle), award-winning novelist McCann has delivered a triumphantly American masterpiece that awakens in us a sense of what the novel can achieve, confront, and even heal.</description>

  <description>Before Liz Lemon, before "Weekend Update," before "Sarah Palin," Tina Fey was just a young girl with a dream: a recurring stress dream that she was being chased through a local airport by her middle-school gym teacher. She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has seen both these dreams come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon—from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unabridged recording on 5 CDs (5.5 Hours).&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>For the last sixty years, the CIA has managed to maintain a formidable reputation in spite of its terrible record, burying its blunders in top-secret archives. Its mission was to know the world. When it did not succeed, it set out to change the world. Its failures have handed us, in the words of President Eisenhower, “a legacy of ashes.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Pulitzer Prize–winning author Tim Weiner offers the first definitive history of the CIA—and everything is on the record. LEGACY OF ASHES is based on more than 50,000 documents, primarily from the archives of the CIA itself, and hundreds of interviews with CIA veterans, including ten Directors of Central Intelligence. It takes the CIA from its creation after World War II, through its battles in the cold war and the war on terror, to its near-collapse after 9/ll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tim Weiner’s past work on the CIA and American intelligence was hailed as “impressively reported” and “immensely entertaining” in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; called it “truly extraordinary . . . the best book ever written on a case of espionage.” Here is the hidden history of the CIA: why eleven presidents and three generations of CIA officers have been unable to understand the world; why nearly every CIA director has left the agency in worse shape than he found it; and how these failures have profoundly jeopardized our national security.</description>

  <description>Tom Watson, a few months short of his sixtieth birthday, led the 2009 British Open with one hole to play and came within an unlucky bounce of winning it for the sixth time. His stunning performance electrified the golf world and showcased a swing that has endured as a model of good mechanics, rhythm, and repeatability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Timeless Swing&lt;/em&gt;, American Ryder Cup Captain Tom Watson draws on all the knowledge and expertise he has accumulated over the course of his extraordinary career, imparting lessons that will help golfers of any age play to the best of their abilities and enjoy the game more. From fundamentals like learning the proper grip to advanced shotmaking techniques such as swinging in wind, he breaks down the full swing into all its parts and explains with his trademark easy voice the most effective ways for mastering each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watson complements these lessons with time-tested drills and also offers a variety of tips and exercises to help golfers continue to swing well as they get older. And for the first time ever, he reveals the two key concepts he considers the most important of all&amp;amp;#8212;concepts that can enable players of all levels to attain a timeless swing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Timeless Swing&lt;/em&gt; is illustrated with stunning photographs by award-winning Golf Digest photographer Dom Furore, and Watson carefully draws the reader&amp;amp;#8217;s eye to what is essential in each photo, providing the kind of easy-to-understand guidance usually found only in private lessons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a foreword by Jack Nicklaus and archival highlights of Tom Watson&amp;amp;#8217;s most memorable shots and tournaments, this is an indispensable guide from a consummate teacher and one of the most respected and admired players in the game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Special Bonus: Each chapter includes an easy-to-access video via your smartphone of Tom Watson teaching key lessons. See details in the book's introduction.</description>

  <description>This is a city that seduces dreamers . . . then eats their dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matthew Scudder understands the futility of his search for a longtime missing Midwestern innocent who wanted to be an actress in the vast meat-grinder called New York City. But her frantic father heard that Schudder is the best--and now the ex-cop-turned-p.i. is scouring the hell called Hell's Kitchen looking for anything that might resemble a lead. And in this neighborhood of the lost, he's finding love--and death--in the worst possible places.</description>

  <description>Here’s Parker—planning to steal the entire payroll of an Air Force base in upstate New York, with help from Marty Fusco, fresh out of the pen, and a smart aleck finance clerk named Devers. Holed up with family in a scrappy little town, the hoisters prepare for the risky job by trying to shorten the odds. But the ice is thinner than Parker likes to think—and Marty’s ex-wife is much more complicated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Parker is refreshingly amoral, a thief who always gets away with the swag.”—Stephen King, &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.”—&lt;em&gt;Washington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Told with urgency and sharp political insight, Nixonland recaptures America's turbulent 1960s and early 1970s and reveals how Richard Nixon rose from the political grave to seize and hold the presidency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perlstein's epic account begins in the blood and fire of the 1965 Watts riots, nine months after Lyndon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnson's historic landslide victory over Barry Goldwater appeared to herald a permanent liberal consensus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;in the United States. Yet the next year, scores of liberals were tossed out of Congress, America was more divided than ever, and a disgraced politician was on his way to a shocking comeback: Richard Nixon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between 1965 and 1972, America experienced no less than a second civil war. Out of its ashes, the political world we know now was born. It was the era not only of Nixon, Johnson, Spiro Agnew, Hubert H. Humphrey, George McGovern, Richard J. Daley, and George Wallace but Abbie Hoffman, Ronald Reagan, Angela Davis, Ted Kennedy, Charles Manson, John Lindsay, and Jane Fonda. There are tantalizing glimpses of Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Jesse Jackson, John Kerry, and even of two ambitious young men named Karl Rove and William Clinton -- and a not so ambitious young man named George W. Bush.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cataclysms tell the story of Nixonland:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Angry blacks burning down their neighborhoods in cities across the land as white suburbanites defend home and hearth with shotguns&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The student insurgency over the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and the riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- The fissuring of the Democratic Party into warring factions manipulated by the "dirty tricks" of Nixon and his Committee to Re-Elect the President&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Richard Nixon pledging a new dawn of national unity, governing more divisively than any president before him, then directing a criminal conspiracy, the Watergate cover-up, from the Oval Office&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, in November 1972, Nixon, harvesting the bitterness and resentment born of America's turmoil, was reelected in a landslide even bigger than Johnson's 1964 victory, not only setting the stage for his dramatic 1974 resignation but defining the terms of the ideological divide that characterizes America today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with prodigious research and driven by a powerful narrative, Rick Perlstein's magisterial account of how America divided confirms his place as one of our country's most celebrated historians.</description>

  <description>It was a dark and stormy night when Mary Crane glimpsed the unlit neon sign announcing the vacancy at the Bates motel. Exhausted, lost, and at the end of her rope, she was eager for a hot shower and a bed for the night. Her room was musty but clean and the plumbing worked. Norman Bates, the manager, seemed nice, if a little odd.</description>

  <description>In the years between the end of World War II and the mid-1950s, the popular culture of today was invented in the pulpy, boldly illustrated pages of comic books. But no sooner had comics emerged than they were beaten down by mass bonfires, congressional hearings, and a McCarthyish panic over their unmonitored and uncensored content. Esteemed critic David Hajdu vividly evokes the rise, fall, and rise again of comics in this engrossing history.</description>

  <description>The Ghost Brigades are the Special Forces of the Colonial Defense Forces, elite troops created from the DNA of the dead and turned into the perfect soldiers for the CDF's toughest operations. They're young, they're fast and strong, and they're totally without normal human qualms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the universe is a dangerous place for humanity - and it's about to become far more dangerous. Three races that humans have clashed with before have allied to halt our expansion into space. Their linchpin: the turncoat military scientist Charles Boutin, who knows the CDF's biggest military secrets. To prevail, the CDF most find out why Boutin did what he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared Dirac is the only human who can provide answers - a superhuman hybrid, created from Boutin's DNA, whose brain is uniquely able to access Boutin's electronic memories. But when the memory transplant appears to fail, Jared is given over to the Ghost Brigades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared begins as one of these perfect soldiers, but as memories begin to surface, he begins to intuit the reason's for Boutin's betrayal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jared desperately hunts for his "father", he must also come to grips with his own choices. Time is running out: the alliance is preparing its offensive, and some of them plan worse things than humanity's mere military defeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2006 John Scalzi; (P)2008 Macmillan Audio</description>

  <description>Absolutely one of the funniest, smartest, meanest books I know. John Self, the Rabelaisian narrator of the novel, is an advertising man and director of TV commercials who lurches through London and Manhattan, eating, drinking, drugging and smoking too much, buying too much sex, and caring for little else besides getting the big movie deal that will make him lots of money. Hey, it was the '80s. Most importantly, however, Amis in &lt;em&gt;Money&lt;/em&gt; musters more sheer entertainment power in any single sentence than most writers are lucky to produce in a career.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Prepare to meet the world's most dangerous man . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicholai Hel-genius, mystic, and the perfect, formidable assassin-was first introduced to readers in &lt;em&gt;Shibumi&lt;/em&gt;, the classic #1 bestseller by master storyteller Trevanian. Now critically acclaimed author Don Winslow continues Hel's story for the first time in this all-new, blockbuster thriller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SATORI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the fall of 1951, and the Korean War is raging. Twenty-six-year-old Nicholai Hel has spent the last three years in solitary confinement at the hands of the Americans. Hel is a master of &lt;em&gt;hoda korosu&lt;/em&gt;, or "naked kill," is fluent in seven languages, and has honed extraordinary "proximity sense"-an extra-awareness of the presence of danger. He has the skills to be the world's most fearsome assassin and now the CIA needs him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Americans offer Hel freedom, money, and a neutral passport in exchange for one small service: to go to Beijing and kill the Soviet Union's commissioner to China. It's almost certainly a suicide mission, but Hel accepts. Now he must survive chaos, violence, suspicion, and betrayal while trying to achieve his ultimate goal of &lt;em&gt;satori&lt;/em&gt;-the possibility of true understanding and harmony with the world.</description>

  <description>This Pulitzer Prize-winning classic tells the poignant tale of a Chinese farmer and his family in old agrarian China. The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family. Nearby, the nobles of the House of Hwang consider themselves above the land and its workers; but they will soon meet their own downfall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family when flood and drought force them to seek work in the city. The working people riot, breaking into the homes of the rich and forcing them to flee. When Wang Lung shows mercy to one noble and is rewarded, he begins to rise in the world, even as the House of Hwang falls.</description>

  <description>From the acclaimed and award-winning team of ED BRUBAKER and SEAN PHILLIPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New York Times listed CRIMINAL as one of the best books of the year, and THE SINNERS is a perfect place to find out why. TRACY LAWLESS returns to star in a tale of vigilante justice and twisted betrayal as the streets of his old home town start to box him in like never before. Made Men are being killed all over the city, and since criminals don't go to the cops for help, only Tracy can solve these murders... If he can survive long enough. Featuring an introduction by best-selling crime novelist Ian Rankin.</description>

  <description>Winner of the Eisner Award for Best New Series, and Winner of the Harvey and Eisner Awards for Best Writer! The third collection of Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips' critically-acclaimed noir series follows a different twist of the knife this time -- telling three interlinking stories that take place during the early 1970s and swirl around the fate of a hard-luck Femme Fatale, a boxer and a thief and killer just home from Vietnam. Each story is told from a different narrative point-of-view, so we can see the varied secrets and hidden desires that ultimately lead to a lot of murder and mayhem.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A journey to Florida's coast becomes an inescapable nightmare in the newest supernatural thriller from international bestseller Michael Koryta.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arlen Wagner has seen it in men before--a trace of smoke in their eyes that promises imminent death. He is never wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Arlen awakens on a train one hot Florida night and sees death's telltale sign in the eyes of his fellow passengers, he tries to warn them. Only 19-year-old Paul Brickhill believes him, and the two abandon the train, hoping to escape certain death. They continue south, but soon are stranded at the Cypress House--an isolated Gulf Coast boarding house run by the beautiful Rebecca Cady--directly in the path of an approaching hurricane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The storm isn't the only approaching danger, though. A much deadlier force controls the county and everyone living in it, and Arlen wants out--fast. But Paul refuses to abandon Rebecca to face the threats alone, even though Arlen's eerie gift warns that if they stay too long they may never leave. From its chilling beginning to terrifying end, &lt;em&gt;The Cypress House &lt;/em&gt;is a story of relentless suspense from "one of the best of the best" (Michael Connelly).</description>

  <description>Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark’s eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir. Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose style—and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency—Stark is a master of crime writing, his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover—and become addicted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rare Coin Score&lt;/em&gt; features the first appearance of Claire, who will steal Parker’s heister’s heart—while together they steal two million dollars of rare coins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Parker . . . lumbers through the pages of Richard Stark’s noir novels scattering dead bodies like peanut shells. . . . In a complex world [he] makes things simple.”—William Grimes, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Whatever Stark writes, I read. He’s a stylist, a pro, and I thoroughly enjoy his attitude.”—Elmore Leonard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.”—&lt;em&gt;Washington Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Donald Westlake’s Parker novels are among the small number of books I read over and over. Forget all that crap you’ve been telling yourself about &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; and Proust—these are the books you’ll want on that desert island.”—Lawrence Block</description>

  <description>More than just a classic political novel, Warren’s tale of power and corruption in the Depression-era South is a sustained meditation on the unforeseen consequences of every human act, the vexing connectedness of all people and the possibility—it’s not much of one—of goodness in a sinful world. Willie Stark, Warren’s lightly disguised version of Huey Long, the onetime Louisiana strongman/governor, begins as a genuine tribune of the people and ends as a murderous populist demagogue. Jack Burden is his press agent, who carries out the boss’s orders, first without objection, then in the face of his own increasingly troubled conscience. And the politics? For Warren, that’s simply the arena most likely to prove that man is a fallen creature. Which it does.</description>

  <description>Frank W. Abagnale, alias Frank Williams, Robert Conrad, Frank Adams, and Robert Monjo, was one of the most daring con men, forgers, imposters, and escape artists in history.  In his brief but notorious criminal career, Abagnale donned a pilot's uniform and copiloted a Pan Am jet, masqueraded as the supervising resident of a hospital, practiced law without a license, passed himself off as a college sociology professor, and cashed over $2.5 million in forged checks, all before he was twenty-one. Known by the police of twenty-six foreign countries and all fifty states as "The Skywayman," Abagnale lived a sumptuous life on the lam-until the law caught up with him.  Now recognized as the nation's leading authority on financial foul play, Abagnale is a charming rogue whose hilarious, stranger-than-fiction international escapades, and ingenious escapes-including one from an airplane-make &lt;strong&gt;Catch Me If You Can&lt;/strong&gt; an irresistible tale of deceit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The uproarious, bestselling true story of the world's most sought-after con man currently in development as a &lt;strong&gt;DreamWorks&lt;/strong&gt; feature film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I stole every nickel and blew it on fine threads, luxurious lodgings, fantastic foxes, and other sensual goodies.  I partied in every capital in Europe and basked on all the world's most famous beaches."</description>

  <description>To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough...not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, ROOM is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.</description>

  <description>Ex-PI Joe Kurtz's survival is on the line when an ambush leaves him badly wounded and his parole officer Peg O'Toole barely clinging to life. Their respective professions have ensured that neither suffers from a shortage of enemies so discovering which of them was the intended target isn't easy. But Kurtz knows who's at the head of his list: Angelina Farino Ferrara, the lethal beauty who leads the Farino crime family, as well as her mob rival, ice cold Toma Gonzaga, who has his own dark history with Kurtz.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The odd thing is, each wants to hire Joe Kurtz to find out who's been waging war beneath the cold gray skies of western New York. Until now, the casualties have been heroin junkies and their dealers. But now, the shootings of Kurtz and O'Toole have drawn the notice of both the newspapers and Buffalo PD Detective Rigby King, who shared Kurtz's tough childhood in a Buffalo orphanage, and who wants to put Kurtz back in prison-or back in her bed. Even Kurtz's jaded past cannot prepare him for what he's about to learn as he finds himself caught in an ever-tightening vise between the wounded and warring mob families and the cops, unaware that a maniac is waiting for his chance to strike...&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A Reason to Kill...&lt;br&gt;Joe Kurtz, former investigator and convicted felon, is on parole. But his years in Attica for snuffing the mob killers of his beautiful partner didn't make his old haunts any safer. Back on the streets, he's already marked by a local Mafia don with unfinished business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Reason to Live...&lt;br&gt;If watching his back wasn't enough, Kurtz has been hired by gravely ill John Frears whose daughter met a grisly fate at the hands of a child-murderer. Frears wants one thing before he dies: for Kurtz to find the fiend that the authorities couldn't. But the calculating killer-a master at changing identities-has a little unfinished business of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Reason to Die...&lt;br&gt;Dodging a contract on his head, and tracking a serial killer on the loose, Kurtz is plunging headfirst into the icy waters of revenge-as both victim and private avenger. It's going to be a tough winter in Buffalo for Joe Kurtz-cold enough to freeze the blood.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark’s eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir. Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose style—and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency—Stark is a master of crime writing, his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover—and become addicted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Handle&lt;/em&gt;, Parker is enlisted by the mob to knock off an island casino guarded by speedboats and heavies, forty miles from the Texas coast&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Parker . . . lumbers through the pages of Richard Stark’s noir novels scattering dead bodies like peanut shells. . . . In a complex world [he] makes things simple.”—William Grimes, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Whatever Stark writes, I read. He’s a stylist, a pro, and I thoroughly enjoy his attitude.”—Elmore Leonard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.”—&lt;em&gt;Washington Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Donald Westlake’s Parker novels are among the small number of books I read over and over. Forget all that crap you’ve been telling yourself about &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; and Proust—these are the books you’ll want on that desert island.”—Lawrence Block</description>

  <description>John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife's grave. Then he joined the army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce-- and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity's resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don't want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You'll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You'll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you'll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine--and what he will become is far stranger.</description>

  <description>Raised within the confines of a system that has done nothing but provide him with pain, Alex Hamilton's frustration and anger are completely natural--and inherently dangerous.&lt;br&gt;Since his parents split up, Alex has been constantly running from foster homes and institutions, yearning to be with his father, a broken man who cannot give his son the home he desperately needs. The only constant in Alex's life is no-good, criminally-minded peers, who are all too ready to plant illegal ideas in an intelligent mind. Bunker writes, "His unique potential would develop into unique destructiveness." &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Animal Factory&lt;/em&gt; goes deep into San Quentin, a world of violence and paranoia, where territory and status are ever-changing and possibly fatal commodities. Ron Decker is a newbie, a drug dealer whose shot at a short two-year stint in the can is threatened from inside and outside. He's got to keep a spotless record or it's ten to life. But at San Quentin, no man can steer clear of the Brotherhoods, the race wars, the relentlessness. It soon becomes clear that some inmates are more equal than others; Earl Copen is one of them, an old-timer who has learned not just to survive but to thrive behind bars. Not much can surprise him-but the bond he forms with Ron startles them both; it's a true education of a felon.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Intense, powerful, and compelling, &lt;em&gt;Matterhorn&lt;/em&gt; is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer's &lt;em&gt;The Naked and the Dead&lt;/em&gt; and James Jones's &lt;em&gt;The Thin Red Line&lt;/em&gt;. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written over the course of thirty years by a highly decorated Marine veteran, &lt;em&gt;Matterhorn&lt;/em&gt; is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Some secrets just can't stay buried, in the brilliant new Lucas Davenport thriller from the number-one &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;- bestselling author. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "One of the best," said &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Storm Prey&lt;/em&gt;. "Razor-sharp dialogue, a tautly controlled pace and enough homicides for a miniseries. What more could fans want?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A house demolition provides an unpleasant surprise for Minneapolis-the bodies of two girls, wrapped in plastic. It looks like they've been there a long time. Lucas Davenport knows exactly how long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In 1985, Davenport was a young cop with a reputation for recklessness, and the girls' disappearance was a big deal. His bosses ultimately declared the case closed, but he never agreed with that. Now that he has a chance to investigate it all over again, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: It wasn't just the bodies that were buried. It was the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Henrietta Lacks, as HeLa, is known to present-day scientists for her cells from cervical cancer. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells were taken without her knowledge and still live decades after her death. Cells descended from her may weigh more than 50M metric tons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The journey starts in the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s, her small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo. Today are stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells, East Baltimore children and grandchildren live in obscurity, see no profits, and feel violated. The dark history of experimentation on African Americans helped lead to the birth of bioethics, and legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.</description>

      <![CDATA[Garth Ennis wrote an introduction to this volume of <em>Preacher</em> where he says that part of his inspiration for the story came from his love of western movies.  He doesn’t explain why he included a kid disfigured after a botched suicide attempt who now goes by the name of Arseface.  That’s probably for...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The brilliant new Spenser novel from the beloved &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author Robert B. Parker. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Called upon by The Hammond Museum and renowned art scholar Dr. Ashton Prince, Spenser accepts his latest case: to provide protection during a ransom exchange-money for a stolen painting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The case becomes personal when Spenser fails to protect his client and the valuable painting remains stolen. Convinced that Ashton Prince played a bigger role than just ransom delivery boy, Spenser enters into a daring game of cat-and-mouse with the thieves. But this is a game he might not come out of alive...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Completed the year before he passed away, &lt;em&gt;Painted Ladies&lt;/em&gt; is Spenser and Robert B. Parker at their electrifying best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Robert B. Parker died almost a year ago, but from what I’ve read <em>Painted Ladies</em> is the first of two unpublished Spenser novels that he had completed. Plus, considering Parker’s output, who knows how many books from his other three series may come out? It seems like Parker’s literary ghost will be...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1 &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BESTSELLER • &lt;strong&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE • &lt;/strong&gt;Hailed as the top nonfiction book of the year by &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine • Winner of the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Prize for biography and the Indies Choice Adult Nonfiction Book of the Year award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in &lt;em&gt;Seabiscuit&lt;/em&gt;. Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity, &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Extraordinarily moving . . . a powerfully drawn survival epic.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “[A] one-in-a-billion story . . . designed to wrench from self-respecting critics all the blurby adjectives we normally try to avoid: It is amazing, unforgettable, gripping, harrowing, chilling, and inspiring.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—New York&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Staggering . . . mesmerizing . . . Hillenbrand’s writing is so ferociously cinematic, the events she describes so incredible, you don’t dare take your eyes off the page.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “A meticulous, soaring and beautifully written account of an extraordinary life.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Ambitious and powerful . . . a startling narrative and an inspirational book.”&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;—The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Marvelous . . . &lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; is wonderful twice over, for the tale it tells and for the way it’s told. . . . It manages maximum velocity with no loss of subtlety.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Moving and, yes, inspirational . . . [Laura] Hillenbrand’s unforgettable book . . . deserve[s] pride of place alongside the best works of literature that chart the complications and the hard-won triumphs of so-called ordinary Americans and their extraordinary time.”&lt;strong&gt;—Maureen Corrigan, &lt;em&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “Hillenbrand . . . tells [this] story with cool elegance but at a thrilling sprinter’s pace.”&lt;strong&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Unbroken&lt;/em&gt; is too much book to hope for: a hellride of a story in the grip of the one writer who can handle it.”&lt;strong&gt;—Christopher McDougall, author of &lt;em&gt;Born to Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>The "New York Times" bestselling author of "The Late Shift" delivers "a boisterous, two-timing, high-stakes drama about the business of comedy" ("The Associated Press").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one is more uniquely suited to document television's latest late- night travesty than veteran media reporter and bestselling author, Bill Carter. NBC's CEO, Jeff Zucker, had it all worked out when he moved Jay Leno from behind the desk at "The Tonight Show," and handed the reins over to Conan O'Brien. But as everyone knows, his decision was a spectacular failure. Ratings plummeted, affiliates were enraged-and when Zucker tried to put everything back the way it was, that plan backfired as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In candid detail, Carter charts the vortex that sucked in-not just Leno and O'Brien-but also Letterman, Stewart, Fallon, Kimmel, and Ferguson as frantic agents and network executives tried to manage a tectonic shift in television's most beloved institution.</description>

      <![CDATA[There’s a fair amount of criticism out there about Stephen King.  A lot of it is valid, but there are certain times that he’s the perfect author to be reading.  Like last night when a winter storm blew through.  Freezing temperatures, snow, ice, and high winds made it look like an Artic wasteland ou...]]>

  <description>It's finally here Six years and almost one-thousand pages have all led to this epic finale With six of Ramona's seven evil exes dispatched, it should be time for Scott Pilgrim to face Gideon Graves, the biggest and baddest of her former beaus. But didn't Ramona take off at the end of Book 5? Shouldn't that let Scott off the hook? Maybe it should, maybe it shouldn't, but one thing is for certain - all of this has been building to Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour</description>

  <description>Before &lt;em&gt;The Firm&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Pelican Brief&lt;/em&gt; made him a superstar,  John Grisham wrote this riveting story of  retribution and justice -- at last it's available in a  Doubleday hardcover edition. In this searing courtroom  drama, best-selling author John Grisham probes the  savage depths of racial violence...as he delivers  a compelling tale of uncertain justice in a small  southern town...Clanton, Mississippi.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The life of a ten-year-old girl is shattered by two  drunken and remorseless young men. The mostly white town reacts with shock and horror at the inhuman  crime. Until her black father acquires an assault  rifle and takes matters into his hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For ten days, as burning crosses  and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as  young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save  his client's life...and then his own.</description>

  <description>Award-winning author Dan Simmons expertly reveals more surprises than clowns in a circus car as he takes the reader on a trip with Kurtz through the cold, windy streets of Buffalo where one wrong move could mean a belly-full of lead...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe Kurtz has been wronged one too many times. So when he takes out the drug dealing thug that killed his girlfried, the ex-PI gets to cool his heels for 11 years in Attica. It's there that he meets "Little Skag" Farino, the son of an aging Buffalo, New York mob boss. In exchange for protecting the kid's manhood against any unwanted jailhouse affection, Kurtz gets an audience with Little Skag's father upon his release from prison. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Byron Farino is still clinging to what dwindling power he holds on the New York organized crime scene. He enlists Kurtz's help to track down the Family's missing accountant--a man with too much knowledge of Family business to have on the loose. But someone doesn't want the accountant found. As the story twists and turns and the body count rises, Kurtz no longer knows who he can trust. Everyone seems to be after something, from the mob boss's sultry yet dangerous daughter, to a hit man named The Dane, an albino killer who is good with a knife, and a dwarf who is armed to the teeth and hell-bent on revenge.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In this classic, John le Carre's third novel and the first to earn him international acclaim, he created a world unlike any previously experienced in suspense fiction. With unsurpassed knowledge culled from his years in British Intelligence, le Carre brings to light the shadowy dealings of international espionage in the tale of a British agent who longs to end his career but undertakes one final, bone-chilling assignment. When the last agent under his command is killed and Alec Leamas is called back to London, he hopes to come in from the cold for good. His spymaster, Control, however, has other plans. Determined to bring down the head of East German Intelligence and topple his organization, Control once more sends Leamas into the fray -- this time to play the part of the dishonored spy and lure the enemy to his ultimate defeat.</description>

  <description>That's right, folks! Put down the video game controller! Skip that rehearsal for your band! Make whatever sacrifices you must to those comic gods you hold so dear! Just make sure you're ready because Bryan Lee O'Malley and Scott Pilgrim are back! Well, a couple months have passed since the last time we caught up with our intrepid hero, but what can change in a few short months? Well, not much has... Scott's still living with his roommate Wallace Wells. He's still playing in a mediocre rock band named Sex Bob-omb. And most importantly, he's still dating the lovely Ramona Flowers while working his way through the gaggle of superpowered, superstylish, superevil ex-boyfriends determined to take him down. But something is different. Don't look now, but Scott Pilgrim may actually be getting it together. And it's a good thing, too, because Scott is about to confront Ramona's most intimidating ex yet!</description>

  <description>Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark's eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir. Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose style, and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency, Stark is a master of crime writing, his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover, and become addicted to. This season's offerings include volumes 7-9 in the series: &lt;em&gt;The Seventh&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Handle&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Rare Coin Score.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Seventh&lt;/em&gt;, the heist of a college football game goes bad, and the take is stolen by a crazed, violent amateur. Parker must outrun the cops, and the killer, to retrieve his cash. In &lt;em&gt;The Handle&lt;/em&gt;, Parker is enlisted by the mob to knock off an island casino guarded by speedboats and heavies, forty miles from the Texas coast&lt;em&gt;. The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Rare Coin Score&lt;/em&gt; features the first appearance of Claire, who will steal Parker's heister's heart, while together they steal two million dollars of rare coins.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Meet Matt Prior. He's about to lose his job, his wife, his house, maybe his mind. Unless . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the winning and utterly original novels &lt;em&gt;Citizen Vince&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Zero&lt;/em&gt;, Jess Walter ("a ridiculously talented writer"—&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) painted an America all his own: a land of real, flawed, and deeply human characters coping with the anxieties of their times. Now, in his warmest, funniest, and best novel yet, Walter offers a story as real as our own lives: a tale of overstretched accounts, misbegotten schemes, and domestic dreams deferred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few years ago, small-time finance journalist Matthew Prior quit his day job to gamble everything on a quixotic notion: a Web site devoted to financial journalism in the form of blank verse. When his big idea—and his wife's eBay resale business— ends with a whimper (and a garage full of unwanted figurines), they borrow and borrow, whistling past the graveyard of their uncertain dreams. One morning Matt wakes up to find himself jobless, hobbled with debt, spying on his wife's online flirtation, and six days away from losing his home. &lt;em&gt;Is this really how things were supposed to end up for me&lt;/em&gt;, he wonders: staying up all night worried, driving to 7-Eleven in the middle of the night to get milk for his boys, and falling in with two local degenerates after they offer him a hit of high-grade marijuana?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or, he thinks, &lt;em&gt;could this be the solution to all my problems?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following Matt in his weeklong quest to save his marriage, his sanity, and his dreams, &lt;em&gt;The Financial Lives of the Poets&lt;/em&gt; is a hysterical, heartfelt novel about how we can reach the edge of ruin—and how we can begin to make our way back.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The brilliant new Virgil Flowers thriller from the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; One late fall Sunday in southern Minnesota, a farmer brings a load of soybeans to a local grain elevator- and a young man hits him on the head with a steel bar, drops him into the grain bin, waits until he's sure he's dead, and then calls the sheriff to report the "accident." Suspicious, the sheriff calls in Virgil Flowers, who quickly breaks the kid down...and the next day the boy's found hanging in his cell. Remorse? Virgil isn't so sure, and as he investigates he begins to uncover a multigeneration, multifamily conspiracy-a series of crimes of such monstrosity that, though he's seen an awful lot in his life, even he has difficulty in comprehending it...and in figuring out what to do next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Four masked men—thieves, rivals, and friends from the tough streets of Charlestown—take on a Boston bank at gunpoint. Holding bank manager Claire Keesey hostage and cleaning out the vault were simple. But career criminal Doug MacRay didn’t plan on one thing: falling hard for Claire. When he tracks her down without his mask and gun, their mutual attraction is undeniable. With a tenacious FBI agent following his every move, he imagines a life away from his gritty, dangerous work—a life centered around Claire. But before that can happen, Doug and his crew learn that there may be a way to rob Boston’s venerable baseball stadium, Fenway Park. Risky yet utterly irresistible, it would be the perfect heist to end his criminal career and begin a new life. But, as it turns out, pursuing Claire may be the most dangerous act of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Racing to an explosive climax, &lt;em&gt;The Town &lt;/em&gt;is a brash tale of robbery in all its forms—and an unforgettable odyssey of crime, love, ambition, and dreams.</description>

  <description>You probably haven’t ever noticed them. But they’ve noticed you. They notice &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. That’s their job. Sitting quietly in a nondescript car outside a bank making note of the tellers’ work habits, the positions of the security guards. Lagging a few car lengths behind the Brinks truck on its daily rounds. Surreptitiously jiggling the handle of an unmarked service door at the racetrack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re thieves. Heisters, to be precise. They’re pros, and Parker is far and away the best of them. If you’re planning a job, you want him in. Tough, smart, hardworking, and relentlessly focused on his trade, he is the heister’s heister, the robber’s robber, the heavy’s heavy. You don’t want to cross him, and you don’t want to get in his way, because he’ll stop at nothing to get what he’s after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark’s eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir.  Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose-style—and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency—Stark is a master of crime writing; his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover—and become addicted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;The Jugger&lt;/em&gt;, Parker travels to Nebraska to help out a geriatric safecracker who knows too many of his criminal secrets. By the time he arrives, the safecracker is dead and Parker’s skeletons are on the verge of escaping from their closet—unless Parker resorts to lethal measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Whatever Stark writes, I read. He’s a stylist, a pro, and I thoroughly enjoy his attitude.”—Elmore Leonard&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.”—&lt;em&gt;Washington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Donald Westlake’s Parker novels are among the small number of books I read over and over. Forget all that crap you’ve been telling yourself about &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; and Proust—these are the books you’ll want on that desert island.”—Lawrence Block</description>

  <description>It was an impossible crime: knock off a huge plant  payroll, all the banks, and all the stores in one entire city in one  night. But there was one thief good enough to try-Parker. All he  needed was the right men, the right plan, and the right kind of help  from Lady Luck.The men and the plan were easy; Lady Luck was another  story. She turned out to be a good-looking blonde with a taste for  booze and eyes for Parker. And Parker knew this chilling caper could  either be the perfect crime...or a set-up that would land him in  jail-for life.</description>

  <description>THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT THINKERS—A MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFE&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete “theory of everything.” If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform—and provoke—like no other.</description>

  <description>You probably haven’t ever noticed them. But they’ve noticed you. They notice &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. That’s their job. Sitting quietly in a nondescript car outside a bank making note of the tellers’ work habits, the positions of the security guards. Lagging a few car lengths behind the Brinks truck on its daily rounds. Surreptitiously jiggling the handle of an unmarked service door at the racetrack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re thieves. Heisters, to be precise. They’re pros, and Parker is far and away the best of them. If you’re planning a job, you want him in. Tough, smart, hardworking, and relentlessly focused on his trade, he is the heister’s heister, the robber’s robber, the heavy’s heavy. You don’t want to cross him, and you don’t want to get in his way, because he’ll stop at nothing to get what he’s after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parker, the ruthless antihero of Richard Stark’s eponymous mystery novels, is one of the most unforgettable characters in hardboiled noir.  Lauded by critics for his taut realism, unapologetic amorality, and razor-sharp prose-style—and adored by fans who turn each intoxicating page with increasing urgency—Stark is a master of crime writing, his books as influential as any in the genre. The University of Chicago Press has embarked on a project to return the early volumes of this series to print for a new generation of readers to discover—and become addicted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Outfit, &lt;/em&gt;Parker goes toe-to-toe with the mob—hitting them with heist after heist after heist—and the entire underworld learns an unforgettable lesson: whatever Parker does, he does deadly.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Westlake knows precisely how to grab a reader, draw him or her into the story, and then slowly tighten his grip until escape is impossible.”—&lt;em&gt;Washington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Elmore Leonard wouldn’t write what he does if Stark hadn’t been there before. And Quentin Tarantino wouldn’t write what he does without Leonard. . . . Old master that he is, Stark does all of them one better.”—&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Donald Westlake’s Parker novels are among the small number of books I read over and over. Forget all that crap you’ve been telling yourself about &lt;em&gt;War and Peace&lt;/em&gt; and Proust—these are the books you’ll want on that desert island.”—Lawrence Block&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>David Pepin has been in love with his wife, Alice, since the moment they met in a university seminar on Alfred Hitchcock. After thirteen years of marriage, he still can’t imagine a remotely happy life without her—yet he obsessively contemplates her demise. Soon she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dead, and David is both deeply distraught and the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The detectives investigating Alice’s suspicious death have plenty of personal experience with conjugal enigmas: Ward Hastroll is happily married until his wife inexplicably becomes voluntarily and militantly bedridden; and Sam Sheppard is especially sensitive to the intricacies of marital guilt and innocence, having decades before been convicted and then exonerated of the brutal murder of &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, these men are in the business of figuring things out, even as Pepin’s role in Alice’s death grows ever more confounding when they link him to a highly unusual hit man called Mobius. Like the Escher drawings that inspire the computer games David designs for a living, these complex, interlocking dramas are structurally and emotionally intense, subtle, and intriguing; they brilliantly explore the warring impulses of affection and hatred, and pose a host of arresting questions. Is it possible to know anyone fully, &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Are murder and marriage two sides of the same coin, each endlessly recycling into the other? And what, in the end, is the truth about love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mesmerizing, exhilarating, and profoundly moving, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Peanut &lt;/em&gt;is a police procedural of the soul, a poignant investigation of the relentlessly mysterious human heart—and a first novel of the highest order.</description>

  <description>Burned-out private detective and self-styled shit magnet Michael McGill needed a wake-up call to jump-start his dead career. What he got was a virtual cattle prod to the crotch, in the form of an impossible assignment delivered directly from the president's heroin-addict chief of staff. It seems the Constitution of the United States has some skeletons in its closet: the Founding Fathers doubted that the document would be able to stave off human nature indefinitely, so they devised a backup Constitution to deploy at the first sign of crisis. In the government's eyes, that time is now, as America is overgrown with perverts who spend more time surfing the Web for fetish porn than they do reading a newspaper. They want to use this "Secret Constitution" to drive the country back to a time when civility, God, and mom's homemade apple pie were all that mattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem is, no one can seem to find it . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So who better to track it down than a private dick who's so down-and-out that he's coming up the other side, a shamus whose only skill is stumbling into every depraved situation imaginable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no lead to speak of, and no knowledge of the underground world in which the Constitution has traveled, McGill embarks on a cross-country odyssey of America's darkest, dankest underbelly. Along the way, his white-bread sensibilities are treated to a smorgasbord of depravity that runs the gamut of human imagination. The filth mounts; it is clear that this isn't the kind of life, liberty, or happiness that Thomas Jefferson thought Americans would enjoy in the twenty-first century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what McGill learns as he closes in on the real Constitution is that freedom takes many forms, the most important of which may be the fight against the "good old days." Like Vonnegut, Orwell, and Huxley before him, Warren Ellis deftly exposes the hypocrisy of the "moral majority" by giving us a glimpse at the monstrous outcome that their overzealous policies would achieve.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;Stiff&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bonk&lt;/em&gt; explores the irresistibly strange universe of space travel and life without gravity.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Space is a world devoid of the things we need to live and thrive: air, gravity, hot showers, fresh produce, privacy, beer. Space exploration is in some ways an exploration of what it means to be human. How much can a person give up? How much weirdness can they take? What happens to you when you can’t walk for a year? have sex? smell flowers? What happens if you vomit in your helmet during a space walk? Is it possible for the human body to survive a bailout at 17,000 miles per hour? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To answer these questions, space agencies set up all manner of quizzical and startlingly bizarre space simulations. As Mary Roach discovers, it’s possible to preview space without ever leaving Earth. From the space shuttle training toilet to a crash test of NASA’s new space capsule (cadaver filling in for astronaut), Roach takes us on a surreally entertaining trip into the science of life in space and space on Earth.</description>

  <description>In &lt;strong&gt;Public Enemies&lt;/strong&gt;, bestselling author Bryan Burrough strips away the thick layer of myths put out by J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI to tell the full story—for the first time—of the most spectacular crime wave in American history, the two-year battle between the young Hoover and the assortment of criminals who became national icons: John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barkers. In an epic feat of storytelling and drawing on a remarkable amount of newly available material on all the major figures involved, Burrough reveals a web of interconnections within the vast American underworld and demonstrates how Hoover’s G-men overcame their early fumbles to secure the FBI’s rise to power.</description>

  <description>Beverly Thompson has been kidnapped and brutalized, but she refuses to be a passive victim.  She will never stop fighting the unknown man who's keeping her prisoner.  And she will never give up hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the attractive attorney was snatched from her home, her husband was callously shot to death with the same gun used to kill an elderly woman two days earlier.  Since then, four more victims have been murdered with the same weapon.  Now Phoenix homicide detective Sean Richardson must somehow stop an elusive killer with few clues to work on and no idea where the madman will strike next.  Until he can find him, Beverly Thompson will be left to struggle against ever-dwindling odds, battling desperately to survive long enough to see her husband's murderer brought to justice.</description>

  <description>The death of Judd Foxman’s father marks the first time that the entire Foxman family—including Judd’s mother, brothers, and sister—have been together in years. Conspicuously absent: Judd’s wife, Jen, whose fourteen-month affair with Judd’s radio-shock-jock boss has recently become painfully public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simultaneously mourning the death of his father and the demise of his marriage, Judd joins the rest of the Foxmans as they reluctantly submit to their patriarch’s dying request: to spend the seven days following the funeral together. In the same house. Like a family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the week quickly spins out of control, longstanding grudges resurface, secrets are revealed, and old passions reawakened. For Judd, it’s a weeklong attempt to make sense of the mess his life has become while trying in vain not to get sucked into the regressive battles of his madly dysfunctional family. All of which would be hard enough without the bomb Jen dropped the day Judd’s father died: She’s pregnant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Is Where I Leave You&lt;/em&gt; is Jonathan Tropper's most accomplished work to date, a riotously funny, emotionally raw novel about love, marriage, divorce, family, and the ties that bind—whether we like it or not.</description>

  <description>In 2008, 22 years after the events of the earlier book, former lawyer Rusty Sabich, now a Kindle County, Ill., chief appellate judge, is again suspected of murdering a woman close to him. His wife, Barbara, has died in her bed of what appear to be natural causes, yet Rusty comes under scrutiny from his old nemesis, acting prosecuting attorney Tommy Molto, who unsuccessfully prosecuted him for killing his mistress decades earlier. Tommy's chief deputy, Jim Brand, is suspicious because Rusty chose to keep Barbara's death a secret, even from their son, Nat, for almost an entire day, which could have allowed traces of poison to disappear. Rusty's candidacy for a higher court in an imminent election; his recent clandestine affair with his attractive law clerk, Anna Vostic; and a breach of judicial ethics complicate matters further.</description>

  <description>After almost fifty years as a wife and mother, Enid Lambert is ready to have some fun. Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson’s disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man—or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home.</description>

  <description>One May evening in London, Adam Kindred, a young climatologist in town for a job interview, is feeling good about the future as he sits down for a meal at a little Italian bistro. He strikes up a conversation with a solitary diner at the next table, who leaves soon afterward. With horrifying speed, this chance encounter leads to a series of malign accidents, through which Adam loses everything—home, family, friends, job, reputation, passport, credit cards, cell phone—never to get them back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The police are searching for him. There is a reward for his capture. A hired killer is stalking him. He is alone and anonymous in a huge, pitiless modern city. Adam has nowhere to go but down—underground. He decides to join that vast army of the disappeared and the missing who throng London’s lowest levels as he tries to figure out what to do with his life and struggles to understand the forces that have made it unravel so spectacularly. Adam's quest will take him all along the river Thames, from affluent Chelsea to the gritty East End, and on the way he will encounter all manner of London's denizens—aristocrats, prostitutes, evangelists, and policewomen—and version after new version of himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ordinary Thunderstorms&lt;/em&gt;, William Boyd's electric follow-up to his award-winning &lt;em&gt;Restless&lt;/em&gt;, is a profound and gripping novel about the fragility of social identity, the corruption at the heart of big business, and the secrets that lie hidden in the filthy underbelly of every city.</description>

  <description>An aging but formidable strip club owner, Claudiu “Manco” Kapak, has been robbed by a masked gunman as he placed his cash receipts in a bank’s night-deposit box. Enraged, he sends his half-dozen security men out to find a suspect who is spending lots of cash and is new enough to Los Angeles not to know he was robbing a gangster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Their search leads them to Joe Carver, an innocent but hardly defenseless newcomer who evades capture and sets out to make Kapak wish he’d chosen someone else. Meanwhile, the real culprit, Jefferson Davis Falkins, and his new girlfriend Carrie seem to believe they’ve found a whole new profession: robbing Manco Kapak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lieutenant Nick Slosser, the police detective in charge of the puzzling and increasingly violent case, has his own troubles, including worries about how he’s going to afford to send the oldest child of each of his two bigamous marriages to college without making their mothers suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As this odd series of difficulties explodes into a triple killing, Carver finds himself in the middle of a brewing gang war over Kapak’s little empire, while Falkins and Carrie journey into territory more strange and violent than either had imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Strip is a pulse-pounding, rambunctious thriller from an Edgar-winning “master of suspense”.</description>

  <description>In the novel, Siddhartha, a young man, leaves his family for a contemplative life, then, restless, discards it for one of the flesh. He conceives a son, but bored and sickened by lust and greed, moves on again. Near despair, Siddhartha comes to a river where he hears a unique sound. This sound signals the true beginning of his life -- the beginning of suffering, rejection, peace, and, finally, wisdom.</description>

  <description>Godzilla’s in a twelve-step program. A soul-sucking Mummy stalks Elvis and John F. Kennedy. Joe Bob Briggs has a moral dilemma: If your girlfriend turns zombie on you, what do you do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that’s the tame stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this red-hot collection from world-champion Mojo storyteller Joe R. Lansdale, you’ll find his best, most outrageous stories. The high priest of Texan weirdness does it all: horror, mystery, satire, suspense, and even Westerns. Prepare to be offended, shocked, and cackling like a crazed redneck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring five Bram Stoker Award�winning stories, this career retrospective contains some of Lansdale’s rarer work, his nonfiction forays into drive-in theaters and B-movies, and the novella &lt;em&gt;Bubba Ho-Tep&lt;/em&gt;, later made into a cult-classic major motion picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come on in—the weirdness is fine.</description>

After a decade of writing books like <em>The Bottoms</em> and <em>A Fine Dark Line</em> which got him mainstream accolades and success, it got easy to forget that this is a guy who originally made his name doing exceptionally gory horror stories and novels.

  <description>Amanda McCready was four years old when she vanished from a Boston neighborhood twelve years ago. Desperate pleas for help from the child's aunt led investigators Kenzie and Gennaro to take on the case. The pair risked everything to find the young girl—only to orchestrate her return to a neglectful mother and a broken home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Amanda is sixteen—and gone again. A stellar student, brilliant but aloof, she seemed destined to escape her upbringing. Yet Amanda's aunt is once more knocking on Patrick Kenzie's door, fearing the worst for the little girl who has blossomed into a striking, clever young woman—a woman who hasn't been seen in weeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by their consciences, Kenzie and Gennaro revisit the case that troubled them the most. Their search leads them into a world of identity thieves, methamphetamine dealers, a mentally unstable crime boss and his equally demented wife, a priceless, thousand-year-old cross, and a happily homicidal Russian gangster. It's a world in which motives and allegiances constantly shift and mistakes are fatal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their desperate fight to confront the past and find Amanda McCready, Kenzie and Gennaro will be forced to question if it's possible to do the wrong thing and still be right or to do the right thing and still be wrong. As they face an evil that goes beyond broken families and broken dreams, they discover that the sins of yesterday don't always stay buried and the crimes of today could end their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Breathers&lt;/em&gt;--an irreverent novel about fate, destiny, and the karmic consequences of getting involved with humans. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Over the past few thousand years, Fabio has come to hate his job. As Fate, he's in charge of assigning the fortunes and misfortunes that befall most of the human race-the 83% who keep screwing things up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Frustrated with his endless parade of drug addicts and career politicians, Fate has to watch Destiny guide her people to Nobel Peace Prizes and Super Bowl MVPs. To make matters worse, he has a five- hundred-year-old feud with Death, and his best friends are Sloth and Gluttony. And worst of all? He's fallen in love with a human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Getting involved with a human breaks Rule #1, and about ten others, setting off some cosmic-sized repercussions that could strip him of his immortality-or lead to a fate worse than death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<em>Storm Prey</em> is the twentieth entry in the Prey series.  Add in the four books about Kidd, three with Virgil Flowers and two stand-alone novels, and that’s a total of twenty-nine John Sandford novels.  I’ve read them all, and I’ll probably keep reading if he writes another twenty-nine.  So yeah, I gue...]]>

  <description>Lisbeth Salander — the heart of Larsson’s two previous novels — lies in critical condition, a bullet wound to her head, in the intensive care unit of a Swedish city hospital. She’s fighting for her life in more ways than one: if and when she recovers, she’ll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for three murders. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will not only have to prove her innocence, but also identify and denounce those in authority who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to suffer abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot revenge—against the man who tried to kill her, and the corrupt government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now Salander is fighting back.</description>

  <description>Beware of the cop.  He bites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hoke Moseley never saw him coming: the person who crashed into his squalid little hidey-hole in the Eldorado Hotel.  When his assailant was was done, Hoke's pride and joy, his dentures, were gone.  So were his gun and his badge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recovering from the brutal beating, Hoke tried to figure out who had administered it. The one place he didn't look was at a pair of ill-suited lovers: an ex-con from California and a simpleminded whore was was studying business management at Miami-Dade college.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the two had in common was a demented interest in haiku, a Hare Krishna who died of a broken finger at a Miami airport, and the acquaintance of a cop without any teeth: the very cop who, as soon as he remembers, will hunt them down.  All the way down.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Assassinations, political upheaval, student riots, and conservative  rage. In the thick of the Cold War it was the perfect recipe for  revolution, and it only took a gentle push to send a nation toppling  into dictatorship. But what if it happened in the United States? Miles  Dorn can make it so. A hired killer with no past and no future, he steps  out of retirement and sets his sights on the political leaders holding  America back from the brink. When they fall, a tyrant will step forward  and Dorn will disappear again. But as the death toll rises, he finds  himself growing close to a civilian who makes him question his path. Can  he turn back before it's too late for him - and America?&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>Deep in the mist-shrouded forests of the Pacific Northwest is a small mill town called Commonwealth, conceived as a haven for workers weary of exploitation. For Philip Worthy, the adopted son of the town’s founder, it is a haven in another sense–as the first place in his life he’s had a loving family to call his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And yet, the ideals that define this outpost are being threatened from all sides. A world war is raging, and with the fear of spies rampant, the loyalty of all Americans is coming under scrutiny. Meanwhile, another shadow has fallen across the region in the form of a deadly illness striking down vast swaths of surrounding communities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Commonwealth votes to quarantine itself against contagion, guards are posted at the single road leading in and out of town, and Philip Worthy is among them. He will be unlucky enough to be on duty when a cold, hungry, tired–and apparently ill–soldier presents himself at the town’s doorstep begging for sanctuary. The encounter that ensues, and the shots that are fired, will have deafening reverberations throughout Commonwealth, escalating until every human value–love, patriotism, community, family, friendship–not to mention the town’s very survival, is imperiled.</description>

  <description>From the Autobiography of Tiberius Claudius, Born 10 B.C., Murdered and Deified A.D. 54:&lt;br&gt;Considered an idiot because of his physical infirmities, Claudius survived the intrigues and poisonings of the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and the Mad Caligula to become emperor in 41 A.D. Historical novel set in 1st-century-AD Rome by Robert Graves, published in 1934. The book is written as an autobiographical memoir by Roman emperor Claudius. Physically weak, afflicted with stammering, and inclined to drool, Claudius is an embarrassment to his family and is shunted to the background of imperial affairs. The benefits of his seeming ineffectuality are twofold: he becomes a scholar and historian, and he is spared the worst cruelties inflicted on the imperial family by its own members during the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula. Palace intrigues and murders surround him. Claudius' informal narration serves to emphasize the banality of the imperial family's endless greed and lust. The story concludes with Claudius ascending to the imperial throne. A sequel, Claudius, the God and His Wife Messalina (1935), covers Claudius' years as Roman emperor.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The literary event of the season: a new novel from Ian McEwan, as surprising as it is masterful. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Beard is a Nobel prize–winning physicist whose best work is behind him. Trading on his reputation, he speaks for enormous fees, lends his name to the letterheads of renowned scientific institutions, and half-heartedly heads a government-backed initiative tackling global warming. While he coasts along in his professional life, Michael’s personal life is another matter entirely. His fifth marriage is crumbling under the weight of his infidelities. But this time the tables are turned: His wife is having an affair, and Michael realizes he is still in love with her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Michael’s personal and professional lives begin to intersect in unexpected ways, an opportunity presents itself in the guise of an invitation to travel to New Mexico. Here is a chance for him to extricate himself from his marital problems, reinvigorate his career, and very possibly save the world from environmental disaster. Can a man who has made a mess of his life clean up the messes of humanity? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A complex novel that brilliantly traces the arc of one man’s ambitions and self-deceptions, &lt;em&gt;Solar&lt;/em&gt; is a startling, witty, and stylish new work from one of the world’s great writers.</description>

  <description>Elmore Leonard, a literary icon praised by&lt;em&gt; The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt; as "the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever," has captured the imagination of millions of readers with his more than three dozen books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this short fiction collection, Leonard demonstrates the superb characterizations, dead-on dialogue, vivid atmosphere, and driving plots that have made him a household name -- and once again illustrates that the line between the law and the lawbreakers is not as firm as we might think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Federal marshal Karen Sisco, from the bestselling novel &lt;em&gt;Out of Sight,&lt;/em&gt; returns in "Karen Makes Out," once again inadvertently mixing pleasure with business. In "Fire in the Hole," Raylan Givens, last seen in Riding the Rap and Pronto, meets up with an old friend, but they're now on different sides of the law. In the title story, "When the Women Come Out to Dance," Mrs. Mahmood gets more than she bargains for when she conspires with her maid to end her unhappy marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All nine stories are Elmore Leonard at his vivid, hilarious, and unfailingly human best.</description>

  <description>The city of San Francisco is being stalked by a huge shaved vampyre cat named Chet, and only I, Abby Normal, emergency backup mistress of the Greater Bay Area night, and my manga-haired love monkey, Foo Dog, stand between the ravenous monster and a bloody massacre of the general public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whoa. And this is a love story? Yup. 'Cept there's no whining. See, while some lovers were born to run, Jody and Tommy were born to bite. Well, reborn, that is, now that they're vampires. Good thing theirs is an undying love, since their Goth Girl Friday, Abby Normal, imprisoned them in a bronze statue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby wants to be a bloodsucking fiend, too, but right now she's really busy with other stuff, like breaking in a pair of red vinyl thigh-high Skankenstein® platform boots and wrangling her Ph.D.-candidate boyfriend, Steve (the love monkey). And then there's that vampire cat Chet, who's getting bigger and smarter—and thirstier—by the minute. Abby thought she and Steve could handle the kitty cat on their own, &lt;em&gt;mais non&lt;/em&gt; . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before you can say "OMG! WTF?" Tommy and Jody are sprung from captivity, and join forces with Abby, Steve, the frozen-turkey-bowling Safeway crew, the Emperor of San Francisco and his trusty dogs Lazarus and Bummer, Abby's gay Goth friend Jared, and SF's finest Cavuto and Rivera to hunt big cat and save the city. And that's when the fun really begins.</description>

  <description>On June 9, 1865, while traveling by train to London with his secret mistress, 53-year-old Charles Dickens--at the height of his powers and popularity, the most famous and successful novelist in the world and perhaps in the history of the world--hurtled into a disaster that changed his life forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did Dickens begin living a dark double life after the accident? Were his nightly forays into the worst slums ofLondon and his deepening obsession with corpses, crypts, murder, opium dens, the use of lime pits to dissolve bodies, and a hidden subterranean London mere research . . . or something more terrifying?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as he did in The Terror, Dan Simmons draws impeccably from history to create a gloriously engaging and terrifying narrative. Based on the historical details of Charles Dickens's life and narrated by Wilkie Collins (Dickens's friend, frequent collaborator, and Salieri-style secret rival), DROOD explores the still-unsolved mysteries of the famous author's last years and may provide the key to Dickens's final, unfinished work: The Mystery of Edwin Drood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chilling, haunting, and utterly original, DROOD is Dan Simmons at his powerful best.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Late one night in August 1934, following a yearlong spree of bank robberies across the Midwest, the Firefly Brothers are forced into a police shootout and die . . . for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In award-winning author Thomas Mullen’s evocative new novel, the highly anticipated follow-up to his acclaimed debut, &lt;em&gt;The Last Town on Earth&lt;/em&gt;, we follow the Depression-era adventures of Jason and Whit Fireson—bank robbers known as the Firefly Brothers by the press, the authorities, and an adoring public that worships their acts as heroic counterpunches thrown at a broken system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it appears they have at last met their end in a hail of bullets. Jason and Whit’s lovers—Darcy, a wealthy socialite, and Veronica, a hardened survivor—struggle between grief and an unyielding belief that the Firesons have survived. While they and the Firesons’ stunned mother and straight-arrow third son wade through conflicting police reports and press accounts, wild rumors spread that the bandits are still at large. Through it all, the Firefly Brothers remain as charismatic, unflappable, and as mythical as the American Dream itself, racing to find the women they love and make sense of a world in which all has come unmoored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complete with kidnappings and gangsters, heiresses and speakeasies, &lt;em&gt;The Many Deaths of the Firefly Brothers&lt;/em&gt; is an imaginative and spirited saga about what happens when you are hopelessly outgunned—and a masterly tale of hardship, redemption, and love that transcends death.</description>

  <description>Charles Burns ha iniziato la lavorazione di Black Hole nel 1994, proseguendo poi per dieci anni. Se appare difficile catalogare un’opera così originale (cronaca semiautobiografica adolescenziale, narrazione horror...), è indiscussa invece la conferma del particolare talento di Burns nel descrivere atmosfere misteriose che divengono fascinose e terrificanti nello stesso tempo. Acclamato dalla critica di tutto il mondo, tra cui quella italiana, e disegnato in un bianco e nero fortemente contrastato, la Coconino ripropone questo moderno classico in una nuova edizione che raccoglie questa lunga saga che racconta di un’epidemia che si propaga tra gli adolescenti, trasmettendosi per via sessuale (metafora scoperta dell’Aids) e causando diverse mutazioni fisiche. La gravità del male, l’esclusione crescente subìta dalle vittime si manifestano attraverso un’atmosfera di palpabile frenesia sessuale. Collegando horror e sessualità, Burns porta alle estreme conseguenze le difficoltà legate alla scoperta del corpo altrui, in un percorso che rimanda a quelli del regista canadese David Cronenberg. Una serie che è già un classico in tutto il mondo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L’AUTORE: Autore di Spookyland, è nato a Washington e vive attualmente a Philadelphia. Creatore di Big Baby, si è aggiudicato i più importanti riconoscimenti americani proprio come creatore di Black Hole, ma memorabili sono anche le sue illustrazioni per riviste come "Time" e "Rolling Stone". In Italia i suoi lavori sono stati pubblicati su molte riviste, tra cui "Frigidaire", "Dolce Vita" e "Black".</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;It was Wizard's book of the year for 2005; now, fan-favorite artist Steve Epting rejoins Top Ten writer Ed Brubaker for an action-packed thriller in London, as Captain America travels across the Atlantic in search of his old partner - a story that will see him fighting side-by-side with some very old friends. But Cap and the Winter Soldier aren't the only ones taking the journey abroad. Crossbones and Sin are on a path of revenge that's leading them in the exact same direction! And what of General Lukin and his "relationship" with the Red Skull?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collects Captain America #18-21.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Captain America has fallen into a clash with his government and his friends, and the people close to him are paying the price. The life of Cap's girlfriend, Agent 13, is torn apart as her superiors use her divided loyalties against her. Elsewhere, a new villain emerges; the Red Skull begins to make himself known; and the Winter Soldier again comes face-to-face with Cap. But which side will he choose? Plus: James Buchanan Barnes, Captain America's one-time partner Bucky, faces his first Christmas of the 21st century - and the truth of the terrible things he was forced to do as the Winter Soldier. And with Cap caught in a conflict he can neither take a side of - or understand - what moves can he make to try to redeem himself? Collecting Captain America #22-24 and the Winter Soldier: Winter Kills one-shot.</description>

As the new regular creative team, they will take Cap's life in directions fans will never see coming! Collects Captain America (2005) #1-7.</description>

      <![CDATA[  The notion that comics are just for kids has been pretty well discredited these days, but if someone ever tried that line on me, I’d probably use Ed Brubaker’s <em>Criminal</em> series for my rebuttal.  Not because of the language, violence and nudity it contains, but because they really are top notch har...]]>

  <description>From Harvey Award-Winning Best Writer Ed Brubaker, and Scream Award-Winning Best Artist Sean Phillips comes the first collection of Criminal, one of the best reviewed comics of 2006. Coward is the story of Leo, a professional pickpocket who is also a legendary heist-planner and thief. But there's a catch with Leo, he won't work any job that he doesn't call all the shots on, he won't allow guns, and the minute things turn south, he's looking for any exit that won't land him in prison. But when he's lured into a risky heist, all his rules go out the window, and he ends up on the run from the cops and the bad men who double-crossed him. Now Leo must come face-to-face with the violence he's kept bottled up inside for 20 years, and nothing will ever be the same for him again. Collects Criminal #1-5.</description>

  <description>¿En qué situación se encontrarían miles de judíos desplazados por las autoridades internacionales a un lugar como Alaska? El sindicato de policías yiddish imagina una historia alternativa en la que, durante más de sesenta años, los judíos refugiados y sus descendientes han vivido tranquilamente en el distrito federal de Sitka, un espacio temporal dependiente de Estados Unidos en el que los judíos han residido en paz. Sin embargo, el sueño de"un hogar para los judíos"parece llegar a su final, y una vez más la Historia los arrastra a un destino incierto. En este contexto el asesinato de un carismático miembro de la comunidad judía servirá para poner de manifiesto las poderosas fuerzas ocultas que manejan los habitantes de Sitka, así como la capacidad analítica del fabuloso detective Meyer Landsman.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; An absorbing, probing look at the conspiracy theories that operate on the sidelines of history and the reasons they continue to play such a seditious role, from an award-winning journalist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Our age is obsessed by the idea of conspiracy. We see it everywhere- from Pearl Harbor to 9/11, from the assassination of Kennedy to the death of Diana. In this age of terrorism we live in, the role of conspiracy is a serious one, one that can fuel radical or fringe elements to violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For David Aaronovitch, there came a time when he started to see a pattern among these inflammatory theories. these theories used similarly murky methods with which to insinu­ate their claims: they linked themselves to the supposed conspiracies of the past (it happened then so it can happen now); they carefully manipulated their evidence to hide its holes; they relied on the authority of dubious aca­demic sources. Most important, they elevated their believers to membership of an elite- a group of people able to see beyond lies to a higher reality. But why believe something that entails stretching the bounds of probabil­ity so far? Surely it is more likely that men did actually land on the moon in 1969 than that thousands of people were enlisted to fabricate an elaborate hoax.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this entertaining and enlightening book -aimed at providing ammunition for those who have found themselves at the wrong end of a conversation about moon landings or the twin towers-Aaronovitch carefully probes and explodes a dozen of the major conspiracy theories. In doing so, he examines why people believe them, and makes an argument for a true skepticism: one based on a thorough knowledge of history and a strong dose of common sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

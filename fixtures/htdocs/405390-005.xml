  <description>Adam Jordan wrote the best and worst articles of his journalistic career on the same day. The worst was bad enough to get him fired - but the best landed him a new job, penning lurid articles for &lt;em&gt;Real Detective&lt;/em&gt; magazine, one of the last of the true-crime pulps. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the case they've got him working on, involving a beauty pageant contestant found dead on an Atlantic City beach, is one some very powerful men would rather see covered up than covered. And if Adam keeps digging, he may find he's digging his own grave... </description>

  <description>THE GIRL WHO WOULDN'T DIE HUNTS THE KILLER WHO SHOULDN'T EXIST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future is not as loud as war, but it is relentless. It has a terrible fury all its own." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Curtis is a killer who stepped out of the past. Kirby Mazrachi is the girl who was never meant to have a future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirby is the last shining girl, one of the bright young women, burning with potential, whose lives Harper is destined to snuff out after he stumbles on a House in Depression-era Chicago that opens on to other times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the urging of the House, Harper inserts himself into the lives of the shining girls, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. He's the ultimate hunter, vanishing into another time after each murder, untraceable-until one of his victims survives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to bring her would-be killer to justice, Kirby joins the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; to work with the ex-homicide reporter, Dan Velasquez, who covered her case. Soon Kirby finds herself closing in on the impossible truth . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SHINING GIRLS is a masterful twist on the serial killer tale: a violent quantum leap featuring a memorable and appealing heroine in pursuit of a deadly criminal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A hurricane hinders a kidnapping and Spenser goes on a search for the man responsible? the infamous Gray Man, who has both helped and hunted Spenser in the past. &lt;br&gt; Heidi Bradshaw is wealthy, beautiful, and well connected ?and she needs Spenser's help. In a most unlikely request, Heidi, a notorious gold digger recently separated from her latest husband, recruits the Boston P.I. to accompany her to her private island, Tashtego. The reason? To attend her daughter's wedding as a sort of stand-in husband and protector. Spenser consents, but only after it is established that his beloved Susan Silverman will also be in attendance. &lt;br&gt; It should be a straightforward job for Spenser: show up for appearances, have some drinks, and spend some quality time with Susan. But when Spenser's old nemesis Rugar?the Gray Man?arrives, Spenser realizes that something is amiss. A storm, a kidnapping, and murder tear apart what should be a joyous occasion, and Rugar is seemingly at the center of it all. The only thing is that the sloppy kidnapping is not Rugar's style?as Spenser knows from past encounters. With six dead bodies and more questions than he can process, Spenser begins a search for answers?and the Gray Man. &lt;br&gt; With its razor-sharp dialogue, crisply etched characters, and high-wire narrative tension, "Rough Weather" once again proves that ?Robert B. Parker is a force of nature? ("The Boston Globe").</description>

  <description>1845. New York City forms its first police force. The great potato famine hits Ireland. These two seemingly disparate events will change New York City. Forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timothy Wilde tends bar near the Exchange, saving every dollar and shilling in hopes of winning the girl of his dreams. But when his dreams literally incinerate in a fire devastating downtown Manhattan, he finds himself disfigured, unemployed, and homeless. His older brother obtains Timothy a job in the newly minted NYPD, but he is highly skeptical of this untested "police force." And he is less than thrilled that his new beat is the notoriously down-and-out Sixth Ward-at the border of Five Points, the world's most notorious slum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night while returning from his rounds, heartsick and defeated, Timothy runs into a little slip of a girl—a girl not more than ten years old—dashing through the dark in her nightshift . . . covered head to toe in blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timothy knows he should take the girl to the House of Refuge, yet he can't bring himself to abandon her. Instead, he takes her home, where she spins wild stories, claiming that dozens of bodies are buried in the forest north of 23rd Street. Timothy isn't sure whether to believe her or not, but, as the truth unfolds, the reluctant copper star finds himself engaged in a battle for justice that nearly costs him his brother, his romantic obsession, and his own life.</description>

  <description>A savage, funny, and mysteriously poignant saga by a renowned author at the height of his powers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lionel Asbo, a terrifying yet weirdly loyal thug (self-named after England's notorious Anti-Social Behaviour Order), has always looked out for his ward and nephew, the orphaned Desmond Pepperdine.  He provides him with fatherly career advice (always carry a knife, for example) and is determined they should share the joys of pit bulls (fed with lots of Tabasco sauce), Internet porn, and all manner of more serious criminality.  Des, on the other hand, desires nothing more than books to read and a girl to love (and to protect a family secret that could be the death of him).  But just as he begins to lead a gentler, healthier life, his uncle—once again in a London prison—wins £140 million in the lottery and upon his release hires a public relations firm and begins dating a cannily ambitious topless model and “poet.”  Strangely, however, Lionel's true nature remains uncompromised while his problems, and therefore also Desmond's, seem only to multiply.</description>

  <description>When a simple case turns into a treacherous and politically charged investigation, Spenser faces his most difficult challenge yet-keeping his cool while his beloved Susan Silverman is in danger. Spenser knows something's amiss the moment Dennis Doherty walks into his office. The guy's aggressive yet wary, in the way men frightened for their marriages always are. So when Doherty asks Spenser to investigate his wife Jordan's abnormal behavior, Spenser agrees. A job's a job, after all. Not surprisingly, Spenser catches Jordan with another man, tells Dennis what he's found out, and considers the case closed. But a couple of days later, all hell breaks loose, and three people are dead. This isn't just a marital affair gone bad. Spenser is in the middle of hornet's nest of trouble, and he's got to get out of it without getting stung. With Hawk watching his back, and gun-for- hire Vinnie Morris providing extra cover, Spenser delves into a complicated and far-reaching operation: Jordan's former lover, Perry Alderson, is the leader of a group that helps sponsor terrorists. But Perry doesn't like Spenser poking around his business, so he decides to get to Spenser through Susan. The Boston P.I. will use all his connections both above and below the law to uncover the truth behind Perry's antigovernment organization. But what Alderson doesn't realize is that Spenser will stop at absolutely nothing to keep Susan out of harm's way; nothing will keep him from the woman he loves.</description>

  <description>Harlan Coben, the master of domestic suspense, returns with a standalone thriller in the vein of #1 bestsellers Hold Tight, Caught and Stay Close that explores the depth and passion of a lost love . . . and the secrets and lies at its heart. Six years have passed since Jake Fisher watched Natalie, the love of his life, marry another man. Six years of hiding a broken heart by throwing himself into his career as a college professor. Six years of keeping his promise to leave Natalie alone, and six years of tortured dreams of her life with her new husband, Todd. But six years haven’t come close to extinguishing his feelings, and when Jake comes across Todd’s obituary, he can’t keep himself away from the funeral. There he gets the glimpse of Todd’s wife he’s hoping for . . . but she is not Natalie. Whoever the mourning widow is, she’s been married to Todd for more than a decade, and with that fact everything Jake thought he knew about the best time of his life—a time he has never gotten over—is turned completely inside out. As Jake searches for the truth, his picture-perfect memories of Natalie begin to unravel. Mutual friends of the couple either can’t be found or don’t remember Jake. No one has seen Natalie in years. Jake’s search for the woman who broke his heart—and who lied to him—soon puts his very life at risk as it dawns on him that the man he has become may be based on carefully constructed fiction. Harlan Coben once again delivers a shocking page-turner that deftly explores the power of past love and the secrets and lies that such love can hide.</description>

  <description>It's 1954, and a rabble-rousing social critic has declared war on comic books - especially the scary, gory, bloody sort published by the bad boys of the industry, EF Comics. But on the way to a Senate hearing on whether these depraved publications should be banned, the would-be censor meets a violent end of his own - leaving his opponents in hot water.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Jack Starr, private eye to the funny-book industry, and his beautiful boss Maggie unravel the secret of Dr. Frederick's gruesome demise?  Or will the crackdown come, falling like an executioner's axe...?</description>

  <description>A client from a decades-old case reaches out to Boston PI Spenser-but can he rescue troubled April Kyle once more? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Longtime Spenser fans will remember that once upon a time, though not so long ago, there was a girl named April Kyle-a beautiful teenage runaway who turned to prostitution to escape her terrible family life. The book was 1982's &lt;em&gt;Ceremony&lt;/em&gt;, and, thanks to Spenser, April escaped Boston's "Combat Zone" for the relative safety of a high-class New York City bordello. April resurfaced in &lt;em&gt;Taming a Sea-Horse&lt;/em&gt;, again in dire need of Spenser's rescue-this time from the clutches of a controlling lover. But April Kyle's return in &lt;em&gt;Hundred-Dollar Baby&lt;/em&gt; is nothing short of shocking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When a mature, beautiful, and composed April strides into Spenser's office, the Boston PI barely hesitates before recognizing his once and future client. Now a well-established madam herself, April oversees an upscale call-girl operation in Boston's Back Bay. Still looking for Spenser's approval, it takes her a moment before she can ask him, again, for his assistance. Her business is a success; what's more, it's an all-female enterprise. Now that some men are trying to take it away from her, she needs Spenser. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; April claims to be in the dark about who it is that's trying to shake her down, but with a bit of legwork and a bit more muscle, Spenser and Hawk find ties to organized crime and local kingpin Tony Marcus, as well as a scheme to franchise the operation across the country. As Spenser again plays the gallant knight, it becomes clear that April's not as innocent as she seems. In fact, she may be her own worst enemy.</description>

  <description>"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fifteen-year-old Dell Parsons' parents rob a bank, his sense of normal life is forever altered. In an instant, this private cataclysm drives his life into before and after, a threshold that can never be uncrossed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His parents' arrest and imprisonment mean a threatening and uncertain future for Dell and his twin sister, Berner. Willful and burning with resentment, Berner flees their home in Montana, abandoning her brother and her life. But Dell is not completely alone. A family friend intervenes, spiriting him across the Canadian border, in hopes of delivering him to a better life. There, afloat on the prairie of Saskatchewan, Dell is taken in by Arthur Remlinger, an enigmatic and charismatic American whose cool reserve masks a dark and violent nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undone by the calamity of his parents' robbery and arrest, Dell struggles under the vast prairie sky to remake himself and define the adults he thought he knew. But his search for grace and peace only moves him nearer to a harrowing and murderous collision with Remlinger, an elemental force of darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A true masterwork of haunting and spectacular vision from one of America's greatest writers, &lt;em&gt;Canada&lt;/em&gt; is a profound novel of boundaries traversed, innocence lost and reconciled, and the mysterious and consoling bonds of family. Told in spare, elegant prose, both resonant and luminous, it is destined to become a classic.</description>

  <description>Stunningly dark, hugely intelligent and thoroughly addictive,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghostman &lt;/em&gt;announces the arrival of an exciting and highly distinctive novelist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When a casino robbery in Atlantic City goes horribly awry, the man who orchestrated it is obliged to call in a favor from someone who’s occasionally called Jack. While it’s doubtful that anyone knows his actual name or anything at all about his true identity, or even if he’s still alive, he’s in his mid-thirties and lives completely off the grid, a criminal’s criminal who does entirely as he pleases and is almost impossible to get in touch with. But within hours a private jet is flying this exceptionally experienced fixer and cleaner-upper from Seattle to New Jersey and right into a spectacular mess: one heister dead in the parking lot, another winged but on the run, the shooter a complete mystery, the $1.2 million in freshly printed bills god knows where and the FBI already waiting for Jack at the airport, to be joined shortly by other extremely interested and elusive parties. He has only forty-eight hours until the twice-stolen cash literally explodes, taking with it the wider, byzantine ambitions behind the theft. To contend with all this will require every gram of his skill, ingenuity and self-protective instincts, especially when offense and defense soon become meaningless terms. And as he maneuvers these exceedingly slippery slopes, he relives the botched bank robbery in Kuala Lumpur five years earlier that has now landed him this unwanted new assignment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From its riveting opening pages, &lt;em&gt;Ghostman &lt;/em&gt;effortlessly pulls the reader into Jack’s refined and peculiar world—and the sophisticated shadowboxing grows ever more intense as he moves, hour by hour, toward a  constantly reimprovised solution. With a quicksilver plot, gripping prose and masterly expertise, Roger Hobbs has given us a novel that will immediately place him in the company of our most esteemed crime writers. </description>

  <description>What’s the point in solving murders if we’re all going to die soon, anyway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Hank Palace has faced this question ever since asteroid 2011GV1 hovered into view. There’s no chance left. No hope. Just six precious months until impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Policeman&lt;/em&gt; presents a fascinating portrait of a pre-apocalyptic United States. The economy spirals downward while crops rot in the fields. Churches and synagogues are packed. People all over the world are walking off the job—but not Hank Palace. He’s investigating a death by hanging in a city that sees a dozen suicides every week—except this one feels suspicious, and Palace is the only cop who cares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first in a trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The Last Policeman&lt;/em&gt; offers a mystery set on the brink of an apocalypse. As Palace’s investigation plays out under the shadow of 2011GV1, we’re confronted by hard questions way beyond “whodunit.” &lt;em&gt;What basis does civilization rest upon? What is life worth? What would any of us do, what would we really do, if our days were numbered?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The explosive new masterpiece of suspense from the #1 New York Times' bestselling author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LAPD cop Scott James is not doing so well. Eight months ago, a shocking nighttime assault by unidentified men killed his partner Stephanie, nearly killed him, and left him enraged, ashamed, and ready to explode. He is unfit for duty...until he meets his new partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie is not doing so well, either. A German shepherd who survived three tours in Iraq and Afghanistan sniffing explosives before losing her handler to an IED, her PTSD is as bad as Scott's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are each other's last chance. Shunned and shunted to the side, they set out to investigate the one case that no one wants them to touch: the identity of the men who murdered Stephanie.  What they begin to find is nothing like what Scott has been told, and the journey will take them both through the darkest moments of their own personal hells. Whether they will make it out again, no one can say.</description>

  <description>From Mark Bowden, the preeminent chronicler of our military and special forces, comes &lt;em&gt;The Finish&lt;/em&gt;, a gripping account of the hunt for Osama bin Laden. With access to key sources, Bowden takes us inside the rooms where decisions were made and on the ground where the action unfolded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After masterminding the attacks of September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden managed to vanish. Over the next ten years, as Bowden shows, America found that its war with al Qaeda—a scattered group of individuals who were almost impossible to track—demanded an innovative approach. Step by step, Bowden describes the development of a new tactical strategy to fight this war—the fusion of intel from various agencies and on-the-ground special ops. After thousands of special forces missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, the right weapon to go after bin Laden had finally evolved. By Spring 2011, intelligence pointed to a compound in Abbottabad; it was estimated that there was a 50/50 chance that Osama was there. Bowden shows how three strategies were mooted: a drone strike, a precision bombing, or an assault by Navy SEALs. In the end, the President had to make the final decision. It was time for the finish.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>As the summer of 2004 draws to a close, Archy Stallings and Nat Jaffe are still hanging in there—longtime friends, bandmates, and co-regents of Brokeland Records, a kingdom of used vinyl located in the borderlands of Berkeley and Oakland. Their wives, Gwen Shanks and Aviva Roth-Jaffe, are the Berkeley Birth Partners, two semi-legendary midwives who have welcomed more than a thousand newly minted citizens into the dented utopia at whose heart—half tavern, half temple—stands Brokeland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When ex-NFL quarterback Gibson Goode, the fifth-richest black man in America, announces plans to build his latest Dogpile megastore on a nearby stretch of Telegraph Avenue, Nat and Archy fear it means certain doom for their vulnerable little enterprise. Meanwhile, Aviva and Gwen also find themselves caught up in a battle for their professional existence, one that tests the limits of their friendship. Adding another layer of complication to the couples' already tangled lives is the surprise appearance of Titus Joyner, the teenage son Archy has never acknowledged and the love of fifteen-year-old Julius Jaffe's life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An intimate epic, a NorCal &lt;em&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/em&gt; set to the funky beat of classic vinyl soul-jazz and pulsing with a virtuosic, pyrotechnical style all its own, &lt;em&gt;Telegraph Avenue&lt;/em&gt; is the great American novel we've been waiting for. Generous, imaginative, funny, moving, thrilling, humane, and triumphant.</description>

  <description>Penzler Pick, May 2000: Like many authors with ongoing characters, Robert Crais has taken a break from his famous private eye. After eight novels featuring Elvis Cole and his loyal sidekick Joe Pike, Crais has created Carol Starkey, a bomb squad veteran now doing time as a Detective-2 with LAPD's Criminal Conspiracy Section. Three years have passed since the detonation that killed Carol's partner and lover, but she is still severely scarred both mentally and physically. She can't bear to look in the mirror, and she hasn't been with another man since David Boudreaux left her bed that last morning he went to work. She gets through the day with the help of Tagamet and alcohol.&lt;br&gt;When a bomb call takes the life of another colleague, Carol begins to investigate a series of explosions that seem to be designed to exterminate bomb technicians. She soon realizes that she's "the one that got away." With the help of an FBI agent whom she loathes professionally for interfering with her job but finds attractive anyway, Carol must track down one of the most frighteningly brilliant killers of the modern age. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This edgy thriller's protagonist is one that the reader at first may have difficulty liking, but she's got a background and history that make her truly three-dimensional. One hopes that Crais, one of the handful of young crime writers capable of writing consistently luminous prose, will continue to give us characters like Carol Starkey to star in his always powerful portraits of modern-day Los Angeles. --Otto Penzler --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Warren Ellis reimagines New York City as a puzzle with the most dangerous pieces of all: GUNS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a shootout claims the life of his partner in a condemned tenement building on Pearl Street, Detective John Tallow unwittingly stumbles across an apartment stacked high with guns. When examined, each weapon leads to a different, previously unsolved murder. Someone has been killing people for twenty years or more and storing the weapons together for some inexplicable purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confronted with the sudden emergence of hundreds of unsolved homicides, Tallow soon discovers that he's walked into a veritable deal with the devil. An unholy bargain that has made possible the rise of some of Manhattan's most prominent captains of industry. A hunter who performs his deadly acts as a sacrifice to the old gods of Manhattan, who may, quite simply, be the most prolific murderer in New York City's history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warren Ellis's body of work has been championed by &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; for its "merciless action" and "incorruptible bravery," and steadily amassed legions of diehard fans. His newest novel builds on his accomplishments like never before, announcing Ellis as one of today's most daring thriller writers. This is twenty-first century suspense writ large. This is GUN MACHINE.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE EPIC STORY OF &lt;em&gt;THE PASSAGE&lt;/em&gt; CONTINUES...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of &lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt;, the great viral plague had left a small group of survivors clinging to life amidst a world transformed into a nightmare. In the second volume of this epic trilogy, this same group of survivors, led by the mysterious, charismatic Amy, go on the attack, leading an insurrection against the virals: the first offensives of the Second Viral War.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To do this, they must infiltrate a dozen hives, each presided over by one of the original Twelve. Their secret weapon: Alicia, transformed at the end of book one into a half human, half viral—but whose side, in the end, is she really on?</description>

  <description>Burke is one of the most cold-blooded yet strangely honorable heroes in the history of crime fiction, an outlaw who makes his living by preying on the most vicious of New York City's bottom-feeders, those who thrive on the suffering of children. In Andrew Vachss's tautly engrossing novel Burke is given a purse full of dirty money to find the infamous Ghost Van that is cutting a lethal swath among the teenage prostitutes in the hood. He also gets help in the form of a stripper named Belle, whose moves on the runway are outclassed only by what she can do in a getaway car. But not even Burke is prepared for the evil that is behind the Ghost Van or for the sheer menace of its guardian, a cadaverous karate expert who enjoys killing so much that he has named himself after death. A book so ferocious, with characters so venal and actions so breakneck, that you dare not get in the way...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.  Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it.  District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>Meet Nick Monday: a private detective who&amp;amp;#8217;s more Columbo than Sam Spade, more Magnum P.I. than Philip Marlowe. As San Francisco&amp;amp;#8217;s infamous luck poacher, Nick doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether his ability to swipe other people&amp;amp;#8217;s fortunes with a simple handshake is a blessing or a curse. Ever since his youth, Nick has swallowed more than a few bitter truths when it comes to wheeling and dealing in destinies. Because whether the highest bidders of Nick&amp;amp;#8217;s serendipitous booty are celebrities, yuppies, or douche bag vegans, the unsavory fact remains: luck is the most powerful, addictive, and dangerous drug of them all. And no amount of cappuccinos, Lucky Charms, or apple fritters can sweeten the notion that Nick might be exactly what his father once claimed&amp;amp;#8212;as ambitious as a fart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until Tuesday Knight, the curvy brunette who also happens to be the mayor&amp;amp;#8217;s daughter, approaches Nick with an irresistible offer: $100,000 to retrieve her father&amp;amp;#8217;s stolen luck. Could this high-stakes deal let Nick do right? Or will kowtowing to another greedmonger&amp;amp;#8217;s demands simply fund Nick&amp;amp;#8217;s addiction to corporate coffee bars while his morality drains down the toilet? Before he downs his next mocha, Nick finds himself at the mercy of a Chinese mafia kingpin and with no choice but to scour the city for the purest kind of luck, a hunt more titillating than softcore porn. All he has to do to stay ahead of the game is remember that you can&amp;amp;#8217;t take something from someone without eventually paying like hell for it. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.  She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.  Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>One of the most talented and creative authors working today, Neal Stephenson is renowned for his exceptional novels—works colossal in vision and mind-boggling in complexity. Exploring and blending a diversity of topics, including technology, economics, history, science, pop culture, and philosophy, his books are the products of a keen and adventurous intellect. Not surprisingly, Stephenson is regularly asked to contribute articles, lectures, and essays to numerous outlets, from major newspapers and cutting-edge magazines to college symposia. This remarkable collection brings together previously published short writings, both fiction and nonfiction, as well as a new essay (and an extremely short story) created specifically for this volume.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephenson ponders a wealth of subjects, from movies and politics to David Foster Wallace and the Midwestern American College Town; video games to classics-based sci-fi; how geekdom has become cool and how science fiction has become mainstream (whether people admit it or not); the future of publishing and the origins of his novels. Playful and provocative, &lt;em&gt;Some Remarks&lt;/em&gt; displays Stephenson's opinions and ideas on:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Internet, our dwindling national attention span, and the cultural importance of books and bookishness&lt;br&gt;Waco, religion, and the cluelessness of secular society&lt;br&gt;Metaphysics and the battle between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&lt;br&gt;The laying of the longest wire on Earth—and why it matters to you&lt;br&gt;Technology, freedom, commerce, and the Chinese&lt;br&gt;How &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;300&lt;/em&gt; mirror who we are today and what that spells for our future&lt;br&gt;Modern Jedi knights, a.k.a. scientists and technologists, and why they are admired and feared by both the left and the right&lt;br&gt;By turns amusing and profound, critical and celebratory, yet always entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Some Remarks&lt;/em&gt; offers a fascinating look into the prismatic mind of this extraordinary writer.</description>

  <description>"A lost world, man-eating tribesmen, lush impenetrable jungles, stranded American fliers (one of them a dame with great gams, for heaven's sake), a startling rescue mission. This is a true story made in heaven for a writer as talented as Mitchell Zuckoff. Whew--what an utterly compelling &amp;amp; deeply satisfying read!"--Simon Winchester&lt;br&gt;Former Boston Globe reporter Mitchell Zuckoff unleashes the exhilarating, untold story of an extraordinary World War II rescue mission, where a plane crash in the South Pacific plunged a trio of U.S. military personnel into a land that time forgot. Fans of Hampton Sides' Ghost Soldiers, Marcus Luttrell's Lone Survivor &amp;amp; David Grann's The Lost City of Z will be captivated by Zuckoff's masterfully recounted, all-true story of danger, daring, determination &amp;amp; discovery in jungle-clad New Guinea during the final days of WWII.</description>

  <description>Fegan has been a “hard man,” an IRA killer in northern Ireland. Now that peace has come, he is being haunted day and night by twelve ghosts: a mother and infant, a schoolboy, a butcher, an RUC constable, and seven other of his innocent victims. In order to appease them, he’s going to have to kill the men who gave him orders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he’s working his way down the list he encounters a woman who may offer him redemption; she has borne a child to an RUC officer and is an outsider too. Now he has given Fate—and his quarry—a hostage. Is this Fegan’s ultimate mistake?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stuart Neville is a partner in a multimedia design business based in Armagh, northern Ireland. &lt;strong&gt;This novel, also known as The Twelve in the UK and Ireland, is the first in a series.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[As part of the DC’s reboot of the month, the New 52, Bruce Wayne is back as Batman.  I won’t be reading any other New 52 stuff because DC is addicted to retconning, and I don’t want to be an enabler.  However, this one seems to have kept a big chunk of recent Bat-happenings.

  <description>Welcome to the second issue of Blood &amp;amp; Tacos! There was a time when paperback racks were full of men’s adventure series. Next to the Louis L’Amours, one could find the adventures of The Executioner, the Destroyer, the Death Merchant, and many more action heroes that were hell-bent on bringing America back from the brink. That time was the 1970s &amp;amp; ’80s. A bygone era filled with wide-eyed innocence and mustaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those stories are back! The new quarterly magazine Blood &amp;amp; Tacos is bringing back the action, the fun, and the adventure. Also, the mustaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In each issue of Blood &amp;amp; Tacos, some of today’s hottest crime writers will choose an era and create a new pulp hero and deliver a brand-new adventure. Each issue will include 5-6 stories featuring action-packed mayhem written in the style of that bygone era. The stories might not always be politically correct, but whether satire or homage, they will deliver on every page. Fast and fun, action and adventure, Blood &amp;amp; Tacos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the stories weren’t enough, Blood &amp;amp; Tacos will also feature fine pulpy art, reviews of some of the fine (and not so fine) novels from the same period, and maybe even a recipe or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So enjoy this serving of Blood &amp;amp; Tacos. And remember, if it’s too cheesy, it’s a quesadilla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Tacos is the brainchild of Johnny Shaw, screenwriter and author of the novel Dove Season: A Jimmy Veeder Fiasco. When he’s not writing or teaching, he is usually in an undisclosed warzone working as the demolitions expert in the mercenary group, The Bushmasters. He also enjoys badminton. His website can be found at Johnnyshaw.net. Or follow him on Twitter at @BloodandTacos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Tacos is published by Creative Guy Publishing, the company that brought you such fine books as Amityville House of Pancakes (Vols 1-3), Stays Crunchy in Milk, Installing Linux on a Dead Badger, Brine, and many others with odd titles but excellent stories.</description>

  <description>The world we knew is gone. The world of commerce and frivolous necessity has been replaced by a world of survival and responsibility. An epidemic of apocalyptic proportions has swept the globe, causing the dead to rise and feed on the living. In a matter of months society has crumbled: no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. In a world ruled by the dead, the survivors are forced to finally start living. The events of No Way Out have affected everyone in the Community, and not everyone has survived to pick up the pieces. Reprinting issues #85-90 of the Eisner Award-winning series, The Walking Dead.

  <description>In the southernmost Los Angeles district of San Pedro, one of the world’s busiest harbors, an unlikely pair of lovers are unwittingly caught between the two warring sides of the law. When Dinko Babich, a young longshoreman, delivers Lita Medina, a young Mexican dancer, from the harbor to a Hollywood nightclub, theirs lives are forever changed, as their love develops among the myriad cops and criminals who occupy the harbor.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Part noir, part psychedelic romp, all Thomas Pynchon- private eye Doc Sportello comes, occasionally, out of a marijuana haze to watch the end of an era as free love slips away and paranoia creeps in with the L.A. fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's been awhile since Doc Sportello has seen his ex-girlfriend. Suddenly out of nowhere she shows up with a story about a plot to kidnap a billionaire land developer whom she just happens to be in love with. Easy for her to say. It's the tail end of the psychedelic sixties in L.A., and Doc knows that "love" is another of those words going around at the moment, like "trip" or "groovy," except that this one usually leads to trouble. Despite which he soon finds himself drawn into a bizarre tangle of motives and passions whose cast of characters includes surfers, hustlers, dopers and rockers, a murderous loan shark, a tenor sax player working undercover, an ex-con with a swastika tattoo and a fondness for Ethel Merman, and a mysterious entity known as the Golden Fang, which may only be a tax dodge set up by some dentists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this lively yarn, Thomas Pynchon, working in an unaccustomed genre, provides a classic illustration of the principle that if you can remember the sixties, you weren't there . . . or . . . if you were there, then you . . . or, wait, is it . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Lucas Davenport has seen many terrible murder scenes. This is one of the worst. In the small Minnesota town of Wayzata, an entire family has been killed—husband, wife, two daughters, dogs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There’s something about the scene that pokes at Lucas’s cop instincts—it looks an awful lot like the kind of scorched-earth retribution he’s seen in drug killings sometimes. But this is a seriously upscale town, and the husband was an executive vice president at a big bank. It just doesn’t seem to fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Until it does. And where it leads Lucas will take him into the darkest nightmare of his life.</description>

  <description>Carl Streator is a reporter investigating Sudden Infant Death Syndrome for a soft-news feature. After responding to several calls with paramedics, he notices that all the dead children were read the same poem from the same library book the night before they died. It's a 'culling song' - an ancient African spell for euthanising sick or old people. Researching it, he meets a woman who killed her own child with it accidentally. He himself accidentally killed his own wife and child with the same poem twenty years earlier. Together, the man and the woman must find and destroy all copies of this book, and try not to kill every rude sonofabitch that gets in their way. &lt;em&gt;Lullaby&lt;/em&gt; is a comedy/drama/tragedy. In that order. It may also be Chuck Palahniuk's best book yet.</description>

      <![CDATA[To most people a lullaby is a soothing song meant to help coax a child to sleep, but in Chuck Palahniuk’s hands it becomes a death spell that can kill anyone. Of course, that’s not twisted enough for Chuckie P. so he had to throw in some witchcraft, necrophilia and dead babies to really make it a...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fast-paced literary thriller that recalls dystopian classics such as &lt;em&gt;1984 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fahrenheit 451&lt;/em&gt;, from the award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Last Town on Earth&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Zed is an agent from the future. A time when the world's problems have been solved. No hunger. No war. No despair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His mission is to keep it that way. Even if it means ensuring every cataclysm throughout history runs its course-especially The Great Conflagration, an imminent disaster in our own time that Zed has been ordered to protect at all costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zed's mission will disrupt the lives of a disgraced former CIA agent; a young Washington lawyer grieving over the loss of her brother, a soldier in Iraq; the oppressed employee of a foreign diplomat; and countless others. But will he finish his final mission before the present takes precedence over a perfect future? One that may have more cracks than he realizes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Revisionists&lt;/em&gt; puts a fresh spin on today's global crises, playing with the nature of history and our own role in shaping it. It firmly establishes Mullen as one of the most exciting and imaginative writers of his generation.</description>

  <description>From one of our most esteemed historical novelists, a remarkable retelling of the Watergate scandal, as seen through a kaleidoscope of its colorful perpetrators and investigators.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For all the monumental documentation that Watergate generated—uncountable volumes of committee records, court transcripts, and memoirs—it falls at last to a novelist to perform the work of inference (and invention) that allows us to solve some of the scandal’s greatest mysteries (who &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; erase those eighteen-and-a-half minutes of tape?) and to see this gaudy American catastrophe in its human entirety. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Watergate, &lt;/em&gt;Thomas Mallon conveys the drama and high comedy of the Nixon presidency through the urgent perspectives of seven characters we only thought we knew before now, moving readers from the private cabins of Camp David to the klieg lights of the Senate Caucus Room, from the District of Columbia jail to the Dupont Circle mansion of Theodore Roosevelt’s sharp-tongued ninety-year-old daughter (“The clock is dick-dick-dicking”), and into the hive of the Watergate complex itself, home not only to the Democratic National Committee but also to the president’s attorney general, his recklessly loyal secretary, and the shadowy man from Mississippi who pays out hush money to the burglars.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Praised by Christopher Hitchens for his “splendid evocation of Washington,” Mallon achieves with &lt;em&gt;Watergate &lt;/em&gt;a scope and historical intimacy that surpasses even what he attained in his previous novels, as he turns a “third-rate burglary” into a tumultuous, first-rate entertainment.</description>

  <description>Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship &lt;em&gt;Intrepid&lt;/em&gt;, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456. It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that (1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces, (2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations, and (3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding of what the starship &lt;em&gt;Intrepid &lt;/em&gt;really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.</description>

  <description>For maverick Lapd homicide detective Harry Bosch, the body in the drainpipe at Mulholland Dam is more than another anonymous statistic. This one is personal...because the murdered man was a fellow Vietnam "tunnel rat" who had fought side by side with him in a hellish underground war. Now Bosch is about to relive the horror of Nam. From a dangerous maze of blind alleys to a daring criminal heist beneath the city, his survival instincts will once again be tested to their limit. Pitted against enemies inside his own department and forced to make the agonizing choice between justice and vengeance, Bosch goes on the hunt for a killer whose true face will shock him.</description>

  <description>Sunshine State trivia buff Serge A. Storms loves eliminating jerks and pests. His drug-addled partner Coleman loves cartoons. Hot stripper Sharon Rhodes loves cocaine, especially when purchased with rich dead men's money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, there's Sean and David, who love fishing and are kind to animals -- and who are about to cross paths with a suitcase filled with $5 million in stolen insurance money. Serge wants the suitcase. Sharon wants the suitcase. Coleman wants more drugs . . . and the suitcase. In the meantime, there's murder by gun, Space Shuttle, Barbie doll, and Levi's 501s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other words, welcome to Tim Dorsey's Florida -- where nobody gets out unscathed and untanned!</description>

  <description>Joe Pickett is the new game warden in Twelve Sleep, Wyoming, a town where nearly everyone hunts and the game warden--especially one like Joe who won't take bribes or look the other way--is far from popular. When he finds a local hunting outfitter dead, splayed out on the woodpile behind his state-owned home, he takes it personally. There had to be a reason that the outfitter, with whom he's had run-ins before, chose his backyard, his woodpile to die in. Even after the "outfitter murders," as they have been dubbed by the local press after the discovery of the two more bodies, are solved, Joe continues to investigate, uneasy with the easy explanation offered by the local police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Joe digs deeper into the murders, he soon discovers that the outfitter brought more than death to his backdoor: he brought Joe an endangered species, thought to be extinct, which is now living in his woodpile. But if word of the existence of this endangered species gets out, it will destroy any chance of InterWest, a multi-national natural gas company, building an oil pipeline that would bring the company billions of dollars across Wyoming, through the mountains and forests of Twelve Sleep. The closer Joe comes to the truth behind the outfitter murders, the endangered species and InterWest, the closer he comes to losing everything he holds dear.</description>

  <description>There isn't much sun in the fun when a billionaire real estate tycoon is found murdered on the Tilt-A-Whirl at a seedy seaside amusement park in the otherwise quiet summer tourist town of Sea Haven. John Ceepak, a former MP just back from Iraq, has just joined the Sea Haven police department. The job offer came from an old army buddy who hoped to give Ceepak at least a summer's worth of rest and relaxation to help him forget the horrors of war. Instead, Ceepak will head up the murder investigation. He is partnered with Danny Boyle, a 24-year-old part-time summer cop who doesn't carry a gun and only works with the police by day so he has enough pocket money left over to play with his beach buddies at night. In the first novel in a new series written in the spirit of Carl Hiaasen's work, the Tilt-A-Whirl murder pushes Ceepak's deep sense of honor and integrity to the limits, as unexpected twists and turns keep the truth spinning wildly in every direction.</description>

  <description>An epic novel and a thrilling literary discovery, &lt;em&gt;The Orphan Master’s Son&lt;/em&gt; follows a young man’s journey through the icy waters, dark tunnels, and eerie spy chambers of the world’s most mysterious dictatorship, North Korea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pak Jun Do is the haunted son of a lost mother—a singer “stolen” to Pyongyang—and an influential father who runs Long Tomorrows, a work camp for orphans. There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Considering himself “a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,” Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress “so pure, she didn’t know what starving people looked like.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, &lt;em&gt;The Orphan Master’s Son&lt;/em&gt; is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love. A towering literary achievement, &lt;em&gt;The Orphan Master’s Son&lt;/em&gt; ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today’s greatest writers.</description>

  <description>The newest Palahniuk novel concerns Madison, a thirteen year old girl who finds herself in Hell, unsure of why she will be there for all eternity, but tries to make the best of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author described the novel as "if The Shawshank Redemption had a baby by The Lovely Bones and it was raised by Judy Blume." And "it's kind of like The Breakfast Club set in Hell."</description>

  <description>Absolutely nothing is sacred to Christopher Moore. The phenomenally popular New York Times-bestselling satirist, whom the Atlanta Journal-Constitution calls “Stephen King with a whoopee cushion and a double-espresso imagination,” has already lampooned Shakespeare, San Francisco vampires, marine biologists, Death... even Jesus Christ and Santa Claus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his latest novel, the immortal Moore takes on the Great French Masters. A magnificent “Comedy d’Art” from the author of &lt;em&gt;Lamb&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fool&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bite Me&lt;/em&gt;, Moore’s &lt;em&gt;Sacre Bleu&lt;/em&gt; is part mystery, part history (sort of), part love story, and wholly hilarious as it follows a young baker-painter who joins the dapper  Henri Toulouse-Lautrec on a quest to unravel the mystery behind the supposed suicide of Vincent van Gogh.</description>

  <description>The revered &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author, recognized as “America’s greatest crime writer” (&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;), brings back U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, the mesmerizing hero of &lt;em&gt;Pronto&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Riding the Rap&lt;/em&gt;, and the hit FX series &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the closing of the Harlan County, Kentucky, coal mines, marijuana has become the biggest cash crop in the state. A hundred pounds of it can gross $300,000, but that’s chump change compared to the quarter million a human body can get you—especially when it’s sold off piece by piece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Dickie and Coover Crowe, dope-dealing brothers known for sampling their own supply, decide to branch out into the body business, it’s up to U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens to stop them. But Raylan isn’t your average marshal; he’s the laconic, Stetson-wearing, fast-drawing lawman who juggles dozens of cases at a time and always shoots to kill. But by the time Raylan finds out who’s making the cuts, he’s lying naked in a bathtub, with Layla, the cool transplant nurse, about to go for his kidneys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bad guys are mostly gals this time around: Layla, the nurse who collects kidneys and sells them for ten grand a piece; Carol Conlan, a hard-charging coal-mine executive not above ordering a cohort to shoot point-blank a man who’s standing in her way; and Jackie Nevada, a beautiful sometime college student who can outplay anyone at the poker table and who suddenly finds herself being tracked by a handsome U.S. marshal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dark and droll, &lt;em&gt;Raylan&lt;/em&gt; is pure Elmore Leonard—a page-turner filled with the sparkling dialogue and sly suspense that are the hallmarks of this modern master.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Jewish scripture, there is a legend: There are thirty-six righteous people on earth. The thirty-six protect us. Without them, humanity would perish. But the thirty-six do not know they are the chosen ones.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Beijing, a monk collapses in his chamber, dead. A fiery mark&amp;amp;#8212;a tattoo? a burn?&amp;amp;#8212;spreads across his back and down his spine. In Mumbai, a beloved economist, a man who served the poor, dies suddenly. His corpse reveals the same symbol. Similar deaths are reported around the world&amp;amp;#8212;the victims all humanitarians, all with the same death mark. In Venice, an enterprising Italian policeman links the deaths, tracing the evidence. Who is killing good people around the world? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Copenhagen, police are preparing for a world climate summit when they receive the Interpol alert. The task falls to veteran detective Niels Bentzon: Find the &amp;amp;#8220;good people&amp;amp;#8221; of Denmark and warn them. But Bentzon is a man who is trained to see the worst in humanity, not the good. One by one, people are crossed off his list. He senses their secrets and wrongdoings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Bentzon is ready to give up, he meets Hannah Lund, a brilliant astrophysicist mourning the death of her son and the implosion of her marriage. With Hannah&amp;amp;#8217;s help, Bentzon begins to piece together the puzzle of these far-flung deaths. A pattern emerges. It is, they realize, a perfectly executed plan of murder. There have been thirty-four deaths&amp;amp;#8212;two more to come if the legend is true. According to the pattern, Bentzon and Hannah can predict the time and place of the final two murders. The deaths will occur in Venice and Copenhagen. And the time is now.</description>

  <description>It's hard to find work as a doctor when using your real name will get you killed. So hard that when a reclusive billionaire offers Dr. Peter Brown, aka Pietro Brnwa, a job accompanying a sexy but self-destructive paleontologist on the world's worst field assignment, Brown has no real choice but to say yes. Even if it means that an army of murderers, mobsters, and international drug dealers-not to mention the occasional lake monster-are about to have a serious Pietro Brnwa problem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing new and old monsters alike, Dr. Brnwa's story continues in this darkly funny and lightning-paced follow up to Josh Bazell's bestselling debut.</description>

  <description>This bestseller was the basis for the blockbuster film "Die Hard" starring Bruce Willis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High atop a Los Angeles skyscraper, an office Christmas party turns into a deadly cage-match between a lone New York City cop and a gang of international terrorists. Every action fan knows it could only be the explosive big-screen blockbuster Die Hard. But before Bruce Willis blew away audiences as unstoppable hero John McClane, author Roderick Thorp knocked out thriller readers with the bestseller that started it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dozen heavily armed terrorists have taken hostages, issued demands, and promised bloodshed all according to plan. But they haven't counted on a death-defying, one-man cavalry with no shoes, no backup, and no intention of going down easily. As hot-headed cops swarm outside, and cold-blooded killers wield machine guns and rocket launchers inside, the stage is set for the ultimate showdown between anti-hero and uber-villains. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good fight to the death. Ho ho ho!</description>

  <description>They were friends, brothers and teammates through all of Marvel's greatest adventures, but recent events turned them into the bitterest of enemies. In the wake of the Siege of Asgard Thor, Iron Man and Steve Rogers are brought together on the same side once more, but these great heroes can't truly trust each other yet. They better start soon because something only the Big Three can handle is tearing their world apart. This all-new, grand and dangerous adventure will catapult our heroes into the explosive Heroic Age and will unite comics legend Alan Davis with Avengers scribe Brian Bendis for the very first time. &lt;strong&gt;Collecting:&lt;/strong&gt; Avengers Prime #1-5</description>

  <description>On March 5, 2008, at 10:15 A.M., a hedge fund manager in Florida wrote a post on his investing advice Web site that included a startling statement about Bear Stearns &amp;amp; Co., the nation’s fifth-largest investment bank: “In my book, they are insolvent.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This seemed a bold and risky statement. Bear Stearns was about to announce profits of $115 million for the first quarter of 2008, had $17.3 billion in cash on hand, and, as the company incessantly boasted, had been a colossally profitable enterprise in the eighty-five years since its founding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten days later, Bear Stearns no longer existed, and the calamitous financial meltdown of 2008 had begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How this happened – and why – is the subject of William D. Cohan’s superb and shocking narrative that chronicles the fall of Bear Stearns and the end of the Second Gilded Age on Wall Street. Bear Stearns serves as the Rosetta Stone to explain how a combination of risky bets, corporate political infighting, lax government regulations and truly bad decision-making wrought havoc on the world financial system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cohan’s minute-by-minute account of those ten days in March makes for breathless reading, as the bankers at Bear Stearns struggled to contain the cascading series of events that would doom the firm, and as Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, New York Federal Reserve Bank President Tim Geithner, and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke began to realize the dire consequences for the world economy should the company go bankrupt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But HOUSE OF CARDS does more than recount the incredible panic of the first stages of the financial meltdown. William D. Cohan beautifully demonstrates&lt;em&gt; why&lt;/em&gt; the seemingly invincible Wall Street money machine came crashing down. He chronicles the swashbuckling corporate culture of Bear Stearns, the strangely crucial role competitive bridge played in the company’s fortunes, the brutal internecine battles for power, and the deadly combination of greed and inattention that helps to explain why the company’s leaders ignored the danger lurking in Bear’s huge positions in mortgage-backed securities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author deftly portrays larger-than-life personalities like Ace Greenberg, Bear Stearns’ miserly, take-no-prisoners chairman whose memos about re-using paper clips were legendary throughout Wall Street; his profane, colorful rival and eventual heir Jimmy Cayne, whose world-champion-level bridge skills were a lever in his corporate rise and became a symbol of the reasons for the firm’s demise; and Jamie Dimon, the blunt-talking CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who won the astonishing endgame of the saga (the Bear Stearns headquarters alone were worth more than JP Morgan paid for the whole company). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cohan’s explanation of seemingly arcane subjects like credit default swaps and fixed- income securities is masterful and crystal clear, but it is the high-end dish and powerful narrative drive that makes HOUSE OF CARDS an irresistible read on a par with classics such as LIAR’S POKER and BARBARIANS AT THE GATE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written with the novelistic verve and insider knowledge that made THE LAST TYCOONS a bestseller and a prize-winner, HOUSE OF CARDS is a chilling cautionary tale about greed, arrogance, and stupidity in the financial world, and the consequences for all of us.</description>

  <description>From its inception, Atlantic City has always been a town dedicated to the fast buck, and this wide-reaching history offers a riveting account of its past 100 years—from the city's heyday as a Prohibition-era mecca of lawlessness to its rebirth as a legitimate casino resort in the modern era. A colorful cast of characters, led by Enoch “Nucky” Johnson, populates this stranger-than-fiction account of corrupt politics and the toxic power structure that grew out of guile, finesse, and extortion. Atlantic City's shadowy past—through its rise, fall, and rebirth—is given new light in this revealing, and often appalling, study of legislative abuse and organized crime.</description>

  <description>The legendary Hollywood Hills are home to wealth, fame, and power--passing through the neighborhood, it's hard not to get a little greedy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LAPD veteran "Hollywood Nate" Weiss could take or leave the opulence, but he wouldn't say no to onscreen fame. He may get his shot when he catches the appreciative eye of B-list director Rudy Ressler, and his troublemaking fiancée, Leona Brueger, the older-but-still-foxy widow of a processed-meat tycoon. Nate tries to elude her crafty seductions, but consents to keep an eye on their estate in the Hollywood Hills while they're away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also minding the mansion is Raleigh Dibble, a hapless ex-con trying to put the past behind him. Raleigh is all too happy to be set up for the job--as butler-cum-watchdog--by Nigel Wickland, Leona's impeccably dressed art dealer. What Raleigh doesn't realize is that under the natty clothes and posh accent, Nigel has a nefarious plan: two paintings hanging on the mansion's walls will guarantee them more money than they've ever seen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone's dreams are just within reach--the only problem is, this is Hollywood. A circle of teenage burglars that the media has dubbed The Bling Ring has taken to pillaging the homes of Hollywood celebutants like Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan, and when a pair of drug-addled young copycats stumbles upon Nigel's heist, that's just the beginning of the disaster to come. Soon Hollywood Nate, surfer cops Flotsam and Jetsam, and the rest of the team at Hollywood Station have a deadly situation on their hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hollywood Hills&lt;/em&gt; is a raucous and dangerous roller coaster ride that showcases Joseph Wambaugh in vintage form.</description>

  <description>The #1 international bestseller from Jussi Adler-Olsen, author of The Absent One—perfect for fans of Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carl Mørck used to be one of Copenhagen’s best homicide detectives. Then a hail of bullets destroyed the lives of two fellow cops, and Carl—who didn’t draw his weapon—blames himself. So a promotion is the last thing he expects. But Department Q is a department of one, and Carl’s got only a stack of Copenhagen’s coldest cases for company. His colleagues snicker, but Carl may have the last laugh, because one file keeps nagging at him: a liberal politician vanished five years earlier and is presumed dead. But she isn’t dead … yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darkly humorous, propulsive, and atmospheric, The Keeper of Lost Causes introduces American readers to the mega-bestselling series fast becoming an international sensation.</description>

  <description>It's the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune--and remarkable power--to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved--that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt--among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life--and love--in the real world he's always been so desperate to escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world at stake. &lt;br&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize. &lt;br&gt;Are you ready?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly writes novels of brilliantly original suspense. In this electrifying tour de force, he takes us into a world of extremes: too much criminality, too much money, and too many ways to die. &lt;br&gt;In L.A. Cassie Black is another beautiful woman in a Porsche: except Cassie just did six years in prison and still has "outlaw juice" flowing in her veins. Now Cassie is returning to her old profession, taking down a money man in Vegas. But the perfect heist goes very wrong, and suddenly Cassie is on the run--with a near-psychotic Vegas "fixer" killing everyone who knew about the job. Between Cassie and the man hunting her are a few last secrets: like who really set up the job, why Cassie had to take the change, and how, in the end, it might all be a matter of the moon...&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>The time is 1933, the place, Berlin, when William E. Dodd becomes America’s first ambassador to Hitler’s Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the “New Germany,” she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romance—and ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitler’s true character and ruthless ambition.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre Göring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, &lt;em&gt;In the Garden of Beasts&lt;/em&gt; lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror.</description>

  <description>"On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travelers into the gulf below." With this celebrated sentence, Thornton Wilder begins &lt;em&gt;The Bridge of San Luis Rey,&lt;/em&gt; one of the towering achievements in American fiction and a novel read throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By chance, a monk witnesses the tragedy. Brother Juniper seeks to prove that it was divine intervention rather than chance that led to the deaths of those who perished in the tragedy. His study leads to his own death -- and to the author's timeless investigation into the nature of love and the meaning of the human condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&lt;/em&gt; is now reissued in this handsome hardcover edition featuring a new foreword by Russell Banks. Tappan Wilder has written an engaging and thought-provoking afterword, which includes unpublished notes for the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel, illuminating photographs, and other remarkable documentary material. Granville Hicks's insightful comment about Wilder suggests an inveterate truth: "As a craftsman he is second to none, and there are few who have looked deeper into the human heart."</description>

  <description>On location in Boston, bad-boy actor Jumbo Nelson is accused of the rape and murder of a young woman. From the start the case seems fishy, so the Boston PD calls on Spenser to investigate. Things don't look so good for Jumbo, whose appetites for food, booze, and sex are as outsized as his name. He was the studio's biggest star, but he's become its biggest liability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the course of the investigation, Spenser encounters Jumbo's bodyguard: a young, former football-playing Native American named Zebulon Sixkill. He acts tough, but Spenser sees something more within the young man. Despite the odd circumstances, the two forge an unlikely alliance, with Spenser serving as mentor for Sixkill. As the case grows darker and secrets about both Jumbo and the dead woman come to light, it's Spenser-with Sixkill at his side-who must put things right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Andrew Vachss's implacable private eye has a new client, Strega. She wants Burke to find an obscene photograph—and that search will take him into the ocean that flows just beneath the city, an ocean whose currents are flesh and money, the anguish of children and the pleasure of twisted adults. It is a place that Burke can visit only at the risk of his sanity and his life. But between the power of Strega and his own sense of justice, there is no turning back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Strega&lt;/em&gt; one of our most acclaimed crime writers gives us a thriller that might have been imagined by Dante. For this is a tour of hell with no stops left out, conducted by a novelist who writes with the authority of the damned.</description>

      <![CDATA[I’ve read a few of the Burke novels by Andrew Vachss so I knew there was a good chance that this book was probably as depressing as watching a puppy die from cancer.  So I decided to brighten it up by scoring some black market anti-depressants off the internet.  Here are my observations after takin...]]>

  <description>Bernie Rhodenbarr is a personable chap, a good neighbor, a passable poker player. His chosen profession, however, might not sit well with some. Bernie is a burglar, a good one, effortlessly lifting valuables from the not-so-well-protected abodes of well-to-do New Yorkers like a modern-day Robin Hood. (The poor, as Bernie would be the first to tell you, alas, have nothing worth stealing.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's not perfect, however; he occasionally makes mistakes. Like accepting a paid assignment from a total stranger to retrieve a particular item from a rich man's apartment. Like still being there when the cops arrive. Like having a freshly slain corpse lying in the next room, and no proof that Bernie isn't the killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now he's really got his hands full, having to locate the true perpetrator while somehow eluding the police -- a dirty job indeed, but if Bernie doesn't do it, who will?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; From "one of the best crime writers at work today" (Michael Connelly) comes a fast, funny, violent new noir crime classic—a Coen Brothers movie come to life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; He has been compared to Lehane, Ellroy, and Pelecanos, but Ace Atkins's rich, raucous, passionate blend of historical novel and crime story is all his own and never more so than in &lt;em&gt;Infamous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In July 1933, the gangster known as George "Machine Gun" Kelly staged the kidnapping-for-ransom of an Oklahoma oil­man. He would live to regret it. Kelly was never the sharpest knife in the drawer, and what started clean soon became messy, as two of his partners cut themselves into the action; a determined former Texas Ranger makes tracking Kelly his mission; and Kelly's wife, ever alert to her own self-interest, starts playing both ends against the middle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The result is a mesmerizing tale set in the first days of the modern FBI, featuring one of the best femmes fatales in history—the Lady Macbeth of Depression-era crime—a great unexpected hero, and some of the most colorful supporting characters in recent crime fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Watch a Video</description>

  <description>A corrupt African colonel has converted half his country's wealth into diamonds and smuggled them to a Manhattan safe house. Four upstanding citizens plan to rescue their new nation by stealing the diamonds back—with the help of a “specialist”—Parker, that is. He has the best references in town. Will Parker break his rule against working with amateurs and help them because his woman would be disappointed if he doesn’t? Or because three hired morons have threatened to kill him and his woman if he does? They thought they were buying an advantage, but what they get is a predated death certificate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Crime fiction stripped down—as it was meant to be. . . . Oh, how the pages keep turning.”—&lt;em&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Old master that he is, Stark does all of them one better.”—&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Stunning and brutally powerful, &lt;strong&gt;Falconer&lt;/strong&gt; tells the story of a man named Farragut, his crime and punishment, and his struggle to remain a man in a universe bent on beating him back into childhood. Only John Cheever could deliver these grand themes with the irony, unforced eloquence, and exhilarating humor that make &lt;strong&gt;Falconer&lt;/strong&gt; such a triumphant work of the moral imagination.</description>

  <description>Retired from his fighting days, John Perry is now village ombudsman for a human colony on distant Huckleberry. With his wife, former Special Forces warrior Jane Sagan, he farms several acres, adjudicates local disputes, and enjoys watching his adopted daughter grow up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until his and Jane's past reaches out to bring them back into the game--as leaders of a new human colony, to be peopled by settlers from all the major human worlds, for a deep political purpose that will put Perry and Sagan back in the thick of interstellar politics, betrayal, and war.</description>

But this blind quest for retribution has extremely hazardous mental and physical consequences as a careless and unhinged Batman suffers injury after injury.

An emotional and intense adventure, BATMAN: A LONELY PLACE OF DYING illustrates the true significance of Batman and Robin's relationship and also introduces a new Boy Wonder.</description>

  <description>The year was 2014. We had cured cancer. We had beaten the common cold. But in doing so we created something new, something terrible that no one could stop. The infection spread, virus blocks taking over bodies and minds with one, unstoppable command: &lt;strong&gt;FEED&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, twenty years after the Rising, bloggers Georgia and Shaun Mason are on the trail of the biggest story of their lives - the dark conspiracy behind the infected. The truth will get out, even if it kills them.</description>

  <description>Phil Hunt is in deep trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunt is on the run from two men: Drake, the deputy sheriff who intends to catch him, and Grady, the vicious hitman who means to kill him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty years Hunt has lived in Washington State, raising horses with his wife on his small farm. He's tried to stay out of trouble, wanting only to make a living and taking the occasional illicit job in order to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then his last delivery goes horribly wrong, and the chase is on from the mountains down into the Puget lowlands. To have any chance of rescuing his quiet life, Hunt will have to deal with deputy sheriff Bobby Drake, a good man determined to make up for his father's tainted legacy and Grady Fisher, a very bad man intent on making a name for himself in the most violent ways. With a fondness for blood, Grady takes pleasure in the use of knives, taking Hunt's life apart piece by piece, all the while leaving a trail of victims across the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relentless and gorgeously written, with original characters and a vividly powerful sense of place, &lt;em&gt;The Terror of Living&lt;/em&gt; heralds the arrival of a writer who will be compared with the great suspense novelists.</description>

  <description>An oddly compelling, often hilarious forensic exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadavers some willingly, some unwittingly have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They've tested France's first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender reassignment surgery, cadavers have been there alongside surgeons, making history in their quiet way. In this fascinating, ennobling account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries from the anatomy labs and human-sourced pharmacies of medieval and nineteenth-century Europe to a human decay research facility in Tennessee, to a plastic surgery practice lab, to a Scandinavian funeral directors' conference on human composting. In her droll, inimitable voice, Roach tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them. 13 b/w illustrations.</description>

  <description>Fresh off the critical acclaim of his &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Prize--nominated &lt;em&gt;Envy the Night&lt;/em&gt;, Michael Koryta returns with a blistering new installment in the Lincoln Perry series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whisper Ridge&lt;br&gt;Home to Dreams&lt;br&gt;October 2, 1992--April 12, 1996&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So reads the strange epitaph carved beside the door of the home called Whisper Ridge, a multimillion-dollar piece of architectural majesty that once housed the beginnings of a unique program for paroled murderers. The program never got off the ground, however, despite how passionate a woman named Alexandra Cantrell, daughter of a notorious Mafia don, and her husband, Joshua, had been about it. Still uninhabited twelve years later, the house remains as a strange monument to dangerous secrets, falling into ruin as the forest grows up around it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the couple’s abrupt exit was unusual, it was also not regarded as suspicious—until the bones of Alexandra’s husband are found buried in the woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Private investigator Lincoln Perry isn’t thrilled about the situation, or his client: Parker Harrison served fifteen years for murder but claims Alexandra’s intervention saved his life. Now he wants to find her---and he’s not the only one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What seems at first like the simplest of jobs proves to be an undertaking that will challenge both Perry’s abilities as a detective and his commitment to that calling. With a new partner to train and a case that leads straight to the heart of the Cleveland organized crime scene, Perry finds himself glancing over his shoulder at every turn, pushing the bounds of safety even as he backs away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again Michael Koryta has crafted an intricate, lightning-paced thriller, ratcheting up the tension as he explores just how dangerous the offer of a second chance can be. The latest installment in the Lincoln Perry series, which the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; calls “addictively readable,” marks another step forward in his incredible career.</description>

  <description>Detective Dave Robicheaux has fought too many battles: in Vietnam, with killers and hustlers, with police brass, and with the bottle. Lost without his wife's love, Robicheaux's haunted soul mirrors the intensity and dusky mystery of New Orleans' French Quarter -- the place he calls home, and the place that nearly destroys him when he becomes involved in the case of a young prostitute whose body is found in a bayou. Thrust into the world of drug lords and arms smugglers, Robicheaux must face down a subterranean criminal world and come to terms with his own bruised heart in order to survive.</description>

  <description>Sale temps pour l'agent sportif Myron Bolitar. Ex-champion de basket, ex-agent du FBI, il est pourtant habitué aux coups durs. Sauf que là, c'est vraiment tordu : son poulain, le prometteur Christian Steele, est sous le choc. Il vient de recevoir par la poste une revue porno dans laquelle son ancienne petite amie Kathy pose langoureusement dans le plus simple appareil. Problème : Kathy, mystérieusement disparue depuis des mois, est aujourd'hui considérée comme morte. Plus étrange encore, elle n'est autre que la sœur de la romancière Jessica Culver, grand amour de Myron. En pleine négociation de contrat, l'agent sportif croit d'abord à une technique d'intimidation de la part de ses concurrents. &lt;br&gt;Mais la réalité se révèle autrement plus sordide…</description>

      <![CDATA[I’ve been aware of Harlan Coben’s series of crime/mystery novels starring a sports agent named Myron Bolitar for some time but never read one because I thought it’d be something like Jerry Maguire crossed with <em>Murder She Wrote</em>.  I figured Myron would always be tripping over dead baseball players k...]]>

  <description>Brendan Early and Dana Moon have tracked renegade Apaches together and gunned down scalp hunters to become Arizona legends. But now they face each other from opposite sides of what newspapers are calling The Rincon Mountain War. Brendan and a gang of mining company gun thugs are dead set on running Dana and "the People of the Mountain" from their land. The characters are unforgettable, the plot packed with action and gunfights from beginning to end.</description>

  <description>Hyenas marks the always-welcome return of Joe R. Lansdale’s most indelible fictional creations: Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. Once again, the embattled but resilient duo find themselves enmeshed in a web of danger, duplicity, and escalating mayhem. The result is a tightly compressed novella that is at once harrowing, hilarious, and utterly impossible to put down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story begins with a barroom brawl that is both brutal and oddly comic. The ensuing drama encompasses abduction, betrayal, robbery, and murder, ending with a lethal confrontation in an East Texas pasture. Along the way, readers are treated to moments of raucous, casually profane humor and to scenes of vivid, crisply described violence, all related in that unmistakable Lansdale voice. An essential addition to an already imposing body of work, Hyenas shows us both the author and his signature characters at their inimitable best. It doesn’t get better than this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hyenas also includes the bonus Hap Collins short story, “The Boy Who Became Invisible”.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Prepare yourself for a journey through the world of Patton Oswalt, &lt;/strong&gt;one of the most creative, insightful, and hysterical voices on the entertain­ment scene today. Widely known for his roles in the films &lt;em&gt;Big Fan &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ratatouille, &lt;/em&gt;as well as the television hit &lt;em&gt;The King of Queens, &lt;/em&gt;Patton Oswalt—a staple of Comedy Central—has been amusing audiences for decades. Now, with &lt;em&gt;Zombie Spaceship Wasteland, &lt;/em&gt;he offers a fascinating look into his most unusual, and lovable, mindscape. &lt;p&gt;Oswalt combines memoir with uproarious humor, from snow forts to Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons to gifts from Grandma that had to be explained. He remem­bers his teen summers spent working in a movie Cineplex and his early years doing stand-up. Readers are also treated to several graphic elements, includ­ing a vampire tale for the rest of us and some greeting cards with a special touch. Then there’s the book’s centerpiece, which posits that before all young creative minds have anything to write about, they will home in on one of three story lines: zom­bies, spaceships, or wastelands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswalt chose wastelands, and ever since he has been mining our society’s wasteland for perversion and excess, pop culture and fatty foods, indie rock and single-malt scotch. &lt;em&gt;Zombie Spaceship Wasteland &lt;/em&gt;is an inventive account of the evolution of Patton Oswalt’s wildly insightful worldview, sure to indulge his legion of fans and lure many new admirers to his very entertaining “wasteland.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Buffy Summers and her Slayer army have suffered heavy losses throughout Season Eight and faced scores of threats new and old, but the one mystery connecting it all has been the identity of the Big Bad Twilight! In this penultimate volume of Season Eight, New York Times bestselling novelist and comics writer Brad Meltzer (The Book of Lies, Identity Crisis) joins series artist Georges Jeanty in beginning the buildup to the season finale in the story line that finally reveals the identity of Twilight! In the aftermath of the battle with Twilight's army, Buffy has developed a host of new powers, but when will the other shoe drop, and will it be a cute shoe, or an ugly one? Still reeling from the losses of war, Willow goes looking for missing allies, and discovers a horrifying truth about several of the Slayer army's recent ordeals. Adding to the mayhem is the unexpected return of Angel, in his Season Eight debut! This volume also features two stories from series creator and executive producer Joss Whedon! In the Willow one-shot, Whedon and Fray artist Karl Moline reveal for the first time what Buffy's witchy best friend was up to between Seasons Seven and Eight, with a mind-blowing cameo by a frequently requested character. And in "Turbulence," Joss spotlights the complicated relationship between Buffy and Xander with a conversation that changes it forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[I know Joss Whedon is busy working on <em>The Avengers</em> movie. (Just the sheer idea of it is giving most of geekdom multiple nerdgasms.)

  <description>National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 Award winner Charles Yu delivers his debut novel, a razor-sharp, ridiculously funny, and utterly touching story of a son searching for his father . . . through quantum space–time. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Minor Universe 31 is a vast story-space on the outskirts of fiction, where paradox fluctuates like the stock market, lonely sexbots beckon failed protagonists, and time travel is serious business. Every day, people get into time machines and try to do the one thing they should never do: change the past. That’s where Charles Yu, time travel technician—part counselor, part gadget repair man—steps in. He helps save people from themselves. Literally. When he’s not taking client calls or consoling his boss, Phil, who could really use an upgrade, Yu visits his mother (stuck in a one-hour cycle of time, she makes dinner over and over and over) and searches for his father, who invented time travel and then vanished. Accompanied by TAMMY, an operating system with low self-esteem, and Ed, a nonexistent but ontologically valid dog, Yu sets out, and back, and beyond, in order to find the one day where he and his father can meet in memory. He learns that the key may be found in a book he got from his future self. It’s called &lt;em&gt;How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe,&lt;/em&gt; and he’s the author. And somewhere inside it is the information that could help him—in fact it may even save his life. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Wildly new and adventurous, Yu’s debut is certain to send shock waves of wonder through literary space–time.</description>

  <description>What do you do after you’ve crawled out of Hell to wreak bloody revenge? If you’re Stark you turn to bounty hunting, tracking and decimating whatever rogue monsters you’re paid to kill. Stark hates the work, but he needs the money, especially the big bucks Lucifer is offering. In town as an adviser on a biopic of his life, Lucifer needs protection, and he wants Stark as his bodyguard. But the gig isn’t all bad; there is the very sexy, very hot French porn star Brigitte Bardo, a friend of Lucifer’s in LA to remake her reputation as a legit actress. While it isn’t love, it’s pretty damn good, and after 11 years of demonic chastity, it’s enough for now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Stark has enough trouble juggling a diva devil and a scorching French bombshell without a zombie plague to complicate matters. And just what happens when a human-angel half-breed is bitten by the living dead? His human side begins to die, transforming him into an unstoppable angel of death—a killing machine devoid of emotion or thought, with no regrets or future to worry about. Not a bad way to be when your choices are limited. Now, Stark has to decide . . . if he does finds a cure for the zombie infection, will he take it?</description>

  <description>This is the story of Moses Herzog, a great sufferer, joker, mourner, and charmer. Although his life steadily disintegrates around him - he has failed as a writer and teacher, as a father, and has lost the affection of his wife to his best friend - Herzog sees himself as a survivor, both of his private disasters and those of the age. He writes unsent letters to friends and enemies, colleagues and famous people, revealing his wry perception of the world and the innermost secrets of his heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Elmore Leonard, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author and "the hippest, funniest national treasure in sight" (&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;), brings his trademark wit and inimitable style to this twisting, gripping—and sometimes playful—tale of modern-day piracy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dara Barr, documentary filmmaker, is at the top of her game. She's covered the rape of Bosnian women, neo-Nazi white supremacists, and post-Katrina New Orleans, and has won awards for all three. Now, looking for a bigger challenge, Dara and her right-hand-man, Xavier LeBo, a six-foot-six, seventy-two-year-old African American seafarer, head to Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, to film modern-day pirates hijacking merchant ships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They learn soon enough that almost no one in the Middle East is who he seems to be. The most successful pirate, driving his Mercedes around Djibouti, appears to be a good guy, but his pal, a cultured Saudi diplomat, has dubious connections. Billy Wynn, a Texas billionaire, plays mysterious roles as the mood strikes him. He's promised his girlfriend, Helene, a nifty fashion model, that he'll marry her if she doesn't become seasick or bored while circling the world on his yacht. And there's Jama Raisuli, a black al Qaeda terrorist from Miami, who's vowed to blow up something big.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Dara and Xavier have to decide, besides the best way to stay alive: Should they shoot the action as a documentary or turn it into a Hollywood feature film?</description>

  <description>Court Gentry is known as The Gray Man — a legend in the covert realm, moving silently from job to job, accomplishing the impossible, and then fading away. And he always hits his target. But there are forces more lethal than Gentry in the world. And in their eyes, Gentry has just outlived his usefulness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, he is going to prove that for him, there's no gray area between killing for a living — and killing to stay alive.</description>

  <description>In suburban Georgetown a killer's Reeboks whisper on the front floor of a posh home... In a seedy D.C. porno house a patron is swiftly garroted to death... The next day America learns  that two of its Supreme Court justices have been assassinated. And in New Orleans, a young law student prepares a legal brief... To Darby Shaw it was  no more than a legal shot in the dark, a brilliant  guess. To the Washington establishment it was  political dynamite. Suddenly Darby is witness to a murder -- a murder intended for her. Going  underground, she finds there is only one person she can  trust -- an ambitious reporter after a newsbreak  hotter than Watergate -- to help her piece together the deadly puzzle. Somewhere between the bayous of  Louisiana and the White House's inner sanctums, a violent cover-up is being engineered. For somone has read Darby's brief. Someone who will stop at nothing to destroy the evidence of an unthinkable crime.</description>

  <description>When Mitchell McDeere qualified third in his class at Harvard, offers poured in from every law firm in America. The firm he chose was small, but-well respected. They were prepared to match, and then exceed Mitch's wildest dreams: eighty thousand a year, a BMW and a low-interest mortgage. Now the house, the car and the job are his. Then the nightmares begin: the secret files, the bugs in the new bedroom, the mysterious deaths of colleagues, and the millions of dollars of mob money pouring through the office into the Cayman Islands, dollars that the FBI would do anything to trace. Now Mitch is in the place where dreams end and nightmares begin...</description>

  <description>The vampiric virus unleashed in The Strain has taken over New York City. It is spreading across the country and soon, the world. Amid the chaos, Eph Goodweather—head of the Center for Disease Control’s team—leads a small band out to stop these bloodthirsty monsters. But it may be too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ignited by the Master’s horrific plan, a war erupts between Old and New World vampires, each vying for total control. Caught between these warring forces, humans—powerless and vulnerable—are no longer the consumers, but the consumed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Eph understands the vampiric plague better than anyone, even he cannot protect those he loves from the invading evil. His ex-wife, Kelly, has been turned by the Master, and now she stalks the city, in the darkness, looking for her chance to reclaim Zack, Eph’s young son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the future of the world in the balance, Eph and his courageous team, guided by the brilliant former professor and Holocaust survivor Abraham Setrakian and exterminator Vasiliy Fet, must combat a terror whose ultimate plan is more terrible than anyone first imagined—a fate worse than annihilation.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;A team of Intelligence agents try to prevent an impending terrorist attack, but are thwarted by bureaucratic hurdles in this darkly humorous debut written by a former CIA agent &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Maddie James and her colleagues are terrorism experts working in a crumbling intelligence agency. They are certain another big terrorist attack is coming, but in a post-9/11 election year the Administration is stressing its victories in the War on Terror—and few want to hear the team’s warnings. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Reluctantly, Maddie’s given a team of five analysts to focus on the impending threat. The crew labors through bureaucratic obstacles, personal problems, and a blossoming romance between its senior members, Doc and Fran. They come heartbreakingly close to stopping the attack, but fail to predict a surprising twist in the terrorists’ plot. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;In the wake of tragedy, the Administration pins blame on Iran despite lack of evidence—so Maddie and her team try to investigate. With dark humor and a razor-sharp tone, they fight back against office politics, government cover-ups and blackmail in order to set the record straight. A keenly crafted debut that could only be written by an ex-CIA agent, &lt;em&gt;Intelligence &lt;/em&gt;will please fans of &lt;em&gt;Wag the Dog &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Primary Colors&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>A fiendishly imaginative comic novel about doubt, faith, and the monsters we carry within us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ricky Rice was as good as invisible: a middling hustler, recovering dope fiend, and traumatized suicide cult survivor running out the string of his life as a porter at a bus depot in Utica, New York. Until one day a letter appears, summoning him to the frozen woods of Vermont. There, Ricky is inducted into a band of paranormal investigators comprised of former addicts and petty criminals, all of whom had at some point in their wasted lives heard The Voice: a mysterious murmur on the wind, a disembodied shout, or a whisper in an empty room that may or may not be from God.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evoking the disorienting wonder of writers like Haruki Murakami and Kevin Brockmeier, but driven by Victor LaValle’s perfectly pitched comic sensibility, &lt;em&gt;Big Machine&lt;/em&gt; is a mind-rattling literary adventure about sex, race, and the eternal struggle between faith and doubt.</description>

  <description>A passenger train hurting through the night. An unwed teenage mother headed to Moscow to seek a new life. A cruel-hearted soldier looking furtively, forcibly, for sex. An infant disappearing without a trace.&lt;p&gt;So begins Martin Cruz Smith's masterful &lt;em&gt;Three Stations,&lt;/em&gt; a suspenseful, intricately constructed novel featuring Investigator Arkady Renko. For the last three decades, beginning with the trailblazing &lt;em&gt;Gorky Park,&lt;/em&gt; Renko (and Smith) have captivated readers with detective tales set in Russia. Renko is the ironic, brilliantly observant cop who finds solutions to heinous crimes when other lawmen refuse to even acknowledge that crimes have occurred. He uses his biting humor and intuitive leaps to fight not only wrongdoers but the corrupt state apparatus as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Three Stations,&lt;/em&gt; Renko's skills are put to their most severe test. Though he has been technically suspended from the prosecutor's office for once again turning up unpleasant truths, he strives to solve a last case: the death of an elegant young woman whose body is found in a construction trailer on the perimeter of Moscow's main rail hub. It looks like a simple drug overdose to everyone -- except to Renko, whose examination of the crime scene turns up some inexplicable clues, most notably an invitation to Russia's premier charity ball, the billionaires' Nijinksy Fair. Thus a sordid death becomes interwoven with the lifestyles of Moscow's rich and famous, many of whom are clinging to their cash in the face of Putin's crackdown on the very oligarchs who placed him in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renko uncovers a web of death, money, madness and a kidnapping that threatens the woman he is coming to love and the lives of children he is desperate to protect. In &lt;em&gt;Three Stations,&lt;/em&gt; Smith produces a complex and hauting vision of an emergent Russia's secret underclass of street urchins, greedy thugs and a bureaucracy still paralyzed by power and fear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[Russian cop Arkady Renko has been solving crimes in novels for almost three decades now. When he was introduced during the Cold War in <em>Gorky Park</em>, Renko had to tread carefully because of a communist government that didn’t like to even admit that there were any crimes, let alone appreciate someone...]]>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Against the backdrop of a totalitarian &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;North Korea&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;, one man unwillingly uncovers the truth behind series of murders, and wagers his life in the process.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sit on a quiet hillside at dawn among the wildflowers; take a picture of a car coming up a deserted highway from the south&lt;/em&gt;. Simple orders for Inspector O, until he realizes they have led him far, far off his department's turf and into a maelstrom of betrayal and death. North Korea's leaders are desperate to hunt down and eliminate anyone who knows too much about a series of decades-old kidnappings and murders---and Inspector O discovers too late he has been sent into the chaos.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This is a world where nothing works as it should, where the crimes of the past haunt the present, and where even the shadows are real. A corpse in Pyongyang's main hotel---the Koryo---pulls Inspector O into a confrontation of bad choices between the devils he knows and those he doesn't want to meet. A blue button on the floor of a hotel closet, an ice blue Finnish lake, and desperate efforts by the North Korean leadership set Inspector O on a journey to the edge of a reality he almost can't survive. &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Like Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy and the Inspector Arkady Renko novels, &lt;em&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/em&gt; introduces another unfamiliar world, a perplexing universe seemingly so alien that the rules are an enigma to the reader and even, sometimes, to Inspector O. Author James Church weaves a story with beautifully spare prose and layered descriptions of a country and a people he knows by heart after decades as an intelligence officer. This is a chilling portrayal that, in the end, leaves us wondering if what at first seemed unknowable may simply be too familiar for comfort.&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Critical Acclaim for &lt;em&gt;The Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"This is a fine, intelligent, and exciting story that takes us into the netherworld of contemporary North Korean communism. It evokes the gray milieu without ever overstepping its mark, allowing us to see it from the inside rather than the outside, wherein the humanity of all the characters, both good and evil, is apparent. Inspector O is a particularly wonderful creation, a true mensch attempting to hold on to his humanity in a world where humanism is under constant attack. Subtlety is the method, and the result is fantastic work that should mark the beginning of a brilliant career for James Church." &lt;br&gt;---Olen Steinhauer, author of &lt;em&gt;Liberation Movements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"For over fifty years Americans have tried to understand the world of North Korea. James Church does a better job of describing the isolated, impoverished, corrupt, and out- of-touch life in the North than anything I have seen. This novel is a must-read for anyone who would understand how precarious the dictatorship is."&lt;br&gt;---Newt Gingrich, author of &lt;em&gt;Winning Back the Future&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Never Call Retreat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"A gripping story of mystery and intrigue. The laconic Inspector O follows in the traditions of Inspector Arkady Renko, operating in a world of complexity and danger we're meeting here for the first time." &lt;br&gt;---Don Oberdorfer, author of &lt;em&gt;Tet!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Church's debut thriller breaks new ground. O is an original. This is an expert take on a complex, brutal, and mystifying society. Immerse yourself in it." &lt;br&gt;---Marshall Browne, author of &lt;em&gt;Eye of the Abyss&lt;/em&gt; and the Inspector Anders series &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"&lt;em&gt;The Corpse in the Koryo&lt;/em&gt; is a spellbinder. Bloody and chilling, yet subtle in its psychological detail, with an amazing understanding of North Korea." &lt;br&gt;---Ezra F. Vogel, Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences, Harvard University Asia Center&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;"The (pseudonymous) author, a veteran intelligence officer, has intimate knowledge of Asian life and politics, and it shows: He gives the North Korea setting a feeling of palpable reality, depicting the nature of daily life under a totalitarian government not just with broad sociopolitical descriptions but also with specific everyday details. . . . There is also a little of Martin Cruz Smith's early Arkady Renko novels here. The writing is superb, too, well above the level usually associated with a first novel, richly layered and visually evocative." &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;---Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>The author of two critically acclaimed novels, &lt;strong&gt;The Russian Debutante’s Handbook&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Absurdistan&lt;/strong&gt;, Gary Shteyngart has risen to the top of the fiction world. Now, in his hilarious and heartfelt new novel, he envisions a deliciously dark tale of America’s dysfunctional coming years—and the timeless and tender feelings that just might bring us back from the brink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a very near future—oh, let’s say next Tuesday—a functionally illiterate America is about to collapse. But don’t that tell that to poor Lenny Abramov, the thirty-nine-year-old son of an angry Russian immigrant janitor, proud author of what may well be the world’s last diary, and less-proud owner of a bald spot shaped like the great state of Ohio. Despite his job at an outfit called Post-Human Services, which attempts to provide immortality for its super-rich clientele, death is clearly stalking this cholesterol-rich morsel of a man. And why shouldn’t it? Lenny’s from a different century—he totally loves books (or “printed, bound media artifacts,” as they’re now known), even though most of his peers find them smelly and annoying. But even more than books, Lenny loves Eunice Park, an impossibly cute and impossibly cruel twenty-four-year-old Korean American woman who just graduated from Elderbird College with a major in Images and a minor in Assertiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After meeting Lenny on an extended Roman holiday, blistering Eunice puts that Assertiveness minor to work, teaching our “ancient dork” effective new ways to brush his teeth and making him buy a cottony nonflammable wardrobe. But America proves less flame-resistant than Lenny’s new threads. The country is crushed by a credit crisis, riots break out in New York’s Central Park, the city’s streets are lined with National Guard tanks on every corner, the dollar is so over, and our patient Chinese creditors may just be ready to foreclose on the whole mess. Undeterred, Lenny vows to love both Eunice and his homeland. He’s going to convince his fickle new love that in a time without standards or stability, in a world where single people can determine a dating prospect’s “hotness” and “sustainability” with the click of a button, in a society where the privileged may live forever but the unfortunate will die all too soon, there is still value in being a real human being.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wildly funny, rich, and humane, &lt;strong&gt;Super Sad True Love Story&lt;/strong&gt; is a knockout novel by a young master, a book in which falling in love just may redeem a planet falling apart.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>From “one of the great American writers of our time” (Los Angeles Times Book Review): a raw, explicit memoir as high-intensity and riveting as any of his novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year was 1958. James Ellroy was ten years old. His mother, Jean Hilliker, had divorced her fast-buck hustler husband. She gave her son a choice: live with his father or her. He chose his father, and Jean—“half gassed”—attacked him. He wished her dead. Three months later, she was murdered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellroy writes, “I owe her for every true thing that I am. I must remove the malediction I have placed on her and on myself,” and in The Hilliker Curse, he narrates his quest for “atonement in women.” He unsparingly describes his shattered childhood, his delinquent teens, his writing life, his love affairs and marriages, a nervous breakdown and the beginning of a relationship with an extraordinary woman who may just be the long-sought Her. It is a layered narrative of time and place, emotion and insight, sexuality and spiritual quest. And all of it is reported with gut-wrenching and heart-rending candor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brilliant and soul-baring revelation of self—and unlike any memoir you have ever read.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Boone Daniels lives to surf.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laid back, ultra&amp;amp;#8211;California cool, the former cop turned PI begins each day with the Dawn Patrol, a close-knit group of surfers, best friends who not only ride waves together but have one another&amp;amp;#8217;s backs out of the water. It&amp;amp;#8217;s the life Boone loves, all he wants. To him, &amp;amp;#8220;There&amp;amp;#8217;s no such thing as a bad day at the beach.&amp;amp;#8221; So when one of their own is murdered&amp;amp;#8212;especially an icon like Kelly Kuhio, a local hero&amp;amp;#8212;and another surfer, a young punk from the Rockpile Crew, stands accused, the small world of Pacific Beach is rocked to its core. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boone knows he can no longer ignore the painful truth that violence is seeping into the surfing community. But when he agrees to help the defense, the outrage he courts from the community, and the Dawn Patrol, is more than he ever anticipated. He&amp;amp;#8217;s risking losing the relationships that define his life&amp;amp;#8212; just when he needs them most. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Boone digs deeper into San Diego&amp;amp;#8217;s murkier side, delving into places the city&amp;amp;#8217;s reputationconscious establishment would rather he left alone, it becomes clear that more than a murder case is at stake. He soon finds himself out there alone, struggling to stay afloat as the waves get rougher and rougher . . . and more deadly. It&amp;amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;The Gentlemen&amp;amp;#8217;s Hour&lt;/em&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;and it could be Boone&amp;amp;#8217;s last.</description>

  <description>An epic and gripping tale of catastrophe and survival, The Passage is the story of Amy—abandoned by her mother at the age of six, pursued and then imprisoned by the shadowy figures behind a government experiment of apocalyptic proportions. But Special Agent Brad Wolgast, the lawman sent to track her down, is disarmed by the curiously quiet girl and risks everything to save her. As the experiment goes nightmarishly wrong, Wolgast secures her escape—but he can’t stop society’s collapse. And as Amy walks alone, across miles and decades, into a future dark with violence and despair, she is filled with the mysterious and terrifying knowledge that only she has the power to save the ruined world.</description>

  <description>MURDER AT THE RIO GRANDE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, private eye Mike Shayne did a job for one of the richest men in El Paso, digging up dirt on a boy courting the tycoon’s daughter. Now the daughter’s back, all grown up and dangerous. And so’s Shayne—but this time it’s to investigate murder...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * First publication in 20 years&lt;br&gt;    * One of the most popular detectives of all time, Mike Shayne starred in more than 70 novels, a dozen movies, a TV series, radio dramas, comic books, and the long-running Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filmmaker SHANE BLACK,&lt;br&gt;creator of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,&lt;br&gt;on the Work of BRETT HALLIDAY&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In this age of private eyes with cats, funny neighbors, and relationship woes—here’s to 40’s thriller writer Brett Halliday, whose baffling, bullet-paced capers have come to light again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Halliday’s books were marvels of misdirection. Red herrings, skewed motives, mistaken identities—he did everything but come to your house and bang cymbals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Halliday’s plots are byzantine gems. This is back when mystery writers were so much smarter than you and me. Want an engrossing read? Pick this one up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Never heard of this book? No matter. It’s been waiting patiently, poised to dazzle you with raw, ingenious storytelling. Halliday is the king of the baffler novel. Pure pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"How long can Halliday’s best-selling books remain dormant, undiscovered...? The answer: not a minute longer, thanks to Hard Case Crime."</description>

  <description>Hap Collins and Leonard Pine return in a red-hot, mayhem-fueled thriller to face a vampire cult, the Dixie Mafia, and the deadliest assassin they’ve ever encountered—Devil Red.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their friend Marvin asks Hap and Leonard to look into a cold-case double homicide, they’re more than happy to play private investigators: they like trouble, and they especially like getting paid to find it. It turns out that both of the victims were set to inherit serious money, and one of them ran with a vampire cult. The more closely Hap and Leonard look over the crime-scene photos, the more they see, including the image of a red devil’s head painted on a tree. A little research turns up a slew of murders with that same fiendish signature. And if that’s not enough, Leonard has taken to wearing a deerstalker cap . . . Will this be the case that finally sends Hap over the edge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full up with Lansdale’s trademark—whip-smart dialogue, relentless pacing, and unorthodox-to-say-the-least characters—&lt;em&gt;Devil Red&lt;/em&gt; is one rambunctious thrill ride by one hell of a writer.</description>

  <description>In this eagerly awaited follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Lion's Game&lt;/em&gt;, John Corey, former NYPD Homicide detective and special agent for the Anti-Terrorist Task Force, is back. And, unfortunately for Corey, so is Asad Khalil, the notorious Libyan terrorist otherwise known as "The Lion." Last we heard from him, Khali had claimed to be defecting to the US only to unleash the most horrific reign of terrorism ever to occur on American soil. While Corey and his partner, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, chased him across the country, Khalil methodically eliminated his victims one by one and then disappeared without a trace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, years later, Khalil has returned to America to make good on his threats and take care of unfinished business. "The Lion" is a killing machine once again loose in America with a mission of revenge, and John Corey will stop at nothing to achieve his own goal -- to find and kill Khahil.</description>

  <description>In this contemporary, Victorian-style novel Charles Smithson, a nineteenth-century gentleman with glimmerings of twentieth-century perceptions, falls in love with enigmatic Sarah Woodruff, who has been jilted by a French lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of all John Fowles' novels &lt;em&gt;The French Lieutenant's Woman&lt;/em&gt; received the most universal acclaim and today holds a very special place in the canon of post-war English literature. From the god-like stance of the nineteenth-century novelist that he both assumes and gently mocks, to the last detail of dress, idiom and manners, his book is an immaculate recreation of Victorian England. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only is it the epic love story of two people of insight and imagination seeking escape from the cant and tyranny of their age, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' is also a brilliantly sustained allegory of the decline of the twentieth-century passion for freedom.</description>

  <description>“The first of my father’s illusions was that bears could survive the life lived by human beings, and the second was that human beings could survive a life led in hotels.” So says John Berry, son of a hapless dreamer, brother to a cadre of eccentric siblings, and chronicler of the lives lived, the loves experienced, the deaths met, and the myriad strange and wonderful times encountered by the family Berry. Hoteliers, pet-bear owners, friends of Freud (the animal trainer and vaudevillian, that is), and playthings of mad fate, they “dream on” in a funny, sad, outrageous, and moving novel by the remarkable author of &lt;em&gt;A Prayer for Owen Meany &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Last Night in Twisted River&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived–and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who’ve long forgotten her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for details–proof they hope may free Ben–Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club… and maybe she’ll admit her testimony wasn’t so solid after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby’s doomed family members–including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started–on the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The hyperactive love child of &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&lt;/em&gt; caught in a tawdry love triangle with &lt;em&gt;The Fan&lt;/em&gt;. Even Kitty Kelly will blush. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soaked, nay, marinated in the world of vintage Hollywood, &lt;em&gt;Tell-All&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/em&gt;–inflected homage to Old Hollywood when &lt;strong&gt;Bette Davis&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Joan Crawford&lt;/strong&gt; ruled the roost; a veritable Tourette’s syndrome of rat-tat-tat  name-dropping, from the A-list to the Z-list; and a merciless  send-up of &lt;strong&gt;Lillian Hellman&lt;/strong&gt;’s habit of butchering the truth that will have &lt;strong&gt;Mary McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt; cheering from the beyond. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;Thelma Ritter&lt;/strong&gt;–ish narrator is &lt;strong&gt;Hazie Coogan&lt;/strong&gt;, who for decades has tended to the outsized needs of &lt;strong&gt;Katherine “Miss Kathie”  Kenton&lt;/strong&gt;—veteran of multiple marriages, career comebacks, and cosmetic surgeries. But danger arrives with gentleman caller &lt;strong&gt;Webster Carlton Westward III&lt;/strong&gt;, who worms his way into Miss Kathie’s heart (and boudoir). Hazie discovers that this bounder has already written a celebrity tell-all memoir foretelling Miss Kathie’s death in a forthcoming &lt;strong&gt;Lillian Hellman&lt;/strong&gt;–penned musical extravaganza; as the body count mounts, Hazie must execute a plan to save &lt;strong&gt;Katherine Kenton&lt;/strong&gt; for her fans—and for posterity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell-All&lt;/em&gt; is funny, subversive, and fascinatingly clever. It’s wild, it’s wicked, it’s  bold-faced—it’s vintage &lt;strong&gt;Chuck&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

  <description>In the debut of literature's most famous sleuth, a dead man is discovered in a bloodstained room in Brixton. The only clues are a wedding ring, a gold watch, a pocket edition of Boccaccio's Decameron, and a word scrawled in blood on the wall. With this investigation begins the partnership of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Their search for the murderer uncovers a story of love and revenge-and heralds a franchise of detective mysteries starring the formidable Holmes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>What--or who--could turn a gifted little boy into a murderous thing that calls itself "Satan's Child"? In search of an answer, a man named Burke travels from a festering welfare hotel to a neat frame house where a voodoo priestess presides over a congregation of assassins. For this vigilante and unlicensed private eye has made it his business to defend the small victims whom the law has failed--even a child who has been made into a killer. &lt;br&gt;Gripping and chillingly knowledgeable about the mechanisms of evil, "Sacrifice "is a thriller of savage authority from one of the best crime writers of our generation.</description>

  <description>   Andrew Vachss has reinvented detective fiction for an age in which guilty secrets are obsolete and murder isn't even worth a news headline. And in the person of his haunted, hell-ridden private eye Burke, Vachss has given us a new kind of hero: a man inured to every evil except the kind that preys on children. &lt;br&gt;   Now Burke is back, investigating an epidemic of apparent suicides among teenagers of a wealthy Connecticut suburb.  There he discovers a sinister connection between the anguish of the young and the activities of an elite sadomasochistic underground, for whom pan and its accompanying rituals are a source of pleasure—and power</description>

  <description>John Wayne Cleaver is dangerous, and he knows it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s spent his life doing his best not to live up to his potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s obsessed with serial killers, but really doesn’t want to become one. So for his own sake, and the safety of those around him, he lives by rigid rules he’s written for himself, practicing normal life as if it were a private religion that could save him from damnation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dead bodies are normal to John. He likes them, actually. They don’t demand or expect the empathy he’s unable to offer. Perhaps that’s what gives him the objectivity to recognize that there’s something different about the body the police have just found behind the Wash-n-Dry Laundromat---and to appreciate what that difference means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, for the first time, John has to confront a danger outside himself, a threat he can’t control, a menace to everything and everyone he would love, if only he could.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan Wells’s debut novel is the first volume of a trilogy that will keep you awake and then haunt your dreams.</description>

  <description>Resurrection! &lt;br&gt;The hungry dead have risen. They shamble down the street. They hide in back yards, car lots, shopping malls. They devour neighbors, dogs and police officers. And they are here to stay. The real question is, what are you going to do about it? How will you survive?&lt;br&gt;How will the world change when the dead begin to rise?  &lt;br&gt;Stoker-award-winning author &lt;em&gt;Christopher Golden&lt;/em&gt; has assembled an original anthology of never-before-published zombie stories from an eclectic array of today's hottest writers. Inside there are stories about military might in the wake of an outbreak, survival in a wasted wasteland, the ardor of falling in love with a zombie, and a family outing at the circus. Here is a collection of new views on death and resurrection.&lt;br&gt;With stories from &lt;em&gt;Joe Hill&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;John Connolly&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Max Brooks&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kelley Armstrong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tad Williams&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;David Wellington&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;David Liss&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Aimee Bender&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jonathan Maberry&lt;/em&gt;, and many others, this is a wildly diverse and entertaining collection... the last word on &lt;em&gt;The New Dead&lt;/em&gt;. </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this neighborhood, make a wrong turn…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;… and you’re history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mickey Wade is a recently-unemployed journalist who lucked into a rent-free apartment—his sick grandfather’s place. The only problem: it’s in a lousy neighborhood—the one where Mickey grew up, in fact. The one he was so desperate to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But now he’s back. Dead broke. And just when he thinks he’s reached rock bottom, Mickey wakes up in the past. Literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At first he thinks it’s a dream. All of the stores he remembered from his childhood, the cars, the rumble of the elevated train. But as he digs deeper into the past, searching for answers about the grandfather he hardly knows, Mickey meets the twelve-year-old kid who lives in the apartment below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The kid who will grow up to someday murder Mickey’s father.</description>

  <description>When Zane shoots Death, he has to take the job, speeding over the world riding Mortis, his pale horse/limo, measuring souls for the exact balance of Good and Evil, sending each to Heaven or Hell instead of Purgatory. The new Thanatos is superbly competent, ends pain when he ends lives. But Satan is forging a trap for Luna, the woman Death loves.</description>

  <description>Burke's newest client is a woman named Flood, who has the face of an angel, the body of a high-priced stripper, and the skills of a professional executioner.  She wants Burke to find a monster for her—so she can kill him with her bare hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this cauterizing thriller, Andrew Vachss's renegade investigator teams up with a lethally gifted avenger to follow a child's murderer through the catacombs of New York, where every alley is blind and the penthouses are as dangerous as the basements.  Fearfully knowing, crackling with narrative tension, and written in prose as forceful as a hollow-point slug, &lt;em&gt;Flood &lt;/em&gt;is Burke at his deadliest—and Vachss at the peak of his form.</description>

  <description>The Communist. The Politician. The Hit Man. The Shot. Tom Jefferson has a job he does very well. He kills for a living. Fresh off the takedown of a Nazi in Buenos Aires, Tom is poised for his next assignment -- the assassination of Fidel Castro. The mob -- led by Sam Giancana -- the CIA, and presidential candidate Jack Kennedy are all in on the plan. Together, they can take Castro out of the picture, put Jack in office, and get Giancana back in the Cuban casino business. And JFK can't say no, because Giancana possesses some very incriminating tapes documenting the politician's sexual escapades. But just as Tom sets his sights on Cuba, he is suddenly exposed to some explosive information that alters his course. Now, the perfect hit is turning into the perfect nightmare for everyone involved, because the word is out: Cool killer Tom is no longer targeting Castro...he's gunning for Kennedy. From celebrated novelist Philip Kerr comes The Shot, a brilliant pseudo-historical what-if ride through the cultural, political, and social landscape of the 1960s.</description>

  <description>Buffy Season Eight Volume 6 showcases the first retreat of the Slayer legion. Vampires have solid footing at the top of the totem and Slayers have been crushed to the bottom -- in short, no one likes Buffy anymore . . . least of all this season's mysterious Big Bad, Twilight, who is hot on her magical trail!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that it's the world against Slayers, Buffy must find a way to return the status quo to . . . status quo -- and keep her girls alive long enough to do it! Enter Oz, the only person/werewolf Buffy knows who is down with the suppression of magic, and can take the Slayer army off of Twilight's magic-specific radar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Oz's assistance, the Slayers and Wiccans try to become "normal" through meditation and hard labor -- although, not everyone sees the advantage of being magicless, namely, Willow, Giles, and Andrew. And they could be right. After all, is a peaceful life for a Slayer even possible?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Oz appears in Buffy Season Eight!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Collects issues #26-#30 of the ongoing series.</description>

  <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a thunderous hangover, a raging headache . . . and a pair of horns growing from his temples.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;At first Ig thought the horns were a hallucination, the product of a mind damaged by rage and grief. He had spent the last year in a lonely, private purgatory, following the death of his beloved, Merrin Williams, who was raped and murdered under inexplicable circumstances. A mental breakdown would have been the most natural thing in the world. But there was nothing natural about the horns, which were all too real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the righteous Ig had enjoyed the life of the blessed: born into privilege, the second son of a renowned musician and younger brother of a rising late-night TV star, he had security, wealth, and a place in his community. Ig had it &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;, and more—he had Merrin and a love founded on shared daydreams, mutual daring, and unlikely midsummer magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Merrin's death damned all that. The only suspect in the crime, Ig was never charged or tried. And he was never cleared. In the court of public opinion in Gideon, New Hampshire, Ig is and always will be guilty because his rich and connected parents pulled strings to make the investigation go away. Nothing Ig can do, nothing he can say, matters. Everyone, it seems, including God, has abandoned him. Everyone, that is, but the devil inside. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Ig is possessed of a terrible new power to go with his terrible new look—a macabre talent he intends to use to find the monster who killed Merrin and destroyed his life. Being good and praying for the best got him nowhere. It's time for a little revenge. . . . &lt;em&gt;It's time the devil had his due. . . .&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>More than 6 years after his death David Halberstam remains one of this country's most respected journalists and revered authorities on American life and history in the years since WWII. A Pulitzer Prize-winner for his ground-breaking reporting on the Vietnam War, Halberstam wrote more than 20 books, almost all of them bestsellers. His work has stood the test of time and has become the standard by which all journalists measure themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"In the firehouse, the men not only live and eat with each other, they play sports together, go off to drink together, help repair one another's houses, and, most important, share terrifying risks; their loyalties to each other must, by the demands of the dangers they face, be instinctive and absolute."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So writes David Halberstam, one of America's most distinguished reporters and historians, in this stunning&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling book about Engine 40, Ladder 35, located on the West Side of Manhattan near Lincoln Center. On the morning of September 11, 2001, two rigs carrying thirteen men set out from this firehouse: twelve of them would never return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firehouse&lt;/em&gt; takes us to the epicenter of the tragedy. Through the kind of intimate portraits that are Halberstam's trademark, we watch the day unfold--the men called to duty while their families wait anxiously for news of them. In addition, we come to understand the culture of the firehouse itself: why gifted men do this; why, in so many instances, they are eager to follow in their fathers' footsteps and serve in so dangerous a profession; and why, more than anything else, it is not just a job, but a calling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is journalism-as-history at its best, the story of what happens when one small institution gets caught in an apocalyptic day. &lt;em&gt;Firehouse&lt;/em&gt; is a book that will move readers as few others have in our time.</description>

  <description>When Paha Sapa, a young Sioux warrior, "counts coup" on General George Armstrong Custer as Custer lies dying on the battlefield at the Little Bighorn, the legendary general's ghost enters him - and his voice will speak to him for the rest of his event-filled life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seamlessly weaving together the stories of Paha Sapa, Custer, and the American West,  Dan Simmons depicts a tumultuous time in the history of both Native and white Americans.  Haunted by Custer's ghost, and also by his ability to see into the memories and futures of legendary men like Sioux war-chief Crazy Horse, Paha Sapa's long life is driven by a dramatic vision he experienced as a boy in his people's sacred Black Hills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In August of 1936, a dynamite worker on the massive Mount Rushmore project, Paha Sapa plans to silence his ghost forever and reclaim his people's legacy-on the very day FDR comes to Mount Rushmore to dedicate the Jefferson face.</description>

  <description>Video From "The Chemist's War" (&lt;em&gt;Slate Magazine&lt;/em&gt;), by Deborah Blum &lt;strong&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer Deborah Blum follows New York City's first forensic scientists to discover a fascinating Jazz Age story of chemistry and detection, poison and murder.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Deborah Blum, writing with the high style and skill for suspense that is characteristic of the very best mystery fiction, shares the untold story of how poison rocked Jazz Age New York City. In &lt;em&gt;The Poisoner's Handbook&lt;/em&gt; Blum draws from highly original research to track the fascinating, perilous days when a pair of forensic scientists began their trailblazing chemical detective work, fighting to end an era when untraceable poisons offered an easy path to the perfect crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Drama unfolds case by case as the heroes of &lt;em&gt;The Poisoner's Handbook&lt;/em&gt;—chief medical examiner Charles Norris and toxicologist Alexander Gettler—investigate a family mysteriously stricken bald, Barnum and Bailey's Famous Blue Man, factory workers with crumbling bones, a diner serving poisoned pies, and many others. Each case presents a deadly new puzzle and Norris and Gettler work with a creativity that rivals that of the most imaginative murderer, creating revolutionary experiments to tease out even the wiliest compounds from human tissue. Yet in the tricky game of toxins, even science can't always be trusted, as proven when one of Gettler's experiments erroneously sets free a suburban housewife later nicknamed "America's Lucretia Borgia" to continue her nefarious work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From the vantage of Norris and Gettler's laboratory in the infamous Bellevue Hospital it becomes clear that killers aren't the only toxic threat to New Yorkers. Modern life has created a kind of poison playground, and danger lurks around every corner. Automobiles choke the city streets with carbon monoxide; potent compounds, such as morphine, can be found on store shelves in products ranging from pesticides to cosmetics. Prohibition incites a chemist's war between bootleggers and government chemists while in Gotham's crowded speakeasies each round of cocktails becomes a game of Russian roulette. Norris and Gettler triumph over seemingly unbeatable odds to become the pioneers of forensic chemistry and the gatekeepers of justice during a remarkably deadly time. A beguiling concoction that is equal parts true crime, twentieth-century history, and science thriller, &lt;em&gt;The Poisoner's Handbook&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turning account of a forgotten New York.</description>

  <description>Twenty-three essays by young professional philosophers examine crucial ethical and metaphysical aspects of the Buffyverse (the world of Buffy). Though the show already attracted much scholarly attention, this is the first book to fully disinter the intellectual issues. Designed by Whedon as a multilevel story with most of its meanings deeply buried in heaps of heavy irony, Buffy the Vampire Slayer has replaced The X-Files as the show that explains to Americans the nature of the powerful forces of evil continually threatening to surge into our world of everyday decency and overwhelm it. In the tradition of the classic horror films Buffy the Vampire Slayer addresses ethical issues that have long fascinated audiences. This book draws out the ethical and metaphysical lessons from a pop-culture phenomenon.</description>

His wife Jane still loves him, and for all its quiet trials, their marriage is still stronger than most. Despite long hours at the office, he remains passionate about his work, and his partnership at a prestigious Manhattan law firm means that the work he does is important. And, even as his daughter Becka retreats behind her guitar, her dreadlocks and her puppy fat, he offers her every one of a father's honest lies about her being the most beautiful girl in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He loves his wife, his family, his work, his home. He loves his kitchen. And then one day he stands up and walks out. And keeps walking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE UNNAMED is a dazzling novel about a marriage and a family and the unseen forces of nature and desire that seem to threaten them both. It is the heartbreaking story of a life taken for granted and what happens when that life is abruptly and irrevocably taken away.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The second big year of award-winning creators Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark's explosive run on Daredevil is here, and if you think Matt Murdock's life is going to start getting simpler, think again! As Matt tries to deal with the changes in his life, and find a way to move forward, a threat from his past begins to creep toward daylight. And with the post-Civil War fallout all around him, the price of being Daredevil just got even higher. The next mystery begins here! Plus: Milla and Matt have been reunited, but the things he's been through - prison and then life on the run - have changed him. And now, in the days after the Marvel Civil War, being Daredevil is even more dangerous than it was before Matt got taken down. Can their relationship survive the new obstacles that have been placed in their way? Can "Blind Love" conquer all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collects Daredevil #94-99.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The critically acclaimed, award-winning new creative team of Ed Brubaker and Michael Lark make their explosive debut in a storyline that Daredevil fans will not be able to put down! For the past few years, Matt Murdock's life has been teetering on the edge of destruction. Now, pushed beyond the limit, Matt finds himself behind the eight ball with no clear way out, the people he calls friends slowly deserting him, and Hell's Kitchen gradually slipping out of control. The question is, when his back is against the wall, just how far will Daredevil go to get back what is his? Spinning out of the stunning finale of Bendis and Maleev's ground-breaking run, Brubaker and Lark pick up the billy club and run as hard and as fast as they can to leave their own mark on one of comics' most enduring legends. Longtime DD fans will not be disappointed! Collects Daredevil #82-87.</description>

  <description>A grand mystery reaching back centuries. A sensational disappearance that made headlines around the world. A quest for truth that leads to death, madness or disappearance for those who seek to solve it. &lt;em&gt;The Lost City of Z&lt;/em&gt; is a blockbuster adventure narrative about what lies beneath the impenetrable jungle canopy of the Amazon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After stumbling upon a hidden trove of diaries, New Yorker writer David Grann set out to solve "the greatest exploration mystery of the 20th century": What happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett &amp;amp; his quest for the Lost City of Z?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In 1925 Fawcett ventured into the Amazon to find an ancient civilization, hoping to make one of the most important discoveries in history. For centuries Europeans believed the world's largest jungle concealed the glittering kingdom of El Dorado. Thousands had died looking for it, leaving many scientists convinced that the Amazon was truly inimical to humans. But Fawcett, whose daring expeditions inspired Conan Doyle's &lt;em&gt;The Lost World&lt;/em&gt;, had spent years building his scientific case. Captivating the imagination of millions round the globe, Fawcett embarked with his 21-year-old son, determined to prove that this ancient civilisation--which he dubbed Z--existed. Then his expedition vanished. Fawcett's fate, &amp;amp; the tantalizing clues he left behind about Z, became an obsession for hundreds who followed him into the uncharted wilderness.  For decades scientists &amp;amp; adventurers have searched for evidence of Fawcett's party &amp;amp; the lost City of Z. Countless have perished, been captured by tribes or gone mad. As Grann delved ever deeper into the mystery surrounding Fawcett's quest, &amp;amp; the greater mystery of what lies within the Amazon, he found himself, like the generations who preceded him, being irresistibly drawn into the jungle's green hell. His quest for the truth &amp;amp; discoveries about Fawcett's fate &amp;amp; Z form the heart of this complexly enthralling narrative.</description>

  <description>Paul Dirac was among the great scientific geniuses of the modern age. One of the discoverers of quantum mechanics, the most revolutionary theory of the past century, his contributions had a unique insight, eloquence, clarity, and mathematical power. His prediction of antimatter was one of the greatest triumphs in the history of physics. One of Einstein’s most admired colleagues, Dirac was in 1933 the youngest theoretician ever to win the Nobel Prize in physics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dirac’s personality is legendary. He was an extraordinarily reserved loner, relentlessly literal-minded and appeared to have no empathy with most people. Yet he was a family man and was intensely loyal to his friends. His tastes in the arts ranged from Beethoven to Cher, from Rembrandt to Mickey Mouse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on previously undiscovered archives, &lt;em&gt;The Strangest Man&lt;/em&gt; reveals the many facets of Dirac’s brilliantly original mind. A compelling human story, &lt;em&gt;The Strangest Man&lt;/em&gt; also depicts a spectacularly exciting era in scientific history.</description>

It is a round of games that occurs every 88 years as the different cities connect together on the same mystical plane. At stake is the life of his friend, the legacy of his father and mentor, and the future of K'un-Lun.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collects Immortal Iron Fist #1-16, Civil War: Choosing Sides, Annual #1, Orson Randall and the Green Mist of Death, and The Origin of Danny Rand.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Those who don’t learn from history are condemned to repeat it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Stone Age to the information age, the undead have threatened to engulf the human race. They’ re coming. They’re hungry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t wait for them to come to you! &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the graphic novel the fans demanded: major zombie attacks from the dawn of humanity. On the African savannas, against the legions of ancient Rome, on the high seas with Francis Drake . . . every civilization has faced them. Here are the grisly and heroic stories–complete with eye-popping artwork that pulsates with the hideous faces of the undead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organize before they rise!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scripted by the world’s leading zombie authority, Max Brooks, &lt;em&gt;Recorded Attacks&lt;/em&gt; reveals how other eras and cultures have dealt with–and survived– the ancient viral plague. By immersing ourselves in past horror we may yet prevail over the coming outbreak in our time.</description>

We'll Be Right Back," written by Jeph Loeb (Batman: The Long Halloween).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Collecting issue #16-20 of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight series.</description>

  <description>John Constantine is an unconcerned, somewhat amoral occultist with a British working-class background. He's a hero, of sorts, who manages to come out on top through a combination of luck, trickery, and genuine magical skill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this latest volume in the graphic novel series, Peter Milligan (BATMAN, HUMAN TARGET, X-Statix), one of Vertigo's most popular and prolific scribes writes the adventures of Constantine for the first time. John digs his fingers deep into his bumpy past and discovers that old wounds and new loves are both best left untouched. 12 years ago in Liverpool, there was a bloody dockers' strike. Things fell apart when a union leader caved-in to the bosses. Today, John Constantine has a new girlfriend and an extraordinary, horrible new skin complaint: A weeping, dark, knobby scab covers part of his body. And it's growing. What's the&lt;br&gt;bizarre link between this skin fungus and a largely forgotten chapter of British Trade Union history?</description>

  <description>Second in the Kurt Wallander series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweden, winter, 1991. Inspector Kurt Wallander and his team receive an anonymous tip-off. A few days later a life raft is washed up on a beach. In it are two men, dressed in expensive suits, shot dead. The dead men were criminals, victims of what seems to have been a gangland hit. But what appears to be an open-and-shut case soon takes on a far more sinister aspect. Wallander travels across the Baltic Sea, to Riga in Latvia, where he is plunged into a frozen, alien world of police surveillance, scarcely veiled threats, and lies. Doomed always to be one step behind the shadowy figures he pursues, only Wallander's obstinate desire to see that justice is done brings the truth to light</description>

  <description>From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Little Brother&lt;/em&gt;, a major novel of the booms, busts, and further booms in store for America&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perry and Lester invent things—seashell robots that make toast, Boogie Woogie Elmo dolls that drive cars. They also invent entirely new economic systems, like the “New Work,” a New Deal for the technological era. Barefoot bankers cross the nation, microinvesting in high-tech communal mini-startups like Perry and Lester’s. Together, they transform the country, and Andrea Fleeks, a journo-turned-blogger, is there to document it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it slides into collapse. The New Work bust puts the dot.combomb to shame. Perry and Lester build a network of interactive rides in abandoned Wal-Marts across the land. As their rides, which commemorate the New Work’s glory days, gain in popularity, a rogue Disney executive grows jealous, and convinces the police that Perry and Lester’s 3D printers are being used to run off AK-47s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hordes of goths descend on the shantytown built by the New Workers, joining the cult. Lawsuits multiply as venture capitalists take on a new investment strategy: backing litigation against companies like Disney. Lester and Perry’s friendship falls to pieces when Lester gets the ‘fatkins’ treatment, turning him into a sybaritic gigolo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then things get really interesting.</description>

  <description>A knock on Spenser's office door can only mean one thing: a new case. This time the visitor is a local lawyer with an interesting story. Elizabeth Shaw specializes in wills and trusts at the Boston law firm of Shaw &amp;amp; Cartwright, and over the years she's developed a friendship with wives of very wealthy men. However, these rich wives have a mutual secret: they've all had an affair with a man named Gary Eisenhower- and now he's blackmailing them for money. Shaw hires Spenser to make Eisenhower "cease and desist," so to speak, but when women start turning up dead, Spenser's assignment goes from blackmail to murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As matters become more complicated, Spenser's longtime love, Susan, begins offering some input by analyzing Eisenhower's behavior patterns in hopes of opening up a new avenue of investigation. It seems that not all of Gary's women are rich. So if he's not using them for blackmail, then what is his purpose? Spenser switches tactics to focus on the husbands, only to find that innocence and guilt may be two sides of the same coin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With its eloquently spare prose and some of the best supporting characters to grace the printed page, &lt;em&gt;The Professional&lt;/em&gt; is further proof that "[t]here's hardly an author in the crime novel business like Parker" (&lt;em&gt;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A lot can change in three months: wars can be decided, nations can be forged... or entire species can be brought to the brink of annihilation. The Morningstar Virus, an incredibly virulent disease, has swept the face of the planet, infecting billions. Its hosts rampage, attacking anything that remains uninfected.  Even death can't stop the virus-its victims as cannibalistic shamblers.      Scattered across the world, embattled groups have persevered. For some, surviving is the pinnacle of achievement. Others hoard goods and weapons. And still others leverage power over the remnants of humanity in the form of a mysterious cure for Morningstar. Francis Sherman and Anna Demilio want only a vaccine, but to find it, they must cross a countryside in ruins, dodging not only the infected, but also the lawless living.      The bulk of the storm has passed over the world, leaving echoing thunder and softly drifting ashes. But for the survivors, the peril remains, and the search for a cure is just beginning...</description>

  <description>The end begins with a viral outbreak unlike anything mankind has ever encountered before. The infected are subject to delirium, fever, a dramatic increase in violent behavior, and a one-hundred percent mortality rate. Death. But it doesn't end there. The victims return from death to walk the earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a massive military operation fails to contain the plague of the living dead it escalates into a global pandemic. In one fell swoop, the necessities of life become much more basic. Gone are petty everyday concerns. Gone are the amenities of civilized life. Yet a single law of nature remains: Live, or die. Kill, or be killed. On one side of the world, a battle-hardened General surveys the remnants of his command: a young medic, a veteran photographer, a brash Private, and dozens of refugees, all are his responsibility-all thousands of miles from home. Back in the United States, an Army Colonel discovers the darker side of Morningstar virus and begins to collaborate with a well-known journalist to leak the information to the public...The Morningstar Saga has begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2006 Z.A.

  <description>Edgy, suspenseful, and darkly comic, here is the first novel in a riveting new mystery series starring two cranky but brilliant old detectives whose lifelong friendship was forged solving crimes for the London Police Department's Peculiar Crimes Unit. In Full Dark House, Christopher Fowler tells the story of both their first and last case--and how along the way the unlikely pair of crime fighters changed the face of detection. &lt;br&gt;A present-day bombing rips through London and claims the life of eighty-year-old detective Arthur Bryant. For his partner John May, it means the end of a partnership that lasted over half-a-century and an eerie echo back to the Blitz of World War II when they first met. Desperately searching for clues to the killer's identity, May finds his old friend's notes of their very first case and becomes convinced that the past has returned...with a killing vengeance. &lt;br&gt;It begins when a dancer in a risque new production of Orpheus in Hell is found without her feet. Suddenly, the young detectives are plunged in a bizarre gothic mystery that will push them to their limits--and beyond. For in a city shaken by war, a faceless killer is stalking London's theaters, creating his own kind of sinister drama. And it will take Arthur Bryant's unorthodox techniques and John May's dogged police work to catch a criminal whose ability to escape detection seems almost supernatural--a murderer who even decades later seems to have claimed the life of one of them...and is ready to claim the other. &lt;br&gt;Filled with startling twists, unforgettable characters, and a mystery that will keep you guessing, Full Dark House is a witty, heartbreaking, and all-too-human thriller about the hunt for an inhuman killer.

  <description>A Boeing 777 arrives at JFK and is on its way across the tarmac, when it suddenly stops dead. All window shades are pulled down. All lights are out. All communication channels have gone quiet. Crews on the ground are lost for answers, but an alert goes out to the CDC. Dr. Ephraim "Eph" Goodweather, head of their Canary project, a rapid-response team that investigates biological threats, gets the call and boards the plane. What he finds makes his blood run cold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a pawnshop in Spanish Harlem, a former professor and survivor of the Holocaust named Abraham Setrakian knows something is happening. And he knows the time has come, that a war is brewing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins a battle of mammoth proportions as the vampiric virus that has infected New York begins to spill out into the streets. Eph, who is joined by Setrakian and a motley crew of fighters, must now find a way to stop the contagion and save his city - a city that includes his wife and son - before it is too late.</description>

  <description>It starts with the dogs. They won't stop barking. . . . And then the earth shrugs--8.9 on the Richter scale in the world's biggest earthquake since 1755. It hits New Madrid, Missouri, a sleepy town on the Mississippi. Seismologists had predicted the disaster . . . but no one listened. Within minutes, there is nothing but chaos and ruin as America's heartland falls into the nightmare known as the Rift--a fault line in the earth that wrenchingly exposes the fractures in American society itself. As a strange white mist smelling of sulfur rises from the crevassed ground, the real terror begins for the survivors, including a teenager separated from his mother, an African-American engineer searching for his daughter, a TV preacher whose visions of hell have become all too real, and a sheriff cum Ku Klux Klansman who seeks racial vengeance in the midst of disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can happen. And sooner or later, it will.</description>

  <description>In the first of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, 007 declares war on Le Chiffre, French communist and paymaster of the Soviet murder organization SMERSH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The battle begins with a fifty-million-franc game of baccarat, gains momentum during Bond's fiery love affair with a sensuous lady spy, and reaches a chilling climax with fiendish torture at the hands of a master sadist. For incredible suspense, unexpected thrills, and extraordinary danger, nothing can beat James Bond in his inaugural adventure.</description>

  <description>Denver crime-beat reporter Jack McEvoy specializes in violent death. So when his homicide detective brother kills himself, McEvoy copes in the only way he knows how--he decides to write the story. But his research leads him to suspect a serial killer is at work--a devious murderer who's killing cops and leaving a trail of poetic clues. It's the news story of a lifetime, if he can get the story without losing his life.</description>

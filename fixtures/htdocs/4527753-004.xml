  <description>&lt;div&gt;Wanted:&lt;br&gt;One young woman to take care of four-year-old boy.&lt;br&gt;Must be cheerful, enthusiastic and selfless-bordering on masochistic&lt;br&gt;Must relish sixteen-hour shifts with a deliberately nap-deprived pre-schooler&lt;br&gt;Must love getting thrown up on, literally and figuratively, by everyone in his family&lt;br&gt;Must enjoy the delicious anticipation of ridiculously erratic pay&lt;br&gt;Mostly, must love being treated like fungus found growing out of employers Hermes bag. &lt;br&gt;Those who take it personally need not apply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who wouldn't want this job?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling to graduate from NYU and afford her microscopic studio apartment, Nanny takes a position caring for the only son of the wealthy X family. She rapidly learns the insane amount of juggling involved to ensure that a Park Avenue wife who doesn't work, cook, clean, or raise her own child has a smooth day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Xs marriage begins to disintegrate, Nanny ends up involved way beyond the bounds of human decency or good taste. Her tenure with the X family becomes a nearly impossible mission to maintain the mental health of their four-year-old, her own integrity and, most importantly, her sense of humor. Over nine tense months Mrs. X and Nanny perform the age-old dance of decorum and power as they test the limits of modern-day servitude.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nanny Diaries&lt;/em&gt; deftly skewers the manner in which America's over-privileged raise les petites over-privileged-as if grooming them for a Best in Show competition. Written by two former nannies, this alternately comic and poignant satire punctures the glamour of Manhattan's upper class.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>In 1814, three cousins—Gretchen, Emma, and Penelope—discover their family lineage of witchcraft when a binding spell is broken, allowing their individual magical powers to manifest. Now, beyond the manicured gardens and ballrooms of Regency London, an alluring underworld available only to those with power is revealed to the cousins. By claiming their power, the three cousins have accidentally opened the gates to the underworld. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now ghouls, hellhounds—and most terrifying of all, the spirits of dark witches known as the Greymalkin Sisters—are hunting and killing young debutante witches for their powers. And, somehow, Emma is connected to the murders…because she keeps finding the bodies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Can the cousins seal the gates before another witch is killed…or even worse, before their new gifts are stripped away?</description>

  <description>The marriage of Marc Antony and Cleopatra is one of the greatest love stories of all time, a tale of unbridled passion with earth-shaking political consequences. Feared and hunted by the powers in Rome, the lovers choose to die by their own hands as the triumphant armies of Antony’s revengeful rival, Octavian, sweep into Egypt. Their three orphaned children are taken in chains to Rome; only two– the ten-year-old twins Selene and Alexander–survive the journey. Delivered to the household of Octavian’s sister, the siblings cling to each other and to the hope that they will return one day to their rightful place on the throne of Egypt. As they come of age, they are buffeted by the personal ambitions of Octavian’s family and court, by the ever-present threat of slave rebellion, and by the longings and desires deep within their own hearts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fateful tale of Selene and Alexander is brought brilliantly to life in &lt;em&gt;Cleopatra’s Daughter. &lt;/em&gt;Recounted in Selene’s youthful and engaging voice, it introduces a compelling cast of historical characters: Octavia, the emperor Octavian’s kind and compassionate sister, abandoned by Marc Antony for Cleopatra; Livia, Octavian's bitter and jealous wife; Marcellus, Octavian’s handsome, flirtatious nephew and heir apparent; Tiberius, Livia’s sardonic son and Marcellus’s great rival for power; and Juba, Octavian’s watchful aide, whose honored position at court has far-reaching effects on the lives of the young Egyptian royals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selene’s narrative is animated by the concerns of a young girl in any time and place–the possibility of finding love, the pull of friendship and family, and the pursuit of her unique interests and talents. While coping with the loss of both her family and her ancestral kingdom, Selene must find a path around the dangers of a foreign land. Her accounts of life in Rome are filled with historical details that vividly capture both the glories and horrors of the times. She dines with the empire’s most illustrious poets and politicians, witnesses the creation of the Pantheon, and navigates the colorful, crowded marketplaces of the city where Roman-style justice is meted out with merciless authority. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on meticulous research, &lt;em&gt;Cleopatra’s Daughter &lt;/em&gt;is a fascinating portrait of imperial Rome and of the people and events of this glorious and most tumultuous period in human history. Emerging from the shadows of the past, Selene, a young woman of irresistible charm and preternatural intelligence, will capture your heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A MASKED MAN . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter Makepeace lives a double life. By day he's the stoic headmaster of a home for foundling children. But the night brings out a darker side of Winter. As the moon rises, so does the Ghost of St. Giles-protector, judge, fugitive. When the Ghost, beaten and wounded, is rescued by a beautiful aristocrat, Winter has no idea that his two worlds are about to collide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DANGEROUS WOMAN . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Isabel Beckinhall enjoys nothing more than a challenge. Yet when she's asked to tutor the Home's dour manager in the ways of society-flirtation, double-entendres, and scandalous liaisons-Isabel can't help wondering why his eyes seem so familiar-and his lips so tempting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A PASSION NEITHER COULD DENY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the day Isabel and Winter engage in a battle of wills. At night their passions are revealed . . . But when little girls start disappearing from St. Giles, Winter must avenge them. For that he might have to sacrifice everything-the Home, Isabel . . . and his life.</description>

  <description>For Tristan Hart, everything changes with one crashing wave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was gone for three days. Sucked out to sea in a tidal wave and spit back ashore at Coney Island with no memory of what happened. Now his dreams are haunted by a terrifying silver mermaid with razor-sharp teeth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His best friend Layla is convinced something is wrong. But how can he explain he can sense emotion like never before? How can he explain he’s heir to a kingdom he never knew existed? That he’s suddenly a pawn in a battle as ancient as the gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something happened to him in those three days. He was claimed by the sea…and now it wants him back.</description>

  <description>A heretic thief is the empire’s only hope in this fascinating tale that inhabits the same world as the popular novel, &lt;em&gt;Elantris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shai is a Forger, a foreigner who can flawlessly copy and re-create any item by rewriting its history with skillful magic. Condemned to death after trying to steal the emperor’s scepter, she is given one opportunity to save herself. Though her skill as a Forger is considered an abomination by her captors, Shai will attempt to create a new soul for the emperor, who is almost dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Probing deeply into his life, she discovers Emperor Ashravan’s truest nature—and the opportunity to exploit it. Her only possible ally is one who is truly loyal to the emperor, but councilor Gaotona must overcome his prejudices to understand that Shai’s forgery is as much artistry as it is deception. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brimming with magic and political intrigue, this deftly woven fantasy delves into the essence of a living spirit.</description>

His story, the second volume in Anne Rice's best-selling Vampire Chronicles, is mesmerizing, passionate, and thrilling.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;YOU CAN BE A VII. IF YOU GIVE UP EVERYTHING.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Kitty Doe, it seems like an easy choice. She can either spend her life as a III in misery, looked down upon by the higher ranks and forced to leave the people she loves, or she can become a VII and join the most powerful family in the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she says yes, Kitty will be Masked—surgically transformed into Lila Hart, the Prime Minister's niece, who died under mysterious circumstances. As a member of the Hart family, she will be famous. She will be adored. And for the first time, she will matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's only one catch. She must also stop the rebellion that Lila secretly fostered, the same one that got her killed …and one Kitty believes in. Faced with threats, conspiracies and a life that's not her own, she must decide which path to choose—and learn how to become more than a pawn in a twisted game she's only beginning to understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously titled Masked.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;#1&lt;em&gt; New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Kelley Armstrong begins her new series with &lt;em&gt;Omens&lt;/em&gt;, featuring a compelling new heroine thrust into a decades-old murder case and the dark mysteries surrounding her strange new home. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Twenty-four-year-old Olivia Taylor Jones has the perfect life. The only daughter of a wealthy, prominent Chicago family, she has an Ivy League education, pursues volunteerism and philanthropy, and is engaged to a handsome young tech firm CEO with political ambitions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But Olivia’s world is shattered when she learns that she’s adopted. Her real parents? Todd and Pamela Larsen, notorious serial killers serving a life sentence. When the news brings a maelstrom of unwanted publicity to her adopted family and fiancé, Olivia decides to find out the truth about the Larsens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Olivia ends up in the small town of Cainsville, Illinois, an old and cloistered community that takes a particular interest in both Olivia and her efforts to uncover her birth parents’ past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aided by her mother’s former lawyer, Gabriel Walsh, Olivia focuses on the Larsens’ last crime, the one her birth mother swears will prove their innocence. But as she and Gabriel start investigating the case, Olivia finds herself drawing on abilities that have remained hidden since her childhood, gifts that make her both a valuable addition to Cainsville and deeply vulnerable to unknown enemies. Because there are darker secrets behind her new home and powers lurking in the shadows that have their own plans for her.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Every war has turning points and every person too.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Daisy is sent from Manhattan to England to visit her aunt and cousins she’s never met: three boys near her age, and their little sister. Her aunt goes away on business soon after Daisy arrives. The next day bombs go off as London is attacked and occupied by an unnamed enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As power fails, and systems fail, the farm becomes more isolated. Despite the war, it’s a kind of Eden, with no adults in charge and no rules, a place where Daisy’s uncanny bond with her cousins grows into something rare and extraordinary. But the war is everywhere, and Daisy and her cousins must lead each other into a world that is unknown in the scariest, most elemental way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A riveting and astonishing story.</description>

  <description>Every April, when the wind blows from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did You Know?-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Jamie was named after Nicholas's editor, Jamie Raab?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Landon is the name of his third son?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Nicholas Sparks recorded his own reading for the audio version of the novel?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Harry Crewe grew up a tomboy in forests, until her brother joined the Homelanders guarding the far desert reaches. Now an orphan, she joins him. Only a few months later, asking for military aid against advancing Northeners, comes Corlath, the Hillfolk King. After exchanging a single glance, his inner magic compels him to kidnap her, without knowing why. She does not know the Hillfolk language or why she has been chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Renamed Hari, she sees visions, and brings one to all, of the Golden Age legendary Dragon-Killer Queen Aerin, who smiles upon her. Hari is trained in the arts of war until she is a match for any of the elite royal guard, and carries Aerin's famed Blue Sword. Does she have the courage to accept her true fate?</description>

  <description>When Ileni lost her magic, she lost everything: her place in society, her purpose in life, and the man she had expected to spend her life with.  So when the Elders sent her to be magic tutor to a secret sect of assassins, she went willingly, even though the last two tutors had died under mysterious circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But beneath the assassins’ caves, Ileni will discover a new place and a new purpose… and a new and dangerous love. She will struggle to keep her lost magic a secret while teaching it to her deadly students, and to find out what happened to the two tutors who preceded her.  But what she discovers will change not only her future, but the future of her people, the assassins… and possibly the entire world.</description>

  <description>They called it the killing day. Twelve people dead, all in the space of a few hours. Five murderers: neighbors, relatives, friends. All of them so normal. All of them seemingly harmless. All of them now dead by their own hand . . . except one. And that one has no answers to offer the shattered town. She doesn't even know why she killed—or whether she'll do it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something is waking in the sleepy town of Oleander's, Kansas—something dark and hungry that lives in the flat earth and the open sky, in the vengeful hearts of upstanding citizens. As the town begins its descent into blood and madness, five survivors of the killing day are the only ones who can stop Oleander from destroying itself. Jule, the outsider at war with the world; West, the golden boy at war with himself; Daniel, desperate for a different life; Cass, who's not sure she deserves a life at all; and Ellie, who believes in sacrifice, fate, and in evil. Ellie, who always goes too far. They have nothing in common. They have nothing left to lose. And they have no way out. Which means they have no choice but to stand and fight, to face the darkness in their town—and in themselves. </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;EVERY CITY HAS A NOTTING HELL . . .  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A spot of extramarital nookie with a close neighbor is one thing. We're all grown-ups here. But selling a rare-to-the-market mid-Victorian house -- not merely a house but our children's ancestral &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; home -- on a communal garden, the sort of house that a banker would trample over his own grandmother to spend his bonus on -- is another thing entirely. It's &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meet Mimi. Mimi may "have it all" -- the house, the children, the part-time vanity job, the skinny jeans, the &lt;em&gt;feng shui&lt;/em&gt; guru -- but life chez Fleming is not as cushy as she'd like (husband Ralph prefers the trout stream to the fast lane). And when Mimi meets Si, the new billionaire on the block, at a sushi party, she soon faces a choice of keeping up or keeping it real.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then there's her best friend Clare, neat-freak garden designer, deep in biopanic about her childlessness with eco-architect husband, Gideon. Clare monitors all illicit activity in the private West London compound, from light adultery to heavy construction, and she is watching Mimi. . . .  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Notting Hell&lt;/em&gt; is a wickedly funny and oh-so-recognizable comedy of manners, filleting life on a communal garden in London. So take your irreplaceable numbered key and enter Lonsdale Gardens, the world of wealthy one-upmanship, where the old-fashioned laws of love still rule among the stainless steel kitchen appliances, cashmere throws, and compassionately produced cups of latte.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;INCLUDES  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Notting Hill for Beginners," a witty guide to the must-haves and must knows of Notting Hill&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>AN UNEXPECTED LOVE STORY . . .Jules Strauss is a Princeton senior on a full scholarship who plans on selling her "pedigree" eggs to help save her father from addiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annie Barrow, a struggling Pennsylvania housewife, thinks that carrying another woman's child will help her recover a sense of purpose and will bring in some much-needed cash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India Bishop, thirty-eight (really, forty-three) and recently married to the wealthy Marcus Croft, yearns for a baby for reasons that have more to do with money than with love. When her attempts at pregnancy fail, she turns to Jules and Annie to make her dreams come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But each of their plans is thrown into disarray when Bettina, Marcus's privileged daughter, becomes suspicious that her new stepmother is not what she seems . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told with Jennifer Weiner's trademark wit and sharp observations, "Then Came You "is a hilarious, tender, and timely tale that explores themes of class and entitlement, surrogacy and charity, the rights of a parent and the measure of a mother.</description>

  <description>What is the sinister mystery of Chateau Bois Serpe? &lt;p&gt;Roger, his parents, and twin sisters arrive at this crumbling ruin in the wilds of France, anticipating a holiday that's "different." And so it proves, but not as they'd hoped. The owner, the strange daughter Mesuline, whom Roger first meets tending her father's goats. She is like no girl he has ever seen, with her brusqueness and her expressionless black eyes, and as he gradually befriends her, he begins to realize that there is something very wrong about her, about the chateau, and about her life within it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roger senses a cry for help. How can he know that by trying to answer it, he will involve himself and his family in a shocking drama that reaches its climax in a grisly discovery and sudden death?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>April 1951. It has been twenty years since the death of Rebecca, the hauntingly beautiful first wife of Maxim de Winter, and twenty years since Manderley, the de Winter family's estate, was destroyed by fire. But Rebecca's tale is just beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colonel Julyan, an old family friend, receives an anonymous package concerning Rebecca. An inquisitive young scholar named Terence Gray appears and stirs up the quiet seaside hamlet with questions about the past and the close ties he soon forges with the Colonel and his eligible daughter, Ellie. Amid bitter gossip and murky intrigue, the trio begins a search for the real Rebecca and the truth behind her mysterious death.</description>

  <description>Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires. They protect vampire secrets - and human lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In The Indigo Spell, Sydney was torn between the Alchemist way of life and what her heart and gut were telling her to do. And in one breathtaking moment that Richelle Mead fans will never forget, she made a decision that shocked even her. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the struggle isn't over for Sydney. As she navigates the aftermath of her life-changing decision, she still finds herself pulled in too many directions at once. Her sister Zoe has arrived, and while Sydney longs to grow closer to her, there's still so much she must keep secret. Working with Marcus has changed the way she views the Alchemists, and Sydney must tread a careful path as she harnesses her profound magical ability to undermine the way of life she was raised to defend. Consumed by passion and vengeance, Sydney struggles to keep her secret life under wraps as the threat of exposure — and re-education — looms larger than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pulses will race throughout this smoldering fourth installment in the New York Times bestselling Bloodlines series, where no secret is safe.</description>

  <description>“I finally understand what the poets have written. In spring, moved to passion; in autumn only regret.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For young Peony, betrothed to a suitor she has never met, these lyrics from The Peony Pavilion mirror her own longings. In the garden of the Chen Family Villa, amid the scent of ginger, green tea, and jasmine, a small theatrical troupe is performing scenes from this epic opera, a live spectacle few females have ever seen. Like the heroine in the drama, Peony is the cloistered daughter of a wealthy family, trapped like a good-luck cricket in a bamboo-and-lacquer cage. Though raised to be obedient, Peony has dreams of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peony’s mother is against her daughter’s attending the production: “Unmarried girls should not be seen in public.” But Peony’s father assures his wife that proprieties will be maintained, and that the women will watch the opera from behind a screen. Yet through its cracks, Peony catches sight of an elegant, handsome man with hair as black as a cave–and is immediately overcome with emotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins Peony’s unforgettable journey of love and destiny, desire and sorrow–as Lisa See’s haunting new novel, based on actual historical events, takes readers back to seventeenth-century China, after the Manchus seize power and the Ming dynasty is crushed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steeped in traditions and ritual, this story brings to life another time and place–even the intricate realm of the afterworld, with its protocols, pathways, and stages of existence, a vividly imagined place where one’s soul is divided into three, ancestors offer guidance, misdeeds are punished, and hungry ghosts wander the earth. Immersed in the richness and magic of the Chinese vision of the afterlife, transcending even death, Peony in Love explores, beautifully, the many manifestations of love. Ultimately, Lisa See’s new novel addresses universal themes: the bonds of friendship, the power of words, and the age-old desire of women to be heard.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Caymen Meyers studies the rich like her own personal science experiment, and after years of observation she’s pretty sure they’re only good for one thing—spending money on useless stuff, like the porcelain dolls in her mother’s shop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Xander Spence walks into the store to pick up a doll for his grandmother, it only takes one glance for Caymen to figure out he’s oozing rich. Despite his charming ways and that he’s one of the first people who actually gets her, she’s smart enough to know his interest won’t last. Because if there’s one thing she’s learned from her mother’s warnings, it’s that the rich have a short attention span. But Xander keeps coming around, despite her best efforts to scare him off. And much to her dismay, she's beginning to enjoy his company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows her mom can’t find out—she wouldn’t approve. She’d much rather Caymen hang out with the local rocker who hasn’t been raised by money. But just when Xander’s attention and loyalty are about to convince Caymen that being rich isn’t a character flaw, she finds out that money is a much bigger part of their relationship than she’d ever realized. And that Xander’s not the only one she should’ve been worried about.</description>

  <description>Breathtaking new YA SF from the author of the Faeriewalker series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Nadia Lake comes from a high-class Executive family in the Corporate States. Her marriage has been arranged with the most powerful family in her state, which means she lives a life of privilege but also of public scrutiny, followed everywhere by photographers, every detail of her private life tabloid fodder. But her future is assured, as long as she can maintain her flawless public image — no easy feat when your betrothed is a notorious playboy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Hayes is the heir of Paxco — controller of the former state of New York, and creator of human replication technology, science that every state and every country in the world would kill to have. Though Nadia and Nate aren’t in love, they’ve grown up close, and they (and the world) are happy enough with their match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Nate turns up dead, and as far as everyone knows, Nadia was the last person to see him alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the new Nate wakes up in the replication tanks, he knows he must have died, but with a memory that only reaches to his last memory backup, he doesn’t know what killed him. Together, Nadia and Nate must discover what really happened without revealing the secrets that those who run their world would kill to protect.</description>

  <description>Meridian Six remembers the days before the Troika enslaved humans. She also remembers her mother, a freedom fighter murdered in the final battle between humans and vampires. But it is her mother's final words that have haunted her: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red means life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the years since her mother's death, she has been used as both a propaganda tool and a blood slave by the Troika. She's withstood their indignities because the alternative meant bleeding out in a blood camp. But their abuses finally go too far, and she decides to run towards freedom and her mother's red light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other side, she finds the Sisters of Crimson. They help her just as her mother promised, but they also hand her to the human rebels. The vampires used her famous name to keep human slaves biddable, but now the humans want to use it inspire a revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the world is at war, freedom is a luxury paid for with blood.</description>

  <description>“Never underestimate the power of a good story.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good advice...especially when a story can kill you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For most people, the story of their lives is just that: the accumulation of time, encounters, and actions into a cohesive whole. But for an unfortunate few, that day-to-day existence is affected—perhaps infected is a better word—by memetic incursion: where fairy tale narratives become reality, often with disastrous results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's where the ATI Management Bureau steps in, an organization tasked with protecting the world from fairy tales, even while most of their agents are struggling to keep their own fantastic archetypes from taking over their lives. When you're dealing with storybook narratives in the real world, it doesn't matter if you're Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, or the Wicked Queen: no one gets a happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indexing is New York Times bestselling author Seanan McGuire’s new urban fantasy where everything you thought you knew about fairy tales gets turned on its head.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;"There was little danger of encountering the Bennet sisters ever again."&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane Austen's classic novel &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; is beloved by millions, but little is revealed in the book about the mysterious and handsome hero, Mr. Darcy. And so the question has long remained: Who is Fitzwilliam Darcy?  &lt;p&gt; Pamela Aidan's trilogy finally answers that long-standing question, creating a rich parallel story that follows Darcy as he meets and falls in love with Elizabeth Bennet. &lt;em&gt;Duty and Desire&lt;/em&gt;, the second book in the trilogy, covers the "silent time" of Austen's novel, revealing Darcy's private struggle to overcome his attraction to Elizabeth while fulfilling his roles as landlord, master, brother, and friend.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Darcy pays a visit to an old classmate in Oxford in an attempt to shake Elizabeth from his mind, he is set upon by husband-hunting society ladies and ne'er-do-well friends from his university days, all with designs on him -- some for good and some for ill. He and his sartorial genius of a valet, Fletcher, must match wits with them all, but especially with the curious Lady Sylvanie.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irresistibly authentic and entertaining, &lt;em&gt;Duty and Desire&lt;/em&gt; remains true to the spirit and events of &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt; while incorporating fascinating new characters, and is sure to dazzle Austen fans and newcomers alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>They hear the most silent of footsteps.&lt;br&gt;They are faster than anything you've ever seen.&lt;br&gt;And They won't stop chasing you...until you are dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amy is watching TV when it happens, when the world is attacked by Them. These vile creatures are rapidly devouring mankind. Most of the population is overtaken, but Amy manages to escape—and even rescue “Baby,” a toddler left behind in the chaos. Marooned in Amy’s house, the girls do everything they can to survive—and avoid Them at all costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After years of hiding, they are miraculously rescued and taken to New Hope, a colony of survivors living in a former government research compound. While at first the colony seems like a dream with plenty of food, safety, and shelter, New Hope slowly reveals that it is far from ideal. And Amy soon realizes that unless things change, she’ll lose Baby—and much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebellious, courageous, and tender, this unforgettable duo will have you on the edge of your seat as you tear through the pulse-pounding narrow escapes and horrifying twists of fate in this thrilling debut from author Demitria Lunetta.</description>

  <description>Fans of Neil Gaiman's "American Gods" and Holly Black's "The Curse Workers" will embrace this richly drawn, Norse-mythology-infused alternate world: the United States of Asgard. Seventeen-year-old Soren Bearskin is trying to escape the past. His father, a famed warrior, lost himself to the battle-frenzy and killed thirteen innocent people. Soren cannot deny that berserking is in his blood--the fevers, insomnia, and occasional feelings of uncontrollable rage haunt him. So he tries to remain calm and detached from everyone at Sanctus Sigurd's Academy. But that's hard to do when a popular, beautiful girl like Astrid Glyn tells Soren she dreams of him. That's not all Astrid dreams of--the daughter of a renowned prophetess, Astrid is coming into her own inherited abilities. &lt;br&gt; When Baldur, son of Odin and one of the most popular gods in the country, goes missing, Astrid sees where he is and convinces Soren to join her on a road trip that will take them to find not only a lost god, but also who they are beyond the legacy of their parents and everything they've been told they have to be.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Ephraim Scott is horrified when he comes home from school and finds his mother unconscious at the kitchen table, clutching a bottle of pills. The reason for her suicide attempt is even more disturbing: she thought she’d identified Ephraim’s body at the hospital that day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among his dead double’s belongings, Ephraim finds a strange coin—a coin that grants wishes when he flips it. With a flick of his thumb, he can turn his alcoholic mother into a model parent and catch the eye of the girl he’s liked since second grade. But the coin doesn’t always change things for the better. And a bad flip can destroy other people’s lives as easily as it rebuilds his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The coin could give Ephraim everything he’s ever wanted—if he learns to control its power before his luck runs out.</description>

  <description>Every Fairy-Tale Ending Has a Price. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned as a child in the crumbling village of Tulan, Elara is determined to learn her true identity, even if it means wielding a dagger. Meanwhile, in Galandria's royal capital, Princess Wilha stands out as someone to either worship or fear. Though no one knows why the king has always made her conceal her face—including Wilha herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an assassination attempt threatens the peace of neighboring kingdoms, Elara and Wilha are brought face to face . . . with a chance at claiming new identities. However, with dark revelations now surfacing, both girls will need to decide if brighter futures are worth the binding risks.</description>

  <description>Knox was born into one of the City’s wealthiest families. A Patron, he has everything a boy could possibly want—the latest tech, the coolest clothes, and a Proxy to take all his punishments. When Knox breaks a vase, Syd is beaten. When Knox plays a practical joke, Syd is forced to haul rocks. And when Knox crashes a car, killing one of his friends, Syd is branded and sentenced to death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syd is a Proxy.  His life is not his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, neither is Knox’s. Knox and Syd have more in common than either would guess. So when Knox and Syd realize that the only way to beat the system is to save each other, they flee. Yet Knox’s father is no ordinary Patron, and Syd is no ordinary Proxy. The ensuing cross-country chase will uncover a secret society of rebels, test both boys’ resolve, and shine a blinding light onto a world of those who owe and those who pay. Some debts, it turns out, cannot be repaid.</description>

  <description>Here we go again … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when it seems life at Mythos Academy can’t get any more dangerous, the Reapers of Chaos manage to prove me wrong. It was just a typical night at the Library of Antiquities — until a Reaper tried to poison me. The good news is I’m still alive and kicking. The bad news is the Reaper poisoned someone else instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Nike’s Champion, everyone expects me to lead the charge against the Reapers, even though I’m still hurting over what happened with Spartan warrior Logan Quinn. I’ve got to get my hands on the antidote fast — otherwise, an innocent person will die. But the only known cure is hidden in some creepy ruins — and the Reapers are sure to be waiting for me there …</description>

  <description>Luke is the perfect boyfriend: handsome, kind, fun. He and Emaline have been together all through high school in Colby, the beach town where they both grew up. But now, in the summer before college, Emaline wonders if perfect is good enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Theo, a super-ambitious outsider, a New Yorker assisting on a documentary film about a reclusive local artist. Theo's sophisticated, exciting, and, best of all, he thinks Emaline is much too smart for Colby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emaline's mostly-absentee father, too, thinks Emaline should have a bigger life, and he's convinced that an Ivy League education is the only route to realizing her potential. Emaline is attracted to the bright future that Theo and her father promise. But she also clings to the deep roots of her loving mother, stepfather, and sisters. Can she ignore the pull of the happily familiar world of Colby?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emaline wants the moon and more, but how can she balance where she comes from with where she's going?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Dessen's devoted fans will welcome this story of romance, yearning, and, finally, empowerment. It could only happen in the summer.</description>

  <description>Destiny awaits Bianca and Lucas . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca and Lucas have always believed they could endure anything to be together. When a twist of fate not only transforms Bianca into a wraith but also turns Lucas into a vampire--the very creature he spent his life hunting--they are left reeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by his powerful need to kill, Lucas can turn to only one place for help . . . Evernight Academy. Bianca is determined to remain with him. But with the vampire leader of Evernight waging a war against wraiths, her former home has become the most dangerous place she could be, despite the new powers her ghostly transformation has given her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A battle between wraiths and vampires looms, and Bianca and Lucas face a terrifying new reality. They've overcome every obstacle life has thrown at them, but is their love strong enough to survive the challenges after life?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Bianca wants to escape.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's been uprooted from her small hometown and enrolled at Evernight Academy, an eerie Gothic boarding school where the students are somehow too perfect: smart, sleek, and almost predatory. Bianca knows she doesn't fit in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Lucas. He's not the "Evernight type" either, and he likes it that way. Lucas ignores the rules, stands up to the snobs, and warns Bianca to be careful—even when it comes to caring about him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I couldn't stand it if they took it out on you,"&lt;/em&gt; he tells Bianca, &lt;em&gt;"and eventually they would." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the connection between Bianca and Lucas can't be denied. Bianca will risk anything to be with Lucas, but dark secrets are fated to tear them apart . . . and to make Bianca question everything she's ever believed.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;There are no heroes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his wills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody fights the Epics... nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And David wants in. He wants Steelheart—the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planning—and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's seen Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.</description>

I'm not a fan of comic books, I enjoy superhero movies, but I've never been a fan of comics themselves because I'm not a visual person. I don't like pictures. I prefer words.

  <description>Sixteen year old Taylor Oh is cursed: if she is touched by the ghost of a murder victim then they pass a mark beneath her skin. She has three weeks to find their murderer and pass the mark to them – letting justice take place and sending them into the Darkness. And if she doesn’t make it in time? The Darkness will come for her…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She spends her life trying to avoid ghosts, make it through school where she’s bullied by popular Justin and his cronies, keep her one remaining friend, and persuade her father that this is real and that she’s not going crazy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Justin is murdered and everything gets a whole lot worse. Justin doesn’t know who killed him, so there’s no obvious person for Taylor to go after. The clues she has lead her to the V Club, a vicious secret society at her school where no one is allowed to leave… and where Justin was dared to do the stunt which led to his death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she find out who was responsible for his murder before the Darkness comes for her? Can she put aside her hatred for her former bully to truly help him? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what happens if she starts to fall for him?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It all began with a ruined elixir and an accidental bolt of lightning…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iolanthe Seabourne is the greatest elemental mage of her generation—or so she's being told. The one prophesied for years to be the savior of The Realm. It is her duty and destiny to face and defeat the Bane, the greatest mage tyrant the world has ever known. A suicide task for anyone let alone a sixteen-year-old girl with no training, facing a prophecy that foretells a fiery clash to the death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prince Titus of Elberon has sworn to protect Iolanthe at all costs but he's also a powerful mage committed to obliterating the Bane to avenge the death of his family—even if he must sacrifice both Iolanthe and himself to achieve his goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Titus makes the terrifying mistake of falling in love with the girl who should have been only a means to an end. Now, with the servants of the Bane closing in, he must choose between his mission and her life.</description>

  <description>John Charming isn't your average Prince... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He comes from a line of Charmings — an illustrious family of dragon slayers, witch-finders and killers dating back to before the fall of Rome. Trained by a modern day version of the Knights Templar, monster hunters who have updated their methods from chainmail and crossbows to kevlar and shotguns, he was one of the best. That is — until he became the abomination the Knights were sworn to hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was a lifetime ago. Now, he tends bar under an assumed name in rural Virginia and leads a peaceful, quiet life. One that shouldn't change just because a vampire and a blonde walked into his bar... Right?</description>

  <description>It's a night like any other on board the Icarus. Then, catastrophe strikes: the massive luxury spaceliner is yanked out of hyperspace and plummets into the nearest planet. Lilac LaRoux and Tarver Merendsen survive. And they seem to be alone.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilac is the daughter of the richest man in the universe. Tarver comes from nothing, a young war hero who learned long ago that girls like Lilac are more trouble than they’re worth. But with only each other to rely on, Lilac and Tarver must work together, making a tortuous journey across the eerie, deserted terrain to seek help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, against all odds, Lilac and Tarver find a strange blessing in the tragedy that has thrown them into each other’s arms. Without the hope of a future together in their own world, they begin to wonder—would they be better off staying here forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes when they uncover the truth behind the chilling whispers that haunt their every step. Lilac and Tarver may find a way off this planet. But they won’t be the same people who landed on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A timeless love story, THESE BROKEN STARS sets into motion a sweeping science fiction series of companion novels. The Starbound Trilogy: Three worlds. Three love stories. One enemy.</description>

  <description>Startling, unusual, and yet irresistably readable, Among Others is at once the compelling story of a young woman struggling to escape a troubled childhood, a brilliant diary of first encounters with the great novels of modern fantasy and SF, and a spellbinding tale of escape from ancient enchantment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raised by a half-mad mother who dabbled in magic, Morwenna Phelps found refuge in two worlds. As a child growing up in Wales, she played among the spirits who made their homes in industrial ruins. But her mind found freedom and promise in the science fiction novels that were her closest companions. Then her mother tried to bend the spirits to dark ends, and Mori was forced to confront her in a magical battle that left her crippled--and her twin sister dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing to her father whom she barely knew, Mori was sent to boarding school in England–a place all but devoid of true magic. There, outcast and alone, she tempted fate by doing magic herself, in an attempt to find a circle of like-minded friends. But her magic also drew the attention of her mother, bringing about a reckoning that could no longer be put off…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combining elements of autobiography with flights of imagination in the manner of novels like Jonathan Lethem’s The Fortress of Solitude, this is potentially a breakout book for an author whose genius has already been hailed by peers like Kelly Link, Sarah Weinman, and Ursula K. Le Guin.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;It's time to choose sides....&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the surface, Sorry-in-the-Vale is a sleepy English town. But Kami Glass knows the truth. Sorry-in-the-Vale is full of magic. In the old days, the Lynburn family ruled with fear, terrifying the people into submission in order to kill for blood and power. Now the Lynburns are back, and Rob Lynburn is gathering sorcerers so that the town can return to the old ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Rob and his followers aren’t the only sorcerers in town. A decision must be made: pay the blood sacrifice, or fight. For Kami, this means more than just choosing between good and evil. With her link to Jared Lynburn severed, she’s now free to love anyone she chooses. But who should that be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A darkly humorous take on Gothic romance, Sarah Rees Brennan's Lynburn Legacy weaves together the tale of a heroine desperate to protect those she loves, two boys hoping to be saved, and the magical forces that will shape their destiny.</description>

  <description>The haunting, humorous and tender story of the brief lives of the five entrancing Lisbon sisters, &lt;em&gt;The Virgin Suicides&lt;/em&gt;, now a major film, is Jeffrey Eugenides' classic debut novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shocking thing about the girls was how nearly normal they seemed when their mother let them out for the one and only date of their lives. Twenty years on, their enigmatic personalities are embalmed in the memories of the boys who worshipped them and who now recall their shared adolescence: the brassiere draped over a crucifix belonging to the promiscuous Lux; the sisters' breathtaking appearance on the night of the dance; and the sultry, sleepy street across which they watched a family disintegrate and fragile lives disappear.</description>

  <description>Lizzie, Ella, and Betsey Best grew up believing they were identical triplets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then they learned the truth...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and no one else can know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, to the outside world, the Best family appears to consist of a single mother with one seventeen-year-old daughter named Elizabeth. Lizzie, Ella, and Betsey take turns going to school, pursuing extracurriculars, and even dating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Lizzie meets Sean Kelly, the one person who can help her realize she's not a carbon copy of the others - she's an individual with unique dreams and desires. Digging deeper into her background and her mother's role in her life, Lizzie begins to dismantle the delicate balance of an unusual family that only science could have created.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;1814 promises to be another eventful season, but not, this author believes, for Anthony Bridgerton, London's most elusive bachelor, who has shown no indication that he plans to marry.&lt;br&gt;And in truth, why should he? When it comes to playing the consummate rake, nobody does it better...&lt;br&gt;--Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, &lt;/em&gt;April 1814&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this time, the gossip columnists have it wrong. Anthony Bridgerton hasn't just decided to marry--he's even chosen a wife! The only obstacle is his intended's older sister, Kate Sheffield--the most meddlesome woman ever to grace a London ballroom. The spirited schemer is driving Anthony mad with her determination to stop the betrothal, but when he closes his eyes at night, Kate is the woman haunting his increasingly erotic dreams...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Kate is quite sure that reformed rakes do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make the best husbands--and Anthony Bridgerton is the most wicked rogue of them all.  Kate is determined to protect her sister--but she fears her own heart is vulnerable.  And when Anthony's lips touch hers, she's suddenly afraid she might not be able to resist the reprehensible rake herself...</description>

  <description>Penelope Featherington has secretly adored her best friend's brother for... well, it feels like forever. After half a lifetime of watching Colin Bridgerton from afar, she thinks she knows everything about him, until she stumbles across his deepest secret... and fears she doesn't know him at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Bridgerton is tired of being thought nothing but an empty-headed charmer, tired of everyone's preoccupation with the notorious gossip columnist Lady Whistledown, who can't seem to publish an edition without mentioning him in the first paragraph. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Colin returns to London from a trip aboard, he discovers nothing in his life is quite the same, especially Penelope Featherington, the girl haunting his dreams! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when he discovers that Penelope has secrets of her own, this elusive bachelor must decide... is she his biggest threat, or his promise of a happy ending?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 March 1811.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Today I fell in love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of ten, Miss Miranda Cheever showed no signs of ever becoming a Great Beauty. Her hair was lamentably brown, her eyes the same muddy colour, and her legs, which were uncommonly long, refused to learn anything which might remotely be called grace. Only, in 1811, the nineteen-year-old Viscount Turner—elder brother of Miranda's closest friend—had kissed the hand of an awkward ten-year-old girl and promised her that one day she'd be as beautiful as she was smart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, eight years later, Miranda is a woman grown, and Turner an embittered widower. But she has never forgotten his kindness. Indeed it is only in her diary that she confides the truth: she has never stopped loving Turner, and she has never stopped hoping that one day he will see her as more than a naive girl.</description>

  <description>Freak. That's what her classmates call seventeen-year-old Donna Underwood. When she was seven, a horrific fey attack killed her father and drove her mother mad. Donna's own nearly fatal injuries from the assault were fixed by magic—the iron tattoos branding her hands and arms. The child of alchemists, Donna feels cursed by the magical heritage that destroyed her parents and any chance she had for a normal life. The only thing that keeps her sane and grounded is her relationship with her best friend, Navin Sharma.&lt;p&gt;When the darkest outcasts of Faerie—the vicious wood elves—abduct Navin, Donna finally has to accept her role in the centuries old war between the humans and the fey. Assisted by Xan, a gorgeous half-fey dropout with secrets of his own, Donna races to save her friend—even if it means betraying everything her parents and the alchemist community fought to the death to protect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I thought this would be a dystopian universe where people knew what the iron branding on her arm meant, and that's why Donna is ostracized.

  <description>The Hematoi descend from the unions of gods and mortals, and the children of two Hematoi pure bloods have godlike powers. Children of Hematoi and mortals--well, not so much. Half-bloods only have two options: become trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes of the pures. Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets, but she may end up slumming it anyway. There are several rules that students at the Covenant must follow. Alex has problems with them all, but especially rule #1:Relationships between pures and halfs are forbidden. Unfortunately, she's crushing hard on the totally hot pure-blood Aiden. But falling for Aiden isn't her biggest problem--staying alive long enough to graduate the Covenant and become a Sentinel is. If she fails in her duty, she faces a future worse than death or slavery: being turned into a daimon, and being hunted by Aiden. And that would kind of suck.</description>

      <![CDATA[I might have rated this book higher had I read this before Richelle Mead's <em>Vampire Academy</em> series. As it stands, the characters and the plot all feels like a very watered down version of VA. I couldn't help comparing one character to the next, and they all felt lacking.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the New Blood Dagger, Arthur Ellis, Barry, Anthony, and Dilys awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the Sûreté du Québec and his team of investigators are called in to the scene of a suspicious death in a rural village south of Montréal and yet a world away. Jane Neal, a long-time resident of Three Pines, has been found dead in the woods. The locals are certain it’s a tragic hunting accident and nothing more but Gamache smells something foul this holiday season…and is soon certain that Jane died at the hands of someone much more sinister than a careless bowhunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this award-winning first novel, Louise Penny introduces an engaging hero in Inspector Gamache, who commands his forces—and this series—with power, ingenuity, and charm.</description>

  <description>A searing, post apocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Cozy mystery lovers’ favorite paranormal sleuth is back with her eighteenth otherworldly adventure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When a finely wrought silver sleigh figurine turns up in her thrift shop, Lori Shepherd recognizes it instantly.  It was the object that mesmerized the sweet but very poor nine-year-old Daisy Pickering at Sproggton Manor, the bizarre Jacobean house-turned-museum Lori recently visited with her twin sons.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hoping to avoid any real commotion, Lori decides to speak with the museum curator, who turns out to be oddly uninterested in the theft. But there’s not much that could be done anyway for the Pickerings seem to have come into some money and moved to Australia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With Aunt Dimity’s otherworldly guidance, Lori’s search for the sleigh’s true owner leads her to a tangled web of secrets stretching from the finest English country estates back to the blood-drenched soil of the Russian Revolution.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Ian McEwan’s symphonic novel of love and war, childhood and class, guilt and forgiveness provides all the satisfaction of a brilliant narrative and the provocation we have come to expect from this master of English prose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a hot summer day in 1934, thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis witnesses a moment’s flirtation between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, the son of a servant and Cecilia’s childhood friend. But Briony’s incomplete grasp of adult motives—together with her precocious literary gifts—brings about a crime that will change all their lives. As it follows that crime’s repercussions through the chaos and carnage of World War II and into the close of the twentieth century, &lt;em&gt;Atonement&lt;/em&gt; engages the reader on every conceivable level, with an ease and authority that mark it as a genuine masterpiece.</description>

  <description>Paul Bäumer enlisted with his classmates in the German army of World War I. Youthful, enthusiastic, they become soldiers. But despite what they have learned, they break into pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. And as horrible war plods on year after year, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principles of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against each other --- if only he can come out of the war alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure."&lt;br&gt;THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Can Tessa pose as Madison . . . and stop a killer before it’s too late? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tessa is a Variant, able to absorb the DNA of anyone she touches and mimic their appearance. Shunned by her family, she’s spent the last two years training with the Forces with Extraordinary Abilities, a secret branch of the FBI. When a serial killer rocks a small town in Oregon, Tessa is given a mission: she must impersonate Madison, a local teen, to find the killer before he strikes again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tessa hates everything about being an impostor—the stress, the danger, the deceit—but loves playing the role of a normal girl. As Madison, she finds friends, romance, and the kind of loving family she’d do anything to keep. Amid action, suspense, and a ticking clock, this super-human comes to a very human conclusion: even a girl who can look like anyone struggles the most with being herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Regret was for people with nothing to defend, people who had no water.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lynn knows every threat to her pond: drought, a snowless winter, coyotes, and, most importantly, people looking for a drink. She makes sure anyone who comes near the pond leaves thirsty, or doesn't leave at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confident in her own abilities, Lynn has no use for the world beyond the nearby fields and forest. Having a life means dedicating it to survival, and the constant work of gathering wood and water. Having a pond requires the fortitude to protect it, something Mother taught her well during their quiet hours on the rooftop, rifles in hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wisps of smoke on the horizon mean one thing: strangers. The mysterious footprints by the pond, nighttime threats, and gunshots make it all too clear Lynn has exactly what they want, and they won’t stop until they get it….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With evocative, spare language and incredible drama, danger, and romance, debut author Mindy McGinnis depicts one girl’s journey in a barren world not so different than our own.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mattie was never truly mine. That knowledge must have filled me as quickly and surely as the milk from her breasts. Although my family ‘owned’ her, although she occupied the center of my universe, her deepest affections lay elsewhere. So along with the comfort of her came the fear that I would lose her some day. This is our story...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins Lisbeth Wainwright’s compelling tale of coming-of-age in antebellum Virginia. Born to white plantation owners but raised by her enslaved black wet nurse, Mattie, Lisbeth’s childhood unfolds on the line between two very different worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up under the tender care of Mattie, Lisbeth adopts her surrogate mother’s deep-seated faith in God, her love of music and black-eyed peas, and the tradition of hunting for yellow crocuses in the early days of spring. In time, Lisbeth realizes she has freedoms and opportunities that Mattie does not have, though she’s confined by the societal expectations placed on women born to privilege. As Lisbeth grows up, she struggles to reconcile her love for her caregiver with her parents’ expectations, a task made all the more difficult as she becomes increasingly aware of the ugly realities of the American slavery system. When Lisbeth bears witness to a shockingly brutal act, the final vestiges of her naiveté crumble around her. Lisbeth realizes she must make a choice, one that will require every ounce of the courage she learned from her beloved Mattie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This compelling historical novel is a richly evocative tale of love, loss, and redemption set during one of the most sinister chapters of American history.</description>

  <description>Alyssa Gardner has been down the rabbit hole and faced the bandersnatch. She saved the life of Jeb, the guy she loves, and escaped the machinations of the disturbingly seductive Morpheus and the vindictive Queen Red. Now all she has to do is graduate high school and make it through prom so she can attend the prestigious art school in London she's always dreamed of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    That would be easier without her mother, freshly released from an asylum, acting overly protective and suspicious. And it would be much simpler if the mysterious Morpheus didn’t show up for school one day to tempt her with another dangerous quest in the dark, challenging Wonderland—where she (partly) belongs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    As prom and graduation creep closer, Alyssa juggles Morpheus’s unsettling presence in her real world with trying to tell Jeb the truth about a past he’s forgotten. Glimpses of Wonderland start to bleed through her art and into her world in very disturbing ways, and Morpheus warns that Queen Red won’t be far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    If Alyssa stays in the human realm, she could endanger Jeb, her parents, and everyone she loves. But if she steps through the rabbit hole again, she'll face a deadly battle that could cost more than just her head.</description>

  <description>It's been six weeks since angels of the apocalypse descended to demolish the modern world. Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anything, including making a deal with an enemy angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival.  Together, they journey toward the angels' stronghold in San Francisco where she'll risk everything to rescue her sister and he'll put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for ages 16 and up.</description>

      <![CDATA[It's an interesting twist to the angel genre. <em>Angelfall</em> isn't the best book about angels that I've read, but it has restored my faith (har har) in the genre. The first half of the book probably garners a 4-4.5 stars, the second half a 2, so my rating is an average. In some ways, it's frustrating,...]]>

  <description>Anne's children were almost grown up, except for pretty, high-spirited Rilla. No one could resist her bright hazel eyes and dazzling smile. Rilla, almost fifteen, can't think any further ahead than going to her very first dance at the Four Winds lighthouse and getting her first kiss from handsome Kenneth Ford. But undreamed-of challenges await the irrepressible Rilla when the world of Ingleside becomes endangered by a far-off war. Her brothers go off to fight, and Rilla brings home an orphaned newborn in a soup tureen. She is swept into a drama that tests her courage and leaves her changed forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the Newbery Medal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt; Best of Children's Books&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A National Book Award Nominee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Taylor . . . writes not with rancor or bitterness of indignities, but with pride, strength, and respect for humanity."—&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Why is the land so important to Cassie's family? It takes the events of one turbulent year—the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliates Cassie in public simply because she's black—to show Cassie that having a place of their own is the Logan family's lifeblood. It is the land that gives the Logans their courage and pride—no matter how others may degrade them, the Logans possess something no one can take away.</description>

  <description>The novel is set in the midwestern United States (Kansas) during the late 19th century. Jacob Witting, a widowed farmer who is still saddened by the death of his wife several years earlier, giving birth to Caleb, finds that the task of taking care of his farm and two children, Anna and Caleb, is too difficult to handle alone. He writes an ad in the newspaper for a mail-order bride. Sarah, from Maine, answers his ad and travels out to become his wife. But Sarah grows homesick - the prairie grass didn't substitute for the Maine sea shore. When Sarah leaves for a trip into town, the kids wonder if she would come back. And she did. She had brought back colored pencils so she could show them the beautiful colors and views of Maine and gorgeous sea shore. She, Anna, Caleb, and Jacob have a lot of good times that lead to Caleb loving Sarah even more, but Anna thinks that she will replace her mother. In the end Sarah and Jacob get married.</description>

  <description>"The beloved Noel Streatfeild classic back in print! &lt;br&gt;"It's a stroke of great luck when Harriet Johnson's doctor prescribes skating after an illness that has left her feeling frail and listless. For on her very first day at the rink, Harriet meets orphaned Lalla Moore, who is being brought up by her wealthy aunt Claudia to be a skating champion. Although they have little in common, the girls form a fast friendship. Harriet is energized by talented, funny Lalla, and Lalla in turn blossoms under the affection of openhearted Harriet. The girls skate together more and more. But just as Lalla's interest in skating starts to fade, Harriet's natural talent begins to emerge. Suddenly Lalla and Harriet seem headed in two very different directions. Can their friendship survive?</description>

  <description>Jess Aarons' greatest ambition is to be the fastest runner in his grade. He's been practicing all summer and can't wait to see his classmates' faces when he beats them all. But on the first day of school, a new girl boldly crosses over to the boys' side and outruns everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's not a very promising beginning for a friendship, but Jess and Leslie Burke become inseparable. Together they create Terabithia, a magical kingdom in the woods where the two of them reign as king and queen, and their imaginations set the only limits.</description>

  <description>Last year, Annabel was "the girl who has everything" — at least that's the part she played in the television commercial for Kopf's Department Store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, she's the girl who has nothing: no best friend because mean-but-exciting Sophie dropped her, no peace at home since her older sister became anorexic, and no one to sit with at lunch. Until she meets Owen Armstrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tall, dark, and music-obsessed, Owen is a reformed bad boy with a commitment to truth-telling. With Owen's help, maybe Annabel can face what happened the night she and Sophie stopped being friends.</description>

  <description>There are many things that Annah would like to forget: the look on her sister's face when she and Elias left her behind in the Forest of Hands and Teeth, her first glimpse of the horde as they found their way to the Dark City, the sear of the barbed wire that would scar her for life. But most of all, Annah would like to forget the morning Elias left her for the Recruiters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annah's world stopped that day and she's been waiting for him to come home ever since. Without him, her life doesn't feel much different from that of the dead that roam the wasted city around her. Then she meets Catcher and everything feels alive again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except, Catcher has his own secrets—dark, terrifying truths that link him to a past Annah's longed to forget, and to a future too deadly to consider. And now it's up to Annah—can she continue to live in a world drenched in the blood of the living? Or is death the only escape from the Return's destruction?</description>

  <description>Greg and Tess MacAvoy are one of four prominent Nantucket couples who count each other as best friends. As pillars of their close-knit community, the MacAvoys, Kapenashes, Drakes, and Wheelers are important to their friends and neighbors, and especially to each other. But just before the beginning of another idyllic summer, Greg and Tess are killed when their boat capsizes during an anniversary sail. As the warm weather approaches and the island mourns their loss, nothing can prepare the MacAvoy's closest friends for what will be revealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again, Hilderbrand masterfully weaves an intense tale of love and loyalty set against the backdrop of endless summer island life.</description>

  <description>Meredith Martin Delinn just lost everything: her friends, her homes, her social standing - because her husband Freddy cheated rich investors out of billions of dollars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate and facing homelessness, Meredith receives a call from her old best friend, Constance Flute. Connie's had recent worries of her own, and the two depart for a summer on Nantucket in an attempt to heal. But the island can't offer complete escape, and they're plagued by new and old troubles alike. When Connie's brother Toby - Meredith's high school boyfriend - arrives, Meredith must reconcile the differences between the life she is leading and the life she could have had. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against the backdrop of a Nantucket summer, Elin Hilderbrand delivers a suspenseful story of the power of friendship, the pull of love, and the beauty of forgiveness.</description>

  <description>Birdie Cousins has thrown herself into the details of her daughter Chess's lavish wedding, from the floating dance floor in her Connecticut back yard to the color of the cocktail napkins. Like any mother of a bride-to-be, she is weathering the storms of excitement and chaos, tears and joy. But Birdie, a woman who prides herself on preparing for every possibility, could never have predicted the late-night phone call from Chess, abruptly announcing that she's cancelled her engagement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's only the first hint of what will be a summer of upheavals and revelations. Before the dust has even begun to settle, far worse news arrives, sending Chess into a tailspin of despair. Reluctantly taking a break from the first new romance she's embarked on since the recent end of her 30-year marriage, Birdie circles the wagons and enlists the help of her younger daughter Tate and her own sister India. Soon all four are headed for beautiful, rustic Tuckernuck Island, off the coast of Nantucket, where their family has summered for generations. No phones, no television, no grocery store - a place without distractions where they can escape their troubles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But throw sisters, daughters, ex-lovers, and long-kept secrets onto a remote island, and what might sound like a peaceful getaway becomes much more. Before summer has ended, dramatic truths are uncovered, old loves are rekindled, and new loves make themselves known. It's a summertime story only Elin Hilderbrand can tell, filled with the heartache, laughter, and surprises that have made her page-turning, bestselling novels as much a part of summer as a long afternoon on a sunny beach.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Things break all the time.&lt;br&gt; Day breaks, waves break, voices break.&lt;br&gt; Promises break.&lt;br&gt; Hearts break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Every expectant parent will tell you that they don't want a perfect baby, just a healthy one. Charlotte and Sean O'Keefe would have asked for a healthy baby, too, if they'd been given the choice. Instead, their lives are made up of sleepless nights, mounting bills, the pitying stares of "luckier" parents, and maybe worst of all, the what-ifs. What if their child had been born healthy? But it's all worth it because Willow is, well, funny as it seems, perfect. She's smart as a whip, on her way to being as pretty as her mother, kind, brave, and for a five-year-old an unexpectedly deep source of wisdom. Willow is Willow, in sickness and in health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Everything changes, though, after a series of events forces Charlotte and her husband to confront the most serious what-ifs of all. What if Charlotte should have known earlier of Willow's illness? What if things could have been different? What if their beloved Willow had never been born? To do Willow justice, Charlotte must ask herself these questions and one more. What constitutes a valuable life? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emotionally riveting and profoundly moving, &lt;em&gt;Handle with Care&lt;/em&gt; brings us into the heart of a family bound by an incredible burden, a desperate will to keep their ties from breaking, and, ultimately, a powerful capacity for love. Written with the grace and wisdom she's become famous for, beloved #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jodi Picoult offers us an unforgettable novel about the fragility of life and the lengths we will go to protect it.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Sister's Keeper&lt;/em&gt; examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in &lt;em&gt;My Sister's Keeper,&lt;/em&gt; Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.</description>

  <description>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, &lt;em&gt;Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings.  "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"  Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He smiles. It's a wicked smile. Kind but not kind. Handsome but dangerous. Feral almost. I can see why Nick nearly killed him, Nick...&lt;br&gt;I ask again, "Why were you in the road?"&lt;br&gt;"I was waiting for you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zara and her friends thought they'd solved the pixie problem. And they did - sort of. The pixie's are all locked away, deep in the woods. But the king's needs grow stronger each day that he is in captivity, while his control over his people weakens. And it's enough to draw a new king into town. Astley claims he is different. He claims there are pixies who can live peacefully with humans, that it doesn't have to be all violence and nastiness all the time. Zara wants to believe him...until Astley also claims that she is fated to be his queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no way Zara would ever turn pixie. And she's got good friends who will make sure of that. Besides, she and Nick are so in love they're practically inseparable. But when they very thing Zara wants to protect most is exactly what's at risk, she is forced to make choices she never imagined....</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;What could be more dangerous than cozy village life in the English countryside? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max Tudor has adapted well to his post as vicar of St. Edwold’s in the idyllic village of Nether Monkslip. The quiet village seems the perfect home for Max, who has fled a harrowing past as an MI5 agent. Now he has found a measure of peace among urban escapees and yoga practitioners, artists and crafters and New Agers. But this new-found serenity is quickly shattered when the highly vocal and unpopular president of the Women’s Institute turns up dead at the Harvest Fayre. The death looks like an accident, but Max’s training as a former agent kicks in, and before long he suspects foul play.  &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max has ministered to the community long enough to be familiar with the tangled alliances and animosities among the residents, but this tragedy surprises and confounds him. It is impossible to believe anyone in his lovely village capable of the crime, and yet given the victim, he must acknowledge that almost everyone had probably fantasized about killing Wanda Batton-Smythe.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the investigation unfolds, Max becomes more intricately involved. Memories he’d rather not revisit are stirred, evoking the demons from the past which led him to Nether Monkslip. In WICKED AUTUMN, G.M. Malliet serves up an irresistible English village—deliciously skewered—a flawed but likeable protagonist, and a brilliantly modern version of the traditional drawing room mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;'s Best Mystery Books of 2011 &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The era of the Tudors was one of danger, intrigue, conspiracy, and, above all, spies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Summer 1553: A time of danger and deceit. Brendan Prescott, an orphan, is reared in the household of the powerful Dudley family. Brought to court, Prescott finds himself sent on an illicit mission to the king’s brilliant but enigmatic sister, Princess Elizabeth. But Brendan is soon compelled to work as a double agent by Elizabeth’s protector, William Cecil, who promises in exchange to help him unravel the secret of his own mysterious past. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A dark plot swirls around Elizabeth’s quest to unravel the truth about the ominous disappearance of her seriously ill brother, King Edward VI. With only a bold stable boy and an audacious lady-in-waiting at his side, Brendan plunges into a ruthless gambit of half-truths, lies, and murder. Filled with the intrigue and pageantry of Tudor England, &lt;em&gt;The Tudor Secret &lt;/em&gt;is the first book in The Elizabeth I Spymaster Chronicles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Things I know about Reece Malcolm:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. She graduated from New York University.&lt;br&gt;2. She lives in or near Los Angeles.&lt;br&gt;3. Since her first novel was released, she’s been on the New York Times bestseller list every week.&lt;br&gt;4. She likes strong coffee and bourbon.&lt;br&gt;5. She’s my mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devan knows very little about Reece Malcolm, until the day her father dies and she’s shipped off to live with the mother she’s never met. All she has is a list of notebook entries that doesn’t add up to much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;L.A. offers a whole new world to Devan—a performing arts school allows her to pursue her passion for show choir and musicals, a new circle of friends helps to draw her out of her shell, and an intriguing boy opens up possibilities for her first love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then the Reece Malcolm list gets a surprising new entry. Now that Devan is so close to having it all, can she handle the possibility of losing everything?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lovely Bones&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a family devastated by a gruesome murder -- a murder recounted by the teenage victim.  Upsetting, you say?  Remarkably, first-time novelist Alice Sebold takes this difficult material and delivers a compelling and accomplished exploration of a fractured family's need for peace and closure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the crime are laid out in the first few pages: from her vantage point in heaven, Susie Salmon describes how she was confronted by the murderer one December afternoon on her way home from school.  Lured into an underground hiding place, she was raped and killed.  But what the reader knows, her family does not.  Anxiously, we keep vigil with Susie, aching for her grieving family, desperate for the killer to be found and punished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebold creates a heaven that's calm and comforting, a place whose residents can have whatever they enjoyed when they were alive -- and then some.  But Susie isn't ready to release her hold on life just yet, and she intensely watches her family and friends as they struggle to cope with a reality in which she is no longer a part.  To her great credit, Sebold has shaped one of the most loving and sympathetic fathers in contemporary literature.</description>

Her long hours have led to a broken engagement and, suddenly single at thirty-four, she feels her messy life crumbling around her. But when the family gathers for her grandmother Addie’s ninety-ninth birthday, a relative lets slip hints about a long-buried family secret, leading Clemmie on a journey into the past that could change everything. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is a potent story that spans generations and continents, bringing an &lt;em&gt;Out of Africa&lt;/em&gt; feel to a &lt;em&gt;Downton Abbey&lt;/em&gt; cast of unforgettable characters. From the inner circles of WWI-era British society to the skyscrapers of Manhattan and the red-dirt hills of Kenya, the never-told secrets of a woman and a family unfurl.</description>

  <description>Despite Setsuna's efforts to deny his love for his sister, he can't allow her to leave the country without letting her know how he feels, but how can she feel about love that borders on incest? She may never live to find out, because an angel has been sent down from heaven just for her-just to make sure that she dies! The two demons from hell, Kurai and Arachne, are still trying to bring out the avenging angel in Setsuna, but first they must deal with the mysterious, seemingly immortal Kira. Even if a way is found to bring the angel Alexiel out of Setsuna, can Tokyo survive the transformation?</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;Rurouni Kenshin&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most beloved and popular manga series worldwide. Set against the backdrop of the Meiji Restoration, it tells the saga of Himura Kenshin, once an assassin of ferocious power, now a humble &lt;em&gt;rurouni&lt;/em&gt;, a wandering swordsman fighting to protect the honor of those in need. &lt;p&gt;A hundred and fifty years ago in Kyoto, amid the flames of revolution, there arose a warrior, an assassin of such ferocious power he was given the title &lt;em&gt;Hitokiri&lt;/em&gt;: Manslayer. With his bloodstained blade, Hitokiri Battosai helped close the turbulent Bakumatsu period and end the reign of the shoguns, slashing open the way toward the progressive Meiji Era.  Then he vanished, and with the flow of years became legend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 11th year of Meiji, in the middle of Tokyo, the tale begins. Himura Kenshin, a humble &lt;em&gt;rurouni&lt;/em&gt;, or wandering swordsman, comes to the aid of Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman struggling to defend her father's school of swordsmanship against attacks by the infamous Hitokiri Battosai. But neither Kenshin nor Battosai are quite what they seem...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Set against the backdrop of the Meiji Restoration, it tells the saga of Himura Kenshin, once an assassin of ferocious power, now a humble &lt;em&gt;rurouni&lt;/em&gt;, a wandering swordsman fighting to protect the honor of those in need.&amp;amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hundred and fifty years ago in Kyoto, amid the flames of revolution, there arose a warrior, an assassin of such ferocious power he was given the title &lt;em&gt;Hitokiri&lt;/em&gt;: Manslayer. With his bloodstained blade, Hitokiri Battosai helped close the turbulent Bakumatsu period and end the reign of the shoguns, slashing open the way toward the progressive Meiji Era.&amp;amp;nbsp; Then he vanished, and with the flow of years became legend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the 11th year of Meiji, in the middle of Tokyo, the tale begins. Himura Kenshin, a humble &lt;em&gt;rurouni&lt;/em&gt;, or wandering swordsman, comes to the aid of Kamiya Kaoru, a young woman struggling to defend her father's school of swordsmanship against attacks by the infamous Hitokiri Battosai.

  <description>After a night of gambling, Kenshin and Sanosuke return with an unexpected prize - a woman. Beautiful and mysterious, Takani Megumi, the daughter of a famous family of physicians, has unwittingly been participating in the production of a super-powerful, super-profitable form of opium. Hot on her trail is shady industrialist Kanryu, and Sanosuke may not be her best protector after the death of one of his friends from an opium overdose. But Kenshin has looked into her eyes and seen her sadness. He knows he must act - but will he be able to save her from the wrath of Kanryu, or for that matter, from Sanosuke?</description>

  <description>Jael Thompson has never really fit in. She’s changed schools too many times to count. The only family she’s ever known is her father, a bitter ex-priest who never lets her date and insists she attend the strictest Catholic school in Seattle. And her mother—well, she was a five thousand year old demon. That doesn’t exactly help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on her sixteenth birthday, her father gives her a present that brings about some unexpected changes. Some of the changes, like strange and wonderful powers and the cute skater boy with a knack for science, are awesome. But others, like the homicidal demon seeking revenge on her family? Not so much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Steeped in mythology, this is an epic tale of a heroine who balances old world with new, science with magic, and the terrifying depths of the underworld with the ordinary halls of high school.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;strong&gt;The Dragon Scroll&lt;/strong&gt; comes an ingenious new novel of murder and malfeasance in ancient Japan, featuring the detective Sugawara Akitada. The son of reduced nobility forced to toil in the Ministry of Justice, Akitada is relieved when an old friend, Professor Hirata, asks him to investigate a friend’s blackmail. Taking a post at the Imperial University, he is soon sidetracked from his primary case by the murder of a young girl and the mysterious disappearance of an old man—a disappearance that the Emperor himself declares a miracle. &lt;strong&gt;Rashomon Gate&lt;/strong&gt; is a mystery of magnificent complexity and historical detail that will leave readers yearning for more.</description>

  <description>In an adventure filled with highway bandits, unscrupulous politicians, and renegade monks, &lt;strong&gt;The Dragon Scroll&lt;/strong&gt; introduces readers to the lively world of eleventh-century Japan and an irrepressible hero—Sugawara Akitada. On his first official assignment, Akitada—an impoverished nobleman and earnest young government clerk in the Ministry of Justice—is sent from the capital city on a nearly impossible mission to the distant province of Kazusa to discover why tax convoys are disappearing. In the politically murky world of the Japanese court, he has been set up to fail. Against the odds, the ever-resourceful Akitada, his elderly servant Seimei, and his impudent bodyguard Tora are determined to fulfill their mission and discover the truth in a town of dangerous secrets.</description>

  <description>Jack Lester has to find a bride...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But where can he find the perfect woman? She has to be attractive, kind, a good conversationalist...and most important, she has to accept him as he is: devilishly handsome, charming and, as far as anyone knows, poor as a church mouse! If London society discovers his hidden wealth, he'll never find the right wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack's heart races when he first lays eyes on Sophie Winterton. She is everything he desires--and more--but he is caught in his own trap. Believing that Jack needs to marry into wealth, Sophie rejects all his advances, certain he would never marry a poor girl like her. As they play out a game of cat and mouse, can Jack convince her that she is the woman he wants--and that he is the husband she deserves?</description>

  <description>All of Regency London knows that no Cynster male would ever walk away from a lady in distress...but their protection can come at a tantalizingly high price. And now, Stephanie Laurens has created her boldest Cynster yet--Gabriel--a man who has known the pleasure of many women, but who has given his heart to no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was desperate for his help...When a mysterious lady, her face hidden by a black veil, begs Gabriel Cynster for his help, he cannot refuse her plea. For despite her disguise, Gabriel finds the woman alluring and he is powerless to deny her. But he exacts payment as only a Cynster would demand: with each piece of information he uncovers, she must pay him--in the form of a kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was powerless to resist...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Alathea Morwellan knows Gabriel is intrigued, but despite the sparks that fly between them, they have never passed a civil moment together. Yet as the stakes get higher, so does Gabriel's desire for payment. And with each overpowering kiss, each passionate embrace, Alathea knows that she will not be able to resist his ultimate seduction...but what will happen when she reveals the truth?</description>

  <description>How can an honourable lady like Lady Catriona Hennessy unite with a rake like Richard Cynster? Though charmed by his commanding presence, she cannot give up her independence. Marriage had not previously been on Richard′s agenda, but perhaps taming the lady was just the challenge he needs - if he can have the rights of the marriage bed without making any revealing promises of love?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;There are some things you can’t leave behind…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;A broken-down camper hidden deep in a national forest is the only home fifteen year-old Carey can remember. The trees keep guard over her threadbare existence, with the one bright spot being Carey’s younger sister, Jenessa, who depends on Carey for her very survival. All they have is each other, as their mentally ill mother comes and goes with greater frequency. Until that one fateful day their mother disappears for good, and two strangers arrive. Suddenly, the girls are taken from the woods and thrust into a bright and perplexing new world of high school, clothes and boys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Carey must face the truth of why her mother abducted her ten years ago, while haunted by a past that won’t let her go… a dark past that hides many a secret, including the reason Jenessa hasn’t spoken a word in over a year. Carey knows she must keep her sister close, and her secrets even closer, or risk watching her new life come crashing down.</description>

      <![CDATA[This is a pretty heartbreaking story, and I found it a difficult read. There's no other way for me to say this without sounding like a horrible parson lacking empathy, but it was frustrating for me to read this book from Carey's point of view, because her world view is so warped from all the abus...]]>

  <description>On the morning of her sixteenth birthday, Renée Winters was still an ordinary girl. She spent her summers at the beach, had the perfect best friend, and had just started dating the cutest guy at school. No one she'd ever known had died. But all that changes when she finds her parents dead in the Redwood Forest, in what appears to be a strange double murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the funeral Renée’s wealthy grandfather sends her to Gottfried Academy, a remote and mysterious boarding school in Maine, where she finds herself studying subjects like Philosophy, Latin, and the “Crude Sciences.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s there that she meets Dante Berlin, a handsome and elusive boy to whom she feels inexplicably drawn. As they grow closer, unexplainable things begin to happen, but Renée can’t stop herself from falling in love. It’s only when she discovers a dark tragedy in Gottfried’s past that she begins to wonder if the Academy is everything it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little does she know, Dante is the one hiding a dangerous secret, one that has him fearing for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Beautiful&lt;/em&gt; is both a compelling romance and thought-provoking read, bringing shocking new meaning to life, death, love, and the nature of the soul.</description>

  <description>A haunted castle, a handsome young man dead for four hundred years, one heck of a scary portrait of a witch, and a treasure hunt -- not to mention a princess for a roommate! -- all await 15 year old American girl Caitlyn Monahan when she earns a scholarship to a French boarding school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are secrets behind the stone walls of Chateau de la Fortune, buried for centuries along with the mystery of who killed Raphael, the charming ghost who visits Caitlyn at night.  But as Caitlyn unearths the history of the castle, nothing scares her as badly as the secret she learns about herself, and the reason she was chosen to come to the Fortune School.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And nothing breaks her heart as badly as falling in love with a dead guy.</description>

  <description>High in their mountain covens, red witches pray to the Goddess, protecting the Witchlands by throwing the bones and foretelling the future. &lt;p&gt;It’s all a fake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, that’s what Ryder thinks. He doubts the witches really deserve their tithes—one quarter of all the crops his village can produce. And even if they can predict the future, what danger is there to foretell, now that his people’s old enemy, the Baen, has been defeated? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a terrifying new magic threatens both his village and the coven, Ryder must confront the beautiful and silent witch who holds all the secrets. Everything he’s ever believed about witches, the Baen, magic and about himself will change, when he discovers that the prophecies he’s always scorned— &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are about him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The day the rains came was like any other, blistering air coating the canyon in a heavy stillness....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as the rains come after ten long, dry years, a young wizard, Wayland North, appears, to whisk Sydelle Mirabil away from her desert village. North needs an assistant, and Sydelle is eager to see the country - and to join him on his quest to stop the war that surely will destroy her home. But North has secrets - about himself, about why he chose Sydelle, about his real reasons for the journey. What does he want from her? And why does North's sworn enemy seem fascinated by Sydelle himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through a journey that spans a country, magic and hard-won romance are woven together with precision and brilliant design by a first-time novelist.</description>

And the vampires won.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humans huddle in their walled cities, supplying blood in exchange for safety. But not even that is guaranteed. Dawn has lost her entire family and now reluctantly serves as the delegate to Lord Valentine, the most powerful vampire for miles. It isn’t until she meets Victor, Valentine’s son, that she realizes not all vampires are monsters....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkness Before Dawn&lt;/em&gt; is a fresh new story with captivating characters, unexpected plot twists, a fascinating setting, and a compelling voice. Written under the name J. A. London by a talented mother-son team, the trilogy is perfect for fans of True Blood and the House of Night and Morganville Vampires series.</description>

      <![CDATA[It's rather unfair, really. Any post-apocalyptic vampire fiction I read these days pales next to Julie Kagawa's series. Dawn (get it??!! Sunlight! Vampires! Ok, I'm done) is a likeable character. She has had to grow up pretty quickly, becoming the delegation to the city's vampire leader, Lord Val...]]>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;A shout comes echoing up the stairway "Fetch the whipping boy!" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A young orphan named Jemmy rouses from his sleep. "Ain't I already been whipped twice today? Gaw! What's the prince done now? It was forbidden to spank, thrash, or whack the heir to the throne. Jemmy had been plucked from the streets to serve as whipping boy to the arrogant and spiteful Prince Brat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of running away, Jemmy finds himself trapped in Prince Brat's own dream—at once brash and perilous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this briskly told tale of high adventure, taut with suspense and rich with colorful characters, the whipping boy and Prince Brat must at last confront each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning author Sid Fleischman again blends the broadly comic with the deeply compassionate in this memorable novel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the city of Imardin, where those who wield magic wield power, a young street-girl, adopted by the Magician's Guild, finds herself at the centre of a terrible plot that may destroy the entire world . . . Sonea has learned much at the magicians' guild and the other novices now treat her with a grudging respect. But she cannot forget what she witnessed in the High Lord's underground room - or his warning that the realm's ancient enemy is growing in power once more. As Sonea learns more, she begins to doubt her guildmaster's word. Could the truth really be as terrifying as Akkarin claims, or is he trying to trick her into assisting in some unspeakably dark scheme?</description>

  <description>In a way, Candace Bushnell's &lt;em&gt;Lipstick Jungle&lt;/em&gt; picks up where her career-defining book &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; left off, in the money-soaked, power-hungry, beauty-obsessed jungle that is New York City. This time around, the ladies are a bit older, a lot richer, but not particularly wiser nor more endearing than Bushnell's earlier heroines. &lt;p&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Lipstick Jungle&lt;/em&gt; weaves the stories of Nico O'Neilly, Wendy Healy, and Victory Ford, numbers 8, 12, and 17 on &lt;em&gt;The New York Post&lt;/em&gt;'s list of "New York's 50 Most Powerful Women." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this is 21st Century New York, and to get ahead and stay ahead, these women will do anything, including jeopardizing their personal and professional relationships. Take for example Nico, editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;Bonfire&lt;/em&gt; magazine, who betrays her boss to rise to the top of the entire magazine division at media mega-giant Splatch-Verner. As president of Paradour Pictures, Wendy may be poised to win an Oscar for her 10-year labor-of-love, &lt;em&gt;Ragged Pilgrims&lt;/em&gt;, but her marriage is in shambles and her children care more about a $50,000 pony than their mother. And for single, 43-year-old fashion designer Victory, pleasing tough critics may be more important than ever finding the real relationship she's convinced herself she doesn't need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This racy tale of women behaving badly manages to shrewdly flip the tables to show us how gender roles are essentially interchangeable, given the right circumstances. Whether that was Bushnell's intent when crafting this wicked tale is another story. &lt;em&gt;--Gisele Toueg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Were Victory, Wendy, and Nico inspired by any real-life women?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; The characters and situations in &lt;em&gt;Lipstick Jungle&lt;/em&gt; were inspired by the real-life women I know and admire in New York City. As with &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;, I spent a lot of time thinking about where women were today, and what I noticed was that there was a fascinating group of women in their forties who were leading non-traditional lives. They were highly successful and motivated, they often had children, and usually were the providers for their families, and yet, they didn't fit the old stereotype of the witchy businesswoman. Indeed, so many of these women were the girls next door, the girls who reminded me of my best friends when I was a kid and we used to fantasize about the great things we were going to do in life. Like the women in &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Lipstick Jungle&lt;/em&gt; women are charting new lives for themselves, redefining what it means to be a woman when you really are as powerful, or more powerful, than a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Of course, you probably want specifics, so I will say that there was a moment when it all clicked. Tina Brown used to write a terrific column in the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, and one of the things she was always mentioning was how there was a group of powerful women who were meeting and lunching at Michael's restaurant. They'd been working for over twenty years, their children were now in their early teens and didn't need them every minute, and now, in their forties or early fifties, they had time to strive for new career goals and to spend more time with their girlfriends. I thought, "Aha--that's the Lipstick Jungle." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What kind of research did you do to cover fashion, film, and publishing in one book?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; To research fashion, film and publishing, I did what I always do--I talked to my girlfriends! Of course, it helps that I've worked in magazine publishing and have had my share of experience with Hollywood. I'm also lucky enough to have a couple of girlfriends who are top designers, who offered to help me out with the specific details. I still remember the afternoon when one of my girlfriends and I sat down to talk--she was over eight months pregnant, and I was worried that we were going to have to run to the hospital! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon.com's Significant Seven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candace Bushnell graciously agreed to answer the questions we like to ask every author: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What book has had the most significant impact on your life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; So many books have affected my life it's hard to pick just one. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with Kurt Vonnegut, and Evelyn Waugh; when I was in my early thirties, a girlfriend and I re-read &lt;em&gt;House of Mirth&lt;/em&gt;, and freaked out--we didn't want to end up like Lily Bart. Most recently I read &lt;em&gt;Angela's Ashes&lt;/em&gt; for the first time and was absolutely stunned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; You are stranded on a desert island with only one book, one CD, and one DVD--what are they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Make Way for Lucia&lt;/em&gt;, by E.F. Benson, a book that I always hope will never end; Van Morrison's greatest hits; and &lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;, the six-part mini-series..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the worst lie you've ever told?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; "My e-mail isn't working." I'm not a good liar. It's one of my flaws. I'm too forthright and usually have to apologize the next day for telling the truth the night before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Describe the perfect writing environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; All I need is a desk, a chair and my computer. Once I start writing, I don't notice my environment. In fact, I've had people try to talk to me when I'm writing and I literally can't hear them. I see their mouths moving but no sound comes out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; If you could write your own epitaph, what would it say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; "I don't ever want to be asked about my own epitaph!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is the one person living or dead that you would like to have dinner with?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Tolstoy. I've read that he loved gossip. It would be great to have a good old gossip with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; If you could have one superpower, what would it be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Flying, of course. Who wouldn't want to be unfettered by gravity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  <description>What happens when your Prince Charming turns out not to be so charming after all? In &lt;em&gt;To Have and To Hold&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Jane Green offers a sizzling, highly entertaining look at romantic relationships after we say “I do.” &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice knows she should be happy. A charming twenty-eight-year-old with a successful catering business, she’s always dreamed of a rose-covered cottage in the English countryside, filled with children and animals and home-cooked meals. Her favorite attire is comfy jeans, her best manicure features garden dirt under the nails. But when her teenage crush—the wealthy, dashing man-about-town Joe Chambers—wants to make her his bride, Alice is more than willing to play Cinderella to Joe’s prince. Never mind that he wants her to change—a diet, ice-blond highlights, stilettos, snooty gallery openings—and that he’s allergic to nature and kids. She tells herself she’s happy to sacrifice for love, and besides, with Joe’s stunning good looks and high-profile career at a top financial firm, every woman in London wants to be in her shoes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that’s just the problem. Despite Alice’s efforts to be the perfect wife, Joe soon reveals a penchant for being hopelessly unfaithful. When a notorious indiscretion with a female colleague forces Joe to transfer to New York, Alice’s life turns upside down. As Joe continues to sneak around, and her best friend’s beau offers a tempting glimpse of what real love could be like, Alice must decide how much Cinderella she can take before her deepest desires win out—and if she can summon up the courage to find real happiness on her own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delicious, witty, and packed with sparkling sex appeal, &lt;em&gt;To Have and To Hold&lt;/em&gt; is an unputdownable read that will have you rooting out loud for its endearing heroine. A #1 bestseller in Britain, this latest tale from the beloved, utterly winning Jane Green proves that the search for true love doesn’t always end when someone dons a veil, and offers a lively, refreshing take on modern marriage.</description>

  <description>When Ellie Black meets Dan Cooper, she feels as though she's found her best friend and soul mate. After an idyllic courtship, Dan proposes and Ellie happily accepts. She loves everything about Dan, even his family: his sister, Emma, has become her good friend, and his mother, Linda, might end up being the mother Ellie never had when she was growing up. Ellie's own family was far from ideal--her alcoholic mother died when she was 13, and Ellie and her father withdrew from each other almost completely. She hopes Dan's family will become her own, that is, until she gets to know Linda and realizes how controlling and manipulative she can be. Ellie's resentment toward Linda grows after she gets pregnant and gives birth to Tom. When an accident puts Tom's life at risk, Ellie's bottled-up emotions spill over and threaten not just her relationship with her mother-in-law but her marriage itself. Green, best-selling author of Jemima J (2000) and To Have and to Hold[BKL Mr 1 04], is particularly adept at producing engaging women's fiction, and her latest is a prime example--warm, convincing, and eminently readable. Although at times Ellie's venomous anger toward her mother-in-law grates, overall, she is a sympathetic heroine.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The perfect title for the perfect beach read from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane Green is one of the preeminent authors of women�s fiction today, and with each new novel, her audience grows. Green�s avid and loyal fans follow her because she writes about the true-to-life dilemmas of women�and &lt;em&gt;The Beach House&lt;/em&gt; will not disappoint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Known in Nantucket as the crazy woman who lives in the rambling house atop the bluff, Nan doesn�t care what people think. At sixty-five-years old, her husband died twenty years ago, her beauty has faded, and her family has flown. If her neighbors are away, why shouldn�t she skinny dip in their swimming pools and help herself to their flowers? But when she discovers the money she thought would last forever is dwindling and she could lose her beloved house, Nan knows she has to make drastic changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So Nan takes out an ad: &lt;em&gt;Rooms to rent for the summer in a beautiful old Nantucket home with water views and direct access to the beach&lt;/em&gt;. Slowly, people start moving into the house, filling it with noise, with laughter, and with tears. As the house comes alive again, Nan finds her family expanding. Her son comes home for the summer, and then an unexpected visitor turns all their lives upside-down.</description>

  <description>To Libby Mason, Mr. Right has always meant Mr. Rich. A twenty seven-year-old publicist, she's barely able to afford her fashionable and fabulous lifestyle and often has to foot the bill for dates with Struggling Writer Nick, a sexy but perpetually strapped-for-cash guy she's dating (no commitments – really). So when Ed, Britain's wealthiest but stodgiest bachelor, enters the picture, her idea of the fairy tale romance is turned on it's head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Maybe is the tale of her heartfelt but hilarious deliberation, irresistibly chronicled by bestselling author Jane Green. On one hand, Nick makes up for his low bank-account balance by his performance in the sack, or in the bathtub, as the case may be. But life with him means little more than nightly trips to the bar, a dark and grungy apartment, and plenty of dull political tirades to boot. But those blue eyes, and that tender heart...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, there's Ed, whose luxurious house and gargantuan bank account are quite tempting to the starving Libby. But his unsavory mustache and bumbling ways make Libby wonder if the platinum AMEX and unlimited "retail therapy" are worth it. He may have fallen in love with her at first sight, but nothing seems to solve his lackluster performance in the sack – even speed reading The Joy of Sex. When the diamond shopping commences, Libby is forced to realize that the time for "maybe" is up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking romantic comedy to a hip, sparkling new level, Mr. Maybe is a classic tale of what happens to one girl when her heart and her head aren't looking for the same thing. With a laugh and minute and a heroine whose struggles in the dating jungle will remind you of your own, Mr. Maybe is a story that all will leave you smitten.</description>

Return with her to that elemental universe in this tale of secrecy, romance, and a battle for power..." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josetta is a princess of one of the Five Families. But she is far from the throne, so she is free to spend her days working in the poorest sections of the city. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rafe Adova, an outcast since he was born, lives the life of a career gambler in those slums. He has no ambition other than cheating at the card tables—until the night he decides to help a girl named Corene, who looks like she's stumbled into the wrong bar. She, too, is a princess—sister to Josetta, who finds her with Rafe. He fascinates her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josetta has never encountered anyone like him—someone seemingly devoid of elemental blessings. He is drawn to her, though he thinks they are unlikely to ever meet again—but their connection grows strong when she nurses him back to health after he is assaulted by foreign mercenaries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when they learn the reason he's being hunted, they know that the truth about his history could endanger not only their love but also their very lives...</description>

No, it was not terrible by any means, but considering the previous book in the series was spectacularly good, and one of my favorite YA high fantasies, this book, was a grievous dissappointment. <strong>It is the equivalent of watching <em>Green Lantern</em> after having...</strong>]]>

  <description>With language that is both lyrical and distinctly her own, Francesca Lia Block turns nine fairy tales inside out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Escaping the poisoned apple, Snow frees herself from possession to find the truth of love in an unexpected place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A club girl from L.A., awakening from a long sleep to the memories of her past, finally finds release from its curse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Beauty learns that Beasts can understand more than men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within these singular, timeless landscapes, the brutal and the magical collide, and the heroine triumphs because of the strength she finds in a pen, a paintbrush, a lover, a friend, a mother, and finally, in herself.</description>

  <description>Bleak House is a novel by Charles Dickens, published in 20 monthly installments between March 1852 and September 1853. It is held to be one of Dickens's finest novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the novel's core is long-running litigation in England's Court of Chancery, Jarndyce v Jarndyce, which has far-reaching consequences for all involved. The litigation, which already has taken many years and consumed between £60,000 and £70,000 in court costs, is emblematic of the failure of Chancery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Chancery lawyers and judges criticised Dickens's portrait of Chancery as exaggerated and unmerited, his novel helped to spur an ongoing movement that culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About this edition: This scarce antiquarian book is included in our special Legacy Reprint Series.

  <description>In what may be Dickens's best novel, humble, orphaned Pip is apprenticed to the dirty work of the forge but dares to dream of becoming a gentleman — and one day, under sudden and enigmatic circumstances, he finds himself in possession of "great expectations." In this gripping tale of crime and guilt, revenge and reward, the compelling characters include Magwitch, the fearful and fearsome convict; Estella, whose beauty is excelled only by her haughtiness; and the embittered Miss Havisham, an eccentric jilted bride.</description>

  <description>Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine.  Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy.  The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret.  When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate.  All the tension of the novel revolves around one question:  Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square.  Readers of &lt;em&gt;Persuasion&lt;/em&gt; will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work.</description>

  <description>The year is 1771, and war is coming. Jamie Fraser’s wife tells him so. Little as he wishes to, he must believe it, for hers is a gift of dreadful prophecy—a time-traveler’s certain knowledge. Claire’s unique view of the future has brought him both danger and deliverance in the past; her knowledge of the oncoming revolution is a flickering torch that may light his way through the perilous years ahead—or ignite a conflagration that will leave their lives in ashes.</description>

  <description>An old-fashioned London Hotel is not quite as reputable as it makes out! When Miss Marple comes up from the country for a holiday in London, she finds what she's looking for at Bertram's Hotel: traditional decor, impeccable service and an unmistakable atmosphere of danger behind the highly polished veneer. Yet, not even Miss Marple can foresee the violent chain of events set in motion when an eccentric guest makes his way to the airport on the wrong day!</description>

  <description>When Dana is invited to Faerie to be officially presented at the Seelie Court, it’s no easy decision. After all, everyone knows Titania, the Seelie Queen, wants her dead. But Titania claims not to be the one behind the death threats; and her son, Prince Henry, makes the decision a whole lot easier when he suggests Dana might be arrested for (supposedly) conspiring with her aunt Grace to usurp the Seelie throne. So she and her father better do as they're told . . . &lt;p&gt;The journey through Faerie is long—and treacherous. Dana &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; it would be a good idea to have friends along, but her sort-of-boyfriend, Ethan, and her bodyguard’s son, Keane, just can’t seem to get along, and Kimber’s crush on Keane isn’t making things any easier. When a violent attack separates Dana from their caravan, the sexy Erlking saves her just in the nick of time . . . and makes it clear that he hasn’t given up on making her his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Titania’s beautiful palace should be a relief. But Dana is soon implicated in an assassination attempt against Titania’s granddaughter, and is suddenly a fugitive, forced to leave her father behind as she and her friends flee for their lives. Will she be able to prove her innocence before the forces of the Seelie Court—or, worse, the Erlking—catch up with her? And will she save her father before he pays the ultimate price in her stead? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I think this book has been the best out of the Faeriewalker series. But considering I gave it 3 stars, that doesn't exactly speak well of the books, now, does it? This series has been one of the rare ones in which I've found the good guys (male and female alike) to be largely whiny, adolescent, a...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Who is the real McLean? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Since her parents' bitter divorce, McLean and her dad, a restaurant consultant, have been on the move-four towns in two years. Estranged from her mother and her mother's new family, McLean has followed her dad in leaving the unhappy past behind. And each new place gives her a chance to try out a new persona: from cheerleader to drama diva. But now, for the first time, McLean discovers a desire to stay in one place and just be herself, whoever that is. Perhaps Dave, the guy next door, can help her find out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Combining Sarah Dessen's trademark graceful writing, great characters, and compelling storytelling, &lt;em&gt;What Happened to Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; is irresistible reading.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A long, hot summer...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's what Macy has to look forward to while her boyfriend, Jason, is away at Brain Camp. Days will be spent at a boring job in the library, evenings will be filled with vocabulary drills for the SATs, and spare time will be passed with her mother, the two of them sharing a silent grief at the traumatic loss of Macy's father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But sometimes unexpected things can happen—things such as the catering job at Wish, with its fun-loving, chaotic crew. Or her sister's project of renovating the neglected beach house, awakening long-buried memories. Things such as meeting Wes, a boy with a past, a taste for Truth-telling, and an amazing artistic talent, the kind of boy who could turn any girl's world upside down. As Macy ventures out of her shell, she begins to wonder, Is it really better to be safe than sorry?</description>

  <description>Three years have passed since the magician Nathaniel helped prevent a cataclysmic attack on London. Now an established member of the British Government, he faces unprecedented problems: foreign wars are going badly; Britain's enemies are mounting attacks close to London; and rebellion is fomentingamong the commoners. Increasingly imperious and distracted, Nathaniel is treating Bartimaeus worse than ever. The longsuffering djinni is growing weak and vulnerable from too much time in this world and is nearing the end of his patience.    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Nathaniel's longtime rival Kitty has been stealthily completing her research on magic, demons, and Bartimaeus's past. She has a daring plan that she hopes will break the endless cycle of conflict between djinn and humans. But will anyone listen to what she has to say?    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this glorious conclusion to the Bartimaeus trilogy, the destinies of Bartimaeus, Nathaniel, and Kitty converge once more. Together the threesome faces treacherous magicians, a complex conspiracy, and a rebellious faction of demons. To survive, they must test the limits of this world and question the deepest parts of themselves. And most difficult of all-they will have to learn to trust one another.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Stroud is the author of the New York Times bestselling Bartimaeus Trilogy; The Last Siege; The Leap; and Buried Fire. He lives in England with his family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>It is 950 B.C.E., and King Solomon rules Jerusalem with a steely hand; a hand on which gleams a magic ring of immense and unforgiving power. Solomon has just begun work on his marvelous temple, charging Khaba, a formidable magician in his royal court, to oversee its construction. The workforce is an ill-behaved bunch of demons, a particularly unruly djinni named Bartimaeus among them. True to form, Bartimaeus promptly gets kicked off the temple project and assigned the even more miserable task of hunting bandits in the desert. There he crosses paths with Asmira, a highly skilled and loyal captain of the Queen of Sheba’s guard, on a suicidal mission to save her country from Solomon’s imminent attack. Of course, Bartimaeus has no intention of helping her. That is, until Asmira makes him an offer he cannot refuse. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spellbinding addition to Jonathan Stroud’s &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Bartimaeus audiobooks, &lt;em&gt;The Ring of Solomon&lt;/em&gt; brims with dazzling wit, unforgettable characters, and powerful themes of freedom and slavery, with or without magical bonds.</description>

  <description>Miss Lydia Charingford is always cheerful, and never more so than at Christmas time. But no matter how hard she smiles, she can't forget the youthful mistake that could have ruined her reputation. Even though the worst of her indiscretion was kept secret, one other person knows the truth of those dark days: the sarcastic Doctor Jonas Grantham. She wants nothing to do with him...or the butterflies that take flight in her stomach every time he looks her way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonas Grantham has a secret, too: He's been in love with Lydia for more than a year. This winter, he's determined to conquer her dislike and win her for his own. It all starts with a wager and a kiss...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Kiss for Midwinter is a novella (38,000 words) in the Brothers Sinister series. It follows The Duchess War. Each book stands on its own, but those who prefer to read in order might want to read that book first.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Introducing an exciting new series! Steeped in Victorian atmosphere and intrigue, this diverting mystery trails a feisty heroine as she takes on a precarious secret assignment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rescued from the gallows in 1850s London, young orphan (and thief) Mary Quinn is surprised to be offered a singular education, instruction in fine manners — and an unusual vocation. Miss Scrimshaw’s Academy for Girls is a cover for an all-female investigative unit called The Agency, and at seventeen, Mary is about to put her training to the test. Assuming the guise of a lady’s companion, she must infiltrate a rich merchant’s home in hopes of tracing his missing cargo ships. But the household is full of dangerous deceptions, and there is no one to trust — or is there? Packed with action and suspense, banter and romance, and evoking the gritty backstreets of Victorian London, this breezy mystery debuts a daring young detective who lives by her wits while uncovering secrets — including those of her own past.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;For a moment, a face flashed before my eyes—the most hideous face I’d ever seen.  No matter how hard I tried to forget what had happened, I saw him everywhere I went. It was Loki—the evil god that I’d helped set free against my will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should have known that my first official date with Logan Quinn was destined to end in disaster. If we’d gotten into a swordfight, or been ambushed by Reapers, I’d have been more prepared. But getting arrested mid-sip at the local coffee hangout? I didn’t see that one coming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been accused of purposely helping the Reapers free Loki from his prison—and the person leading the charge against me is Linus Quinn, Logan’s dad. The worst part is that pretty much everyone at Mythos Academy thinks I’m guilty. If I’m going to get out of this mess alive, I’ll have to do it myself…</description>

  <description>The "Sarah Midnight Triology" continues... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Midnight is no ordinary teenager. She is a demon hunter, caught up in one of the deadliest wars unknown to man. Orphaned at the age of sixteen, Sarah learned the family trade of hunting without her parents to guide her but under the watchful eye of her 'cousin', who was revealed to be Sean Hannay, no relative at all, but a dear friend of the real Harry Midnight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in the exciting sequel to "Dreams", the fight continues. Sarah and Sean may have defeated the Scottish Valaya, but the rest of the war still rages on, and Sarah, Sean, Nicholas and their companions must unearth the identity and location of the Enemy - the leader of the demons - before the world plunges into the Time of Demons once more. Their quest leads them to Sarah's family home, the Midnight mansion in Islay, and there they discover horrible truths about the demon ruler, his plans, and Sarah's own personal history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, Sarah must battle not only the demons but her hurt toward Sean and her feelings for the enigmatic Nicholas, who has plans of his own.</description>

      <![CDATA[I never really liked Shakespeare. Besides the fact that I've got no appreciation for the finer aspects of 16th-century English, and that most of his plays are frankly, dull as dirt, I desperately hated the use of dramatic irony.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A love like no other...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Abbey's best friend, Kristen, vanishes at the bridge near Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, everyone else is all too quick to accept that Kristen is dead...and rumors fly that her death was no accident. Abbey goes through the motions of mourning her best friend, but privately, she refuses to believe that Kristen is really gone. Then she meets Caspian, the gorgeous and mysterious boy who shows up out of nowhere at Kristen's funeral and keeps reappearing in Abbey's life. Caspian clearly has secrets of his own, but he's the only person who makes Abbey feel normal again...but also special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Abbey starts to feel that she might survive all this, she learns a secret that makes her question everything she thought she knew about her best friend. How could Kristen have kept silent about so much? And could this secret have led to her death? As Abbey struggles to understand Kristen's betrayal, she uncovers a frightening truth that nearly unravels her - one that will challenge her emerging love for Caspian, as well as her own sanity.</description>

  <description>Violet thought she’d made peace with her unique ability to sense the echoes of the dead and the imprints that cling to their killers…that is until she acquired an imprint of her own. Forced to carry a reminder of the horrible events of her kidnapping, Violet is more determined than ever to lead a normal life. However, the people who run the special investigative team Violet works for have no intention of letting her go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When someone close to Violet becomes a suspect in a horrific murder, she finds herself pulled into a deadly hunt for a madman with an army of devoted followers. Violet has survived dangerous situations before, but she quickly discovers that protecting those closest to her is far more difficult than protecting herself.</description>

      <![CDATA[The books in this series have been pretty formulaic. Each contains Violet's struggles with her power, with a main murder mystery plot; they've been good, but after awhile they do get generic. That hasn't stopped me from reading them, however.<br /><br />The murder subplot has been the weakest part in all of...]]>

  <description>Ben Holiday, mere mortal turned monarch of the magic kingdom of Landover, has grappled with numerous contenders for his throne, but nothing could have prepared him for the most daunting of challengers: his headstrong teenage daughter, Mistaya. After getting suspended from an exclusive private school in our world, Mistaya is determined to resume her real education—learning sorcery from court wizard Questor Thews—whether her parents like it or not. Then, horrified that a repulsive Landover nobleman seeks to marry her, Mistaya decides that the only way to run her own life is to run away from home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So begins an eventful odyssey peppered with a formidable dragon, recalcitrant Gnomes, an inscrutable magic cat, a handsome librarian, a sinister sorcerer, and more than a few narrow escapes as fate draws Landover’s intrepid princess into the thick of a mystery that will put her mettle to the test—and possibly bring the kingdom to its knees.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She stood at danger's threshold—then love beckoned her in.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the shelter of her country cottage, Sara Feilding puts pen to paper to create dreams. But curiosity has enticed the prim, well-bred gentlewoman out of her safe haven—and into Derek Craven's dangerous world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A handsome, tough and tenacious Cockney, he rose from poverty to become lord of London's most exclusive gambling house—a struggle that has left Derek Craven fabulously wealthy, but hardened and suspicious. And now duty demands he allow Sara Fielding into his world—with her impeccable manners and her infuriating innocence. But here, in a perilous shadow-realm of ever-shifting fortunes, even a proper "mouse" can be transformed into a breathtaking enchantress—and a world-weary gambler can be shaken to his cynical core by the power of passion...and the promise of love.</description>

Bald steckt Wendy mitten in einer gefährlichen Intrige – um den Thron und um ihr Herz...</description>

  <description>Set in the harsh Puritan community of seventeenth-century Boston, this tale of an adulterous entanglement that results in an illegitimate birth reveals Nathaniel Hawthorne's concerns with the tension between the public and the private selves. Publicly disgraced and ostracized, Hester Prynne draws on her inner strength and certainty of spirit to emerge as the first true heroine of American fiction. Arthur Dimmesdale, trapped by the rules of society, stands as a classic study of a self divided.</description>

  <description>AS TEMPESTUOUS AS THE TUDOR MONARCHS THEMSELVES, THE SECRETS OF THE TUDOR COURT SERIES HAS BEEN CALLED "RIVETING" ("BOOKLIST") AND "WELL DRAWN" ("PUBLISHERS WEEKLY").&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charming. Desirable. Forbidden. Brought to court with other eligible young noblewomen by the decree of King Henry VIII, lovely Elizabeth "Bess" Brooke realizes for the first time that beauty can be hazardous. Although Bess has no desire to wed the aging king, she and her family would have little choice if Henry's eye were to fall on her. And other dangers exist as well, for Bess has caught the interest of dashing courtier Will Parr. Bess finds Will's kisses as sweet as honey, but marriage between them may be impossible. Will is a divorced man, and remarriage is still prohibited. Bess and Will must hope that the king can be persuaded to issue a royal decree allowing Will to marry again . . . but to achieve their goal, the lovers will need royal favor. Amid the swirling alliances of royalty and nobles, Bess and Will perform a dangerous dance of palace intrigue and pulse-pounding passions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brought to glowing life by the talented Kate Emerson, and seen through the eyes of a beautiful young noblewoman, "By Royal Decree "illuminates the lives of beautiful young courtiers in and out of the rich and compelling drama of the Tudor court.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Bluebeard fairy tale retold. . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When seventeen-year-old Sophia Petheram’s beloved father dies, she receives an unexpected letter. An invitation—on fine ivory paper, in bold black handwriting—from the mysterious Monsieur Bernard de Cressac, her godfather. With no money and fewer options, Sophie accepts, leaving her humble childhood home for the astonishingly lavish Wyndriven Abbey, in the heart of Mississippi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie has always longed for a comfortable life, and she finds herself both attracted to and shocked by the charm and easy manners of her overgenerous guardian. But as she begins to piece together the mystery of his past, it’s as if, thread by thread, a silken net is tightening around her. And as she gathers stories and catches whispers of his former wives—all with hair as red as her own—in the forgotten corners of the abbey, Sophie knows she’s trapped in the passion and danger of de Cressac’s intoxicating world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Glowing strands of romance, mystery, and suspense are woven into this breathtaking debut—a thrilling retelling of the “Bluebeard” fairy tale.</description>

  <description>It's been thirty days, two hours, and seventeen minutes since Calder left Lily standing on the shores of Lake Superior. Not that she's counting. And when Calder does return, it's not quite the reunion Lily hoped for. Especially after she lets her father in on a huge secret: he, like Calder, is a merman. Obsessed with his new identity, Lily's dad monopolizes Calder's time as the two of them spend every day in the water, leaving Lily behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then dead bodies start washing ashore. Calder blames his mermaid sisters, but Lily fears her father has embraced the merman's natural need to kill. As the body count grows, everyone is pointing fingers. Lily doesn't know what to believe—only that whoever's responsible is sure to strike again. . . . </description>

  <description>The normal part of Lorelei MacAlister’s life didn’t just slip away quietly the day Jared Kovach came to town. Nope. The normal part of her life shattered. It exploded. It burst into a gazillion shards of fleeting light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It went out with a bang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goodbye normal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hello dark and eerie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While her best friend, Brooklyn, is focusing all of her energy on helping Lorelei hone her abilities, Lorelei is dealing with the reality that Satan’s second in command has taken up residence inside her body. Oh, and the fact that she has a crush on the Angel of Death. But what a beautiful death it is. If those weren’t bad enough, something sinister has come to town and it wants nothing more than to hear Lorelei’s dying breath as it strangles it out of her. Thank goodness the gang has a supernatural champion. But what happens when the only being who can save them switches sides midstream? How can a group of misfits capture one of the most powerful beings ever created? And will they find out how to bring Jared back to them before it’s too late?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/deathdoomanddetention/DaryndaJones" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/deathdoomandd...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Some rules simply beg to be broken...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dressmaker in London's busiest shop, Miss Anabelle Honeycote overhears the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt;'s steamiest secrets—and (occasionally) uses them to her advantage. It isn't something she's proud of, but the reluctant blackmailer needs the money to care for her gravely ill mother. To make up for her misdeeds, Anabelle keeps to a firm set of rules:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Never request payment from someone who cannot afford it.&lt;br&gt;• Never reveal the secrets of a paying client.&lt;br&gt;• Never enter into any form of social interaction with a client.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her list keeps her (somewhat) honest—until she encounters Owen Sherbourne, the Duke of Huntford. Not only does Owen nip Anabelle's extortion plans in the bud, the devilishly handsome Duke soon has the sexy seamstress dreaming of more than silks and satins. With Owen, Anabelle enjoys pleasures she never imagined . . . until a scandal from the past resurfaces. Now her rules could mean his family's ruin. Owen's searing kisses carry the promise of passion, but how will he react when Anabelle's most devastating secret is finally revealed?</description>

  <description>Katie is on the verge of her &lt;em&gt;Rumspringa,&lt;/em&gt; the time in Amish life when teenagers can get a taste of the real world. But the real world comes to her in this dystopian tale with a philosophical bent. Rumors of massive unrest on the “Outside” abound. Something murderous is out there. Amish elders make a rule: No one goes outside, and no outsiders come in. But when Katie finds a gravely injured young man, she can’t leave him to die. She smuggles him into her family’s barn—at what cost to her community? The suspense of this vividly told, truly horrific thriller will keep the pages turning.</description>

      <![CDATA[Interesting book with a storyline one doesn't encounter too often. The heroine is a spirited Amish girl about to go off on her Rumspringa trip with her childhood friend Elijah, a boy she might one day marry.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Three Women Who Share One Fate: The Boleyn Inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anne of Cleves&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;She runs from her tiny country, her hateful mother, and her abusive brother to a throne whose last three occupants are dead. King Henry VIII, her new husband, instantly dislikes her. Without friends, family, or even an understanding of the language being spoken around her, she must literally save her neck in a court ruled by a deadly game of politics and the terror of an unpredictable and vengeful king. Her Boleyn Inheritance: accusations and false witnesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katherine Howard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;She catches the king's eye within moments of arriving at court, setting in motion the dreadful machine of politics, intrigue, and treason that she does not understand. She only knows that she is beautiful, that men desire her, that she is young and in love -- but not with the diseased old man who made her queen, beds her night after night, and killed her cousin Anne. Her Boleyn Inheritance: the threat of the axe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jane Rochford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is the Boleyn girl whose testimony sent her husband and sister-in-law to their deaths. She is the trusted friend of two threatened queens, the perfectly loyal spy for her uncle, the Duke of Norfolk, and a canny survivor in the murderous court of a most dangerous king. Throughout Europe, her name is a byword for malice, jealousy, and twisted lust. Her Boleyn Inheritance: a fortune and a title, in exchange for her soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Boleyn Inheritance&lt;/em&gt; is a novel drawn tight as a lute string about a court ruled by the gallows and three women whose positions brought them wealth, admiration, and power as well as deceit, betrayal, and terror. Once again, Philippa Gregory has brought a vanished world to life - the whisper of a silk skirt on a stone stair, the yellow glow of candlelight illuminating a hastily written note, the murmurs of the crowd gathering on Tower Green below the newly built scaffold. In &lt;em&gt;The Boleyn Inheritance&lt;/em&gt; Gregory is at her intelligent and page-turning best.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When Strangers In The Night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He lives in the shadows. As the mysterious masked avenger known as the Ghost of St. Giles, Godric St. John's only goal is to protect the innocent of London. Until the night he confronts a fearless young lady pointing a pistol at his head—and realizes she is his wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Become Lovers...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Margaret Reading has vowed to kill the Ghost of St. Giles—the man who murdered her one true love. Returning to London, and to the man she hasn't seen since their wedding day, Margaret does not recognize the man behind the mask. Fierce, commanding, and dangerous, the notorious Ghost of St. Giles is everything she feared he would be—and so much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desire Is The Ultimate Danger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When passion flares, these two intimate strangers can't keep from revealing more of themselves than they had ever planned. But when Margaret learns the truth—that the Ghost is her husband—the game is up and the players must surrender...to the temptation that could destroy them both.</description>

  <description>Kami Glass loves someone she’s never met . . . a boy she’s talked to in her head ever since she was born. She wasn’t silent about her imaginary friend during her childhood, and is thus a bit of an outsider in her sleepy English town of Sorry-in-the-Vale. Still, Kami hasn’t suffered too much from not fitting in. She has a best friend, runs the school newspaper, and is only occasionally caught talking to herself. Her life is in order, just the way she likes it, despite the voice in her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that changes when the Lynburns return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lynburn family has owned the spectacular and sinister manor that overlooks Sorry-in-the-Vale for centuries. The mysterious twin sisters who abandoned their ancestral home a generation ago are back, along with their teenage sons, Jared and Ash, one of whom is eerily familiar to Kami. Kami is not one to shy away from the unknown—in fact, she’s determined to find answers for all the questions Sorry-in-the-Vale is suddenly posing. Who is responsible for the bloody deeds in the depths of the woods? What is her own mother hiding? And now that her imaginary friend has become a real boy, does she still love him? Does she hate him? Can she trust him?</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Strange Angels&lt;/em&gt;, Dru Anderson has what her grandmother called “the touch.” (Comes in handy when you’re traveling from town to town with your dad, hunting ghosts, suckers, wulfen, and the occasional zombie.) Then her dad turns up dead—but still walking—and Dru knows she’s next. Even worse, she’s got two guys hungry for her affections, and they’re not about to let the fiercely independent Dru go it alone. Will Dru discover just how special she really is before coming face-to-fang with whatever—or &lt;em&gt;whoever&lt;/em&gt;— is hunting her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[One of the more enjoyable YA paranormals I've read lately. The heroine has been trained for this her whole life, but holy shit she is a normal teenager (besides being knowledgeable of the paranormal world and stuff, ya know?). Her dad is killed, and so what if she's had training and they've been...]]>

  <description>A sequel true to Jane Austen’s beloved masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have been married for almost a year, and their heated arguments are a thing of the past. All that passion is now directed into more satisfying pursuits. But how long can the honeymoon last? The couple’s idyllic life together at Pemberley is jeopardized by secrets they begin keeping from each other, the troubles of their closest friends, and the threat of a villain in their midst. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Layers of seemingly innocent deception are building between Darcy and Elizabeth, threatening their relationship. He is conducting some covert business dealings that he’s unwilling to share with his wife, and she likewise begins keeping things from him against her own better judgment. The couple also becomes embroiled in the tribulations of Mr. Darcy’s younger sister, Georgiana, and his friend and cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fitzwilliam falls victim to their aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as the object of her latest scheme to make a noble match for her daughter. Georgiana runs the gamut of emotions as she comes of age and learns the pain of unrequited love. Meanwhile, the menacing shadow of Mr. Darcy’s life-long nemesis, Mr. Wickham, looms ever larger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Darcys of Pemberley is the tale of two romances: the continuation of Darcy and Elizabeth’s story, and the courtship of Miss Georgiana. For those who didn’t want Pride and Prejudice to end, this novel gives the opportunity to learn what happens after the wedding, to revisit old friends and foes, and to share the next chapter of their lives.</description>

  <description>After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes, 18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal assassin. Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve the kingdom for three years and then be granted her freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilirating. But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one of the other contestants turns up dead... quickly followed by another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Celaena figure out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Hunted, Killed—Survived?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the last Healer in the Fifteen Realms, Avry of Kazan is in a unique position: in the minds of her friends and foes alike, she no longer exists. Despite her need to prevent the megalomanical King Tohon from winning control of the Realms, Avry is also determined to find her sister and repair their estrangement. And she must do it alone, as Kerrick, her partner and sole confident, returns to Alga to summon his country into battle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though she should be in hiding, Avry will do whatever she can to support Tohon’s opponents. Including infiltrating a holy army, evading magic sniffers, teaching forest skills to soldiers and figuring out how to stop Tohon’s most horrible creations yet; an army of the walking dead—human and animal alike and nearly impossible to defeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War is coming and Avry is alone. Unless she figures out how to do the impossible ... again.</description>

She and her equally gifted (or should that be 'cursed'?) friends are now running for their lives from the evil corporation that created them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that's not enough, Chloe is struggling with her feelings for Simon, a sweet-tempered sorcerer, and his brother Derek, a not so sweet-tempered werewolf. And she has a horrible feeling she's leaning towards the werewolf...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Definitely not normal.</description>

  <description>Liesl lives in a tiny attic bedroom, locked away by her cruel stepmother. Her only friends are the shadows and the mice,until one night a ghost appears from the darkness. It is Po, who comes from the Other Side. Both Liesl and Po are lonely, but together they are less alone. &lt;p&gt;That same night, an alchemist's apprentice, Will, bungles an important delivery. He accidentally switches a box containing the most powerful magic in the world with one containing something decidedly less remarkable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will's mistake has tremendous consequences for Liesl and Po, and it draws the three of them together on an extraordinary journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Lauren Oliver comes a luminous and magnificent novel that glows with rare magic, ghostly wonders, and a true friendship that lights even the darkest of places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;New York Times bestseller Karin Slaughter brings back her two most fascinating and complex characters–medical examiner Sara Linton and her ex-husband, police chief Jeffrey Tolliver–in a heart-pounding tale of faith, doubt, and murder…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The victim was buried alive in the Georgia woods–then killed in a horrifying fashion. When Sara Linton and Jeffrey Tolliver stumble upon the body, both become consumed with finding out who killed the pretty young woman. For them, a harrowing journey begins, one that will test their own turbulent relationship and draw dozens of life into the case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;For as Jeffrey and Sara move further down a trail of shocking surprises and hidden passions, neither is prepared for the most stunning discovery of all: the identity of a killer who is more evil and dangerous than anyone could have guessed.</description>

  <description>A Templar treasure for mystery readers!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An honorable-yet world-weary-Knight Templar solves the mysteries of Medieval England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After eight years of captivity in the Holy Land, Templar Bascot de Marins escapes with injuries to his body and soul. Now on a sojourn at Lincoln Castle, he hopes to regain his strength, and mend his waning faith-but not even the peace of God's countryside is safe from the mortal crimes of man. For what appears to be the grisly end to a drunken row is in fact a cunning and baffling crime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Welcome back to New Orleans.&lt;br&gt;Where the streets swirl with jazz and beauty.&lt;br&gt;Where the houses breathe with ghosts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year ago, Rebecca Brown escaped death in a New Orleans cemetery. Now she has returned to this haunting city. She is looking forward to seeing Anton Grey, the boy who may or may not have her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she also meets a ghost: a troubled boy who insists only she can help him. Soon Rebecca finds herself embroiled in another murder mystery from more than a century ago. But as she tries to right wrongs, she finds more questions than answers: Is she putting her friends, and herself, in danger? Can she trust this new ghost? And has she stumbled into something much bigger and more serious than she understands?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Anne Gracie is “always terrific,”* and now the award-winning author delivers a brand-new series about four young women on the verge of destitution—until a daring act changes their fortune and transforms each of them into a glowing bride…&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Governess Abigail Chantry will do anything to save her sister and two dearest friends from destitution, even if it means breaking into an empty mansion in the hope of finding something to sell. Instead of treasures, though, she finds the owner, Lady Beatrice Davenham, bedridden and neglected. Appalled, Abby rousts Lady Beatrice's predatory servants and—with Lady Beatrice's eager cooperation—the four young ladies become her “nieces,” neatly eliminating the threat of disaster for all concerned!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's the perfect situation, until Lady Beatrice’s dashing and arrogant nephew, Max, Lord Davenham, returns from the Orient—and discovers an impostor running his household…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A romantic entanglement was never the plan for these stubborn, passionate opponents—but falling in love may be as inevitable as the falling of autumn leaves...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt; *&lt;/em&gt;Mary Jo Putney</description>

Orderly and predictable—that's the way he likes it. But he's in the public eye, and the scandal sheets will make up anything to sell papers. When the gossip papers link him to Juliette, one of the most beautiful and celebrated courtesans in London, chaos doesn't begin to describe what happens next...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until she came along...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliette is nicknamed the Duchess of Dalliance and has the cream of the nobility at her beck and call.

  <description>With &lt;em&gt;A Feast for Crows&lt;/em&gt;, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth volume of the landmark series that has redefined imaginative fiction and stands as a modern masterpiece in the making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After centuries of bitter strife, the seven powers dividing the land have beaten one another into an uneasy truce. But it's not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters of the Seven Kingdoms gather. Now, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—emerge from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges of the terrible times ahead. Nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages, are coming together to stake their fortunes...and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the survivors.</description>

  <description>As long ago as forever and as far away as Selidor, there lived the dragonlord and Archmage, Sparrowhawk, the greatest of the great wizards - he who, when still a youth, met with the evil shadow-beast; he who later brought back the Ring of Erreth-Akbe from the Tombs of Atuan; and he who, as an old man, rode the mighty dragon Kalessin back form the land of the dead. And then, the legends say, Sparrowhawk entered his boat, &lt;em&gt;Lookfar,&lt;/em&gt; turned his back on land, and without wind or sail or oar moved westward over the sea and our of sight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan, The Farthest Shore&lt;/strong&gt; - Ursula Le Guin's brilliant and magical trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover Illustration: Jonathan Field</description>

  <description>Another Turn, and the deadly silver Threads began falling again. So the bold dragonriders took to the air once more and their magnificent flying dragons swirled and swooped, belching flames that destroyed the shimmering strands before they reach the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But F'lar knew he had to find a better way to protect his beloved Pern, and he had to find it before the rebellious Oldtimers could breed anymore dissent... before his brother F'nor would be foolhardy enough to launch another suicide mission... and before those dratted fire-lizards could stir up any more trouble!</description>

  <description>There's a big curse in little Chinatown…and it's not Prohibition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s the roaring twenties, and San Francisco is a hotbed of illegal boozing, raw lust, and black magic. The fog-covered Bay Area can be an intoxicating scene, particularly when you specialize in spirits…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aida Palmer performs a spirit medium show onstage at Chinatown’s illustrious Gris-Gris speakeasy. However, her ability to summon (and expel) the dead is more than just an act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winter Magnusson is a notorious bootlegger who’s more comfortable with guns than ghosts—unfortunately for him, he’s the recent target of a malevolent hex that renders him a magnet for hauntings. After Aida’s supernatural assistance is enlisted to banish the ghosts, her spirit-chilled aura heats up as the charming bootlegger casts a different sort of spell on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the hunt for the curseworker responsible for the hex, Aida and Winter become drunk on passion. And the closer they become, the more they realize they have ghosts of their own to exorcise…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;To you, perceptive reader, I bequeath my history…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late one night, exploring her father’s library, a young woman finds an ancient book and a cache of yellowing letters addressed ominously to ‘My dear and unfortunate successor’. Her discovery plunges her into a world she never dreamed of – a labyrinth where the secrets of her father’s past and her mother’s mysterious fate connect to an evil hidden in the depths of history.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Riven is as tough as they come. Coming from a world ravaged by a devastating android war, she has to be. There’s no room for softness, no room for emotion, no room for mistakes. A Legion General, she is the right hand of the young Prince of Neospes, a parallel universe to Earth. In Neospes, she has everything: rank, responsibility and respect. But when Prince Cale sends her away to find his long-lost brother, Caden, who has been spirited back to modern day Earth, Riven finds herself in uncharted territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrown out of her comfort zone but with the mindset of a soldier, Riven has to learn how to be a girl in a realm that is the opposite of what she knows. Riven isn’t prepared for the beauty of a world that is unlike her own in so many ways. Nor is she prepared to feel something more than indifference for the very target she seeks. Caden is nothing like Cale, but he makes something in her come alive, igniting a spark deep down that goes against every cell in her body. For the first time in her life, Riven isn’t sure about her purpose, about her calling. Torn between duty and desire, she must decide whether Caden is simply a target or whether he is something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faced with hideous reanimated Vector soldiers from her own world with agendas of their own, as well as an unexpected reunion with a sister who despises her, it is a race against time to bring Caden back to Neospes. But things aren’t always as they seem, and Riven will have to search for truth. Family betrayals and royal coups are only the tip of the iceberg. Will Riven be able to find the strength to defy her very nature? Or will she become the monstrous soldier she was designed to be?</description>

  <description>Emrys—a fiery, red-headed Fae—always embraced her life in the Highlands, far from the city’s draining technology, until she’s sent to London to rejoin the Faery Guard. But this isn’t any normal assignment—she’s sent to guard Prince Richard: Britain’s notorious, partying bad boy and soon-to-be King. The prince’s careless ways and royal blood make him the irresistible for the dark spirits that feed on mortals. Sweet, disheveled, and alive with adventure—Richard is one charge who will put Emrys’s magic and heart to the test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an ancient force begins preying on the monarchy, Emrys must hunt through the London’s magical underworld, facing down Banshees, Black Dogs and Green Women to find the one who threatens Richard’s life. In this chaos of dark magic, palace murders and paparazzi, Emrys finds herself facing an impossible choice. For despite all her powers, Emrys has discovered a force that burns brighter than magic: love.</description>

  <description>Fleeing a destroyed Earth, seventeen-year-old orphan Hope grew up living in the confines of a spaceship heading to CR-3, a new home planet. She's been kicking the steel walls for too long and ever since she broke her boyfriend's heart, touchdown could mean open air and a fresh start. But no one expected the Locals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope’s dreams of freedom turn into nightmares when the Locals trap the humans and mark groups for observation. At any moment she can be called into a holographic observation room for testing. Some days she’s drowning in a strange dark ocean, some days she’s locked up without food, and all with the one boy she can't seem to forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Locals study Hope, she studies them. She wants to believe the tall grey creatures could be peaceful, but as the simulations become more dangerous, Hope is about to become the human race’s last chance for survival.</description>

  <description>A lush and gorgeously written debut, packed with action, intrigue, and a thrilling love triangle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexa Hollen is a fighter. Forced to disguise herself as a boy and serve in the king's army, Alex uses her quick wit and fierce sword-fighting skills to earn a spot on the elite prince's guard. But when a powerful sorcerer sneaks into the palace in the dead of night, even Alex, who is virtually unbeatable, can't prevent him from abducting her, her fellow guard and friend Rylan, and Prince Damian, taking them through the treacherous wilds of the jungle and deep into enemy territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The longer Alex is held captive with both Rylan and the prince, the more she realizes that she is not the only one who has been keeping dangerous secrets. And suddenly, after her own secret is revealed, Alex finds herself confronted with two men vying for her heart: the safe and steady Rylan, who has always cared for her, and the dark, intriguing Damian. With hidden foes lurking around every corner, is Alex strong enough to save herself and the kingdom she's sworn to protect?</description>

  <description>All she wants is a home, but can she find one…UNDER DIFFERENT STARS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kricket Hollowell is normally not one to wish upon stars; she believes they’re rarely in her favor. Well versed at dodging caseworkers from Chicago’s foster care system, the past few years on her own have made Kricket an expert at the art of survival and blending in. With her 18th birthday fast approaching, she dreams of the day when she can stop running and find what her heart needs most: a home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trey Allairis hates Earth and doubts that anyone from his world can thrive here. What he’s learning of Kricket and her existence away from her true home only confirms his theory. But, when he and Kricket lie together under the stars of Ethar, counting them all may be easier than letting her go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyon Ensin’s secrets number the stars; he knows more about Kricket’s gifts than anyone and plans to possess her because of them. He also knows she’s more valuable than any fire in the night sky. He’ll move the heavens and align them all in order to make her his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When everything in their world can be broken, will Kricket rely upon love to save her under different stars?</description>

  <description>On her nineteenth birthday, Princess Kelsea Raleigh Glynn, raised in exile, sets out on a perilous journey back to the castle of her birth to ascend her rightful throne. Plain and serious, a girl who loves books and learning, Kelsea bears little resemblance to her mother, the vain and frivolous Queen Elyssa. But though she may be inexperienced and sheltered, Kelsea is not defenseless: Around her neck hangs the Tearling sapphire, a jewel of immense magical power; and accompanying her is the Queen’s Guard, a cadre of brave knights led by the enigmatic and dedicated Lazarus. Kelsea will need them all to survive a cabal of enemies who will use every weapon—from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic—to prevent her from wearing the crown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite her royal blood, Kelsea feels like nothing so much as an insecure girl, a child called upon to lead a people and a kingdom about which she knows almost nothing. But what she discovers in the capital will change everything, confronting her with horrors she never imagined. An act of singular daring will throw Kelsea’s kingdom into tumult, unleashing the vengeance of the tyrannical ruler of neighboring Mortmesne: the Red Queen, a sorceress possessed of the darkest magic. Now Kelsea will begin to discover whom among the servants, aristocracy, and her own guard she can trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the quest to save her kingdom and meet her destiny has only just begun—a wondrous journey of self-discovery and a trial by fire that will make her a legend…if she can survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Queen of the Tearling introduces readers to a world as fully imagined and terrifying as that of The Hunger Games, with characters as vivid and intriguing as those of The Game of Thrones, and a wholly original heroine. Combining thrilling action and twisting plot turns, it is a magnificent debut from the talented Erika Johansen.</description>

  <description>The truth will test you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For fans of Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games: high fantasy and dystopia meet in this high-stakes tale of a civilization built on lies and the girl who single-handedly brings it down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Eva’s twin brother, Eamon, falls to his death just a few months before he is due to participate in The Testing, no one expects Eva to take his place. She’s a Maiden, slated for embroidery classes, curtseys, and soon a prestigious marriage befitting the daughter of an Aerie ruler. But Eva insists on honoring her brother by becoming a Testor. After all, she wouldn’t be the first Maiden to Test, just the first in 150 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva knows the Testing is no dance class. Gallant Testors train for their entire lives to search icy wastelands for Relics: artifacts of the corrupt civilization that existed before The Healing drowned the world. Out in the Boundary Lands, Eva must rely on every moment of the lightning-quick training she received from Lukas—her servant, a Boundary native, and her closest friend now that Eamon is gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are threats in The Testing beyond what Lukas could have prepared her for. And no one could have imagined the danger Eva unleashes when she discovers a Relic that shakes the Aerie to its core.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Masks&lt;/em&gt;, the first novel in a mesmerizing new fantasy series, draws readers into a world in which cataclysmic events have left the Autarchy of Aygrima—the one land blessed with magical resources—cut off from its former trading partners across the waters, not knowing if any of those distant peoples still live. Yet under the rule of the Autarch, Aygrima survives. And thanks to the creation of the Masks and the vigilance of the Autarch’s Watchers, no one can threaten the security of the empire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Aygrima, magic is a Gift possessed from birth by a very small percentage of the population, with the Autarch himself the most powerful magic worker of all. Only the long-vanquished Lady of Pain and Fire had been able to challenge his rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At the age of fifteen, citizens are recognized as adults and must don the spell-infused Masks—which denote both status and profession—whenever they are in public. To maintain the secure rule of the kingdom, the Masks are magically crafted to reveal any treasonous thoughts or actions. And once such betrayals are exposed, the Watchers are there to enforce the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Mara Holdfast, daughter of the Autarch’s Master Maskmaker, is fast approaching her fifteenth birthday and her all-important Masking ceremony. Her father himself has been working behind closed doors to create Mara’s Mask. Once the ceremony is done, she will take her place as an adult, and Gifted with the same magical abilities as her father, she will also claim her rightful place as his apprentice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But on the day of her Masking something goes horribly wrong, and instead of celebrating, Mara is torn away from her parents, imprisoned, and consigned to a wagon bound for the mines. Is it because she didn’t turn the unMasked boy she discovered over to the Night Watchers? Or is it because she’s lied about her Gift, claiming she can only see one color of magic, when in truth she can see them all, just as she could when she was a young child?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Whatever the reason, her Mask has labeled her a traitor and now she has lost everything, doomed to slavery in the mines until she dies. And not even her Gift can show Mara the future that awaits her—a future that may see her freed to aid a rebel cause, forced to become a puppet of the Autarch, or transformed into a force as dangerous to her world as the legendary Lady of Pain and Fire.</description>

  <description>So many secrets for such a small island. From the moment Anne Merchant arrives at Cania Christy, a boarding school for the world’s wealthiest teens, the hushed truths of this strange, unfamiliar land begin calling to her—sometimes as lulling drumbeats in the night, sometimes as piercing shrieks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One by one, unanswered questions rise. No one will tell her why a line is painted across the island or why she is forbidden to cross it. Her every move—even her performance at the school dance—is graded as part of a competition to become valedictorian, a title that brings rewards no one will talk about. And Anne discovers that the parents of her peers surrender million-dollar possessions to enroll their kids in Cania Christy, leaving her to wonder what her lowly funeral director father could have paid to get her in… and why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a beautiful senior struggles to help Anne make sense of this cloak-and-dagger world without breaking the rules that bind him, she must summon the courage to face the impossible truth—and change it—before she and everyone she loves is destroyed by it.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Soon, Elusion® will change the world and life as we know it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new technology called Elusion is sweeping the country. An app, visor and wristband will virtually transport you to an exotic destination where adventure can be pursued without the complications—or consequences—of real life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regan is an Elusion insider. Or at least she used to be. Her father invented the program, and her best friend, Patrick, heir to the tech giant Orexis, is about to release it nationwide. But ever since her father’s unexpected death, Regan can’t bear to Escape, especially since waking up from the dream means crashing back to her grim reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, when there are rumors of trouble in Elusion—accusations that it’s addictive and dangerous— Regan is determined to defend it. But the critics of Elusion come from surprising sources, including Josh, the handsome skeptic with his own personal stakes. As Regan investigates the claims, she discovers a disturbing web of secrets. She will soon have to choose between love and loyalty…a decision that will affect the lives of millions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suspense, thrills, and romance fuel this near-future story about the seductive nature of a perfect virtual world, and how far one girl will go to uncover the truth behind the illusions.</description>

  <description>It is the spring of 1885 and wealthy New York socialite Beret Osmundsen has been estranged from her younger sister, Lillie, for a year when she gets word from her aunt and uncle that Lillie has died suddenly in Denver.  What they do not tell her is that Lillie had become a prostitute and was brutally murdered in the brothel where she had been living.  When Beret discovers the sordid truth of Lillie’s death, she makes her way to Denver, determined to find her sister’s murderer.  Detective Mick McCauley may not want her involved in the case, but Beret is determined, and the investigation soon takes her from the dangerous, seedy underworld of Denver’s tenderloin to the highest levels of Denver society.  Along the way, Beret not only learns the depths of Lillie’s depravity, but also exposes the sinister side of Gilded Age ambition in the process.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sandra Dallas once again delivers a page-turner filled with mystery, intrigue, and the kind of intricate detail that truly transports you to another time and place.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Olivia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He tilts my chin up so my eyes meet his, his thumb brushing lightly across my lips. I close my eyes. I know Z is trouble. I know that being with him is going to get me into trouble. I don’t care. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least at this moment, I don’t care.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tossed from foster home to foster home, Olivia’s seen a lot in her sixteen years. She’s hardened, sure, though mostly just wants to fly under the radar until graduation. But her natural ability with computers catches the eye of Z, a mysterious guy at her new school. Soon, Z has brought Liv into his team of hacker elite—break into a few bank accounts, and voila, he drives a motorcycle. Follow his lead, and Olivia might even be able to escape from her oppressive foster parents. As Olivia and Z grow closer, though, so does the watchful eye of Bill Sykes, Z’s boss. And he’s got bigger plans for Liv…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Z&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can picture Liv’s face: wide-eyed, trusting. Her smooth lips that taste like strawberry Fanta. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was just a kiss. That’s all. She’s just like any other girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except that she’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to Z, Olivia’s about to get twisted.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Claire Kincaid’s family has been in business for over fifty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The voodoo business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the International Guild of High Priests and Priestesses, a secret society that have practiced voodoo for generations, the Kincaid’s run an underground supply house for authentic voodoo supplies. Claire plays along, filling orders for powders, oils and other bizarre ingredients in the family store, but she has a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She doesn’t believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling to reconcile her modern sensibilities with a completely unscientific craft based on suspicion, Claire can’t wait to escape New Orleans – and voodoo – when she goes to college, a desire that creates almost constant conflict in her secret affair with Xander Toussaint, son of the Guild’s powerful founding family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a mysterious customer places an order for a deadly ingredient, Claire begins to realize that there’s more to voodoo – and the families that make up the Guild – than meets the eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Including her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she bands together with the other firstborns of the Guild, she comes face to face with a deadly enemy – and the disbelief that may very well kill her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A rogue ruined . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is the Killer Duke, accused of murdering Mara Lowe on the eve of her wedding. With no memory of that fateful night, Temple has reigned over the darkest of London’s corners for twelve years, wealthy and powerful, but beyond redemption. Until one night, Mara resurfaces, offering the one thing he’s dreamed of . . . absolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lady returned . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mara planned never to return to the world from which she’d run, but when her brother falls deep into debt at Temple’s exclusive casino, she has no choice but to offer Temple a trade that ends in her returning to society and proving to the world what only she knows . . . that he is no killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A scandal revealed . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a fine trade, until Temple realizes that the lady—and her past—are more than they seem. It will take every bit of his strength to resist the pull of this mysterious, maddening woman who seems willing to risk everything for honor . . . and to keep from putting himself on the line for love.</description>

  <description>From New York Times bestselling author Melissa de la Cruz and Michael Johnston comes this remarkable first book in a spellbinding new series about the dawn of a new kind of magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to New Vegas, a city once covered in bling, now blanketed in ice. Like much of the destroyed planet, the place knows only one temperature—freezing. But some things never change. The diamond in the ice desert is still a 24-hour hedonistic playground and nothing keeps the crowds away from the casino floors, never mind the rumors about sinister sorcery in its shadows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of this city is Natasha Kestal, a young blackjack dealer looking for a way out. Like many, she's heard of a mythical land simply called “the Blue.” They say it’s a paradise, where the sun still shines and the waters are turquoise. More importantly, it’s a place where Nat won’t be persecuted, even if her darkest secret comes to light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But passage to the Blue is treacherous, if not impossible, and her only shot is to bet on a ragtag crew of mercenaries led by a cocky runner named Ryan Wesson to take her there. Danger and deceit await on every corner, even as Nat and Wes find themselves inexorably drawn to each other. But can true love survive the lies? Fiery hearts collide in this fantastic tale of the evil men do and the awesome power within us all.</description>

  <description>Tessa McCaide has a unique talent for getting into trouble. Then again, it isn’t easy for a girl with visions to ignore what she sees. Luckily Tessa and her family are leaving California and moving halfway across the country, giving her the perfect opportunity to leave her reputation as “Freaky Tessa” behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tessa doesn’t realize that kissing the wrong guy in her new Texas town could land her in far more trouble than she ever imagined. Like being forced to attend St. Ailbe’s Academy, a secret boarding school for werewolves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if the wrong guy did accidentally turn her into one of “them” and doom her to attending the weirdest high school ever, Tessa can’t help her growing attraction to the mysterious Dastien Laurent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When vampires attack St. Alibe’s and her visions pinpoint an enemy in their midst, Tessa realizes that boy drama and her newfound canine tendencies might just be the least of her problems.</description>

  <description>Lily can't escape the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years after a tragedy tore her family apart, Lily is on her way to college for what she hopes will be a fresh start. Instead, she finds herself broken down in the place she swore she'd never return to, the place by the water that damaged her family beyond repair. When Ty Reilly offers her help, she reluctantly accepts, eager to get her car fixed and get the hell out of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before that can happen, an eerily similar recurrence stops Lily cold. With her identity and ties to the old tragedy revealed, new suspicions cast a bright light on Lily. Everyone around her – the guy who offered her help, her own wayward sister, and the town sheriff who remembers her from a decade earlier – begins to wonder if her reappearance is merely a coincidence or if she's somehow involved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lily begins to thread together strands from the past with the present, she realizes that there's no such thing as a coincidence down by the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that you can't ever really leave the past behind.</description>

  <description>All West Montgomery wanted was a vacation. A week-long stay in Tucson with Abby and her parents, a chance to get away for the week, the opportunity to get to know her family a little better and maybe carve out a little alone time with his girlfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he doesn't count on is finding a way to resume his baseball career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Encouraged by Abby and her father to attend a MLB open tryout, West discovers that he can still play ball—well—and he suddenly becomes the hottest commodity on the field. Overwhelmed with offers and possibilities, West knows that whatever choice he makes will affect more than his baseball career. It will affect his future with Abby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Professional baseball was always his dream, but Abby was a new dream come true. He doesn't want to choose between them, but in order to fulfill one of those dreams, West will have to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because he knows it's all on him.</description>

  <description>Meg Calloway is at the edge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reeling from her parents' sudden divorce, fifteen-year old Meg has never felt more alone. Her father is about to marry a woman she can't stand and her mother's only companion is an endless supply of alcohol. When Aidan Westwood, an older boy at school, shows interest in her, she grabs on and doesn't let go, thinking he's exactly what she needs to help stem her loneliness and despair. She quickly learns that Aidan lives a darker, more dangerous life than she does and the more isolated she feels from her family, the more willing she is to step into Aidan's world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Meg drifts further from her friends, she tries to find comfort with a boy who is opening her eyes up to new things, none of them good. Will she listen to those around her who are warning her that she's headed down a path of self-destruction?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or will she fall too far...too fast...too deep?</description>

  <description>Fifteen year-old Valerie is used to losing things–she lost her dad to his job ages ago and her best friend moved with no warning...and hasn't been heard from since. During a weekend camping trip with her emotionally distant parents, she stumbles upon a hidden, mysterious stone and she finds herself desperate to keep it, to possess it. Two strange and beautiful boys have other plans, however. They follow her home–Leo, warm and seductive, who covets the stone and will stop at nothing to get it; and Noel, dark-haired and wise, who pledges to protect her and keep her safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she delves deeper into the magic of the stone and the Celtic lore that surrounds it, Valerie realizes that she's losing. Again. But this loss might involve more than a magical stone – this time, she just might lose her heart.</description>

  <description>Kellen Handler is in deep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since he can remember, he’s wanted to be a professional surfer. And he made it, rising to the top of the ranks, traveling the world and riding every break he’s ever dreamed of. His good looks and reputation for living on the edge—both in and out of the water—have made him an international superstar. But when his best friend dies in a tragic accident, Kellen wipes out big time, spiraling so badly that everything he’s worked for starts to disintegrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tour officials scramble to do damage control and demand he work with a public relations company to clean up his bad boy image. It doesn't help that the person assigned to him, Gina Bellori, has her own demons associated with the surfing world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against her better judgement Gina accepts the job and concentrates on repairing Kellen's tattered reputation, despite his protests and despite the pain it causes her. With her past colliding with her present—and Kellen in the thick of it—she begins to realize that some secrets can't stay hidden. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And suddenly, Kellen Handler is no longer worried about losing his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's more worried about losing his heart.</description>

  <description>Abby Sellers knows what she wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enduring eighteen years in the shadow of her identical twin sister, Annika, she wants a fresh start. A chance to create her own life, separate from her conniving, deceptive twin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprising both her family and friends, Abby ditches her plans for college and enrolls at a new school instead. There, she encounters West Montgomery, a sexy fellow student who immediately disarms her with his good looks and charm. West takes a liking to Abby and she suddenly finds herself walking a thin line, fabricating a fictional life created not by lies but by omission. She soon discovers West has secrets of his own, secrets that he's not altogether interested in sharing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out from under the shadow of her twin, Abby's life—and her relationship with West—blossoms. When Abby leaves town one weekend, something unthinkable happens and her relationship with West is shattered. Reeling from the discovery, Abby fears all of her plans have backfired and she's created a mess for both of them, a mess that no one can clean up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But West isn't willing to let her go that easily. When he forces her to confront secrets they've both been hiding, Abby must decide more than if she's willing to forgive and forget. She must also decide just what kind of life she wants...and who she wants to live it with.</description>

  <description>Ever wondered what leads someone to hold another human captive? Why would they do it? What urges drive a person to take another as a possession? What is the motivation to enact one of the most heinous crimes imaginable? Who commits these crimes? Every so often we are presented with another shocking case, all by their very nature are incredibly complex. Without following these cases closely it is easy to get lost in the speculation, confused within the detail, or left wondering as loose ends are never tied off as the media moves onto the next story. Some cases are well known, like that of Elisabeth Fritzl, Jaycee Dugard, and Natascha Kampusch. Josef Fritzl held his daughter in a basement dungeon for 24 years, creating an incestuous family, living two lives. But, there are many other cases that almost evade the public eye. While Elisabeth's story is traumatic, she is far from alone. David Bisson spent his childhood locked in a cupboard, while his mother denied his existence. Under the ice covered grounds of Russia, a copycat kidnapper aimed to recreate another man's vision of an underground city of slaves. James Jamelske got away with holding five women captive over 15 years, before anyone would believe their stories. Captive Humans explores true crime cases of people held captive, examining the stories in a chronological order. These cases present the facts; you can draw your own conclusions. Come into the dark, hard places and explore the secretive world of Captive Humans. &lt;a href="http://www.captivehumans.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.captivehumans.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Dear Mr. Knightley is a contemporary epistolary novel with a delightful dash of Jane Austen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samantha Moore survived years of darkness in the foster care system by hiding behind her favorite characters in literature, even adopting their very words. Her fictional friends give her an identity, albeit a borrowed one. But most importantly, they protect her from revealing her true self and encountering more pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After college, Samantha receives an extraordinary opportunity. The anonymous “Mr. Knightley” offers her a full scholarship to earn her graduate degree at the prestigious Medill School of Journalism. The sole condition is that Sam write to Mr. Knightley regularly to keep him apprised of her progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sam’s true identity begins to reveal itself through her letters, her heart begins to soften to those around her—a damaged teenager and fellow inhabitant of Grace House, her classmates at Medill, and, most powerfully, successful novelist Alex Powell. But just as Sam finally begins to trust, she learns that Alex has secrets of his own—secrets that, for better or for worse, make it impossible for Sam to hide behind either her characters or her letters.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;1347.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calais has finally fallen and Alaun de Montisfryth, first Earl of Montisfryn, powerful Marcher lord and companion of Edward III, is dispatched back to England with orders to secure the Welsh border. Halfway home, pride tempts Montisfryn to attend a tournament held by his family's old foes at Versallet Castle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eloise de Versallet, the widowed Lady de Cannar, rules her father's castle with a tongue sharper than any sword. She has no great opinion of men in general and of knights in particular.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Montisfryn and Eloise meet and sparks fly. He is intrigued. She is irritated.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is under royal edict to wed. An experienced lady, well-born, still young, and exceedingly well-endowed with both wealth and beauty, Eloise is a matrimonial prize beyond compare - and has vowed to remain unwed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Potent and powerful, will Montisfryn be able to breach her walls, storm her castle, and succeed where all others have failed? Or will Eloise, haughty and defiant to the last, prevail? The gauntlet is flung, the challenge accepted. And desire enters the fray.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>To save a kingdom, Zara must choose between a prince who could be the answer and a rising rebellion that threatens to take control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Zara Dane is chosen to marry Prince Sebastian Hart, son of the man who ordered her father’s capture, Zara knows she must fight to save everything she loves from ruin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being betrothed to the prince means a life trapped behind the towering stone walls of the Camelot-forged realm. Under the watchful eye of the prince's first knight, Sir Devlan Capra, changing her future becomes difficult. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an unlikely rebel reveals the truth about the deadly secrets that fuel King Hart’s twisted world, Zara’s path to rescue her father becomes clouded by deception. The Rebels clear her path by forcing Zara’s hand with an ultimatum: sway Prince Sebastian to join the Rebels, convincing him of his father’s evil nature, or they will take him out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Zara is uncertain about a future under the Rebels’ command and where the prince’s heart truly lies. She must decide who to trust, what to believe, and what she’s truly fighting for before the king destroys all of Karm, including her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Set against the volatile backdrop of the English Civil War, dive into this enthralling tale of danger, bravery, and a woman who would do anything for the man she loved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's 1651 and Jane Lane leads a privileged life inside the walls of her family's home. At 25 years old, her parents are keen to see her settled, but Jane dreams of a union that goes beyond the advantageous match her father desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her quiet world is shattered when Royalists, fighting to restore the crown to King Charles II, arrive at their door, imploring Jane and her family for help.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A thrilling debut novel starring one of history's most famous and beloved courtesans. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From London's slums to its bawdy playhouses, &lt;em&gt;The Darling Strumpet&lt;/em&gt; transports the reader to the tumultuous world of seventeenth-century England, charting the meteoric rise of the dazzling Nell Gwynn, who captivates the heart of King Charles II-and becomes one of the century's most famous courtesans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Witty and beautiful, Nell was born into poverty but is drawn into the enthralling world of the theater, where her saucy humor and sensuous charm earn her a place in the King's Company. As one of the first actresses in the newly-opened playhouses, she catapults to fame, winning the affection of legions of fans-and the heart of the most powerful man in all of England, the King himself. Surrendering herself to Charles, Nell will be forced to maneuver the ruthless and shifting allegiances of the royal court-and discover a world of decadence and passion she never imagined possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A boy, a Grandfather, and a small river stone with unmitigated power come together in a story that tugs at one's own heart and memories.&lt;br&gt;In the story,we follow eight year old C.C. through a summer on his grandfather's farm. We see them share in events and experiences that grow and strengthen their relationship, and, like links in a chain, bind them together. And through it all, the power and mystery of the Whisper Stone ebbs and flows, and remembers.</description>

  <description>Since his debut in 1951 as The Catcher in the Rye, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,&lt;br&gt;"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.</description>

  <description>For countless millennia we swallowed the myth perpetrated by the world’s many religions that we were the only sentient species in the cosmos made by an all-powerful God. As it turned out it was an arrogant belief. In the twentieth century, during the period known as the Cold War, between America and its allies versus the former Soviet Union and its acolytes, we revealed our existence to the universe by launching two probes into deep space. The whole event passed into history and was completely forgotten until the thirty-second century, when mankind got a wake-up call that none of us were prepared for.</description>

  <description>Crime's an ugly constant in the big city. L.A. Chicago. New York. But when a savage murder brutalizes a small town and neighbor turns on neighbor, a tough-as-nails cop is essential to restoring order. Blood Land is a gritty, emotional saga set in the Wyoming badlands with both greed and vengeance at its core.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When billions of dollars in natural gas rights hang in the balance and the town's top law officer's wife is slain by her own blood, a reluctant hero is forced to battle his own demons and ultimately choose between justice, revenge, and duty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the tradition of Dennis Lehane, Tony Hillerman and James Lee Burke, Guthrie's sparse, haunting storytelling compliments his talent for creating richly-drawn, unflinching law officers with human frailties and a sense of justice.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An un-putdownable thriller for fans of Uglies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a crash kills their father and leaves them orphaned, Zel knows she needs to protect her sister, Dyl. But before Zel has a plan, Dyl is taken by strangers using bizarre sensory weapons, and Zel finds herself in a safe house for teens who aren’t like any she’s ever seen before—teens who shouldn't even exist. Using broken-down technology, her new friends’ peculiar gifts, and her own grit, Zel must find a way to get her sister back from the kidnappers who think a powerful secret is encoded in Dyl’s DNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spiraling, intense, romantic story set in 2150—in a world of automatic cars, nightclubs with auditory ecstasy drugs, and guys with four arms—this is about the human genetic “mistakes” that society wants to forget, and the way that outcasts can turn out to be heroes.</description>

  <description>The streets of Baltimore are mean enough without the threat of a serial killer, and when the fourth in a string of suspicious deaths is discovered, former cop Frank McGuire's intuitive senses kick into high gear.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pattern of victims — male college students, all homosexual — especially leaves Frank concerned, as they bear striking similarities to his ward and lover, Rand Brennan. Rand struggles with his classes and temptations, yet revels in the delicious punishment Frank delivers when's bad. If only Frank would admit his feelings for Rand run deeper than he lets on...before the killer strikes again.</description>

  <description>Owen Rhys, the sin eater, has been shunned by the local villagers all his life--except for Andras Maddock, the local physician. In love with the one man he believes will never return that love, Owen is shocked when Andras saves him from death at the hands of a vampire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dagan, Dark Lord of the Underworld, vows to avenge his father’s death and obtain the Prince of Wales’s mystic sword from Andras. The claymore’s power holds an immunity the vampires have coveted for centuries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Star-crossed love, sorcery, and bloodlust collide on a vengeful path where only one side will remain victorious.</description>

  <description>After her parents die in a fire, Sophia Whitfield struggles to save her beloved home, Arbor Rose. The Civil War has devastated the South, and another blue coat has come to steal her meager possessions. Before the hated enemy inflicts his destruction, she shoots him. And soon discovers the soldier is Gavin, the champion of her childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gavin's dark secret lurks in Sophia’s future. When she discovers the truth, she's torn between a burning hunger for the man she truly loves and loyalty to Jesse, their childhood friend. The despicable acts of war have changed everything Sophia and Gavin once cherished. Yet somewhere deep in their hearts, the mystical Land of Falling Stars still exists.</description>

  <description>A lush and gorgeously written debut, packed with action, intrigue, and heart-racing romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexa Hollen is a fighter. Forced to disguise herself as a boy and serve in the king's army, Alex uses her quick wit and fierce sword-fighting skills to earn a spot on the elite prince's guard. But when a powerful sorcerer sneaks into the palace in the dead of night, even Alex, who is virtually unbeatable, can't prevent him from abducting her, her fellow guard and friend Rylan, and Prince Damian, taking them through the treacherous wilds of the jungle and deep into enemy territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The longer Alex is held captive with both Rylan and the prince, the more she realizes that she is not the only one who has been keeping dangerous secrets. And suddenly, after her own secret is revealed, Alex finds herself confronted with two men vying for her heart: the safe and steady Rylan, who has always cared for her, and the dark, intriguing Damian. With hidden foes lurking around every corner, is Alex strong enough to save herself and the kingdom she's sworn to protect?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The final installment in the “mesmerizing” (&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;, starred review) and addictive trilogy—find out who truly holds the key to Lanny’s heart and whether she’ll ever be reunited with her beloved in this gripping supernatural tale of magic, lust, and longing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanore McIlvrae has been on the run from Adair for hundreds of years, dismayed by his mysterious powers and afraid of his temper. She betrayed Adair’s trust and imprisoned him behind a stone wall to save Jonathan, the love of her life. When Adair was freed 200 years later, she was sure that he would find her and make her existence a living hell. But things turned out far different than she’d imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four years later, Lanore has tracked Adair to his mystical island home, where he has been living in self-imposed exile, to ask for a favor. She wants Adair to send her to the hereafter so she may beg the Queen of the Underworld to release Jonathan, whom she has been keeping as her consort. Will Lanore honor her promise to Adair to return? Or is her intention to reunite with Jonathan at any cost?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of all the forces of the universe, the most mysterious, confounding, and humbling is the power of love. The epic story of love and loss, magic and destiny that began with &lt;em&gt;The Taker&lt;/em&gt; and sparked a chase around the world in &lt;em&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/em&gt; comes to a surprising conclusion with &lt;em&gt;The Descent. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>After decades of running from her past, Lanore McIlvrae returns to America for the first time in 20 years to confront the source of her fear. The year is 1846 and Lanore—Lanny—has just landed in Baltimore after a long transatlantic crossing. That very night, she meets an “unattractive man with a high forehead and sunken eyes, and a tiny, pinched mouth like a parrot’s beak” who claims to write stories so dark and unsettling that he could be the Devil’s Scribe. His name? Edgar Allan Poe. Has Lanny finally met her match in this macabre man…or is it the other way around?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;SECOND IN ALMA KATSU&amp;amp;#8217;S GRIPPING SUPERNATURAL TRILOGY THAT BEGAN WITH &lt;em&gt;THE TAKER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanore McIlvrae is the kind of woman who will do anything for love. Including imprisoning the man who loves her behind a wall of brick and stone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She had no choice but to entomb Adair, her nemesis, to save Jonathan, the boy she grew up with in a remote Maine town in the early 1800s and the man she thought she would be with forever. But Adair had other plans for her. He used his mysterious, otherworldly powers to give her eternal life, but Lanore learned too late that there was a price for this gift: to spend eternity with him. And though he is handsome and charming, behind Adair&amp;amp;#8217;s seductive fa&amp;amp;#231;ade is the stuff of nightmares. He is a monster in the flesh, and he wants Lanore to love him for all of time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, two hundred years after imprisoning Adair, Lanore is trying to atone for her sins. She has given away the treasures she&amp;amp;#8217;s collected over her many lifetimes in order to purge her past and clear the way for a future with her new lover, Luke Findley. But, while viewing these items at an exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Lanore suddenly is aware that the thing she&amp;amp;#8217;s been dreading for two hundred years has caught up to her: Adair has escaped from his prison. He&amp;amp;#8217;s free&amp;amp;#8212; and he will come looking for her. And she has no idea how she will save herself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the stunningly imaginative storytelling and rich characterizations that fascinated readers worldwide and made &lt;em&gt;The Taker &lt;/em&gt;a singular and memorable literary debut and an international sensation, Alma Katsu once again delivers &amp;amp;#8220;a powerful evocation of the dark side of romantic love&amp;amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;) in her breathtaking new novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;True love can last an eternity . . . but immortality comes at a price. . . .&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the midnight shift at a hospital in rural Maine, Dr. Luke Findley is expecting another quiet evening of frostbite and the occasional domestic dispute. But the minute Lanore McIlvrae&amp;amp;#8212;Lanny&amp;amp;#8212;walks into his ER, she changes his life forever. A mysterious woman with a past and plenty of dark secrets, Lanny is unlike anyone Luke has ever met. He is inexplicably drawn to her . . . despite the fact that she is a murder suspect with a police escort. And as she begins to tell her story, a story of enduring love and consummate betrayal that transcends time and mortality, Luke finds himself utterly captivated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her impassioned account begins at the turn of the nineteenth century in the same small town of St. Andrew, Maine, back when it was a Puritan settlement. Consumed as a child by her love for the son of the town&amp;amp;#8217;s founder, Lanny will do anything to be with him forever. But the price she pays is steep&amp;amp;#8212;an immortal bond that chains her to a terrible fate for all eternity. And now, two centuries later, the key to her healing and her salvation lies with Dr. Luke Findley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part historical novel, part supernatural page-turner, &lt;em&gt;The Taker&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable tale about the power of unrequited love not only to elevate and sustain, but also to blind and ultimately destroy, and how each of us is responsible for finding our own path to redemption.</description>

  <description>The polar caps are melting, the oceans rise inches per day and the world is cooling.  Dragons rising from deep within the earth’s crust are melting the caps to return the planet to how the dragons need it to be.  Why we had not found them before was basic science; there were no skeletons to find just as the giant predator the great white shark has none to find, and we simply never drilled or mined volcanic regions; even the fire was just like the methane that every animal excretes, simply produced as ethanol like fermented corn, and the ignition nothing more than common bodily Potassium excreted from a gland in the mouth. There is no magic here as the world divides into those fighting to save mankind’s way of life, and those fighting with the dragons for the right to coexist.  Children would still die; that was a sad and terrible truth. Though in this new world with children as dragon riders, it would not be as they slept, by a missile or bomb, it would be doing for themselves what generations of adults had failed to do, fight for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best description would be A Game of Thrones set in our time; the main adult character wants to use the dragons to bring justice for all the bad things the politicians have done, but showing good people end up doing bad things too, hopefully the lesson is the dedication in the front of the book, there is never an excuse. Slowly shifting the series down to the children having to try and live and make a new world under the lessons of our current world. Not utopia, just honor and reason, and of course a truckload load of excitement and adventure with battles and dragon wars along the way, occasionally interrupted with humor by the loopy dragon Carus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only available on ebay at the moment, will never be on Amazon as they do not link to Australian Banks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Chi-Rise-Red-Dragon-/170920041551?pt=AU_Fiction_Books_2&amp;amp;hash=item27cba0dc4f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Chi-Rise-R...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>“The perfect post-Bond spy...Move over, Jason Bourne.” —&lt;em&gt;BookPage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Salim Dhar is the world's most wanted terrorist. After he narrowly failed to kill the U.S. president, the CIA is under pressure to hunt him down. Echelon, the West's intelligence analysis network, is in meltdown, monitoring all channels for the faintest trace of Dhar. But no one can find him. Only Daniel Marchant, renegade MI6 officer, knows where he is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marchant pursues Dhar up into the Atlas Mountains outside Marrakech, where he sees an unmarked military helicopter take off and head east. Is someone shielding Dhar to perpetrate an act of proxy terrorism on the West? Or is the CIA right when it claims to have killed him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To discover the truth, Marchant must be recruited by Moscow. It's a role that will require him to believe his late father was a traitor, an allegation that he fought long and hard to dispel. Now he must rekindle those rumors and confront dark truths about his own loyalties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Britain braces itself for an airborne terrorist attack, Marchant is about to discover that treachery is the greatest game of all.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>If she sink, she be no witch and shall be drowned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she float, she be a witch and must be hanged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meg Lytton has always known she is different—that she bears a dark and powerful gift. But in 1554 England, in service at Woodstock Palace to the banished Tudor princess Elizabeth, it has never been more dangerous to practise witchcraft. Meg knows she must guard her secret carefully from the many suspicious eyes watching over the princess and her companions. One wrong move could mean her life, and the life of Elizabeth, rightful heir to the English throne. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With witchfinder Marcus Dent determined to have Meg's hand in marriage, and Meg's own family conspiring against the English queen, there isn't a single person Meg can trust. Certainly not the enigmatic young Spanish priest Alejandro de Castillo, despite her undeniable feelings. But when all the world turns against her, Meg must open her heart to a dangerous choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Circle&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;The Other Boleyn Girl&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Witchstruck,&lt;/em&gt; the first book of the magical Tudor Witch trilogy.</description>

Inevitably, your lungs will burn, your body will fight with your brain to take that deep gasp of air. Survival instincts are just that---instincts.

  <description>Since the 1970s humans have forced supernaturals to live in caged cities. Silver brands embedded in their foreheads identify them by species: a full moon for Vampires, a crescent moon for Shifters, a pair of wings for Fairies, and the list goes on, for each supernatural species has been tagged and categorized by humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanore Vesta is marked with a silver X, the brand of Mixbreeds, second-class citizens shunned by society. She stays to herself, revealing her ability to create fire only during emergencies. All she wants to do is graduate college and stop having to steal to survive. But when she stumbles upon a murder in progress, she catches the attention of a supernatural killer. Now all she wants is to stop finding dead bodies in her apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enlisting help from her Were-cheetah ex-boyfriend MeShack and a new mysterious friend named Zulu, she is steered through the habitat’s raunchy nightlife. But their presence sometimes proves to be more burden than help, as they fight for her attention.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the corpses pile up, and the scent of blood fills the air, Lanore is left wondering: Will she find the psycho or die trying?</description>

  <description>There ARE creatures lurking in the dead of night... Seventeen year old Nikki and her twin brother, Nathan, move to the small town of Shore Lake to start over after their mother is brutally attacked. When a missing teenager washes up on shore during their first night at the cabin and there are whispers of vampires in Shore Lake, Nikki begins to realize that there are things roaming in the darkness that are far more sinister than what they left behind in the big city. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book contains some graphic language, violence, and mild sexual situations.</description>

  <description>In Tallenmere, fate has a way of catching up with you...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somewhere, hidden in the waters of the Southern Sea, lies an island unlike any other. Within the amber glow of its pyrogem-laden cliffs, legend says the very heart of the dragon god Drae keeps the island, and its occupants, alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loralee Munroviel, daughter of Leogard's High Priestess Arianne, had no idea what she would face when she arrived by boat ten years ago and was left alone in exile. All she knew about Draekoria's inhabitants was written in one tattered notebook. Now, her life revolves around keeping Drae's descendants happy. Never in her life did she imagine being a Dragon Keeper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captain Igrorio Everlyn, known as Sir Robert to his unit of Holy Paladins, has faced his share of hell, battling the evils of Emperor Sarvonn's tyranny and the dark god Tyr's abominations. But none of that compares to the ten years of hell he's been without Loralee, presumed dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One freak storm changes everything. Now the two of them must fight to reestablish the delicate balance of the island before the dragons take things into their own hands. Through it all, they discover the secrets that kept them, and their hearts, exiled for a decade.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;No one ever said love was easy...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serenya Crowe may be a half-elf commoner, but she's no ordinary woman. With the ability to interpret dreams, and a birth defect that forces her to wear gloves, she's endured gossip and the cruelty of her husband, Sebastian, The Earl of Summerwind. All she's ever wanted is to live a quiet life and raise a family. When she meets the new stranger in town, her world and her heart, are turned upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wood-elf Jayden Ravenwing is an ex-secret agent who wants nothing more than to forget matters of the heart. He left the bustle of Leogard and his failed marriage to make a fresh start in Summerwind. He never planned to fall in love again, especially with the enchanting Serenya Crowe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a strange portal opens on the Crowe property, Jayden is thrown into an investigation, knowing that if he fails, Serenya and everyone in the town may die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, he and Serenya must overcome an ancient evil, and their own inner demons, to save Summerwind and find the love they've always dreamed of.</description>

Yet, being forced to follow in her father's footsteps and being betrothed to a man she doesn't even like makes her want a taste of life outside the city walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a young boy, half-elf Galadin Trudeaux witnessed his parents' death at the hands of pirates. After being raised by those same murderers and forced to do their bidding, he escaped and now lives an honest life as a sea merchant and ranger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When two brutes at Leogard Harbor attempt to kidnap Caliphany while she dreams of faraway lands, Galadin comes to her rescue. Impressed by his skills, she asks him to train her as a ranger. Though he is hesitant at first to train a woman of her class, Caliphany's hefty sack of gold finally persuades him. Unfortunately, her father is not amused, and the two must escape before Caliphany faces a forced marriage and Galadin faces a noose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From that moment on, to the finale, where Caliphany must decide where her heart truly lies, she and Galadin embark on an adventure of a lifetime. Only if they can survive the trials ahead, will they find a love that stands the test of time.</description>

  <description>Colette Iselin is excited to go to Paris on a class trip. She’ll get to soak up the beauty and culture, and maybe even learn something about her family’s French roots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a series of gruesome murders are taking place across the city, putting everyone on edge. And as she tours museums and palaces, Colette keeps seeing a strange vision: a pale woman in a ball gown and powdered wig, who looks suspiciously like Marie Antoinette.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colette knows her popular, status-obsessed friends won’t believe her, so she seeks out the help of a charming French boy. Together, they uncover a shocking secret involving a dark, hidden history. When Colette realizes she herself may hold the key to the mystery, her own life is suddenly in danger . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acclaimed author Katie Alender brings heart-stopping suspense to this story of revenge, betrayal, intrigue — and one killer queen.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Let's be honest, nobody dives into a book by the name of <em>Marie Antoinette, Serial Killer</em> expecting a masterpiece. I didn't expect much, and I was let down anyway.</strong> Even for purely entertainment purposes, it still failed. The mystery is laughable, the character is a (Speshul) Mean Girl wannabe, and...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Rising star Cassie Mae introduces New Adult readers to a practical soon-to-be college freshman who &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to have everything—until a special guy shows her what she’s been missing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; In the wealthy town of Sundale, Kelli Pinkins has hatched the perfect plan to capitalize on her sweet reputation. For a generous fee, she will be every trust-fund baby’s dream: a Friday-night alibi, the “girlfriend” or “BFF” that parents dream about. With college approaching in the fall, Kelli’s services are in demand more than ever, which means that her social life is nonexistent. But Kelli is A-okay with that. She’s raking in cash for school. Besides, relationships are tricky, and sometimes very messy. She’d rather be at home on Xbox LIVE, anyway. Then the unexpected happens: She meets college stud Chase Maroney.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Chase isn’t like the preppy, privileged guys Kelli usually meets in Sundale. For starters, he’s twentysomething, always wears black., and he shoots back one-liners as fast as she can dish them out. But Kelli’s attempts to drive Chase away falter when she realizes that he treats her like he really &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; her, like he &lt;em&gt;cares &lt;/em&gt;about knowing her. When Kelli finally gives in to the delicious kiss she’s been fighting for so long, she faces a tough decision: make Chase a real-life boyfriend and risk her heart . . . or keep her clients and lose her first true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance praise for &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Alibi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Totally entertaining with as many swoon-worthy moments as hilarious ones, &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Alibi&lt;/em&gt; is a must-read.”—Jolene Perry, co-author of&lt;em&gt; Out of Play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; “A fun, funny, and fantastic story, this is one you will read in a day, and pick up to re-read again the next.”—Kelley Lynn, author of&lt;em&gt; Fraction of Stone&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Ihmiskunnan rippeet elävät valtavassa maanalaisessa siilossa. Maailma on saastunut elinkelvottomaksi ja ulkoilma on myrkyllistä hengittää. Ihmiset elävät siilossa ankarien sääntöjen ja rajoitusten armoilla. Mutta jotkut uskaltavat kyseenalaistaa vallitsevan järjestyksen ja unelmoida. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yksi heistä on Jules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hän on valmis paljastamaan siilon salaisuudet.</description>

  <description>This Omnibus Edition collects the five Wool books into a single volume. It is for those who arrived late to the party and who wish to save a dollar or two while picking up the same stories in a single package.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first Wool story was released as a standalone short in July of 2011. Due to reviewer demand, the rest of the story was released over the next six months. My thanks go out to those reviewers who clamored for more. Without you, none of this would exist. Your demand created this as much as I did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.</description>

  <description>When the world ends, can love survive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Scarlet, raising her two daughters alone makes fighting for tomorrow an everyday battle. Nathan has a wife, but can’t remember what it’s like to be in love; only his young daughter Zoe makes coming home worthwhile. Miranda’s biggest concern is whether her new VW Bug is big enough to carry her sister and their boyfriends on a weekend escape from college finals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When reports of a widespread, deadly “outbreak” begin to surface, these ordinary people face extraordinary circumstances and suddenly their fates are intertwined. Recognizing they can’t outrun the danger, Scarlet, Nathan, and Miranda desperately seek shelter at the same secluded ranch, Red Hill. Emotions run high while old and new relationships are tested in the face of a terrifying enemy—an enemy who no longer remembers what it’s like to be human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set against the backdrop of a brilliantly realized apocalyptic world, love somehow finds a way to survive. But what happens when the one you’d die for becomes the one who could destroy you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Red Hill grabs you from page one and doesn’t let go until its stunning conclusion. This is #1 New York Times bestselling author Jamie McGuire at her unforgettable best.</description>

  <description>They won't stay dead!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The zombies can't be stopped. From the pitch-black holds of pirate ships and the tunnels beneath the steaming, war-torn jungles of Vietnam, they rise up. And there's no way to slow their shambling march of conquest, no corner of the world or period in history that's safe from the invasion. Secret government labs, the trendy galleries of New York's art scene, and the drawing rooms of nineteenth century England all become the lair of the living dead in this inventive and chilling collection of horror and dark fantasy fiction.</description>

  <description>Ibexian is an independent quarterly magazine based in New York City that publishes short fiction within the horror genre. Our purpose is to provide a platform for unpublished or emerging writers whose stories are overlooked by the mainstream. We primarily exhibit standalone pieces, but occasionally we may also feature excerpts from larger works.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;L.A. Knows You're Coming to Town&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Robert, a 30-something independent filmmaker in Los Angeles, is hearing voices in his head. Alice Hershlug, a Jewish movie star who recently won the Academy Award, is slowly torturing him via The Grapevine, a kind of mental telephone. Hoovey Weinerschniztel, a movie producer in New York City, is in love with his plastic telephone and blasé about his recent rape and imprisonment in his office closet of one of his former employees. The novel appears to be an Anti-Semitic rant, written by a lonely Jew who has apparently been accused of being a child molester. It cuts rapidly back and forth between the narrator’s vitriolic prose poems which accuse American Jews and other plutocrats of ruining the country, the trials and tribulations of Robert as he navigates Hollywood and the mental health system, and the machinations of several Hollywood insiders as they stab each other in the back to rise to the top. The island of Manhattan turns into a sailing ship and blasts through the strait of Gibraltar on the way to visit Jerusalem, a psychiatric treatment facility gets possessed by some kind of evil demon named Cheeto, and Hoovey Weinerschnitzel abandons his religion to found an evil cult. Part political diatribe, part philosophical essay, part picaresque, the novel explores the implications of the new post-2008 U.S. economy on the human psyche, relations between Jew and Gentile, between American and Israeli Jews, between thought and reality, and tries to figure out where the hell America can go next.</description>

  <description>Dan Shepherd is used to putting his life on the line. Working for an elite undercover squad, he’s lied, cheated, and conned in order to bring Britain’s most wanted criminals to justice. But when a powerful drug lord starts to kill off witnesses to his crimes, Shepherd has no choice but to go undercover in a high-security prison—a world where one wrong move will mean certain death. As Shepherd gambles everything to move in on his quarry, he soon realizes that the man he’s hunting is far more dangerous than the police realize—and that he’s capable of striking outside the prison walls and hitting Shepherd where it hurts most.</description>

  <description>In Selenoth, the race of Man is on the ascendant. The ancient dragons sleep, the evil Witchkings are no more, their evil power destroyed by the courage of Men and the fearsome magic of the Elves. The dwarves have retreated to the kingdoms of the Underdeep, the trolls hide in their mountains, and even the most savage orc tribes have learned to dread the iron discipline of the mighty Amorran legions. But after four hundred years of mutual suspicion, the rivalry between two of the noble Houses Martial that rule the Senate and People threatens to turn violent, even as unrest sparks rebellion throughout the imperial provinces. In the north, the barbarian reavers who have long plagued the coasts of the White Sea sue for peace and beg for royal protection from the King of Savondir, fleeing a mysterious race of ravenous wolf-demons. In the east, there are wars and rumors of war as orcs and goblins gather together in unprecedented numbers, summoned by their dreadful gods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the Most Holy and Sanctified Father is found dead in his bed, leaving the Ivory Throne of the Four Apostles unclaimed, the temptation to seize the Sacred College and wield Holy Mother Church as a weapon is more than some fallen souls can resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is currently on pre-order, and will be available in December 2012.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Maddie Dunn needs to learn how to use her special abilities before somebody else gets hurt. Ganzfield is a secret training facility full of people like her, but it's not exactly a nurturing place.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every social interaction carries the threat of mind-control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stray thought can burn a building to the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And people's nightmares don't always stay in their own heads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's still better than New Jersey,&lt;br&gt;especially once she meets the man of her dreams…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first three books of the Ganzfield series are in a single volume.</description>

  <description>When seventeen-year-old Samantha Matheson finds herself in the most secure prison ever—five miles under the ocean—she must choose between joining her captors’ foreign world and any hope of returning to her former life. Only her love for the mermaid prince, Adrian, could even make her pause for a millisecond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first Sam can only think of returning to her family. She refuses to fulfill her destiny as the prince’s one true love, the only one who can carry on Triton’s line and its power. As she gets to know Adrian, she learns that all is not peaceful in the mermaid world; an evil group created by Hades and ruled by Habean, known as the Sharks, threatens the safety of the mermaids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows that, if she makes the change to become a mermaid and marry Adrian, she will never be able to return home. Her eyes will turn completely black, like Adrian’s, in order to see underwater. She will feel cold and damp to humans, and she will not be able to survive more than five days on dry land. Will love and responsibility outweigh a future exiled from her home? This is the choice Sam must make.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The demon is a mob, and the mob is demonic. The Democratic Party activates mobs, depends on mobs, coddles mobs, publicizes and celebrates mobs—it is the mob. Sweeping in its scope and relentless in its argument, &lt;em&gt;Demonic &lt;/em&gt;explains the peculiarities of liberals as standard groupthink behavior. To understand mobs is to understand liberals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; In her most provocative book to date, Ann Coulter argues that liberals exhibit all the psychological characteristics of a mob, for instance:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Groupthink: &lt;/strong&gt;“The same mob mentality that leads otherwise law-abiding people to hurl rocks at cops also leads otherwise intelligent people to refuse to believe anything they haven’t heard on NPR.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Schemes: &lt;/strong&gt;“No matter how mad the plan is—Fraternité, the ‘New Soviet Man,’ the Master Race, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, Building a New Society, ObamaCare—a mob will believe it.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Enemies: &lt;/strong&gt;“Instead of ‘counterrevolutionaries,’ liberals’ opponents are called ‘haters,’ ‘those who seek to divide us,’ ‘tea baggers,’ and ‘right-wing hate groups.’ Meanwhile, conservatives call liberals ‘liberals’—and that makes them testy.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Justice: &lt;/strong&gt;“In the world of the liberal, as in the world of Robespierre, there are no crimes, only criminals.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liberal Violence: &lt;/strong&gt;“If Charles Manson’s followers hadn’t killed Roman Polanski’s wife, Sharon Tate, Clinton would have pardoned him, too, and he’d probably be teaching at Northwestern University.”&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Citing the father of mob psychology, Gustave Le Bon, Coulter catalogs the Left’s mob behaviors: the creation of messiahs, the fear of scientific innovation, the mythmaking, the preference for images over words, the lack of morals, and the casual embrace of contradictory ideas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Coulter traces the history of the liberal mob to the French Revolution and Robespierre’s revolutionaries (delineating a clear distinction from America’s founding fathers), who simply proclaimed that they were exercising the “general will” before slaughtering their fellow citizens “for the good of mankind.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Similarly, as Coulter demonstrates, liberal mobs, from student radicals to white-trash racists to anti-war and pro-ObamaCare fanatics today, have consistently used violence to implement their idea of the “general will.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is not the American tradition; it is the tradition of Stalin, of Hitler, of the guillotine—and the tradition of the American Left. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As the heirs of the French Revolution, Democrats have a history that consists of pandering to mobs, time and again, while Republicans, heirs to the American Revolution, have regularly stood for peaceable order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hoping to muddy this horrifying truth, liberals slanderously accuse conservatives of their own crimes—assassination plots, conspiracy theorizing, political violence, embrace of the Ku Klux Klan. Coulter shows that the truth is the opposite: Political violence—mob violence—is always a Democratic affair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surveying two centuries of mob movements, Coulter demonstrates that the mob is always destructive. And yet, she argues, beginning with the civil rights movement in the sixties, Americans have lost their natural, inherited aversion to mobs. Indeed, most Americans have no idea what they are even dealing with. &lt;br&gt;             &lt;br&gt;Only by recognizing the mobs and their demonic nature can America begin to defend itself. </description>

  <description>“Liberals seem to have hit upon a reverse Christ story as their belief system. He suffered and died for our sins; liberals make the rest of us suffer for sins we didn’t commit.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who are the victims here? To hear liberals tell it, you’d think they do nothing but suffer at the hands of ruthless entities like the “Republican Attack Machine” and Fox News.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s just another instance of the Big Lie, of course, told so often that some people have actually started to believe it. In &lt;em&gt;Guilty&lt;/em&gt;, Ann Coulter explodes this myth to reveal that when it comes to bullying, no one outdoes the Left. Citing case after case, ranging from the hilariously absurd to the shockingly vicious, Coulter dissects these so-called victims who are invariably the oppressors. For instance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•Single mothers: Getting pregnant isn’t like catching the flu. There are volitional acts involved–someone else explain it to Dennis Kucinich. By this purposeful act, single mothers cause irreparable harm to other human beings–their own children–as countless studies on the subject make clear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•The myth of the Republican Attack Machine: The most amazing thing liberals have done is create the myth of a compliant right-wing media with Republicans badgering baffled reporters into attacking Democrats. It’s so mad, it’s brilliant. It’s one kind of lie to say the Holocaust occurred when the Swedes killed the Jews. But it’s another kind of lie entirely to say the Holocaust occurred when the Jews killed the Nazis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•“Brave” liberals: In addition to being beautiful, compassionate tribunes of the downtrodden, liberals are brave. I know that because they’re always telling me how brave they are. Why, five nights a week, MSNBC’s Keith Olbermann courageously books guests who completely agree with him. It doesn’t get much braver than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•Obambi’s luck: While B. Hussein Obama piously condemned attacks on candidates’ ­families, his media and campaign surrogates ripped open the court-sealed divorce records of his two principal opponents in his Senate race in Illinois.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•The offenders are offended!: Republican senator George Allen’s career was destroyed when he made a joking remark to a privileged Indian American harassing him at campaign stops. When did rich kids become a new protected category that must be shielded from words that are insulting in other languages? How did Sidarth become a specially anointed victim? What did we ever do to India? And why didn’t we ever hear about the far more offensive anti-Semitic flyers of Allen’s opponent Jim Webb?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One essential and recurring truth about self-righteous liberals, says Coulter, is that “they viciously attack all while wailing that they are the true victims.” With &lt;em&gt;Guilty&lt;/em&gt;–a mordantly witty and shockingly specific catalog of offenses that liberals would rather we ignore and forget–Ann Coulter presents exhibits A through Z.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The hottest and most controversial book of the year! Find out who really controls the media in America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“[Ann Coulter] is never in doubt. And that, along with her bright writing, sense of irony and outrage, and her relish at finally hitting back at political opponents (especially in the media) is what makes &lt;strong&gt;Slander&lt;/strong&gt; such refreshing and provocative reading.”&lt;br&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;“[Ann Coulter] is a fluent polemicist with a gift for Menckenesque invective . . . and she can harness such language to subtle, syllogistic argument.”&lt;br&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Washington Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The most popular nonfiction book in America.”—&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The real value of &lt;strong&gt;Slander&lt;/strong&gt; . . . is not in the jokes or devastating exposés of liberal politicians and their allies, but the serious and scholarly study of just how entrenched the media prejudice is against anyone whose politics are even faintly conservative.”&lt;br&gt;—&lt;em&gt;New York Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Written with a great deal of passion . . . the real source of its strength—and its usefulness—was its painstaking marshalling of evidence . . . More important than [&lt;strong&gt;High Crimes and Misdemeanors&lt;/strong&gt;] because it addresses a much broader issue, and one of lasting significance.”—&lt;em&gt;National Review&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>“Liberals’ loyalty to the United States is off-limits as a subject of political debate. Why is the relative patriotism of the two parties the only issue that is out of bounds for rational discussion?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a stunning follow-up to her number one bestseller &lt;strong&gt;Slander&lt;/strong&gt;, leading conservative pundit Ann Coulter contends that liberals have been wrong on every foreign policy issue, from the fight against Communism at home and abroad, the Nixon and the Clinton presidencies, and the struggle with the Soviet empire right up to today’s war on terrorism. “Liberals have a preternatural gift for always striking a position on the side of treason,” says Coulter. “Everyone says liberals love America, too. No, they don’t.” From Truman to Kennedy to Carter to Clinton, America has contained, appeased, and retreated, often sacrificing America’s best interests and security. With the fate of the world in the balance, liberals should leave the defense of the nation to conservatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reexamining the sixty-year history of the Cold War and beyond—including the career of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Whittaker Chambers–Alger Hiss affair, Ronald Reagan’s challenge to Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall,” the Gulf War, and our present war on terrorism—Coulter reveals how liberals have been horribly wrong in all their political analyses and policy prescriptions. McCarthy, exonerated by the Venona Papers if not before, was basically right about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government. Hiss turned out to be a high-ranking Soviet spy (who consulted Roosevelt at Yalta). Reagan, ridiculed throughout his presidency, ended up winning the Cold War. And George W. Bush, also an object of ridicule, has performed exceptionally in responding to America’s newest threats at home and abroad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coulter, who in&lt;strong&gt; Slander&lt;/strong&gt; exposed a liberal bias in today’s media, also examines how history, especially in the latter half of the twentieth century, has been written by liberals and, therefore, distorted by their perspective. Far from being irrelevant today, her clearheaded and piercing view of what we’ve been through informs us perfectly for challenges today and in the future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;Slander&lt;/strong&gt;, Ann Coulter became the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual of the year. &lt;strong&gt;Treason&lt;/strong&gt;, in many ways an even more controversial and prescient book, will ignite impassioned political debate at one of the most crucial moments in our history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Welcome to the world of Ann Coulter. With her monumental bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Treason&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Slander&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;High Crimes and Misdemeanors&lt;/em&gt;, Coulter has become the most recognized and talked-about conservative intellectual in years—and certainly the most controversial. Now, in &lt;em&gt;How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)&lt;/em&gt;, which is sure to ignite impassioned debate, she offers her most comprehensive analysis of the American political scene to date. With incisive reasoning, refreshing candor, and razor-sharp wit, she reveals just why liberals have got it so wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this powerful and entertaining book, which draws on her weekly columns, Coulter ranges far and wide. No subject is off-limits, and no comment is left unsaid. After all, she writes, “Nothing too extreme can be said about liberals because it’s all true.” &lt;em&gt;How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)&lt;/em&gt; offers Coulter’s unvarnished take on: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•The essence of being a liberal: “The absolute conviction that there is one set of rules for you, and another, completely different set of rules for everyone else.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•John Kerry: “A reporter asked Kerry, ‘Are you for or against gay marriage?’ As usual, his answer was, ‘Yes.’ ”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•Her 9/11 comments: “I am often asked if I still think we should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity. The answer is: Now more than ever!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•The state of the Democratic Party: “Teddy Kennedy crawls out of Boston Harbor with a quart of Scotch in one pocket and a pair of pantyhose in the other, and Democrats hail him as their party’s spiritual leader.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•Her philosophy for arguing with liberals: “Tough love, except I don’t love them. My ‘tough love’ approach is much like the Democrats’ ‘middle-class tax cuts’—everything but the last word.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•The “Treason Lobby”: “Want to make liberals angry? Defend the United States.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this full-on Coulterpalooza, you’ll find the real, uncensored Ann Coulter. A special concluding chapter even includes the pieces that squeamish editors refused to publish—“what you could have read if you lived in a free country,” says Coulter. &lt;em&gt;How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)&lt;/em&gt; is a stunning reminder of why Ann Coulter’s commentary has achieved must-read status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A fluent polemicist with a gift for Menckenesque invective...and she can harness such language to subtle, syllogistic argument.”--&lt;em&gt;Washington Post Book World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ann Coulter is a trailblazer.”--&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“She can zing one-liners faster than Zeus can throw lightning bolts.”--&lt;em&gt;Kansas City Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You know those pundits who bore you to tears trying to balance everyone’s point of view? Coulter isn’t one.”--&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A great deal of research supports Ms. Coulter’s wisecracks.”--&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The conservative movement has found its diva.”--Bill Maher&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ann Coulter is a pundit extraordinaire.”--Rush Limbaugh&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also available as a Random House AudioBook and as an e-Book</description>

  <description>"If a martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation's official state religion, he would have to conclude it is liberalism, while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law. &lt;br&gt;Many Americans are outraged by liberal hostility to traditional religion. But as Ann Coulter reveals in this, her most explosive book yet, to focus solely on the Left's attacks on our Judeo-Christian tradition is to miss a larger point: liberalism "is" a religion--a godless one. &lt;br&gt;And it is now entrenched as the state religion of this county. &lt;br&gt;Though liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, it bears all the attributes of a religion. In "Godless," Coulter throws open the doors of the Church of Liberalism, showing us its sacraments (abortion), its holy writ ("Roe v. Wade"), its martyrs (from Soviet spy Alger Hiss to cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal), its clergy (public school teachers), its churches (government schools, where prayer is prohibited but condoms are free), its doctrine of infallibility (as manifest in the "absolute moral authority" of spokesmen from Cindy Sheehan to Max Cleland), and its cosmology (in which mankind is an inconsequential accident). &lt;br&gt;Then, of course, there's the liberal creation myth: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. &lt;br&gt;For liberals, evolution is the touchstone that separates the enlightened from the benighted. But Coulter neatly reverses the pretense that liberals are rationalists guided by the ideals of free inquiry and the scientific method. She exposes the essential truth about Darwinian evolution that liberals refuse to confront: "it is bogus science." &lt;br&gt;Writing with a keen appreciation for genuine science, Coulter reveals that the so-called gaps in the theory of evolution are all there is--Darwinism is nothing but a gap. After 150 years of dedicated searching into the fossil record, evolution's proponents have failed utterly to substantiate its claims. And a long line of supposed evidence, from the infamous Piltdown Man to the "evolving" peppered moths of England, has been exposed as hoaxes. Still, liberals treat those who question evolution as religious heretics and prohibit students from hearing about real science when it contradicts Darwinism. And these are the people who say they want to keep faith out of the classroom? &lt;br&gt;Liberals' absolute devotion to Darwinism, Coulter shows, has nothing to do with evolution's scientific validity and everything to do with its refusal to admit the possibility of God as a guiding force. They will brook no challenges to the official religion. &lt;br&gt;Fearlessly confronting the high priests of the Church of Liberalism and ringing with Coulter's razor-sharp wit, "Godless" is the most important and riveting book yet from one of today's most lively and impassioned conservative voices. "Liberals love to boast that they are not 'religious, ' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as 'religion.'" --From Godless</description>

  <description>Los Angeles, 2012. It’s been five years since the events of the Mortal Instruments when Nephilim stood poised on the brink of oblivion and Shadowhunter Emma Carstairs lost her parents. After the blood and violence she witnessed as a child, Emma has dedicated her life to the eradication of demons and being the best, fastest and deadliest Shadowhunter since Jace Lightwood. Raised in the Los Angeles Institute, Emma is paired as a parabatai with her best friend, Julian. As Emma hunts those who caused the death of her parents, the trail they’re following leads back to those they’ve always been taught to trust. At the same time, Emma is falling in love with Julian — her closest friend and, because he is her parabatai, the one person in the world she’s absolutely forbidden by Shadowhunter Law to love. Set against the glittering backdrop of present-day Los Angeles, Emma must learn to trust her head and her heart as she investigates a demonic plot that stretches from the warlock-run nightclubs of the Sunset Strip to the enchanted sea that pounds the beaches of Santa Monica.</description>

  <description>This suspenseful debut follows a group of teenage misfits in their delicious quest for revenge on those who have wronged them at their high school. When a mysterious note appears in Charlotte’s mailbox inviting her to join the League of Strays, she’s hopeful it will lead to making friends. What she discovers is a motley crew of loners and an alluring, manipulative ringleader named Kade. Kade convinces the group that they need one another both for friendship and to get back at the classmates and teachers who have betrayed them. But Kade has a bigger agenda. In addition to vandalizing their school and causing fights between other students, Kade’s real intention is a dangerous plot that will threaten lives and force Charlotte to choose between her loyalty to the League and her own conscience.</description>

  <description>Their love could destroy them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the ages, Marked Ones have harnessed the powers of the four elements: Water, Fire, Earth, and Air. Much about the elements is shrouded in mystery, but one thing is certain: A relationship between two Marked Ones has the potential to cause widespread devastation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Megan and Adam—Air and Water—are determined to defy the risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the power that swirls inside Megan is growing in twisted ways. And the closer she is to Adam, the closer Megan comes to unleashing a dark force that could spell destruction for the entire Marked line.</description>

  <description>This book is about what happens to a man and his family after he catches a pedophile serial killer.&lt;br&gt;_______&lt;br&gt;Son Of Adam, takes us on the thrill ride exposing the monster lurking inside each of us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cal, a black, rough tempered, hard-nosed automotive engineer driving his way around life’s twisting race-track until the second Gulf War places him on a collision course with a pedophile serial killer in a distant war-torn land. Lives changed forever in an instant of horror.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen girls missing and seventeen weeping mothers with no hope of rescue confuse the soldier’s motives and missions. A small, foreign village with a fledgling infrastructure barely able to support traffic stops was a pedophiles playground. The shadows of war and the prowling despot have free reign over the frightened village families until the killer gets sloppy, exposing his bloodstained trail. All the gory pieces fall together and the Army platoon moves in for the arrest. Mission accomplished for all, except for the soldier that found him – the one who had to search the killer’s bedroom and catalog all of his bloody souvenirs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back home and years later, the demons of that horrible day are still lurking in the darkness, pushing him from odd job to odd job around the country, spiraling an out of control life but weaving it back together with help from some unlikely outsiders – just like him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The suspenseful story winds its way from the foothills of the Alps to the foothills of the Appalachians as a new journey begins. With twists and turns along the way, finishing in the unwanted answer to an age old question. A life redeemed in the midst of disgraceful mistakes and youth’s tiresome baggage, bringing him back to the tender answer to a divisive social issue: How can anyone be Pro-Life and Pro-Death Penalty?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From first homes to the German Oktoberfest and jumbo jet rides across the Atlantic Ocean to automotive assembly plants in the new south, Son Of Adam, exposes the inner workings of the fall-out from the heinous crimes and bloody investigation, pieced by painful piece.</description>

  <description>A compilation of blogs written by historical fiction author Sharon Desruisseaux. Though her other novels might be more on the serious side, this book is filled with her whimsical adventures of moving from busy Southeastern Massachusetts to the wilderness of Maine with her daughters. There is some sad and heart wrenching blogs mixed in just for the variety that her life seems to be. The blogs are of how a suburban Mom learned how to be a farmer in the mountains and how she began to make her dream of becoming a novelist a reality. In this collection of blogs are her struggles, interpretations of the cultural differences she moved to and how she learned to overcome obstacles that seemed to have constantly been thrown in her path. You laugh; you cry and wonder why....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A very silly outlook on life in Maine from a Flatlander's perspective. Check out her author site at sharondnovels.com/ for more blogs and updated information on her writing. Or join on as a fan at her Goodreads site and definitely check out her farm site at mymainesheep.webs.com/ You can also find her on Twitter at smbrooksi and Facebook under sharondnovels.</description>

  <description>Cleopatra Selene was born to a world of plenty, where all of her wishes were granted. She was a princess of an ancient and powerful family of Egypt. Her own mother was a pharaoh, what else could a girl want more than that. Her whole life was planned out and sung to her by her own mother who cherished her in her loving embrace. Suddenly it was all ripped away, leaving Cleopatra Selene and her siblings stunned and frightened. Their mother was killed by the venomous Octavian; their father had fallen in honor on his own sword in battle, their older brothers rumored to have been killed as well. In shackles they were thrown aboard a ship headed straight to Rome into the house of their own father's other wife....His lesser, Roman wife named Octavia, who happened to also be the sister of their mother's killer! Their lives once happy and predetermined were now one huge nightmare and they were all helpless and now the property of Rome...Cleopatra Selene became one of Rome's valuable pawns in a marriage arranged by Octavian. She vowed that she was never be helpless again and fought her whole life to make sure she had some control in a world that listened only to Rome. She would learn how to be strong and how creatively to protect herself and her own children. Cleopatra Selene was only one of several children of the legendary Cleopatra VII and Mark Antonius of Rome. There was her twin brother, Alexander Helios-the sun and her younger siblings Arsinoe and Ptolemy. Ripped from each other and forced to make their own way in a land conquered by their enemy Octavian. The very same Octavian, who later became the first emperor of Rome later called Augustus, yet he was just a man and he had dreams. He had visions of Rome in stone and of a land of plenty stretching to the four corners of the known world. His sister, Octavia, he honored to care for the children of his now conquered enemy Cleopatra VII. Her duty was to prepare the conquered and terrified children and to make them a part of his Roman family to realize further his plans. Octavia’s daughters Antonia Minor and Major were not only hers but those of her marriage with her adulterous husband Marcus Antonius. Of them, Antonia Minor befriends Cleopatra Selene and together they form a bond that surpasses all of the boundaries of Rome. Then there is Juba II, a son of a conquered King of Numidia who was captured and raised in Rome since the age of three. In Rome, Juba II found a home and it suited him well. He fast became a scholar and clung to making discoveries and in chronicling it for the world to see of all he found in his journeys. He married Cleopatra Selene and together they brought Numidia to its former glory, until it was ripped away by rebels. Then, they pick up the pieces and move to Mauretania where they build again. For their children they would travel and endure anything and though they grew to love Rome, they were cautious and thus, they looked far away to the land of Gaul and the Keltoi to find a future and peace from the ever-grasping clutches of Rome that sought to swallow them whole. In this novel, the author cleverly blends the cultures of Egypt, Rome, Numidia, Mauretania, and the lands of the Celts to the north in incredible fact and fable. Incredibly well researched the author values the sources in which her history was found. She weighed it all and gleaned from it a fair and honorable depiction of Cleopatra VII and all she had done and accomplished, despite the garnishments of the men of Rome who only sought to dethrone any woman in power.</description>

  <description>Sophia and her daughters make a bold move from the suburbs of Boston to the wilderness of Maine. They leave all they know behind on a quest for tranquility. The house they move into was built in 1787 and with a yard bigger than any neighborhood they have ever lived in prior. However, things begin to test their endurance with the history of the house coming alive before their very eyes. Odd things occur all around them and bring their reality to question. In living in an historical house, there is a lot to consider with all presented that goes way beyond the mere age of the structure. There are forces and a history that might just question all you are familiar with in bringing live before you a window into another realm. Things are not where placed before, voices of those long past beckon your notice, and even the thin veil up for so long, begins to weaken and introduce one to a realm not meant to collide with the current time. &lt;br&gt;Sophia and her children knew normal in all sense of the word, yet needed peace from all that surrounded them. Sophia worked hard to make her dream of being a writer tangible and in a way to better support her children. With their new house, they realized a life only read about with a huge antique house and endless acres to roam about and to have the farm they always cherished in their hearts. In leaving all familiar for a new life, it is a huge risk, but to have to deal with things beyond the normal comprehension, things tend to be a bit more challenging. Sophia struggles to give her children a life she never had, away from the chaos of an area spilling over from its abundant population. In their new home in Chester Village, they breathe in the fresh air of the country as never before thought possible. Yet, with all entailed and brought new to their lives a force perniciously creeps in to introduce itself to the young family, as they had never thought possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would this woman be allowed her dream, or would something maleficent take that away? Not all on the paranormal plane is sinister, for there are those forces who want resolution and for the wickedness to leave as those living on the adjacent material plane do. In being a writer, Sophia used her talents to research the history of the house in Chester Village to find the underlying cause of the odd occurrences that have broken free fomenting the once dormant diabolical entities that seek to stop all of her efforts. Yet, she knows that knowledge is paramount to solving any issue and what she learns about the history of her dream house is something that she is bound to use on her mission for tranquility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tale is about all Sophia is determined to gain for her children and the challenges along the way. It is one thing to have a quest to reach a goal, and quite the other, for a goal to be constantly blocked by forces beyond the tangible realm surrounding. She holds on dear to all she knows with all she has in assiduous fortitude to fight for the serenity she so desperately yearns for.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you who want to read a typical ghost story, there are tons out there. For those of you who want a ghost story vividly painted before you in classic format with prodigious detail, this is the tale for you. This is a story of a woman determined to conquer the maniacal forces that have entered her life material and paranormal. She moves to a land protected by the Abenaki tribe of long before the initial settlers ever stepped foot in the vast wilderness surrounding. This tale also brings to light; the tales of those who stayed behind long after their remains have turned to dust. Can two worlds reside in unison and peace? This is the question one must consider when delving into this eloquently rendered tale as it piques issues inherently bold and not often defined in this modern era.</description>

  <description>Imagine your life's purpose predetermined before you were even born? Before Au Set was born her mother had planned all she was to be. As the first born of an ancient legacy in a land called Eshnunna her life was all designed theologically before she was even born as the oldest daughter of a Goddess Representative of the temple for Inanna named Ninnuit. She was born to a land older than Babylon and even older than Sumer. The first in line to an ancient destiny older than recorded history. However, the world had something different planned. As a tribe of men came down with a vengeance to destroy all of the Goddess cults and all those involved, Au Set and her family knew their numbers alone would not assure their survival. To keep their world and legacy alive her mother Ninnuit had to think fast to save them all. What she came up would not only save their family and their traditions but to line her family up in the creation of a culture that would shake the world-that of a land far to the south. A land of a long and endless river that provided life inside a vast desert. Au Set and her siblings were sent to create a new dynasty in hopes of preserving her family legacy. They went to a land called Kemet. And there, Au Set and her siblings would learn to fight to protect all they have ever known and cherished and to forge creatively something new and possibly more powerful than ever their heritage had ever been. Her siblings became as legendary as she in the pages of history for they created what we know of Egypt and its mystery of a culture that lasted almost untouched for over three thousand years. She and her twin sister Neb Het (Nepthys) each took half of the strange and raw land of Kemet to rule over with their brothers Set (Suti) and Au Sar (Osiris). They had to leave their impact over a dying ancient tradition that they arrived to while still very young and afraid from all they left behind. They saw a rough world of ritual and religious cannibalism and animal worship. Together they conquered the first and built on the second and made it their own as temple and tomb paintings had been found of such. Their brother Tehuti (Thoth) founded writing and Au Sar brought Kemet agriculture and many more things were brought to light to this land untouched that would last millenniums after. The children of a lost culture alone in a vast wilderness striving to survive and to start something the world would never forget-Egypt. Revised November 2012</description>

  <description>Imagine leaving all you know behind for good to head for a land so far away and different that it is beyond your wildest dreams? That is what the Hebert family did. In fact, they had a very profitable business in running an apothecary in downtown Paris and all was perfect. That is for anyone else, but them. Yet their dreams pushed and drove them to run for the unfathomable new world so far across the ocean. In those days, Canada was a vast wilderness filled with mystery and promise .Untouched and raw. Anything could happen. Louis Hebert went ahead to the new world to see what it was all about and in hopes of bringing his family there to settle. His wife Marie, however, was not to be undone for though she was safe in Paris in the beginning of it all; she was acquiring skills of her own to survive and prepare for making their dreams a reality. She learned the skills necessary to survive in the rough and open terrain of New France with no possibility of help. Marie was raised as the daughter of a wealthy merchant and her husband was a successful apothecary-would she learn those new skills required for a family to survive alone so far from any aid? Then, what about actually getting there? It was so far away and almost inaccessible. Follow Louis Hebert as he learned to navigate the politics of the era. France was more than eager to jump aboard to settle in the New World, yet they had plans of their own. They wanted all they could gain in profits from there and the fur trade was just showing its promise. King Henry IV was more than willing to have his people settle in the infinite terrain overseas, yet not too thrilled about funding them. He had his eye on the profit and thus the fur monopolies were started. Once they were underway, the wars began for full control over territory in the New World. Then there was the land battle...Enter Samuel Champlain, a young navigator and cartographer who inquisitively had his eyes on finding a route to the Orient where he could see in his dreams of wealth and riches - cities populated by the French along the way. Yet, the land drew him and roped him in. Trip after trip from France to Arcadie-the land he sought to claim for France, the land found his heart warming even more with each trip he made. Will he find his trade route? Well, history tells us that answer of course. In addition, there was Jean Poutrincourt, a nobleman from a daunting lineage. This was a man who saw hope and glory. He was the younger son and had luckily inherited his fair share of his family's estate, yet it was not enough. He wanted more. He saw in his dreams at night a huge Chateau on rolling hills and his descendants growing fat off the food of the land. He spent every penny he owned and from his wife's dowry in doing all he could with each cell of his aging body to make his dreams come true. With his wit and charm, it almost seemed possible, yet; again, there was the politics of the era. Road block after roadblock and with the will of all-somehow they managed to take that first terrifying step in a land so very far away from all they had even known. Such bravery and determination is noted well by the author in this epic tale of such remarkable and profound people.

  <description>In his elegant, lucid and moving biography David Gilmour used his access to Lampedusa's unpublished notes and papers to trace the process by which Lampedusa came to an understanding of his own history and transformed that understanding into one of the most admired novels of his century.</description>

  <description>In his first two novels David Gilmour took a candid look at romantic and carnal love.  With this newest work he makes a surprising departure and turns his attention to a different kind of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"He was a bad dog that needed killing."  That's how the grisly death of Pascal Charleville was described to police after a weekend visit at the country estate of Harrow Winncup took a nasty turn.  Few people were surprised: Harrow had been courting tragedy for years.  He was a bright, beautiful boy with a penchant for strong booze and drugs; he also had the unfortunate fate of being the only son to a very wicked mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also at the house that weekend was Christian Blackwood.  He and Harrow grew up together, went to Paris together, drank together, went out with girls together, and decided what to do with Pascal Charleville's body together.  &lt;em&gt;An Affair with the Moon&lt;/em&gt; is ultimately the story of their relationship--and its astonishing aftermath.  It is a story of how one friend turned the others tragedy into his advantage; it is a story of friendship, but it is also a story of revenge.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Back On Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; is the savagely funny story of Eugene H., a failed, womanizing writer from Toronto. After a nasty flare-up with his ex-wife, he snatches their five-year-old daughter from school and flees to Jamaica. Over the next eighteen hours he embarks on a starlit walk down an endless sea-coast road, muddles over his life, fumes, plots, drinks over-proof, regrets, reminisces, encounters a young woman with grey eyes, a coffin maker, a black Napoleon on his motorcycle...and a host of other creatures from the Jamaican night. At the end of the road - where he's been heading all along - is the black, aquarium stillness of the Wharf Club, a bar that sits dead in the centre of the world.</description>

  <description>Over the course of one Saturday night, a man and his half-sister meet at her request to spend the evening preparing for her assisted death. They drink and reminisce fondly, sadly, amusingly about their lives and especially her children, both of whom have led dramatic and profoundly different lives. &lt;em&gt;Extraordinary&lt;/em&gt; is a gentle consideration of assisted suicide, but it is also a story about siblings—about how brothers and sisters turn out so differently; about how little, in fact, turns out the way we expect. In the end, this is a novel about the extraordinary business of being alive, and it may well be David Gilmour’s very best work of fiction to date.</description>

  <description>Bix has it all: a failed marriage, a faltering career as a speechwriter, a drinking problem (not to mention the pills) and a wayward eye for the women. The last thing he needs is trouble named Holly, which is, of course, exactly what he gets -- briefly. His only assets are his daughter Zoey and an excruciating (and excruciatingly funny) sense of who he is, which becomes his path to redemption from the erotic rollercoaster that is this impressive and un-put-downable novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Lost Between Houses&lt;/em&gt; is about a turbulent year in the life of Simon Albright, a fifteen-year-old private school boy struggling to be his sophisticated mother's best friend, the rebel his girlfriend adores and the son his father respects. Which is a hard act to pull off when your mother is distracted, your girlfriend too beautiful and your father in and out of a mental institution. &lt;em&gt;Lost Between Houses&lt;/em&gt; unfolds with mingled sarcasm, grief and awe, and grips the reader until its startling climax.</description>

  <description>Like a tourist visiting his own life, David Gilmour's narrator journeys in time to reexamine those critical moments that created him. He revisits the terrible hurt of a first love, the shock of a parent's suicide, the trauma of a best friend's bizarre dissembling, and the pain and humiliation of unrelenting jealousy, among other rites of passage. Set within an episodic narrative arc stories about the profound effect of Tolstoy, of the "Beatles," of the cult of celebrity, of the delusion of drugs, and of the literary life on the winding road of the narrator's progress. This compelling and deeply interesting picaresque novel is a creative tour de force from the hand of one of our master storytellers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Perfect Order of Things" breaks new fictional ground and is an astonishing story of a life lived fully and with breathtaking passion. David Gilmour is a novelist who has earned critical praise from literary figures as diverse as William Burroughs and Northrop Frye, and from publications as different as the "New York Times" to "People magazine."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author of six novels, he also hosted the award-winning Gilmour on the Arts. In 2005, his novel "A Perfect Night to Go to China" won the Governor General's Award for Fiction. His next book, "The Film Club," was a finalist for the 2008 Charles Taylor Prize. It became an international bestseller, and has sold over 200,000 copies in Germany and over 100,000 copies in Brazil. He lives in Toronto with his wife.</description>

  <description>This astonishing novel - unlike anything Gilmour has ever written before - begins with every parent's worst nightmare: the disappearance of a child. A father makes a casual error of judgement one evening and leaves his six-year-old son alone for fifteen minutes. When he returns the child is gone and three lives are changed forever. Has the boy been kidnapped? Spirited out of the country? Is he dead?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story that unfolds is told by the novel's narrator, a television host named Roman, who searches for his son through the city and through the underworld of dreams and tries to bring him back. Pursued by an unshakeable conviction that his son is speaking directly to him, Roman begins to enter a haunting relationship with the missing child and his own conscience. In the meantime, his behaviour becomes increasingly erratic and he is rejected by his grieving and angry wife, eventually fired from his job, and shadowed by a persistent policeman who thinks Roman is hiding the child. Written in the clear, elegant prose Gilmour is known for, "A Perfect Night to Go to China" is a completely absorbing and original work of fiction. It sets up a harrowing premise and doesn't let up until the last surprising page.</description>

  <description>From the 2005 winner of the Governor-General's Award for Fiction and the former national film critic for CBC television comes a delightful and absorbing book about the agonies and joys of home-schooling a beloved son. Written in the spare elegant style he is known for, The Film Club is the true story about David Gilmour's decision to let his 15-year-old son drop out of high school on the condition that the boy agrees to watch three films a week with him. The book examines how those pivotal years changed both their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From French New Wave, Kurosawa, and New German cinema, to De Palma, film noir, Cronenberg and Billy Wilder, among many others from world cinema, we read about key moments in each film, as the author teaches his son about life and the vagaries of growing up through the power of the movies. Replete with page-turning descriptions of scenes and actors and directors, the narrative is framed with the tender story of his son's first bittersweet first loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a charming and poignant story about a very special time in a father and son's relationship. David Gilmour is a novelist who has earned critical praise from literary figures as diverse as William Burroughs and Northrop Frye, and from publications as different as the New York Times to People magazine. The author of six novels, he also hosted the award-winning Gilmour on the Arts. He lives in Toronto with his wife Tina Gladstone.</description>

  <description>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY to the second power meets Keisha and Jada from the Block.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you've wondered how an ethnic girl from the hood might have handled an arrangement with an experienced white Dominant, this is your book. If you'd like to see the sexiest TWIN DOMS in a  romance series in interracial relationships, this is most definitely your book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aspiring recording studio owners, Keisha Beale and Jada Jameson, score a rare meeting with venture capitalist Tristan White, and are thrust into a world beyond their wildest imaginations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Street-wise Keisha is startled to realize she wants this rich white man, despite the certainty that he is out of her league. Unable to resist Keisha's sassy, irreverent, and fiercely independent spirit, Tristan knew from day one he wanted her, too--as his first African American submissive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upper Class Jada of the Springfield Jamesons has traveled in almost the same circles as the White brothers, and has had a secret crush on Nathan White, the point guard for the Chicago Bulls, for quite some time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both brothers have succumbed to jungle fever, and want a little coffee in their cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lured by Tristan White and his offer of fronting the capital for her business in exchange for kinky sex, Keisha finds herself with no other option.  Keisha is also tortured by a demons from her past, and her inability to come to terms with them threatens to undermine the future of her business and her tumultuous unorthodox relationship with Tristan White. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotic, amusing, and in places hilarious, the Ghetto Girl Erotica Trilogy is a parody with a unique take on a Fifty Shades-type story that will take you even further into the BDSM world, and promises to make the vanilla original Fifty Shades Blacker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first two books focus on Keisha and Tristan's romance, and the final two focus on Jada and Nathan's.</description>

  <description>In this ebook (approx. 5,950 words in length), I address and discuss “unfairly unfavorable” book reviews that are posted against independent (indie) author's books and ebooks and not those that are earned and deserved by them. Some of the content in this ebook, I have derived from posts I made on a publisher's forum, which I have rewritten and edited into headings for this ebook. The fact that undeserved negative reviews are posted online by readers on bookseller websites, is evident by the fact that same books at the same time, can have highly favorable and positive reviews posted for them by other readers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Taken from description provided by the author at Amazon.com.)</description>

  <description>The Yoni Civilisation ruled by women. A civilisation without war and conflict which has left men feeling emasculated. They send an assassin back through the web of time, seeking to kill the mother of the future. To prevent her daughter and her ideas from ever being born, to prevent them from ever existing. And thereby to re-establish the dominance of men once again, turning herstory back into history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The assassin has several impediments to overcome. He has no weapons to bring with him. He has had no exposure to violence. While his target lives on a sink housing estate in the early twenty-first century, so that he is going to have to battle through his belligerent male ancestors to get to her. The estate is controlled by two brothers, one a criminal overlord and the other a pirate radio DJ who serves as his eyes and ears and communicates to their foot-soldiers through his broadcasts and musical selections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet the greatest hurdle the assassin faces is how to get close enough to the woman. Before he can utilise his lethal if theoretical training to dispatch her, first he has to figure out the yet darker arts of seduction; how to make her even notice him. Thus ensues a hilarious spectrum of seduction scenarios between the same man, the same woman, the same opening chat up lines and a myriad of outcomes. For the most difficult aspect he has to contend with, is that due to the nature of time and its paradoxes, he has to be successful many times over in parallel universes. This is the only way he can fuse all the different potential versions of history into a single definitive thread. And as Chaos Theory and The Butterfly Effect suggest, even the tiniest change in the starting conditions of any scenario, can radically alter all that follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Time After Time" is that rare thing, a science-fiction dark comedy. It explores the minefield that is the dance of male and female around one another in an uproarious way, but always against the background of a menacing urban landscape and of course, with the ultimate aim of the seduction being one of murder. It uses science in a light way, though its very structure embodies the notion of parallel universes and the theory of The Butterfly Effect. It also tackles head on the mind-blowing paradoxes of travelling back in time in order to alter future outcomes. But perhaps the most radical element is that of the DJ himself. Spinning records that not only seem to soundtrack the narrative, but to influence it and to actually determine the fate of the leading players themselves. The novel has a Spotify playlist link to all the songs featured within it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Time After Time", where "Terminator" meets "Attack The Block" with a DJ providing the soundscape.</description>

  <description>Eden Newman must mate before her 18th birthday in six months or she'll be left outside to die in a burning world. But who will pick up her mate-option when she's cursed with white skin and a tragically low mate-rate of 15%? In a post-apocalyptic, totalitarian, underground world where class and beauty are defined by resistance to an overheated environment, Eden's coloring brands her as a member of the lowest class, a weak and ugly Pearl. If only she can mate with a dark-skinned Coal from the ruling class, she'll be safe. Just maybe one Coal sees the Real Eden and will be her salvation her co-worker Jamal has begun secretly dating her. But when Eden unwittingly compromises her father's secret biological experiment, she finds herself in the eye of a storm and thrown into the last area of rainforest, a strange and dangerous land. Eden must fight to save her father, who may be humanity's last hope, while standing up to a powerful beast-man she believes is her enemy, despite her overwhelming attraction. Eden must change to survive but only if she can redefine her ideas of beauty and of love, along with a little help from her "adopted aunt" Emily Dickinson.</description>

  <description>Homosexuality: is it learned, biological or both?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer to this question deeply concerns parents. They want to know how they can best raise their children. A common belief today is that nothing can be done to foster the development of healthy heterosexual orientation in children. But the clinical experience and professional research of Dr. Nicolosi and others indicates otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this groundbreaking book Joseph and Linda Ames Nicolosi uncover the most significant factors that contribute to a child's healthy sense of self as male or female. Listening to moving recollections from ex-homosexual men and women who describe what was missing in their own childhoods, the Nicolosis provide clear insight for identifying potential developmental roadblocks and give practical advice to parents for helping their children securely identify with their gender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Replete with personal stories from parents, children and ex-homosexual strugglers, offers compassion and hope for all those parents who seek to lay a foundation for a healthy heterosexual identity in their children.</description>

  <description>He's a doctor, of course I trust him. Or at least I did, once. I haven't eaten since yesterday. He had scrambled eggs and toast for breakfast. The smell seeps at me from beneath the locked door. The gnawing in my stomach never goes away but it's not from lack of food. Up until yesterday, I've been able to eat. Until yesterday, I was able to do almost anything I wanted within the two thousand square feet of this place. Things are different now.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;He's my teacher. I shouldn't be alone with him. But I can't help that he's irresistible.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I let the door silently close at my back. He stared at me, and a taut quiet stretched between us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I like hearing you play," I said, moving toward him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He turned, in sync with my slow approach. He looked up at me but didn't say anything. I rested my clammy hand on the cold, slick body of the baby grand. "May I?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The muscles in his throat shifted, then he swallowed. "Eden."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My knees weakened, like a soft tickling kiss had just been blown against the backs of them. "Is it okay?" I asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His gaze held mine like two hands joined. He understood what I was really asking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Let me stay," I said. "Please."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"You're going to get me in trouble," he said.</description>

  <description>Grace Doll had everything a girl could want: Fame. Fortune. Beauty. Everything except her freedom. So when a powerful movie producer forces an experimental treatment on Grace--one that's purported to make beauty immortal--she stages her own death to escape him. With the help of trusted friends, Grace slips into hiding. She's forever flawless. Forever young, and forever pursued by her past. But when a stranger arrives on her doorstep, holding the key to a life she thought she'd left behind, Grace must decide between the safety she's known...and embracing the role she was born to play.</description>

  <description>Cort, the high school senior jock seems to have it all -- except a summer job. When he lands one doing women's nails, his eyes are opened to the catty, back-stabbing world of females. Girls he thought he knew and trusted turn out to shock and use him. He gets to know Rachel, an elusive girl the others gossip about, a girl with secrets. From her he learns there is more to life than weekend partying and social status, and one of the secrets she shares with him will change his life forever.</description>

  <description>One girl. Two guys. Who says three's a crowd? When Mandy takes an unusual summer job-in construction-she has to prove she's just one of the guys. But she gets more than she bargains for being the only girl on the job. The mixture of hot guys, sunscreen, raw wood and testosterone proves to be an elixir she can't protect her heart from. Brooding Boston and flirty AJ find themselves looking at Mandy as more than just a girl who holds a hammer. Mandy soon finds herself not only lost in a whirlwind of a male-dominated world, but also the center of an inadvertently "constructed" love triangle. Mandy must choose between two guys who want her heart. But what's a girl to do when she wants them both?</description>

  <description>Seeing good and evil spirits is a gift Zoe guards with her life.&lt;br&gt;Despite her guardian angel’s disappearance, Zoe forces herself to accept that she still has a purpose—but how does she carry the weight of her brother’s drug abuse, the hardship of living with an autistic sister, and a best friend who’s obsessed with a guy who only wants Zoe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s never felt more alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious spirit appears, Zoe thinks she has a new guardian angel. Instead, her brother’s addiction worsens, her parents are on the brink of separation, and her best friend tries to kill her. The spirit she thinks is her new guardian isn’t there to protect her: he’s out to destroy her family and seize Zoe’s soul. . . for Hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Matthias’ return mean that he is Zoe’s guardian angel again? Or is their love the reason the jaws of Hell now gape open?</description>

Her parents are so overwhelmed; they don't see Zoe lost in her broken life. Zoe escapes the only way she knows how: partying.

  <description>Bean (née Pearl) and Henry, misfits and best friends, have the strangest mothers in town. Henry’s mom Sally never leaves the house. Bean’s mom Lexie, if she is home, is likely nursing a hangover or venting to her friend Claire about Bean’s beloved grandfather Gus, the third member of their sunny household.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gus’s death unleashes a host of family secrets that brings them all together. And they threaten to change everything—including Bean’s relationship with Henry, her first friend, and who also might turn out to be her first love.</description>

  <description>Ophelia's been successful at hiding her true identity, until the mark of the serpent appears on her neck—a death sentence, should it be seen by anyone in her town. Hiding the mark might save her from falling victim to the witch hunts of her era, but the scorching sensation it carries can’t be ignored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mysterious Ethan is sent to collect her for a life of something more, she learns concealing the mark is the least of her concerns. She’s destined to do a new task—to join a dark, supernatural world and protect the future of people she may never meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she doesn’t know—what she learns too late—is that her initiation won’t be complete until she kills the man who’s captured her heart.</description>

  <description>When friends move away, it is hard for them to leave and even harder to watch them go. Toby’s best friend moved yesterday, and now all Toby has is his friend’s baseball glove (which smells like Parmesan cheese). Toby is bored and alone. But then the snow starts to fall, and Toby finds an unexpected flurry of friends . . .&lt;br&gt;With humor and warmth, Julie Halpern and Matthew Cordell tell the story of one little boy who learns about friendship, change, and the nature of the snowflake.</description>

  <description>Anna Bloom has just come home from a three-week stay in a mental hospital. She feels...okay. It's time to get back to some sort of normal life, whatever that means. She has to go back to school, where teachers and friends are dying to know what happened to her, but are too afraid to ask. And Anna is dying to know what's going on back at the hospital with her crush, Justin, but is too afraid to ask. Meanwhile, Anna's parents aren't getting along, and she wonders if she's the cause of her family's troubles. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;On the first day of Lillian’s summer-before-college, she gets a message on her cell from her sort-of friend, Penny. Not only has Penny faked her own kidnapping, but Lil is the only one who figures it out. She knows that Penny’s home life has been rough, and that her boyfriend may be abusive. Soon, Penny’s family, the local police, and even the FBI are grilling Lil, and she decides to head out to Oregon, where Penny has mentioned an acquaintance. And who better to road-trip across the country with than Lil’s BFF, Josh. But here’s the thing: Lil loves Josh. And Josh doesn’t want to “ruin” their amazing friendship. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Josh has a car and his dad’s credit card. Lil has her cellphone and a hunch about where Penny is hiding. There’s something else she needs to find: Are she and Josh meant to be together?&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>It’s Jessie’s sophomore year of high school. A self-professed “mathelete,” she isn’t sure where she belongs. Her two best friends have transformed themselves into punks and one of them is going after her longtime crush. Her beloved older brother will soon leave for college (and in the meantime has shaved his mohawk and started dating . . . the prom princess!) . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things are changing fast. Jessie needs new friends. And her quest is a hilarious tour through high-school clique-dom, with a surprising stop along the way—the Dungeons and Dragons crowd, who out-nerd everyone. Will hanging out with them make her a nerd, too? And could she really be crushing on a guy with too-short pants and too-white gym shoes?      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you go into the wild nerd yonder, can you ever come back?</description>

  <description>Anna Bloom is depressed—so depressed that her parents have committed her to a mental hospital with a bunch of other messed-up teens. Here she meets a roommate with a secret (and a plastic baby), a doctor who focuses way too much on her weight, and a cute, shy boy who just might like her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But wait!  Being trapped in a loony bin isn’t supposed to be about making friends, losing weight, and having a crush, is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her fiction debut, Julie Halpern finds humor in the unlikeliest of places, and presents a character whose voice—and heart—will resonate with all of us who have ever felt just a little bit crazy.</description>

  <description>Fang Girl - noun – a female fan of vampire media who might be a little obsessive in her fandom.&lt;br&gt;[Derived from modern slang fanboy but always in reference to females. First used by Cassandra Duffy in Fabled Fang Girls]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassandra Duffy, an emerging voice in lesbian literature, releases her third short story collection, Fabled Fang Girls in a transparent attempt to satisfy the vampire addiction of her readership. Eight short stories of vampire lust and love revisit characters from Demons of Paradise and introduce new stories of lesbian sex and relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Princess of Castle Eclipse” – a beautiful fairytale of doomed love in the tragic tradition of European fables.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Witch of Vigil’s Grove” and “Return to Vigil’s Grove” – two pieces of an upcoming novel that offer a chilling introduction to the town of Vigil’s Rest where a vampire haunts the forest, luring young girls to their doom with promises of forbidden love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Last Best Tip” – the critically acclaimed novella finds a new home in this collection. Grifts, swingers, a sassy but irresponsible vampire and her underachieving girlfriend occupy a clever urban fantasy landscape where even eternal children of the night have money problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“From Nightshift to Swing Shift” – Vendela and Brooke are back! The vampire fashionista and her Australian girlfriend have hit a lull in their peculiar relationship and turn to a beautiful Persian executive to inject some much-need passion back into the couple’s sex life to keep out the Alaskan cold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Lovely Predators” – a brief look at the upcoming Noire style mystery novel of the same name that follows a talented Los Angeles homicide detective as she investigates a series of grisly murders that keep leading her back to the doorstep of her new girlfriend who is keeping a dark secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Undead Housewives of the Other Orange County” – a farcical take on the Real Housewives television shows that interjects vampires and humanity to create a humorous story about what might really take place between bored housewives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Chains of Command” – a mixture of Duffy’s remarkable science fiction, paranormal romance, and hardcore erotica. Chains follows a vampire captain of a cutting-edge space warship who must break the will of her new executive officer during a long, deep space raid, but quickly finds the tables turned on her by the fiery and reckless, Commander Crash Langford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassandra Duffy floods this collection with vampires, sex, horror, romance, action, and humor in ways that truly display the depth and range of her remarkable talent. Sapphic Pixie Tales is proud to offer this outstanding collection of vampire fiction from the 21-year-old lesbian author.</description>

  <description>The lone anchor in Lucy’s life is a job she hates at a swingers club in the heart of middle America; without it, she would be just another twenty-something college dropout, who never quite reached her potential, and is as unlucky in love as most everything else. It’s a shame she hates her job. Sasha, her vampire crush, working in the bar across the way, is in a similar boat, but she has a way out…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy breaks the law, breaks rules she didn’t even know she had, and risks what little she has left to be with Sasha. In this sexy, lighthearted comedy of errors luck and flexibility aren’t always what they seem.</description>

  <description>Eight short, erotica and romance stories involving paranormal creatures like vampires, werewolves, mummies, and more, from a lesbian author intended for a lesbian audience. The stories are split down two lines: one lighter and more romantic and the other darker and kinkier in their content. The darker sexual themes run the gamete of coercion, reluctance, lost loves, voyeurism, mind-control, domination/submission, and BDSM--a taste for every palette and kink, while the lighter side touches on first romances, first loves, intimate relationships, and the sweetness of committed couples.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassandra Duffy/Lizzy Dark encompasses the full experience of living and loving as a lesbian while adding playful humor, some scares, and possibly even tears on the backdrop of a sexually rich paranormal setting.</description>

  <description>Fiona and Gieo are back in the third book in the Raven Ladies series! The war of retribution against the city of Juarez has gone well through the autumn and winter months. Fiona, at the head of a fresh army of Ravens provided by the new White Queen Alondra, has captured or killed the fleeing remnants of the Juarez invaders responsible for the massacre at Tombstone. Supported by Gieo and her fledgling air force of modified World War II planes, Fiona is set to end the war of retribution with a final blow to the last bastion of the Juarez drug cartel. Before the final blow can be struck, the Slark make their return to the conflict, restored to their former glory and strength.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a disastrous battle, Fiona’s army is on the verge of breaking and Gieo has fallen into the hands of the marauder warlord General McKenzie. Fiona must leave the Ravens to find her captured beloved, riding out alone into the desert to seek help from the revived Apache Nation, the spirit world, and Gieo’s robot companion, Ramen, who is discovered to be of sinister origins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riding through the post-apocalyptic world of Dead Texas, Fiona infiltrates McKenzie’s marauders only to find the Ravens have once again lied to her. Fiona’s rescue might end in wedding bells or betrayal and seems destined for bloodshed either way.</description>

  <description>In the town of Vigil’s Rest, vampires haunt the forest, luring young girls to their doom with promises of forbidden love. After Deborah Poole, a local beauty queen goes missing, the town’s long history of cover-ups begins to unravel. She returns from the dead, more angel than demon, and acting as a spirit of mercy in the haunted forest that has known only vengeance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oppression and tightly held secrets keep Deborah from love for decades, finally shattering when the unlikely fulfillment of an ancient prophesy gives her a new chance at love and humanity in the form of a disillusioned teenage girl, Annabelle. But to severe Deborah’s chains to the past, the duo must unravel the three 200 year old mystery of the forest’s haunting and the town’s dark past.</description>

  <description>Harper, Sword Maiden for the illustrious Goddess of the Open Sea, has returned to the fabled city of Griffon's Rock at the end of the Last Road to rest for the winter months after a disappointing year treasure hunting. Her rest is cut short by a mysterious storm of divine origin, an attempted horse theft of her beloved mount, and the sudden appearance of a beautiful southerner who seems determined to capture Harper's heart. As the snows begin to fall, intrigue and romance heats up. The object of Harper's desire, the mysterious rogue Calista, appears destined to get everyone into fresh trouble with a mystical stew-brewing ogre, a greedy guild of Dwarven thieves, and finally an exalted march out of the snowy north bent on divine retribution. Harper must decide if her growing love for Calista is real or a product of the lies she's been told. Before the spring thaw, Harper will choose between the woman she loves and the Goddess that is the source of her magic.</description>

  <description>Claudia Marceau, sniper extraordinaire and notorious flirt, has grown bored with Tombstone and the Lazy Ravens as a whole. With her unrequited crush on the gunfighter Fiona Bishop growing ever more impossible after the inclusion of Gieo into the mix, she has found temporary comfort in the arms of the White Queen Veronica. But what she really wants is out—out of Tombstone, out of the Ravens, out of the range of the romance she can’t have. On the tumultuous last night, with Tombstone burning down around her, she makes her escape into the desert night to seek out the father she is certain still lives and the freedom she craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her years of experience as a scout and survivor serve her well on a tremendous journey through the post apocalyptic wasteland where she takes counsel from a scorched Owl, slays a rising caste of Slark, and survives an encounter with an army of mutants that forever changes her and the fortunes of humanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she arrives in the City of Broken Bridges that arose from the ashes of San Francisco, she finds her father not only lives, but has become a powerful warlord charged with protecting the most technologically advanced city in human history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The maudlin French Canadian heroine becomes embroiled in a love tangle with a British sailor, a Scottish footballer, and the world’s last donut shop girl. In a landscape filled with man-eating trees, giant god-like robots, and vile mutants, Claudia strives to find a moment’s peace before the Lazy Ravens make their push to the west coast and claim a city with more secrets than people.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Sixteen-year-old Maddie Dunn is special, but she needs to figure out how to use her new abilities before somebody else gets hurt. Ganzfield is a secret training facility full of people like her, but it's not exactly a nurturing place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every social interaction carries the threat of mind-control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stray thought can burn a building to the ground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And people's nightmares don't always stay in their own heads. But it's still better than New Jersey. Especially once she meets the man of her dreams...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Welcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come amuse yourself in the company of slime-dripping vagina jaws, Aboriginal ABBA tribute bands and &lt;em&gt;Deliverance&lt;/em&gt;-quoting parrots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This trio of politically incorrect comedies, which bleakly focus on male inadequacy and misogyny, will introduce you to a bunch of chronic misfits kicking around Wales, Australia and South Korea. But be warned - you may grow to like some of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just make sure you don't leave this little encyclopaedia of dysfunction on your maiden aunt's chair...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking For Sarah Jane Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marty's living in a Welsh town he hates, doing a job he's lost interest in and so bored he can't even be bothered with sex.&lt;br&gt;But a new life beckons in Australia. It's also a chance to get away from his stupid mates, the loveable loser John and the ultra-macho Wasp Boy.&lt;br&gt;Maybe he'll even meet an exquisite girl like his &lt;em&gt;Doctor Who&lt;/em&gt; heroine, Sarah Jane Smith, and live happily ever after...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for Sarah Jane Smith&lt;/em&gt; - For anyone who suspects life's a bit rubbish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part road trip and part celebration of idiotic male friendship, &lt;em&gt;Looking for Sarah Jane Smith&lt;/em&gt; is sure to strike a chord with those who appreciate &lt;em&gt;The Inbetweeners&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Peep Show&lt;/em&gt; and Bill Hicks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manic Streets of Perth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perth.&lt;br&gt;It's thousands of miles from anywhere, it's got a rubbish Bell Tower and not enough of the laidback locals are being eaten by sharks. Well, that's what expat reporter Paul Lewis thinks, but after a lonely Manic Street Preachers fan reveals her disastrously unlucky life suddenly nothing's the same...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manic Streets of Perth&lt;/em&gt; - Where a snake-wielding robber is just the start of your troubles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gentler and warmer than Dave Franklin's other novels, &lt;em&gt;Manic Streets&lt;/em&gt; is an easy to read comedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;English Toss on Planet Andong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year thousands of people travel to faraway lands to teach English as a foreign language. The fools.&lt;br&gt;One such expat is Paul Taylor, a heartbroken Aussie looking for a fresh start in a South Korean classroom. The lack of training isn't much of a help, but it's the baffling natives and unhinged flatmates that really start to convince him he's crash-landed in another galaxy...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Packed with over the top characters, &lt;em&gt;English Toss&lt;/em&gt; is a demented sitcom of a novel that revels in the extremes of expat dislocation.</description>

  <description>Part coming of age story, part exploration of the maddening nature of dreams, Girls Like Funny Boys is a potent mix of sexual obsession, guilt and fame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Gina crouched, resting on her haunches to continue the conversation. Her legs were too far apart. There was a hole in her black tights just above the left knee. Johnny felt a hot urge to poke a finger in it. He wished she'd leave him alone. He wished she wasn't wearing tights. He stared at her lopsided mouth and the way her fat lower lip jutted out. It was so red it bordered on purple, the colour of strawberries on the turn.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Johnny Goodwin. He's grown up in a quiet Brisbane suburb with loving parents, a faithful dog and an unrequited yearning for his teenage sweetheart Angie Everson. &lt;br&gt;Now in his last year at school, he's finally caught her eye by starring in a teacher-baiting pantomime. Dreams are already taking shape of a career in entertainment, perhaps with Angie by his side. &lt;br&gt;And all he's got to do is pass his exams, get to uni and keep away from Gina Wood, that weird girl who once let him touch her…</description>

  <description>A collection of weird discussions that I have with my nine-year-old son, taken from my blog and centralized in one downloadable location to be easily used against him when he is a teenager. Conversation topics include: God and hoodies, whether or not I killed the Thanksgiving turkey, rooting through the neighbor's recycling bin and discovering a Victoria's Secret catalog, anthropomorphizing food items while I'm cooking, butlers, how to get girls, and the kid's obsession with hot tubs.</description>

  <description>Relatively Famous delivers Hollywood with heart. Meet Dani McKinley: A typical teen whose world is rocked when she finds out that her father is a famous Hollywood action star. Now meet Mark Ocean: A self-serving actor with a floundering career who sees that a daughter is just what he needs to reinvent himself as a family man and get back on track. When the two decide to spend the summer together, they must not only wrangle their own love lives, but try to figure out who they really are to themselves and to each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now armed with credit cards, club memberships, and a new wardrobe, Dani learns that what Mark has in wealth, he sorely lacks in parenting skills. Trying to show Mark that parenting is about more than loading her up with Prada bags and taking her to movie premieres is challenging enough, but she's also got her hands full with her new friends. Oh, and the boys... Dani meets Jason, a gorgeous young personal trainer who is easy on the eyes and wildly flirtatious. But is this smug hottie the one for her? Or will she ignore her friends eye-rolling and go for the goofy but sweet surfer? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While juggling her own complicated love life, Dani tries to set her father up with someone less likely to appear on a VH1 reality show, and someone more... well, normal. And age-appropriate. And dressed in anything but a thong bikini. But whether Mark is able to heal old wounds and move forward with anything more than a meaningless fling remains to be seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Dani fit in with this new, fast-moving California crowd without losing herself? With the world at her fingertips and hot boys now after her, staying grounded gets tough. And can Mark drop his egocentric approach to life and learn to appreciate how truly wonderful his daughter is? As driven as he is to get that A-list acting role, he's willing to do whatever it takes to get there, even if it means using his daughter. Or is he...? Mark and Dani's relationship hits a few highs, but the question becomes whether the lows are too much.</description>

  <description>Matt is a junior at MIT. He’s geeky, he's witty, he's brilliant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he’s also very, very stupid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful, cool, insightful Julie moves in with Matt’s family, why (oh why!) does he pretend to be his absent brother Finn for her alleged benefit? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems harmless enough until her short-term stay becomes permanent. And until it snowballs into heart-squeezing insanity. And until he falls in love with Julie, and Julie falls in love with Finn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But … Matt is the right one for her. If only he can make Julie see it. Without telling her the truth, without shattering them all. Particularly his fragile sister Celeste, who may need Julie the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You saw Matt through Julie’s eyes in FLAT-OUT LOVE. Now go deeper into Matt’s world in this FLAT-OUT MATT novella. Live his side of the story, break when his heart breaks, and fall for the unlikely hero all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take an emotional skydive for two prequel chapters and seven Flat-Out Love chapters retold from his perspective, and then land with a brand-new steamy finale chapter from Julie.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What does it take to rise from life’s depths, swim against the current, and breathe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weighted down by the loss of her parents, Blythe McGuire struggles to keep her head above water as she trudges through her last year at Matthews College. Then a chance meeting sends Blythe crashing into something she doesn’t expect—an undeniable attraction to a dark-haired senior named Chris Shepherd, whose past may be even more complicated than her own. As their relationship deepens, Chris pulls Blythe out of the stupor she’s been in since the night a fire took half her family. She begins to heal, and even, haltingly, to love this guy who helps her find new paths to pleasure and self-discovery. But as Blythe moves into calmer waters, she realizes Chris is the one still strangled by his family’s traumatic history. As dark currents threaten to pull him under, Blythe may be the only person who can keep him from drowning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book is intended for mature audiences due to strong language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: due to mature content recommended for Ages 17+</description>

  <description>He was tall, at least six feet, with dirty blond hair that hung over his eyes. His T-shirt read &lt;strong&gt;Nietzsche Is My Homeboy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, that was Matt.  Who Julie Seagle likes. A lot.  But there is also Finn.  Who she flat out loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicated? Awkward?  Completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But really, how was this freshly-minted Boston transplant and newbie college freshman supposed to know that she would end up living with the family of an old friend of her mother's? This was all supposed to be temporary.  Julie wasn't supposed to be important to the Watkins family, or to fall in love with one of the brothers.  Especially the one she's never quite met. But what does that really matter?  Finn &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt; her, like no one ever has before. They have &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here's the thing about love, in all its twisty, bumpy permutations—it always throws you a few curves.  And no one ever escapes unscathed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best-selling author Jessica Park mines the territory of love’s growing pains with wit, sharp insights, and a discernible heat and heartbeat. Her previous novels include Relatively Famous and she authored the e-shorts &lt;em&gt;What the Kid Says&lt;/em&gt; (Parts 1 and 2) and &lt;em&gt;Facebooking Rick Springfield&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>The Destruction of Dresden is a 1963 non-fiction book which describes the February 1945 bombing of Dresden in World War II. The book is based on a series of 37 articles written on the strategic bombing during World War II by David Irving called Wie Deutschlands Städte starben (English: How Germany's Cities Died) for the German journal Neue Illustrierte. The book became an international bestseller during the 1960s debate about the morality of the World War II area bombing of the Nazi Germany civilian population.</description>

  <description>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder -- much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing―not even a smear of blood―to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.</description>

  <description>John and Mary Hilt are hired to restore the Mandiev mansion isolated between four surrounding towns. In the past, the Mandiev brothers had a fatal accident which killed hundreds of local citizens. The event marks the beginning of a device that will control its creator and affect the community for years to come. Mary will discover the madness that spawned from its awakening and unravel its deadly secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Necro Device is a mind-melting, suspense thriller loaded with hidden agendas, twists, and a diabolical plot. It all begins with a betrayal, a machine, and a darker intent... It has a purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: The Necro Device was originally titled Mandiev. After being picked up by a publisher a new name and cover art was assigned to it. It also gained a subtitle, Rise of the Mandiev. After being removed from the publisher, the cover art was restored back to its original classic look with a darker twist and is now known as the Classic Edition. All text versions of the novel are unchanged other than minor grammar and spelling edits.</description>

  <description>#1 BESTSELLER SCIENCE FICTION VISIONARY&lt;br&gt;#1 BESTSELLER PHILOSOPHY&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Philosopher, entrepreneur, and former National Geographic and New York Times correspondent Zoltan Istvan presents his bestselling visionary novel, The Transhumanist Wager, as a seminal statement of our times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scorned by over 500 publishers and literary agents around the world, his philosophical thriller has been called "revolutionary" and "socially dangerous" by readers, scholars, and religious authorities. The novel debuts a challenging original philosophy, which rebuffs modern civilization by inviting the end of the human species—and declaring the onset of something greater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the present day, the novel tells the story of transhumanist Jethro Knights and his unwavering quest for immortality via science and technology. Fighting against him are fanatical religious groups, economically depressed governments, and mystic Zoe Bach: a dazzling trauma surgeon and the love of his life, whose belief in spirituality and the afterlife is absolute. Exiled from America and reeling from personal tragedy, Knights forges a new nation of willing scientists on the world's largest seasteading project, Transhumania. When the world declares war against the floating city, demanding an end to its renegade and godless transhuman experiments and ambitions, Knights strikes back, leaving the planet forever changed.</description>

  <description>Inside the pages of this book you will discover a captivating man's story of life growing up poor in West Virginia. The son of a coal miner, drifting after graduation trying to find his way in the world, moving with his family back to the state of Texas and leaving behind the girl he planned to marry. Life for him was tough and only one could imagine how in the world one person could encounter the difficulties that seemed to follow him wherever he went. The breakup of his first love, the ended romance in Texas, he could take no more, leading him to join the Marines for a life of hell that would cause the injuries that he lives with today. Returning home, drifting and trying to become successful in life, using his fist as an amateur boxer, managing to win the West Texas Golden Gloves Championship. Beating the odds was nothing for this man because he fought them his entire life. Something you only see in movies? No, not this man, they say he has lived the life of twenty men. From being poor to working his way up in the business world of sales he would own and operate several retail businesses that would make him a millionaire. This sounds pretty good until you get to the part that he loses it all.

What you read in this book you will not believe happened, but it did! This is just a sample of this one man's life. Readers say, "It's addictive." Once you start reading this unbelievable story you can't put it down. Step into this man's life as he tells you in his words the life as he knows only to be "From Hell to Heaven to Hell."</description>

  <description>Madman, tyrant, animal - history has given Adolf Hitler many names. In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), often called the Nazi bible, Hitler describes his life, frustrations, ideals, and dreams. Born to an impoverished couple in a small town in Austria, the young Adolf grew up with the fervent desire to become a painter. The death of his parents and outright rejection from art schools in Vienna forced him into underpaid work as a labourer. During the First World War, Hitler served in the infantry and was decorated for bravery. After the war, he became actively involved with socialist political groups and quickly rose to power, establishing himself as Chairman of the National Socialist German Worker's party. In 1924, Hitler led a coalition of nationalist groups in a bid to overthrow the Bavarian government in Munich. The infamous Munich "Beer-hall putsch" was unsuccessful, and Hitler was arrested. During the nine months he was in prison, an embittered and frustrated Hitler dictated a personal manifesto to his loyal follower Rudolph Hess. He vented his sentiments against communism and the Jewish people in this document, which was to become Mein Kampf, the controversial book that is seen as the blue-print for Hitler's political and military campaign. In Mein Kampf, Hitler describes his strategy for rebuilding Germany and conquering Europe. It is a glimpse into the mind of a man who destabilized world peace and pursued the genocide now known as the Holocaust. "... I believe today that my conduct is in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator. In standing guard against the Jew I am defending the handiwork of the Lord"</description>

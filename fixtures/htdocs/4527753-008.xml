  <description>The very first book from #OneVoice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A collection of fifty true victims and survivors stories from around the world with one common theme - domestic violence/abuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each one written from the heart and unedited so raw and full of the pain and feelings they convey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALL revenue from the profits will be donated to charities around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From emotional abuse to violence, rape and a victim on trial for 1st degree murder this book carries a STRONG WARNING - please purchase but read with caution as the subject matter between these pages is graphic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out why some of our survivors feel that Fifty Shades Of Grey and it's main character, Christian Grey is NOT a romantic love story but a tale of domestic abuse and violence that has destroyed one woman's life that we know of!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you see the signs but most of all do you recognise the signs that hide within this book?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I speak on behalf of all #OneVoice victims and survivors when I say that if one person walks away from a violent relationship after reading this book we will all be a happy bunch of survivors and know that we have helped just a little!</description>

  <description>I bring to you, from the quickly expanding Faellin Angels Realm collection, several haunting and horrific tales that leave you tingly, shivering, and quite possibly wishing you were not alone and unaware of the eyes glaring out at you in the darkness, from your window. &lt;br&gt;Within these pages you will find several authors’ demented fantasies brought to life to entertain you on a dark and chilly evening. Enjoy them with a fine glass of Chardonnay by a fire, or anywhere. I suggest that you cuddle with a warm furry companion for the sake of your heart. &lt;br&gt;This e-book is free and always will be. We only ask that you check out our other books and let other readers know how much you enjoyed it. A review would be very nice&lt;br&gt;but that is up to you. I only hope that these short stories are enough to make you sit up and think that we may have talent. &lt;br&gt;Chilling, thrilling short stories of the paranormal/horror genre. Faellin Angels Realm LP wants to share our work to provide you a taste of our dark and twisted work. Sink your teeth into bloody stories that leave you addicted and wanting more.</description>

  <description>The year is 1921 and two students from Providence, R.I. are exploring the tunnel system that honeycombs College Hill under Brown University. They are seeking a site for Professor Vasil Kozoff to conduct his experiments in relativity. In the course of their explorations they discover a huge cache of mysterious crates. These crates contain artifacts that are identical to the religious, mystical, magical and mythological relics described in the writings of the ages. But they soon discover that these strange and puzzling artifacts are not all the tunnels have to offer. Soon they finds themselves locked in a savage battle with a Lovecroftian monstrosity that has plagued humanity for thousands of years and that is just the beginning of this tale.</description>

  <description>While performing research for a master's thesis at Brown University, Brian Metcalf finds more than darkness behind closed eyelids. Astral realms intent upon unleashing unspeakable evil attempt to use him as a pawn in their struggle to open a portal to this world. It's happened before to others. Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, "If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you. Whoever battles monsters had better see that it does not turn him into a monster." Novella 18049 words</description>

  <description>In a lifestyle of speed, adrenaline and desire, one racer has sacrificed everything for the sport he loved. &lt;br&gt;In turn, he will fight for his name, his family and now his life to be the legend he’s been portrayed to be.&lt;br&gt;You can be everything you set out to be if you want it bad enough. You can be that record breaker you said you’d be. You can be that hero you always thought you would be. You can be a champion.  You can be a legend. You can love the same woman your entire life and give everything you got to a sport that gives you happiness. That is, if you want it.&lt;br&gt;But what happens when you’re standing on the edge of disaster and none of that matters anymore?&lt;br&gt;Jameson Riley, a racer whose effect on the sport is greater than any statistical contribution, has that talent and the family dedicated to get him to those legendary levels he has always dreamed of. Just like any long race, their lives have fallen into a comfortable pace making pit stops and adjustments along the way they remain in line with the occasional shuffle. Through it all, Jameson is a driver with a numbing reputation, an imperial manner and the clout to back it. From his unlikely beginnings in the Pacific Northwest to blaring spotlight, he’s been challenged on and off the track for the last eighteen years but life is changing for this family. Their children are growing, the family business is soaring and he’s in the peak of his career having won more championships than any other driver in the series.&lt;br&gt;That’s when tragedy surfaces. A malicious act of revenge will decide the fate of the champion everyone has watched grow from the local dirt track racer to the mystifying greatness he became. One family is forced to look for a miracle. They question the sport, relationships, and the only lifestyle they’ve ever known.&lt;br&gt;When your life is measured in laps, what happens when the white flag is thrown?</description>

  <description>Dylan Wade wants to bury the grief that surrounds his past, his decisions and his reactions. He never had an easy life, but at least now, he has the girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bailey Gray&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wants a life alone with Bailey but their past won't allow it. He finds himself wanting to know her soul, to live inside her heart and to have a moment where it's just them and their memories, without distractions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they find themselves on the path to nowhere, again in search of the love they once knew. They are forced to dig deep to see what they couldn't before. Deals can't be broken. Moments can't be stolen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But maybe loving with all your heart isn't enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Bailey see that their deal can't be broken despite the revenge set forth by her family?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or will she run from the&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;only boy who has ever held her heart?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A must have companion to Happy Hour that give you an inside look into the characters of the Racing on the Edge series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Step into the magic where the clay met rubber and desire defined greatness. Trading Paint takes you inside the hasty driver’s mind to what led him to a decision that changed the path of two souls.&lt;br&gt;Jameson Riley, a dirt track racer from the pacified Northwest attempts to step from the shadows of his legendary World of Outlaw father, Jimi.&lt;br&gt;Struggling to make his own identity, his best friend becomes a distraction he didn’t see coming. When you’re touted as the next legendary sprint car racer to someone whose mystique alone is intimidating, you tend to lose sight and wonder who you are at times.&lt;br&gt;He has something to prove and something to learn. Can he surpass greatness? &lt;br&gt;Warning: This book contains adult content and racing. It may not be for everyone and is completely different from the other books in the series as it contains detailed racing, setups and the mindset of a racer.</description>

  <description>An American detective, Lancaster Parks, searching for a serial killer of American tourists in San Felipe, Mexico, a town buried in secrets, and ghosts. A corrupt police chief, Hernando Felix, clouded in more mystery than the town he serves. And her, the cat of Mexico, the beautiful girl whose name changes on a daily basis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When American detective, Lancaster Parks, is sent by the U.S. State Department to investigate a string of serial killings committed against American male tourists in Mexico, he gets more than he ever bargained for. He quickly realizes he is in way over his head. Dealing with the corruption of local law enforcement, he also has to battle his conflicting emotions with a mysterious woman who shows up out of nowhere to seduce him. When all the evidence of the killings points to the chief, he wonders if he will even come out of this thing alive. He also wonders what mystery he will solve first, that of the woman, that of the corrupt chief of police, or the buried secrets of the past in a town lost in time. When you want a job done right, you send in the best, but even the best can have a bad day. Shadows are hard to capture in this elusive story of suspense, intrigue and erotic romance.</description>

  <description>An apocalyptic alien invasion set humanity on the edge of extermination. Unable to match technology with the invaders, humanity bet their existence on their physical strength overcoming. In a desperate last stand by the world's greatest scientists, the cataclysm electromagnetic pulse wiped out all technology on the planet, stranding the aliens on earth, effectively locking them in the cage with the beasts of humanity that remained. Using pre-industrial weapons of war, the surviving humans fought back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six years later, Gieo, the self-proclaimed last pilot on earth, was shot down yet again. She finds herself in the unwelcoming post apocalyptic old west town of Tombstone, the guest of the beautiful gunfighter Fiona with a turbulent history. Their budding romance hits an immediate snag when Fiona's mysterious past finally catches up with her, bringing with it old flames, hot grudges, and a rekindling of the war with the aliens that had cooled to a stalemate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sky-captain Gieo and her fleet of steam-powered dirigibles are humanity's best chance to turn the tide of the war against the alien invaders, but only if Fiona can protect her from blind cultists, jealous ex-girlfriends, and a town of apocalypse cowboys with suspect sanity.</description>

  <description>DOON…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veronica doesn't think she's going crazy. But why can't anyone else see the mysterious blond boy who keeps popping up wherever she goes? When her best friend, Mackenna, invites her to spend the summer in Scotland, Veronica jumps at the opportunity to leave her complicated life behind for a few months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Scottish countryside holds other plans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only has the imaginary kilted boy followed her to Alloway, she and Mackenna uncover a strange set of rings and a very unnerving letter from Mackenna's great aunt—and when the girls test the instructions Aunt Gracie left behind, they find themselves transported to a land that defies explanation. Doon seems like a real-life fairy tale, complete with one prince who has eyes for Mackenna and another who looks suspiciously like the boy from Veronica's daydreams. But Doon has a dark underbelly as well. The two girls could have everything they've longed for...or they could end up breaking an enchantment and find themselves trapped in a world that has become a nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DOON is loosely based on the premise of the musical Brigadoon, with permission from the ALan Jay Lerner Estate and the Frederick Loewe Foundation. Follow the journey at &lt;a href="http://www.DoonSeries.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.DoonSeries.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                                              ~Destiny awaits!</description>

  <description>Jacob Wonderbar is used to detentions, but when a spaceship crashes near his house, he finds himself in a whole new level of trouble. After swapping a corn dog for the ship, he and his two best friends, Sarah Daisy and Dexter, take off on a madcap adventure. They accidentally cause an epic explosion, get kidnapped by a space pirate, and are marooned on planets like Numonia and Paisley, where the air smells like burp breath and revenge-hungry substitute teachers rule. And that's only the beginning . . . It turns out that there's an entire colony of space humans, and Jacob's long-lost father just might be one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The first book in debut author Nathan Bransford's hilarious space adventure series has dynamite friendships, peculiar planets, and nonstop action. You'll never look at the stars the same way!</description>

  <description>In his house at R’lyeh, great Cthulhu lies dreaming... of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would you do if you discovered you were the only one in the world with the hidden power to keep it from utter annihilation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if you had no idea what that power might even be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andromeda Slate, the self-proclaimed most ordinary girl in America, can’t figure out why the gorgeous but mysterious new boy at high school seems to hate her so much. It couldn't have anything to do with the strange dream she had the night before he first showed up in class, could it? The dream where the very same boy rescued her from a giant, green, tentacled sea monster?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it couldn’t have anything to do with that time she read aloud from that ancient tome of eldritch magic, the Necronomicon... could it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andi Slate never imagined she’d find herself in a situation where somehow she was the key to saving the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her life is about to get a whole lot less ordinary.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From nineteenth-century London’s elegant ballrooms to its darkest slums, a spirited young woman and a nobleman investigating for the Crown unmask a plot by Napoleon to bleed England of its gold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chance led to Charlotte Raven’s transformation from chimney sweep to wealthy, educated noblewoman, but she still walks a delicate tightrope between two worlds, unable to turn her back on the ruthless crime lord who was once her childhood protector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lord Edward Durnham is tapped to solve the mystery of England’s rapidly disappearing gold, his search leads him to the stews of London, and Charlotte becomes his intriguing guide to the city’s dark, forbidding underworld. But as her involvement brings Charlotte to the attention of men who have no qualms about who they hurt, and as Edward forges a grudging alliance with the dangerous ghosts of Charlotte’s former life, she faces a choice: to continue living in limbo, or to close the door on the past and risk her heart and her happiness on an unpredictable future.</description>

  <description>In 1921 two students from Providence search the tunnels under College Hill to find the ideal site for an experiment in the relativity of time for one of their professors. They find much, much more. In a carven chamber they find a cache of mysterious crates packed with artifacts of legendary power. The problem is that there are multiples of each. They also become aware of another presence in the tunnels, a non-human cult who practice human sacrifice to their ancient god, a creature that has plagued mankind for thousands of years. Soon they are locked in a desperate battle with the cult and their evil deity. This is Part 1 of a larger episodic story, The Chronicles of Underhill. That is why there are a few subplots that seem to be left dangling: they are picked up in Part 2.</description>

  <description>Women are missing . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the rising number of abused women who've gone missing a statistical anomaly? Or is a serial killer targeting this vulnerable group of women?&lt;br&gt;When the Milwaukee Police Department refuses to investigate because no bodies have been discovered, Lisa Rayburn, the clinical psychologist who discovers the anomaly, is drawn into an investigation to discover the cause after one of her own clients goes missing. She finds herself forming an unlikely alliance with a former policewoman turned security consultant, TJ Peacock, and the husbands of two of the missing women who may themselves be murderers.&lt;br&gt;When TJ is attacked, and a woman looking remarkable like Lisa is found murdered, they know . . . someone is willing to kill to protect his secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they reveal the killer before he gets to them?</description>

  <description>Freya Beauchamp is trapped in 1692, in Salem of all places, with no recollection of her past. A powerful enemy spell has sent her spiraling away so that she is separated by centuries from her mother, Joanna, and sister, Ingrid. This is not good news for a twenty-first-century witch. Not to mention the immediate threat she faces from the wealthy and influential Putnam family. When little Annie Putnam is one of the first to make accusations of witchcraft, her landowner father jumps at the opportunity to consolidate his power and expand his holdings in Puritan Salem Town. If Freya is caught using magic, she will be forced to relive the witch trials, and this time, her immortality will be in question. Meanwhile, twenty-first-century North Hampton has its own snares. Joanna and Norm consult the Oracle for advice, and Freddie and his pixie allies search for a missing totem that could reopen the passages of time and help bring his sister home. When Ingrid bumps into an old flame, she finds that her new love for Detective Matt Noble is in doubt. Moving between past and present, with dizzying plot twists and page-turning suspense, &lt;em&gt;Winds of Salem&lt;/em&gt; is sure to bewitch fans old and new.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In a world ravaged by mutation, a teenage girl must travel into the forbidden Savage Zone to recover lost artifacts or her father’s life is forfeit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;America has been ravaged by a war that has left the eastern half of the country riddled with mutation. Many of the people there exhibit varying degrees of animal traits. Even the plantlife has gone feral.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crossing from west to east is supposed to be forbidden, but sometimes it’s necessary. Some enter the Savage Zone to provide humanitarian relief. Sixteen-year-old Lane’s father goes there to retrieve lost artifacts—he is a Fetch. It’s a dangerous life, but rewarding—until he’s caught.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to save her father, Lane agrees to complete his latest job. That means leaving behind her life of comfort and risking life and limb—and her very DNA—in the Savage Zone. But she’s not alone. In order to complete her objective, Lane strikes a deal with handsome, roguish Rafe. In exchange for his help as a guide, Lane is supposed to sneak him back west. But though Rafe doesn’t exhibit any signs of “manimal” mutation, he’s hardly civilized . . . and he may not be trustworthy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A richly inventive novel about a centuries-old vampire, a spellbound witch, and the mysterious manuscript that draws them together. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; series-with an extra serving of historical realism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A virus that had once been contained has returned, and soon no place will be left untouched by its destruction. But when Cheyenne wakes up in Elysian Fields--a subdivision cut off from the world and its monster-creating virus--she is thrilled to have a chance at survival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   At first, Elysian Fields,with its beautiful houses and manicured lawns, is perfect. Teo Richardson, the older man who stole Cheyenne's heart, built it so they could be together. But when Teo tells Cheyenne there are tests that she and seven other couples must pass to be worthy of salvation, Cheyenne begins to question the perfection of his world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   The people they were before are gone. Cheyenne is now "Persephone," and each couple has been re-named to reflect the most tragic romances ever told. Everyone is fighting to pass the test, to remain in Elysian Fields. Teo dresses them up, tells them when to move and how to act, and in order to pass the test, they must play along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   If they play it right, then they'll be safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   But if they play it wrong, they'll die.</description>

  <description>Haunted by silence, a mute teenage girl is mysteriously given back her voice ... and it is divine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rendered mute at birth, Portia Griffin has been silent for 16 years. Music is her constant companion, along with Felix, her deaf best friend who couldn’t care less whether or not she can speak. If only he were as nonchalant about her newfound interest in the musically gifted Max Hunter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Portia’s silence is about to be broken with the abrupt discovery of her voice, unparalleled in its purity and the power it affords to control those around her. Able to persuade, seduce and destroy using only her voice, Portia embarks on a search for answers about who she really is, and what she is destined to become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by Homer’s Odyssey, SILENT ECHO: A Siren's Tale is an epic story filled with fantasy, romance and original music.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A modern day thrill ride, where a teen girl and her animal companion must participate in a breathtaking race to save her brother's life—and her own.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tella Holloway is losing it. Her brother is sick, and when a dozen doctors can't determine what's wrong, her parents decide to move to Montana for the fresh air. She's lost her friends, her parents are driving her crazy, her brother is dying—and she's helpless to change anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she receives mysterious instructions on how to become a Contender in the Brimstone Bleed. It's an epic race across jungle, desert, ocean, and mountain that could win her the prize she desperately desires: the Cure for her brother's illness. But all the Contenders are after the Cure for people they love, and there's no guarantee that Tella (or any of them) will survive the race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The jungle is terrifying, the clock is ticking, and Tella knows she can't trust the allies she makes. And one big question emerges: Why have so many fallen sick in the first place?</description>

  <description>In the future, humans live in city-like spaceships orbiting far above Earth's toxic atmosphere. No one knows when, or even if, the long-abandoned planet will be habitable again. But faced with dwindling resources and a growing populace, government leaders know they must reclaim their homeland... before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, one hundred juvenile delinquents are being sent on a high-stakes mission to recolonize Earth. After a brutal crash landing, the teens arrive on a savagely beautiful planet they've only seen from space. Confronting the dangers of this rugged new world, they struggle to form a tentative community. But they're haunted by their past and uncertain about the future. To survive, they must learn to trust - and even love - again.</description>

  <description>When Chalice sets off for Branbury in the middle of the night with her grandfather's instructions, she has no idea of the dangers that await her. The King's men have destroyed her home village of Canton and she is suddenly thrown into a Terravailian world that she does not know. Lost and alone, she is hard pressed to evade the iron grasp of the madman who rules the land. With the help of a friendly Chinuk, an old man, and a book that she discovers along the way, not only does she find true friends and true love, but she also finds her true self and what it means to be the Raie'Chaelia.</description>

  <description>It's customary for Gothic romance novels to include a mysterious girl locked in the attic. Hannah Smith just wishes she wasn't that girl. As a narcoleptic and the companion to an earl's daughter with a strange affliction of her own, Hannah knows she's lucky to have a roof over her head and food in her belly when so many orphans starve on the streets. Yet freedom is something Hannah longs for. She did not, however, want her freedom to arrive in the form of kidnapping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taken by handsome Jack Langley to a place known as Freak House, she finds herself under the same roof as a mad scientist, his niece, a mute servant and Jack, a fire starter with a mysterious past. They assure Hannah she is not a prisoner and that they want to help her. The problem is, they think she's the earl's daughter. What will they do when they discover they took the wrong girl?</description>

  <description>To Whom Ever This May Concern;&lt;br&gt;I wish I could tell you the contents of this book were purely fictional. That I, Adela Arthur, was just a normal sixteen year old from Portland and that dragons, giants, elves and mermaids were just myths. I wish these were legends shared from crazy old grandparents to crazy old grandparents around campfires. After all, that is what I used to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never would have thought they lived on the other side of our mirrors in a world called Cielieu. But they do...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never would have thought there were humans, better known as Volsin that lived among them with the ability to create light from a single thought. But there are...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never would have thought I was one of them... But I am...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am the last Arthur and I was brought to the human world after a Volsin, filled with greed, began to strip the light from our kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The human world was supposed to be a safe haven... but he s found us and the only way to stop him is to go back to Cielieu and begin training as a student in the Elpida Castle of Light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said I wish the contents of this book were purely fictional and not my life...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Looking back, I wonder if I had an inkling that my life was about to go from ordinary to extraordinary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sixteen-year-old Lillie Hart meets the gorgeous and mysterious Tom Windsor-Smith for the first time, it’s like fireworks — for her, anyway. Tom looks as if he would be more interested in watching paint dry; as if he is bored by her and by her small Nebraskan town in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Lillie begins to break down the walls of his seemingly impenetrable exterior, she starts to suspect that he holds the answers to her reoccurring nightmares and to the impossible memories which keep bubbling to the surface of her mind — memories of the two of them, together and in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she at last learns the truth about their connection, Lillie discovers that Tom has been hiding an earth-shattering secret; a secret that is bigger — and much more terrifying and beautiful — than the both of them. She also discovers that once you finally understand that the world is round, there is no way to make it flat again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An epic and deeply original sci-fi romance, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein’s theories and the world-bending wonder of true love itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the first chapter at: &lt;a href="http://ingridjonach.com.au/when-the-world-was-flat-excerpt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://ingridjonach.com.au/when-the-w...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Tavia Michaels is the sole survivor of the plane crash that killed her parents. When she starts to see strange visions of a boy she’s never spoken with in real life, she begins to suspect that there’s much about her past that she isn’t being told. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tavia immediately searches for answers, desperate to determine why she feels so drawn to a boy she hardly knows. But when Tavia discovers that the aunt and uncle who took her in after her parents' death may have actually been responsible for the plane crash that killed them--and that she may have been the true intended victim--she flees for the safety of Camden, Maine, where the boy she sees in her visions instructs her to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Tavia is on the run with no one to trust. No one, that is, except for her best friend and longtime crush, Benson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tavia feels torn between the boy who mysteriously comes to her at night and the boy who has been by her side every step of the way. But what Tavia doesn't know is that the world is literally falling apart and that to save it she will have to unite with the boy in her visions. Only problem? To do so would mean rejecting Benson's love. And that's the one thing Tavia Michaels swore she'd never do.</description>

  <description>After the Contamination—an epidemic caused by the super-trendy diet drink ThinPro that turned ordinary citizens into violent, uncontrollable creatures—the government rounded up the "Connies" to protect the remaining population. Now, two years later, the rehabilitated are being allowed home, complete with shock collars that will either control, or kill, them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Velvet Ellis has struggled to care for her ten-year-old sister since her parents were taken in the round up. When she finds her mother in one of the "Kennels," Velvet resolves to do whatever it takes to put her family back together. But the danger isn’t over. It’s beginning all over again…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gritty and grabbing, Velvet is a harrowing, emotionally charged novel for fans of Carrie Ryan and The Walking Dead.</description>

  <description>‘There is a rumour that the Elites don’t bleed.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds of years into the future, wars, riots, resource crises and rising sea-levels have destroyed the old civilisations. Only one city has survived: Neo-Babel, a city full of cultures – and racial tension. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Silver is an Elite, a citizen of Neo-Babel chosen to guard the city due to her superior DNA. She’d never dream of leaving – but then she fails to prevent the assassination of Neo Babel’s president, setting off a chain of events more shocking and devastating than she could ever have imagined. Forced to flee the city with her best friend Butterfly (a boy with genetically-enhanced wings), Silver will have to fight to find her family, uncover the truth about Neo-Babel and come to terms with her complicated feelings for Butterfly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Packed full of adventure, romance, exoticism and the power of friendship, &lt;em&gt;The Elites&lt;/em&gt; is a highly compelling and beautifully written novel from a supremely talented debut author.</description>

  <description>While most seventeen-year-old American girls would refuse to let their parents marry them off to a stranger, Robyn Mason dreams of the mysterious McKale in Ireland, wondering how he’ll look and imagining his cute Irish accent. Prearranged bindings are common for magical families like her own, however when she travels to the whimsical Emerald Isle she discovers there’s more to her betrothal and McKale’s clan than she was led to believe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as an obligatory pairing between Robyn and McKale morphs over time into something they both need. But one giant obstacle stands in the way of their budding romance: a seductive and deadly Fae princess accustomed to getting what she wants—and what she wants is McKale as her plaything. Love, desire, and jealousies collide as Robyn’s family and McKale’s clan must work together to outsmart the powerful Faeries and preserve the only hope left for their people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(YA Urban Fantasy, Romance, Magical Realism, Irish Folklore)</description>

  <description>In QUEST, BOOK 2 of QUEEN'S HONOR: After agreeing to marry Arthur, Guinevere thinks she’s solved all her problems—the protection of Camelaird, the freedom of her cousin, and the power to make a difference. But when she finds herself unable to control her attraction to Lancelot, a chance encounter with the knight threatens to ruin everything she’s strived to achieve. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To complicate matters, when she arrives in Camelot, she realizes she’s caught in an intricate web of magic and ulterior motivations—and some of those motivations seek to expose her unchaste desires for another man before her wedding day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;QUEST is a novella (about ½ the length of a novel). QUEEN'S HONOR will be told in episodic books meant to be read in a few hours each. What’s an episodic book? It’s formatted like your favorite television show or a miniseries where an overall story is broken down into smaller, self-contained stories. Each novella is a story by itself, yet the continuing characters will return for new stories that tie to an overall story-line. For those who don’t have time for longer books, this is a great shorter read, while those who love longer books will get the benefit of more episodes and a deepening story through multiple episodes.</description>

  <description>New York Times bestselling author Christopher Rice brilliantly conjures the shadowed terrors of the Louisiana bayou—where three friends confront a deadly, ancient evil rising to the surface—in this intense and atmospheric new supernatural thriller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been a decade since the Delongpre family vanished near Bayou Rabineaux, and still no one can explain the events of that dark and sweltering night. No one except Niquette Delongpre, the survivor who ran away from the mangled stretch of guardrail on Highway 22 where the impossible occurred…and kept on running. Who left behind her best friends, Ben and Anthem, to save them from her newfound capacity for destruction…and who alone knows the source of her very bizarre—and very deadly—abilities: an isolated strip of swampland called Elysium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An accomplished surgeon, Niquette’s father dreamed of transforming the dense acreage surrounded by murky waters into a palatial compound befitting the name his beloved wife gave to it, Elysium: “the final resting place for the heroic and virtuous.” Then, ten years ago, construction workers dug into a long-hidden well, one that snaked down into the deep, black waters of the Louisiana swamp and stirred something that had been there for centuries—a microscopic parasite that perverts the mind and corrupts the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Niquette is living proof that things done can’t be undone. Nothing will put her family back together again. And nothing can save her. But as Niquette, Ben, and Anthem uncover the truth of a devastating parasite that has the potential to alter the future of humankind, Niquette grasps the most chilling truths of all: someone else has been infected too. And unlike her, this man is not content to live in the shadows. He is intent to use his newfound powers for one reason only: revenge.</description>

  <description>The Registry saved the country from collapse. But stability has come at a price. In this patriotic new America, girls are raised to be brides, sold at auction to the highest bidder. Boys are raised to be soldiers, trained by the state to fight to their death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly eighteen, beautiful Mia Morrissey excitedly awaits the beginning of her auction year. But a warning from her married older sister raises dangerous thoughts. Now, instead of going up on the block, Mia is going to escape to Mexico—and the promise of freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Mia wants is to control her own destiny—a brave and daring choice that will transform her into an enemy of the state, pursued by powerful government agents, ruthless bounty hunters, and a cunning man determined to own her . . . a man who will stop at nothing to get her back.</description>

  <description>Maya Banks, the New York Times bestselling author of erotic romance, romantic suspense, and contemporary romance, has captivated readers with her steamy Scottish historical novels, perfect for fans of Julie Garwood. In Never Love a Highlander, the youngest McCabe brother uses sword and seduction to save his clan—and seal his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caelen McCabe’s young, reckless heart nearly destroyed his clan. Now, putting family loyalty above all else, he steps up to marry his older brother’s jilted bride and salvage the uneasy alliance between two clans. While beautiful Rionna McDonald is a fit wife for any man, Caelen trusts no woman, especially not this sweet temptress who torments him with white-hot longing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the sacrificial lamb in her father’s power game, Rionna will do her duty but vows to protect her heart and her pride from humiliation. Despite everything, though, the heat in Caelen’s touch melts her defenses, and she craves the sensual delights of a husband who guards his emotions as fiercely as his clan. But when the ultimate battle for the McCabe legacy is upon them, Rionna’s true warrior spirit emerges. She will risk the wrath of her father, the fury of her enemies, and her life to prove to Caelen that his wife’s love is too precious to lose.</description>

  <description>Thalli has fifteen minutes and twenty-three seconds left to live. The toxic gas that will complete her annihilation is invading her bloodstream. But she is not afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thalli is different than others in The State. She feels things. She asks questions. And in the State, this is not tolerated. The Ten scientists who survived the nuclear war that destroyed the world above believe that emotion was at the core of what went wrong—and they have genetically removed it from the citizens they have since created. Thalli has kept her malformation secret from those who have monitored her for most of her life, but when she receives an ancient piece of music to record as her community’s assigned musician, she can no longer keep her emotions secreted away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seen as a threat to the harmony of her Pod, Thalli is taken to the Scientists for immediate annihilation. But before that can happen, Berk—her former Pod mate who is being groomed as a Scientist—steps in and persuades the Scientists to keep Thalli alive as a test subject.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more time she spends in the Scientist’s Pod, the clearer it becomes that things are not as simple as she was programmed to believe. She hears stories of a Designer—stories that fill her mind with more questions: Who can she trust? What is this emotion called love? And what if she isn’t just an anomaly, but part of a greater design?</description>

  <description>When he was bad, he was so very, very good…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London’s Ultimate Bad Boy…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physically reckless, irrepressibly roguish, and poised on the brink of ruin, Jonathon Westruther, Earl of Davenport, returns from the dead only to throw himself into dissipation. Until he meets his worst nightmare: a straitlaced former schoolteacher he can’t get out of his head. He resolves to seduce the delightful Miss Hilary deVere by fair means or foul. But when his past returns to endanger Hilary, he must protect her at all costs…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meets England’s Most Proper Miss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dismissed from her post at a ladies’ academy because of prejudice against her uncouth family, Hilary will do anything to avoid going back to live with her loutish brothers. She longs for a London season to show the world a deVere can behave with utmost decorum and to find a respectable husband. Everything about Lord Davenport appalls her, but desperation makes strange bedfellows. To get to London, Hilary strikes a bargain with the devilish Davenport, confident that she’s immune to his charm. But as she discovers surprising depths beneath his rakish surface, this infamous scoundrel becomes more temptation than even the most proper lady can withstand…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/londonslasttruescoundrel/ChristinaBrooke" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/londonslasttr...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>The House of Night series is set in a world very much like our own, except in 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres have always existed.  In this first book in the series, Zoey enters the House of Night, a school where, after having undergone the Change, she will train to become an adult vampire -- that is, if she makes it through the Change.  Not all of those who are chosen do.  It's tough to begin a new life, away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.  She has been Marked as special by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx.  But she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers.  When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite club, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends.</description>

  <description>Lady Mercy likes her life neat and tidy. She prides herself on being practical - like her engagement to Viscount Grey, whose dark colouring co-ordinates very well with her favourite furnishings. But things start to get messy when her best friend abandons her fiance at the altar, leaving it up to Mercy to help the couple. There's just one problem. The jilted man is Rafe Hartley—Mercy's former husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rafe has not forgiven Mercy for deserting him when they were seventeen. Their hasty marriage was declared void by law, but in his eyes the bossy little vixen was still his wife, even if the marriage lasted only a few hours. And Mercy "Silky Drawers" Danforthe still owes him a wedding night.</description>

  <description>The Arrivals is the second novel for adults by internationally bestselling author Melissa Marr.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chloe walks into a bar and blows five years of sobriety. When she wakes, she finds herself in an unfamiliar world, The Wasteland. She discovers people from all times and places have also arrived there: Kitty and Jack, a brother and sister from the Wild West; Edgar, a prohibition bootlegger; Francis, a one-time hippie; Melody, a mentally unbalanced 1950s housewife; and Hector, a former carnival artist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None know why they arrived there--or if there is way out of a world populated by monsters and filled with corruption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as she did in Graveminder, Marr has created a vivid fantasy world that will enthrall. Melissa Marr's The Arrivals is a thoroughly original and wildly imagined tale about making choices in a life where death is unpredictable and often temporary.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bones&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Fringe&lt;/em&gt; in a big, dark, scary, brilliantly-plotted urban thriller that will leave you guessing until the very end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly Boswell knows how to keep secrets. Living in a DC trailer park, she knows better than to share anything that would make her a target with her classmates. Like her mother's job as an exotic dancer, her obsession with the personal ads, and especially the emotions she can taste when she brushes against someone's skin. But when a serial killer goes on a killing spree and starts attacking students, leaving cryptic ads in the newspaper that only Nearly can decipher, she confides in the one person she shouldn't trust: the new guy at school—a reformed bad boy working undercover for the police, doing surveillance. . . on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly might be the one person who can put all the clues together, and if she doesn't figure it all out soon—she'll be next.</description>

  <description>In a vastly different and darker Philadelphia of 1844, steam power has been repressed, war threatens from deep, dark waters, and one young lady of high social standing  is expecting a surprise at her seventeenth birthday party–but certainly not the one she gets!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jordan Astraea, who has lived out all of her life in Philadelphia’s most exclusive neighborhood, is preparing to celebrate her birthday with friends, family and all the extravagance they might muster. The young man who is most often her dashing companion, Rowen Burchette, has told her a surprise awaits her and her best friend, Catrina Hollindale, wouldn’t miss this night for all the world!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But storm clouds are gathering and threatening to do far more than dampen her party plans because someone in the Astraea household has committed the greatest of social sins by Harboring a Weather Witch.</description>

  <description>Piper's world is dying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each day brings hotter temperatures and heat bubbles that threaten to destroy the earth. Amid this global heating crisis, Piper lives under the oppressive rule of her mother, who suffocates her even more than the weather does. Everything changes on her eighteenth birthday, when her mother is called away on a mysterious errand and Piper seizes her first opportunity for freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piper discovers a universe she never knew existed—a sphere of gods and monsters—and realizes that her world is not the only one in crisis. While gods battle for control of the Underworld, Piper’s life spirals out of control as she struggles to find the answer to the secret that has been kept from her since birth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An imaginative melding of mythology and dystopia, Solstice is the first YA novel by talented newcomer P. J. Hoover.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He's no Prince Charming. She doesn't have a pumpkin coach. Sometimes love is nothing like a fairy tale; it's even better...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's Never Too Late&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The infamous Laura Falkner has returned to London society in disguise. Determined to clear her father's name, she becomes a companion to elderly Lady Josephine—only to learn the woman's nephew is none other than Alexander Ross, the devilish Earl of Copley, the man Laura once loved with all her heart. The same man who'd accused her father of theft and forced them to flee England.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Fall Head Over Heels In Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex has never forgotten Laura—or forgiven himself for letting her go. Today, Laura is as lovely—and stubborn—as ever, and her attempts at crime-solving are putting her in danger. The only way Alex can keep her safe is to marry her. But how can this notorious rake convince Laura that his heart is true…before the clock strikes twelve?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.macmillan.com/strokeofmidnight-1/OliviaDrake" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://us.macmillan.com/strokeofmidni...&lt;/a&gt; </description>

  <description>The sequel you’ve been waiting for: the follow-up to the sensational #1 bestseller The Devil Wears Prada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost a decade has passed since Andy Sachs quit the job “a million girls would die for” working for Miranda Priestly at Runway magazine—a dream that turned out to be a nightmare. Andy and Emily, her former nemesis and co-assistant, have since joined forces to start a highend bridal magazine. The Plunge has quickly become required reading for the young and stylish. Now they get to call all the shots: Andy writes and travels to her heart’s content; Emily plans parties and secures advertising like a seasoned pro. Even better, Andy has met the love of her life. Max Harrison, scion of a storied media family, is confident, successful, and drop-dead gorgeous. Their wedding will be splashed across all the society pages as their friends and family gather to toast the glowing couple. Andy Sachs is on top of the world. But karma’s a bitch. The morning of her wedding, Andy can’t shake the past. And when she discovers a secret letter with crushing implications, her wedding-day jitters turn to cold dread. Andy realizes that nothing—not her husband, nor her beloved career—is as it seems. She never suspected that her efforts to build a bright new life would lead her back to the darkness she barely escaped ten years ago—and directly into the path of the devil herself...</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Schuyler Van Alen is starting to get more comfortable with her newfound vampire powers, but she still has many unanswered questions. A trip to Italy in search of her grandfather only serves to make things more confusing. What secrets are the leaders of The Committee hiding? Meanwhile, back in New York, preparations are feverishly underway for the famous Four Hundred Ball. In true Blue Blood fashion, the ball is totally fab, complete with masks-and hidden behind this masquerade is a revelation that will change the course of a young vampire's destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thrilling sequel in Melissa de la Cruz's vampire mythology has all the glamour, attitude, and vampire lore that made the first book a hit.</description>

  <description>When the Mayflower set sail in 1620, it carried on board the men and women who would shape America: Miles Standish; John Alden; Constance Hopkins. But some among the Pilgrims were not pure of heart; they were not escaping religious persecution. Indeed, they were not even human. They were vampires.The vampires assimilated quickly into the New World. Rising to levels of enormous power, wealth, and influence, they were the celebrated blue bloods of American society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Blue Bloods&lt;/em&gt; vowed that their immortal status would remain a closely guarded secret. And they kept that secret for centuries. But now, in New York City, the secret is seeping out. Schuyler Van Alen is a sophomore at a prestigious private school. She prefers baggy, vintage clothes instead of the Prada and pearls worn by her classmates, and she lives with her reclusive grandmother in a dilapated mansion. Schuyler is a loner...and happy that way. Suddenly, when she turns fifteen, there is a visible mosaic of blue veins on her arm. She starts to crave raw food and she is having flashbacks to ancient times. Then a popular girl from her school is found dead... drained of all her blood. Schuyler doesn't know what to think, but she wants to find out the secrets the Blue Bloods are keeping.  But is she herself in danger?</description>

  <description>The author of The September Queen explores Tudor England with the tale of Bess of Hardwick—the formidable four-time widowed Tudor dynast who became one of the most powerful women in the history of England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her twelfth birthday, Bess of Hardwick receives the news that she is to be a waiting gentlewoman in the household of Lady Zouche. Armed with nothing but her razor-sharp wit and fetching looks, Bess is terrified of leaving home. But as her family has neither the money nor the connections to find her a good husband, she must go to facilitate her rise in society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bess arrives at the glamorous court of King Henry VIII, she is thrust into a treacherous world of politics and intrigue, a world she must quickly learn to navigate. The gruesome fates of Henry’s wives convince Bess that marrying is a dangerous business. Even so, she finds the courage to wed not once, but four times. Bess outlives one husband, then another, securing her status as a woman of property. But it is when she is widowed a third time that she is left with a large fortune and even larger decisions—discovering that, for a woman of substance, the power and the possibilities are endless . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The eagerly awaited addition to the series begun with the New York Times best-seller Life As We Knew It, in which a meteor knocks the moon off its orbit and the world changes forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been more than two years since Jon Evans and his family left Pennsylvania, hoping to find a safe place to live, yet Jon remains haunted by the deaths of those he loved. His prowess on a soccer field has guaranteed him a home in a well-protected enclave. But Jon is painfully aware that a missed goal, a careless word, even falling in love, can put his life and the lives of his mother, his sister Miranda, and her husband, Alex, in jeopardy. Can Jon risk doing what is right in a world gone so terribly wrong?</description>

They must  into their enemies' past to find the answers they need, even if it means being drawn deeper into their savagely beautiful world. But one of the girls is not what she seems...and Gemma finds an unlikely ally as she struggles to save herself. Will it be enough to break an ancient curse that no one has ever escaped from alive?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Eva is a chosen one. Chosen to live, while others meet a swift and painful death from an incurable virus so lethal, a person is dead within days of symptoms emerging. In the POD system, a series of underground habitats built by the government, she waits with the other chosen for the deadly virus to claim those above. Separated from family and friends, it's in the PODs she meets David. And while true love might not conquer all, it's a balm for the broken soul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a year, scientists believe the population has died, and without living hosts, so has the virus. That's the theory, anyway. But when the PODs are opened, survivors find the surface holds a vicious secret. The virus mutated, infecting those left top-side and creating... monsters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva and David hide from the infected in the abandoned PODs. Together they try to build a life--a new beginning. But the infected follow and are relentless in their attacks. Leaving Eva and David to fight for survival, and pray for a cure.</description>

  <description>It started with a bus crash.&lt;br&gt;Daisy Appleby was a little girl when it happened, and she barely remembers the accident or being brought back to life. At that moment, though, she became one of the first subjects in a covert government program that tests a drug called Revive.&lt;br&gt;Now fifteen, Daisy has died and been Revived five times. Each death means a new name, a new city, a new identity. The only constant in Daisy's life is constant change.&lt;br&gt;Then Daisy meets Matt and Audrey McKean, charismatic siblings who quickly become her first real friends. But if she's ever to have a normal life, Daisy must escape from an experiment that's much larger--and more sinister--than she ever imagined.&lt;br&gt;From its striking first chapter to its emotionally charged ending, Cat Patrick's &lt;em&gt;Revived&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting story about what happens when life and death collide.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A novel about the end of days full of surprising beginnings&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The world is living in the shadow of oncoming disaster. An asteroid is set to strike the earth in just one week’s time; catastrophe is unavoidable. The question isn’t how to save the world—the question is, what to do with the time that's left? Against this stark backdrop, three island teens wrestle with intertwining stories of love, friendship and family—all with the ultimate stakes at hand. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Alexandra Coutts's TUMBLE &amp;amp; FALL is a powerful story of courage, love, and hope at the end of the world. </description>

  <description>My name is Beatrice. When I was born, I was blessed with the Sight. I was immediately removed from my parents and enrolled in the Institution. At the age of twelve, I had my first true vision, earning my raven’s wings. And when I turned seventeen, one of my visions came true. Things haven’t been the same since. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Institution depends on me to keep the City safe from our enemy, the Dreamcatchers, but I’m finding it harder to do while keeping a secret from everyone, including my best friend Gabe. It is a secret that could put us all in danger. A secret that could kill me and everyone close to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the enemy has been coming to me in my dreams, and I think I’m falling in love with him. He says they’re coming. He says they’re angry. And I think I’ve already helped them win.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An imaginative story of a woman caught in an alternate world—where she will need to learn the skills of magic to survive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nora Fischer’s dissertation is stalled and her boyfriend is about to marry another woman.  During a miserable weekend at a friend’s wedding, Nora wanders off and walks through a portal into a different world where she’s transformed from a drab grad student into a stunning beauty.  Before long, she has a set of glamorous new friends and her romance with gorgeous, masterful Raclin is heating up. It’s almost too good to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then the elegant veneer shatters. Nora’s new fantasy world turns darker, a fairy tale gone incredibly wrong. Making it here will take skills Nora never learned in graduate school. Her only real ally—and a reluctant one at that—is the magician Aruendiel, a grim, reclusive figure with a biting tongue and a shrouded past. And it will take her becoming Aruendiel’s student—and learning magic herself—to survive. When a passage home finally opens, Nora must weigh her "real life" against the dangerous power of love and magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For lovers of Lev Grossman's The Magicians series (&lt;em&gt;The Magicians &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Magician King&lt;/em&gt;) and Deborah Harkness's All Souls Trilogy (&lt;em&gt;A Discovery of Witches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shadow of Night&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She could save the world—or destroy it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Evangeline "Evie" Greene leads a charmed life, until she begins experiencing horrifying hallucinations. When an apocalyptic event decimates her Louisiana hometown, Evie realizes her hallucinations were actually visions of the future—and they're still happening. Fighting for her life and desperate for answers, she must turn to her wrong-side-of-the-bayou classmate: Jack Deveaux.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But she can't do either alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his mile-long rap sheet, wicked grin, and bad attitude, Jack is like no boy Evie has ever known. Even though he once scorned her and everything she represented, he agrees to protect Evie on her quest. She knows she can't totally depend on Jack. If he ever cast that wicked grin her way, could she possibly resist him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can Evie trust?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jack and Evie race to find the source of her visions, they meet others who have gotten the same call. An ancient prophesy is being played out, and Evie is not the only one with special powers. A group of twenty-two teens has been chosen to reenact the ultimate battle between good and evil. But it's not always clear who is on which side.</description>

  <description>What fortune awaited sweet, timid Percy Parker at Athens Academy? Considering how few of Queen Victoria’s Londoners knew of it, the great Romanesque fortress was dreadfully imposing, and little could Percy guess what lay inside. She had never met the powerful and mysterious Professor Alexi Rychman, knew nothing of the growing shadow, the Ripper and other supernatural terrors against which his coterie stood guard. She knew simply that she was different, haunted, with her snow-white hair, pearlescent skin and uncanny gifts. But this arched stone doorway offered a portal to a new life, an education far from the convent—and an invitation to an intimate yet dangerous dance at the threshold of life and death…</description>

  <description>Rory Miller had one chance to fight back and she took it. Rory survived and the serial killer who attacked her escaped. Now that the infamous Steven Nell is on the loose, Rory must enter the witness protection program. Entering the program alongside her, is her father and sister Darcy. The trio starts a new life and a new beginning leaving their friends and family behind without a goodbye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting over in a new town with only each other is unimaginable for Rory and Darcy. They were inseparable as children but now they can barely stand each other. As the sisters settle in to Juniper Landing, a picturesque vacation island, it seems like their new home may be just the fresh start they need. They fall in with a group of beautiful, carefree teens and spend their days surfing, partying on the beach, and hiking into endless sunsets. Just as they’re starting to feel safe again, one of their new friends goes missing. Is it a coincidence? Or is the nightmare beginning all over again?</description>

  <description>Two years ago, the aliens made contact. Now Cara Sweeney is going to be sharing a bathroom with one of them.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Handpicked to host the first-ever L’eihr exchange student, Cara thinks her future is set. Not only does she get a free ride to her dream college, she’ll have inside information about the mysterious L’eihrs that every journalist would kill for. Cara’s blog following is about to skyrocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, Cara isn’t sure what to think when she meets Aelyx. Humans and L’eihrs have nearly identical DNA, but cold, infuriatingly brilliant Aelyx couldn’t seem more alien. She’s certain about one thing, though: no human boy is this good-looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Cara's classmates get swept up by anti-L'eihr paranoia, Midtown High School suddenly isn't safe anymore. Threatening notes appear in Cara's locker, and a police officer has to escort her and Aelyx to class. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cara finds support in the last person she expected. She realizes that Aelyx isn’t just her only friend; she's fallen hard for him. But Aelyx has been hiding the truth about the purpose of his exchange, and its potentially deadly consequences. Soon Cara will be in for the fight of her life—not just for herself and the boy she loves, but for the future of her planet.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Many are called...&lt;br&gt;She alone can save the world and become Death's bride.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cobweb Bride&lt;/em&gt; is a history-flavored fantasy novel with romantic elements of the Persephone myth, about Death's ultimatum to the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if you killed someone and then fell in love with them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an alternate Renaissance world, somewhere in an imaginary "pocket" of Europe called the Kingdom of Lethe, Death comes, in the form of a grim Spaniard, to claim his Bride. Until she is found, in a single time-stopping moment all dying stops. There is no relief for the mortally wounded and the terminally ill....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Covered in white cobwebs of a thousand snow spiders she lies in the darkness... Her skin is cold as snow... Her eyes frozen... Her gaze, fiercely alive...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While kings and emperors send expeditions to search for a suitable Bride for Death, armies of the undead wage an endless war... A black knight roams the forest at the command of his undead father ... Spies and political treacheries abound at the imperial Silver Court.... Murdered lovers find themselves locked in the realm of the living...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look closer — through the cobweb filaments of her hair and along each strand shine stars...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And one small village girl, Percy—an unwanted, ungainly middle daughter—is faced with the responsibility of granting her dying grandmother the desperate release she needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, Percy joins the crowds of other young women of the land in a desperate quest to Death's own mysterious holding in the deepest forests of the North...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And everyone is trying to stop her.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt; is a thrilling and creepy photo-novel perfect for fans of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller&lt;em&gt; Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For sixteen-year-old Dan Crawford, New Hampshire College Prep is more than a summer program—it's a lifeline. An outcast at his high school, Dan is excited to finally make some friends in his last summer before college. But when he arrives at the program, Dan learns that his dorm for the summer used to be a sanatorium, more commonly known as an asylum. And not just any asylum—a last resort for the criminally insane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dan and his new friends, Abby and Jordan, explore the hidden recesses of their creepy summer home, they soon discover it's no coincidence that the three of them ended up here. Because the asylum holds the key to a terrifying past. And there are some secrets that refuse to stay buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring found photos of unsettling history and real abandoned asylums and filled with chilling mystery and page-turning suspense, Madeleine Roux's teen debut, &lt;em&gt;Asylum&lt;/em&gt;, is a horror story that treads the line between genius and insanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Every girl who had taken the test has died.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Now it's Kate's turn.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's always been just Kate and her mom - and her mother is dying. Her last wish? To move back to her childhood home. So Kate's going to start at a new school with no friends, no other family and the fear that her mother won't live past the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she meets Henry. Dark. Tortured. And mesmerizing. He claims to be Hades, god of the Underworld - and if she accepts his bargain, he'll keep her mother alive while Kate tries to pass seven tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate is sure he's crazy - until she sees him bring a girl back from the dead. Now saving her mother seems crazily possible. If she succeeds, she'll become Henry's future bride and a goddess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;If she fails...&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>There is need. And then there is Fate. &lt;br&gt;Being destined to become some kind of supernatural electrical outlet isn't exactly awesome--especially when Alexandria's "other half" is everywhere she goes. Seth's in her training room, outside her classes, and keeps showing up in her bedroom--so not cool. Their connection does have some benefits, like staving off her nightmares of the tragic showdown with her mother, but it has no effect on what Alex feels for the forbidden, pure-blooded Aiden. Or what he will do--and sacrifice--for her. When daimons infiltrate the Covenants and attack students, the gods send furies--lesser gods determined to eradicate any threat to the Covenants and to the gods, and that includes the Apollyon--and Alex. And if that and hordes of aether-sucking monsters didn't blow bad enough, a mysterious threat seems willing to do anything to neutralize Seth, even if that means forcing Alex into servitude--or killing her. When the gods are involved, some decisions can never, ever be undone.</description>

  <description>A can’t-miss read for fans of Deborah Harkness and Karen Marie Moning, The Angel Stone weaves a tale of ancient folklore and thrilling fantasy with a passionate love story that transcends time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For Callie McFay, a half-witch/half-fey professor of folklore and Gothic literature, the fight to save the enchanted town of Fairwick, New York, is far from over. After a hostile takeover by the Grove—a sinister group of witches and their cohorts—many of the local fey have been banished or killed, including Callie’s one true love. And in place of the spirit of tolerance and harmony, the new administration at Fairwick College has fostered an air of danger and distrust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With her unique magical abilities, Callie is the only one who can rescue her friends from exile and restore order to the school—a task that requires her to find the Angel Stone, a legendary talisman of immense power. Propelled on an extraordinary quest back to seventeenth-century Scotland, Callie risks her life to obtain the stone. Yet when she encounters a sexy incarnation of her lost love, she finds the greater risk is to her heart. As the fate of Fairwick hangs in the balance, Callie must make a wrenching choice: reclaim a chance for eternal passion or save everything she holds dear.</description>

  <description>"I was sixteen the first time my grandmother died . . ."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Parsons has never seen Amber House, the grand Maryland estate that's been in her family for three centuries. She's never walked its hedge maze nor found its secret chambers; she's never glimpsed the shades that haunt it, nor hunted for lost diamonds in its walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all of that is about to change. After her grandmother passes away, Sarah and her friend Jackson decide to search for the diamonds--and the house comes alive. She discovers that she can see visions of the house's past, like the eighteenth-century sea captain who hid the jewels, or the glamorous great-grandmother driven mad by grief. She grows closer to both Jackson and a young man named Richard Hathaway, whose family histories are each deeply entwined with her own. But when the visions start to threaten the person she holds most dear, Sarah must do everything she can to get to the bottom of the house's secrets, and stop the course of history before it is cemented forever.</description>

  <description>A dark and sexy reimagining of the Sleeping Beauty fairy tale from the author of THE DEMON TRAPPERS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Briar Rose, life is anything but a fairy tale. She's stuck in a small town in deepest Georgia with parents who won't let her out of their sight, a bunch of small-minded, gossiping neighbours and an evil ex who's spreading nasty rumours about what she may or may not have done in the back of his car. She's tired of it all, so when, on her sixteenth birthday, her parents tell her that she is cursed and will go to sleep for a hundred years when the clock strikes midnight, she's actually kind of glad to leave it all behind. She says her goodbyes, lies down, and closes her eyes . . . And then she wakes up. Cold, alone and in the middle of the darkest, most twisted fairy tale she could ever have dreamed of. Now Briar must fight her way out of the story that has been created for her, but she can't do it alone. She never believed in handsome princes, but now she's met one her only chance is to put her life in his hands, or there will be no happy ever after and no waking up.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Nothing is as it seems in this darkly romantic tale of infatuation and possession, inspired by Daphne du Maurier’s &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becca was the perfect girlfriend: smart, gorgeous, and loved by everyone at New England’s premier boarding school, Thorn Abbey. But Becca’s dead. And her boyfriend, Max, can’t get over his loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Tess transfers to Thorn Abbey. She’s shy, insecure, and ordinary—everything that Becca wasn’t. And despite her roommate’s warnings, she falls for brooding Max.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Max finally has a reason to move on. Except it won’t be easy. Because Becca may be gone, but she’s not quite ready to let him go…</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring.... until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>Every other day, Kali D’Angelo is a normal sixteen-year-old girl. She goes to public high school. She argues with her father. She’s human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then every day in between . . . she’s something else entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though she still looks like herself, every twenty-four hours predatory instincts take over and Kali becomes a feared demon-hunter with the undeniable urge to hunt, trap, and kill zombies, hellhounds, and other supernatural creatures. Kali has no idea why she is the way she is, but she gives in to instinct anyway. Even though the government considers it environmental terrorism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kali notices a mark on the lower back of a popular girl at school, she knows instantly that the girl is marked for death by one of these creatures. Kali has twenty-four hours to save her, and unfortunately she’ll have to do it as a human. With the help of a few new friends, Kali takes a risk that her human body might not survive . . . and learns the secrets of her mysterious condition in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A haunted house, a buried mystery, and a very angry ghost make this one unforgettable thriller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade loves the house she's just moved into with her family. She doesn't even mind being the new girl at the high school: It's a fresh start, and there's that one guy with the dreamy blue eyes. . . . But then things begin happening. Strange, otherworldly things. Jade's little brother claims to see a glimmering girl in his room. Jade's jewelry gets moved around, as if by an invisible hand. Kids at school whisper behind her back like they know something she doesn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Jade must face an impossible fact: that her perfect house is haunted. Haunted by a ghost who's seeking not just vengeance, but the truth. The ghost of a girl who ruled Jade's school — until her untimely death last year. It's up to Jade to put the pieces together before her own life is at stake. As Jade investigates the mystery, she discovers that her new friends in town have more than a few deep, dark secrets. But is one of them a murderer?</description>

  <description>One day Han Alister catches three young wizards setting fire to the sacred mountain of Hanalea. Han takes an amulet away from Micah Bayar, son of the High Wizard, to ensure the boy won’t use it against him. The amulet once belonged to the Demon King, who nearly destroyed the world a millennium ago. With a magical piece so powerful at stake, Han knows that the Bayars will stop at nothing to get it back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Princess Raisa ana’Marianna has her own battle to fight. She’s just returned to court after three years of riding and hunting with her father’s family. Raisa aspires to be like Hanalea, the legendary warrior queen who killed the Demon King and saved the world. But it seems that her mother has other plans for her—plans that include a suitor who goes against everything the Queendom stands for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Seven Realms will tremble when the lives of Han and Raisa collide in this stunning page-turner from best-selling author Cinda Williams Chima.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Riley Blackthorne just needs a chance to prove herself—and that’s exactly what the demons are counting on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Riley, the only daughter of legendary Demon Trapper, Paul Blackthorne, has always dreamed of following in her father's footsteps. The good news is, with human society seriously disrupted by economic upheaval and Lucifer increasing the number of demons in all major cities, Atlanta’s local Trappers’ Guild needs all the help they can get—even from a girl. When she’s not keeping up with her homework or trying to manage her growing crush on fellow apprentice, Simon, Riley’s out saving distressed citizens from foul-mouthed little devils – Grade One Hellspawn only, of course, per the strict rules of the Guild. Life’s about as normal as can be for the average demon-trapping teen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then a Grade Five Geo-Fiend crashes Riley’s routine assignment at a library, jeopardizing her life and her chosen livelihood. And, as if that wasn’t bad enough, sudden tragedy strikes the Trappers’ Guild, spinning Riley down a more dangerous path than she ever could have imagined. As her whole world crashes down around her, who can Riley trust with her heart—and her life?</description>

  <description>There’s something achingly familiar about Daniel Grigori.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious and aloof, he captures Luce Price’s attention from the moment she sees him on her first day at the Sword &amp;amp; Cross boarding school in sultry Savannah. He’s the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce – he goes out of his way to make that very clear. But she can’t let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, Luce has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret...even if it kills her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dangerously exciting and darkly romantic, FALLEN is a page-turning thriller and the ultimate love story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Lily Parker is new to St. Sophia’s School for Girls, but she’s already learned that magic can be your best friend... or your worst enemy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say absolute power corrupts absolutely. Turns out, even a little magic can turn you to the dark side. That’s why Lily has to learn how to control her newly discovered paranormal abilities, on top of avoiding the snobs who think they run her school, nursing a crush on a cute sophomore with a big, werewolf-y secret, and fighting the good fight with her best friend Scout as they take on Chicago’s nastiest nightlife—including the tainted magic users known as Reapers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Lily’s invited to a private meeting with Sebastian. He’s hot, powerful, and offering to help her harness the magic flowing in her veins in a way no one else can. He’s also a Reaper. Lily can’t hide her suspicions. But she’ll soon find out that the line between good and evil isn’t always clear…</description>

  <description>The most popular pirate story ever written in English, featuring one of literature’s most beloved “bad guys,” Treasure Island has been happily devoured by several generations of boys—and girls—and grownups. Its unforgettable characters include: young Jim Hawkins, who finds himself owner of a map to Treasure Island, where the fabled pirate booty is buried; honest Captain Smollett, heroic Dr. Livesey, and the good-hearted but obtuse Squire Trelawney, who help Jim on his quest for the treasure; the frightening Blind Pew, double-dealing Israel Hands, and seemingly mad Ben Gunn, buccaneers of varying shades of menace; and, of course, garrulous, affable, ambiguous Long John Silver, who is one moment a friendly, laughing, one-legged sea-cook . . .and the next a dangerous pirate leader!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unexpected and complex relationship that develops between Silver and Jim helps transform what seems at first to be a simple, rip-roaring adventure story into a deeply moving study of a boy’s growth into manhood, as he learns hard lessons about friendship, loyalty, courage and honor—and the uncertain meaning of good and evil.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An angel is sent to Earth on a mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But falling in love is not part of the plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three angels – Gabriel, the warrior; Ivy, the healer; and Bethany, the youngest and most human – are sent by Heaven to bring good to a world falling under the influence of darkness. They work hard to conceal their luminous glow, superhuman powers, and, most dangerous of all, their wings, all the while avoiding all human attachments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Bethany meets Xavier Woods, and neither of them is able to resist the attraction between them. Gabriel and Ivy do everything in their power to intervene, but the bond between Xavier and Bethany seems too strong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The angel’s mission is urgent, and dark forces are threatening. Will love ruin Bethany or save her?</description>

  <description>In the City of Lights, two star-crossed lovers battle a fate that is destined to tear them apart again and again for eternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kate Mercier's parents die in a tragic car accident, she leaves her life--and memories--behind to live with her grandparents in Paris. For Kate, the only way to survive her pain is escaping into the world of books and Parisian art. Until she meets Vincent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious, charming, and devastatingly handsome, Vincent threatens to melt the ice around Kate's guarded heart with just his smile. As she begins to fall in love with Vincent, Kate discovers that he's a revenant--an undead being whose fate forces him to sacrifice himself over and over again to save the lives of others. Vincent and those like him are bound in a centuries-old war against a group of evil revenants who exist only to murder and betray. Kate soon realizes that if she follows her heart, she may never be safe again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Set in medieval England, this lively historical romance delivers the trademark wit that fans have come to know and love from the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;-bestselling author.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Garron of Kersey returns home from the king's service to claim his title as Baron Wareham, he's shocked to find Wareham Castle very nearly destroyed by a man called the Black Demon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; According to the last starving servants still clinging to life inside the castle walls, the Black Demon was looking for gold belonging to Garron's brother Arthur. Among his remaining servants is the enigmatic Merry, the bastard child of the castle's priest. Garron quickly realizes that she is much more than a servant: She reads and writes and makes lists, just as he does. Together they bring Wareham back to its former splendor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But this is only the beginning. Did Arthur have a cache of gold? Who is the Black Demon? And the biggest question of all: Who is Merry?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Frannie Cavanaugh is a good Catholic girl with a bit of a wicked streak. She has spent years keeping everyone at a distance---even her closest friends---and it seems as if her senior year is going to be more of the same . . . until Luc Cain enrolls in her class. No one knows where he came from, but Frannie can't seem to stay away from him. &lt;br&gt;What she doesn't know is that Luc is on a mission. He's been sent from Hell itself to claim Frannie's soul. It should be easy---all he has to do is get her to sin, and Luc is as tempting as they come. Frannie doesn't stand a chance. But he has to work fast, because if the infernals are after her, the celestials can't be far behind. And sure enough, it's not long before the angel Gabriel shows up, willing to do anything to keep Luc from getting what he came for. It isn't long before they find themselves fighting for more than just Frannie's soul. &lt;br&gt;But if Luc fails, there will be Hell to pay . . . for all of them.</description>

  <description>Finnikin of the Rock and his guardian, Sir Topher, have not been home to their beloved Lumatere for ten years.  Not since the dark days when the royal family was murdered and the kingdom put under a terrible curse.  But then Finnikin is summoned to meet Evanjalin, a young woman with an incredible claim: the heir to the throne of Lumatere, Prince Balthazar, is alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evanjalin is determined to return home and she is the only one who can lead them to the heir.  As they journey together, Finnikin is affected by her arrogance . . . and her hope.  He begins to believe he will see his childhood friend, Prince Balthazar, again.  And that their cursed people will be able to enter Lumatere and be reunited with those trapped inside.  He even believes he will find his imprisoned father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Evanjalin is not what she seems.  And the truth will test not only Finnikin's faith in her . . . but in himself.</description>

      <![CDATA[Unreadable. I hated Evanjalin (I should have known from the spelling of her named). The POV and storyline kept jumping back and forth and gave me a headache. We're also supposed to care about the entire history from the day of creation of this world and all of its nation, it seems. Too much world...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Fans of Amanda Hocking's novel, &lt;em&gt;Wake,&lt;/em&gt; will dive into this paranormal romance featuring mermaids--the killer kind--and won't come up for air!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calder White lives in the cold, clear waters of Lake Superior, the only brother in a family of murderous mermaids. To survive, Calder and his sisters prey on humans and absorb their positive energy. Usually, they select their victims at random, but this time around, the underwater clan chooses its target for a reason: revenge. They want to kill Jason Hancock, the man they blame for their mother's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's going to take a concerted effort to lure the aquaphobic Hancock onto the water. Calder's job is to gain Hancock's trust by getting close to his family. Relying on his irresistible good looks and charm, Calder sets out to seduce Hancock's daughter Lily. Easy enough, but Calder screws everything up by falling in love--just as Lily starts to suspect there's more to the monster-in-the-lake legends than she ever imagined, and just as the mermaids threaten to take matters into their own hands, forcing Calder to choose between them and the girl he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing's for sure: whatever Calder decides, the outcome won't be pretty.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a world free of bloodshed and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not that world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art student and monster's apprentice Karou finally has the answers she has always sought. She knows who she is—and &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; she is. But with this knowledge comes another truth she would give anything to undo: She loved the enemy and he betrayed her, and a world suffered for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this stunning sequel to the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/em&gt;, Karou must decide how far she'll go to avenge her people. Filled with heartbreak and beauty, secrets and impossible choices, &lt;em&gt;Days of Blood &amp;amp; Starlight&lt;/em&gt; finds Karou and Akiva on opposing sides as an age-old war stirs back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Karou and her allies build a monstrous army in a land of dust and starlight, Akiva wages a different sort of battle: a battle for redemption. For &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can any hope be salvaged from the ashes of their broken dream?</description>

  <description>Amy and Elder have finally left the oppressive walls of the spaceship&lt;em&gt; Godspeed&lt;/em&gt; behind. They're ready to start life afresh--to build a home--on Centauri-Earth, the planet that Amy has traveled 25 trillion miles across the universe to experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But this new Earth isn't the paradise Amy had been hoping for. There are giant pterodactyl-like birds, purple flowers with mind-numbing toxins, and mysterious, unexplained ruins that hold more secrets than their stone walls first let on. The biggest secret of all? &lt;em&gt;Godspeed&lt;/em&gt;'s former passengers aren't alone on this planet. And if they're going to stay, they'll have to fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Amy and Elder must race to discover who--or what--else is out there if they are to have any hope of saving their struggling colony and building a future together. They will have to look inward to the very core of what makes them human on this, their most harrowing journey yet. Because if the colony collapses? Then everything they have sacrificed--friends, family, life on Earth--will have been for nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; FUELED BY LIES.&lt;br&gt; RULED BY CHAOS.&lt;br&gt; ALMOST HOME.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Godspeed was once fueled by lies. Now it is ruled by chaos.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been three months since Amy was unplugged. The life she always knew is over. Everywhere she looks, she sees the walls of the spaceship &lt;em&gt;Godspeed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there may be hope: Elder has assumed leadership of the ship. He's finally free to act on his vision—no more Phydus, no more lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Elder learns shocking news about the ship, he and Amy race to discover the truth behind life on &lt;em&gt;Godspeed&lt;/em&gt;. They must work together to unlock a mystery that was set in motion hundreds of years earlier. Their success—or failure—will determine the fate of the 2,298 passengers aboard &lt;em&gt;Godspeed&lt;/em&gt;. But with each step, the journey becomes more perilous, the ship more chaotic, and the love between them more impossible to fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Revis catapulted readers into the far reaches of space with her &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling debut, &lt;em&gt;Across the Universe&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;A Million Suns&lt;/em&gt;, Beth deepens the mystery with action, suspense, romance, and deep philosophical questions. And this time it all builds to one mind-bending conclusion: &lt;em&gt;They have to get off this ship.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Most girls in the Kingdom of Sevalia would be thrilled to receive an invitation to become the first Queen’s Lady without noble blood, but for tomboy Jenna Mallory, it was her worst nightmare. She would need to overcome not only her lack of social status, but her mixed heritage. Jenna received the invitation because her father was a wealthy merchant, but since her mother was from the desert across the sea, Jenna had inherited both her mother’s darker coloring and two magical abilities—abilities that would seem odd to Sevalian nobles that all have magic of their own. Any hopes to lead a quiet life at court are dashed after Jenna becomes the subject of palace scandal when her magic is discovered. Worse, Sevalia’s old enemy to the east lays claim to a powerful mage whom Jenna discovers hiding in the eastern mountains—a mage that takes a keen interest in Jenna’s magic. While she had expected being a Lady would be challenging, Jenna learns she will need all her wits and all her magic… just to survive.</description>

  <description>A girl with a broken past and a dark secret. A boy with a twisted future and no second chances.  When they meet, it just might cost them their souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Summer doesn’t expect the new boarding school to be any different than the rest: a temporary stay where everyone will turn against her after a few weeks. Until she meets the rest of the students at this special school and realizes she’s not the only one with magic in her blood.  Accustomed to the concrete jungle of LA, she gets lost one night in the forests of the Rocky Mountains and meets Decker, the boy who will become the Master of Night and Fire on his eighteenth birthday. Their connection is instant and dangerous, for both will be forced to choose between Light and Dark, life and death, love – and their souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One choice. One soul. One price.</description>

  <description>Still mourning her mother's death, Kimberly Richards is incensed by the determination of her father, the Earl of Amburough, to marry her off as quickly as possible—just to please the jealous lover &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; plans to wed. And since Kimberly harbors a deep-seated dislike of gold-diggers and the whole distasteful state of affairs, the feisty young heiress already despises the "worthy suitor" she encounters at Sherring Cross Estate: Lachlan MacGregor, the dashing, newly impoverished Laird of Clan MacGregor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A tryst with the handsome, haughty Lachlan seems dubious at best—especially since the rogue has designs on the &lt;em&gt;married&lt;/em&gt; Duchess of Wrothston. But strange turns and outrageous circumstances promise to lead a woefully mismatched pair to a wildly unexpected destination—where a hard, resisting heart can open to the true glories of love.</description>

  <description>In this modern-day fairy tale romance, Irish islander, Caitlin Conner, has been in love with professor of Irish folklore, Liam O'Sullivan, for as long as she can remember. But just when he's starting to look at her as more than a friend, a mysterious woman arrives on Seal Island and captures his heart. As Caitlin discovers the truth behind the woman's lies, she realizes Liam is trapped in a dangerous enchantment and the only way to break the spell is to uncover a secret Irish fairy tale that has remained hidden for hundreds of years. But when the petals of a white rose grown in winter start to fall, the legend is set in motion. And Caitlin must find a way to change the ending before the last petal falls.</description>

  <description>Cat Colvin&lt;br&gt;Average Teenager?&lt;br&gt;Or Something Else Entirely?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cat Colvin is pretty much your typical run-of-the-mill teenager. Sure, she’s taller than most girls, has a mane of fiery red hair that’s impossible to tame, is left-handed, and her eyes are two different colors, but that’s where the differences end... unless you include the minor detail of her slow transformation into a Childe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High school can definitely be challenging, and for Cat it’s no different. This is especially true when she’s faced with the daunting task of trying to hide her budding Childe traits as they begin to reveal themselves at the most inopportune times. To make matters worse, her family is oddly dead set against Ryan, the boy she grows to like. But everyone has their secrets: is Ryan really what he seems to be, and what is Cat’s family not telling her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Childe is the first book in this coming-of-age fantasy series which follows Cat's life through the twists and turns toward finding out whom and what she really is. Come and take the plunge with Cat into a world filled with mystery, biting humor, and the paranormal.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Sweetest Dark &lt;/em&gt;is filled with thrilling romance, exciting adventure, and ancient magic. Shana Abé brilliantly captures the drama of post-Victorian England, while unfolding a passionate love story that defies time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“With every fiber of my being, I yearned to be normal. To glide through my days at Iverson without incident. But I’d have to face the fact that my life was about to unfold in a very, very different way than I’d ever envisioned. &lt;/em&gt;Normal&lt;em&gt; would become forever out of reach.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lora Jones has always known that she’s different. On the outside, she appears to be an ordinary sixteen-year-old girl. Yet Lora’s been keeping a heartful of secrets: She hears songs that no one else can hear, dreams vividly of smoke and flight, and lives with a mysterious voice inside her that insists she’s far more than what she seems.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; England, 1915. Raised in an orphanage in a rough corner of London, Lora quickly learns to hide her unique abilities and avoid attention. Then, much to her surprise, she is selected as the new charity student at Iverson, an elite boarding school on England’s southern coast. Iverson’s eerie, gothic castle is like nothing Lora has ever seen. And the two boys she meets there will open her eyes and forever change her destiny.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Jesse is the school’s groundskeeper—a beautiful boy who recognizes Lora for who and what she truly is. Armand is a darkly handsome and arrogant aristocrat who harbors a few closely guarded secrets of his own. Both hold the answers to her past. One is the key to her future. And both will aim to win her heart. As danger descends upon Iverson, Lora must harness the powers she’s only just begun to understand, or else lose everything she dearly loves.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Filled with lush atmosphere, thrilling romance, and ancient magic, &lt;em&gt;The Sweetest Dark&lt;/em&gt; brilliantly captures a rich historical era while unfolding an enchanting love story that defies time.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evie worries he’ll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened.</description>

  <description>I'm Pioneer Woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I love to cook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once upon a time, I fell in love with a cowboy. A strapping, rugged, chaps-wearing cowboy. Then I married him, moved to his ranch, had his babies . . . and wound up loving it. Except the manure. Living in the country for more than fifteen years has taught me a handful of eternal truths: every new day is a blessing, every drop of rain is a gift . . . and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; tastes more delicious than food you cook yourself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Food from My Frontier&lt;/em&gt; is a mouthwatering collection of the simple-but-scrumptious recipes that rotate through my kitchen on a regular basis, including Perfect Pancakes, Cowgirl Quiche, Sloppy Joes, Italian Meatball Soup, White Chicken Enchiladas, and a spicy Carnitas Pizza that'll win you over for life. There are also some elegant offerings for more special occasions at your house: Osso Buco, Honey-Plum-Soy Chicken, and Rib-Eye Steak with an irresistible Onion-Blue Cheese Sauce. And the decadent assortment of desserts, including Blackberry Chip Ice Cream, Apple Dumplings, and Coffee Cream Cake, will make your heart go pitter-pat in the most wonderful way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to detailed step-by-step photographs, all the recipes in this book have one other important quality in common: They're guaranteed to make your kids, sweetheart, dinner guests, in-laws, friends, cousins, or resident cowboys smile, sigh, and beg for seconds. (And hug you and kiss you and be devoted to you for life.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you enjoy, devour, and love this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sure did love making it for you.</description>

  <description>Set amid the austere beauty of the North Carolina coast, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner recently returned form the Second World War. Noah is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again.&lt;br&gt;Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. It is a story of miracles and emotions that will stay with you forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Pain shoots through my head. Fireworks. Explosions. All inside my brain. The white world goes dark and I know what's about to happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zara White suspects there's a freaky guy semi-stalking her. She's also obsessed with phobias. And it's true, she hasn't exactly been herself since her stepfather died. But exiling her to shivery Maine to live with her grandmother? That seems a bit extreme. The move is supposed to help her stay sane...but Zara's pretty sure her mom just can't deal with her right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She couldn't be more wrong. Turns out the semi-stalker is not a figment of Zara's overactive imagination. In fact, he's still following her, leaving behind an eerie trail of gold dust. There's something not right - not human - in this sleepy Maine town, and all signs point to Zara.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this creepy, compelling breakout novel, Carrie Jones delivers romance, suspense, and a creature you never thought you'd have to fear.</description>

Main male lead is a wordly man of the ton, who is considerably older and wiser than the heroine, yet he inexplicably feels a pull towards her anyway. Utterly unbelievable love story.]]>

  <description>Eleven minutes passed before Delaney Maxwell was pulled from the icy waters of a Maine lake by her best friend Decker Phillips. By then her heart had stopped beating. Her brain had stopped working. She was dead. And yet she somehow defied medical precedent to come back seemingly fine. Everyone wants Delaney to be all right, but she knows she's far from normal. Pulled by strange sensations she can't control or explain, Delaney finds herself drawn to the dying. Is her altered brain now predicting death, or causing it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Delaney meets Troy Varga, who recently emerged from a coma with similar abilities. At first she's reassured to find someone who understands the strangeness of her new existence, but Delaney soon discovers that Troy's motives aren't quite what she thought. Is their gift a miracle, a freak of nature-or something much more frightening?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For fans of best-sellers like &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;, this is a fascinating and heart-rending story about love and friendship and the fine line between life and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXchTHzP-N8" rel="nofollow"&gt;Watch the book trailer for &lt;em&gt;Fracture&lt;/em&gt; by Megan Miranda&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[I found the plot confusing and rather boring at times. I got through 2/3 of the book and just skipped to the end, and found no enlightenment in the conclusion. Also, way too many supporting characters. I will not be reading the sequel.]]>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old succubus Lily Anderson can’t have a normal life: She isn't allowed a boyfriend, she has no friends, and school is just one mess-up after another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily’s parents send her away to the prestigious Emerson Academy. It doesn’t appear to be any different from the others. That is, until she meets her roommate, Hannah, and a blue-eyed boy named Jake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily makes an almost deadly mistake, and Jake has a mysterious past that has come back to haunt him. Together, they must go on the run from things neither of them understand in order to save the people they love—and each other. But, Jake’s foe is more dangerous than they realized, and it will take the help of friends and family to save the man Lily loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She must learn to use her powers for good before it’s too late.</description>

  <description>Trapped for three days by a flood, and trapped forever by society because of it…. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The river isn't the only thing overflowing in Hunsford when a natural disaster forces Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy to work together. The residents of flood-stricken Hunsford, seeking refuge in the parsonage atop the hill, are unaware they are interrupting Darcy's disastrous proposal. Even worse, the flood has washed out the only bride to Rosings Park, stranding Darcy with the woman who has just refused his offer of marriage. But it may already be too late to redeem Elizabeth’s reputation…. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this Pride &amp;amp; Prejudice variation, the lane dividing the Hunsford parsonage from Rosings Park has been replaced by one of the flood-prone Kentish rivers. The storms are real – the spring of 1811 was remarkable for numerous thunderstorms in Southeast England.</description>

  <description>“I’d been sitting here wishing on a star, the moon, genies, birthday cakes, wishing wells, whatever I could think of that would make what just happened not be true. I’d never had a wish granted in my life. That was the stuff kids believed in. I wasn’t a kid anymore…”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plain. Invisible. Ugly. Fat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When nineteen year old Evelyn Barns wakes up two hundred and forty-three pounds lighter, her heart’s desire suddenly becomes her curse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Your fate is in your hands," were the witch's words, but when every bad deed counts, there's not much she can do to stop the weight from packing back on, even with coke as her new best friend. It was all moving too fast, her pain only masked by a high that was becoming harder to keep. A new life and social status was all she ever wanted but what she finds leaves her drowning in a beautiful nightmare that only gets worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suicidal and guilt ridden, Evelyn must decide if loving herself is worth letting go of everything else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was beauty somewhere in there. She just had to find it.</description>

  <description>It is Christmas afternoon and Peter Martin gets an unexpected phone call from his parents, asking him to come round. It pulls him away from his wife and children and into a bewildering mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He arrives at his parents house and discovers that they have a visitor. His sister Tara. Not so unusual you might think, this is Christmas after all, a time when families get together. But twenty years ago Tara took a walk into the woods and never came back and as the years have gone by with no word from her the family have, unspoken, assumed that she was dead. Now she's back, tired, dirty, disheveled, but happy and full of stories about twenty years spent traveling the world, an epic odyssey taken on a whim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her stories don't quite hang together and once she has cleaned herself up and got some sleep it becomes apparent that the intervening years have been very kind to Tara. She really does look no different from the young woman who walked out the door twenty years ago. Peter's parents are just delighted to have their little girl back, but Peter and his best friend Richie, Tara's one time boyfriend, are not so sure. Tara seems happy enough but there is something about her. A haunted, otherworldly quality. Some would say it's as if she's off with the fairies. And as the months go by Peter begins to suspect that the woods around their homes are not finished with Tara and his family...</description>

Fall in love with the one creature even the gods fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she feels herself slipping closer into the arms of the prophecy, Psyche must choose between the terrifyingly tender touch she feels almost powerless to resist and the one constant she's come to expect out of life: you cannot escape what is destined.</description>

  <description>A girl with an unknown destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A boy from a hidden world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Celeste starts at a new school in a small, Kansas town, she hears whispering voices, has vivid nightmares, and swarms of blackbirds follow her every move. She is oddly drawn to aloof Rylan, the other new student who has his own secrets. The exact moment she turns seventeen, she wakes to a bedroom full of strange creatures, purple light emanating from her hands, and Rylan breaking in through her bedroom window. He knows what she is . . . Intriguing and deeply romantic, RUA is page-turning YA novel with a supernatural twist.</description>

  <description>While Lady Angeline Dudley’s pedigree dictates that she must land a titled gentleman, the irrepressible beauty secretly longs for a simple, ordinary suitor. No wild rakes like the men of her family, just a kind heart and good nature. So when Edward Ailsbury, the new Earl of Heyward, rescues her with unmatched civility from the advances of a scoundrel, Angeline thinks that she has found her true love. Persuading the earl is another matter entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edward has his future neatly mapped out. He hopes to wed his steadfast companion, a woman who shares his values of loyalty, respect, and decorum. But arriving in London to take his seat in the House of Lords, he is derailed by Angeline, an exquisite bird of paradise seemingly devoted to sending his predictable life into chaos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the brilliant hues of her fashion to her hoydenish antics, Angeline is the last woman on earth for Edward. And yet a stolen kiss in the moonlight awakens something deep and primal within him. Naturally, being a gentleman, he does the right thing after compromising a lady: He offers marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angeline knows that Edward’s proposal is born of duty, not love. But denying something so provocative and passionate is easier said than done. Deep down, Angeline believes that Edward’s dedication to convention will melt behind closed doors, where sensuality and seduction play wicked games. For a proper wife by day can become a husband’s secret mistress by night, when delicious desire rules.</description>

  <description>Each night at precisely 4:33 am, while sixteen-year-old London Lane is asleep, her memory of that day is erased. In the morning, all she can "remember" are events from her future. London is used to relying on reminder notes and a trusted friend to get through the day, but things get complicated when a new boy at school enters the picture. Luke Henry is not someone you'd easily forget, yet try as she might, London can't find him in her memories of things to come. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When London starts experiencing disturbing flashbacks, or flash-&lt;em&gt;forwards&lt;/em&gt;, as the case may be, she realizes it's time to learn about the past she keeps forgetting-before it destroys her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

Eventually he found a way to become a boy, and their loved moved from curious distance to the intense closeness of shared lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That should have been the end of their story.

And the wolves of Mercy Falls are about to be killed in one final, spectacular hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam would do anything for Grace.

  <description>In Book Two we delve deeper into the tragic world of the eighteen year old Estella, now left to find her own way in a place that is less than forgiving of her kind. As she searches to fight for what she loves, friends she had thought she had all but forgotten return, lending her a hand where she thought none would be given. As she travels through the places one can only hope to dream, and one does, we find the significance in our time spent in slumber, and the game we all play to move ahead.     &lt;br&gt;In a story that rivals that of Jules Vern, we find that looking into the deepest regions of our soul opens a higher level of understanding about love, life, and all that it means to live. We are here to guard what we hold most dear and what we hope for above all is love...    &lt;br&gt;Come visit a world where anything can still happen, in a place filled with humor and magic, tragedy and sacrifice. It is when we are called into our darkest days that we find who we are, and the truth behind all things...</description>

  <description>Set against the backdrop of the 1987 stock market collapse, &lt;em&gt;The Starboard Sea&lt;/em&gt; is an examination of the abuses of class privilege, the mutability of sexual desire, the thrill and risk of competitive sailing and the adult cost of teenage recklessness. It is a powerful and compelling novel about a young man navigating the depths of his emotional life, finding his moral center, trying to forgive himself, and accepting the gift of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;When Addy is swept back in time, she couldn't be happier to leave her miserable life behind. Now she's mistaken for Lady Matilda, the pampered ward of the king. If Addy can play her part, she'll have glorious gowns, jewels, and something she's always longed for the respect and admiration of others. But then she meets Will, the falconer's son with sky blue eyes, who unsettles all her plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From shipwrecks to castle dungeons, from betrothals to hidden conspiracies, Addy finds herself in a world where she's not the only one with a dangerous secret. When she discovers the truth, Addy must take matters into her own hands. The stakes? Her chance at true love . . . and the life she's meant to live.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When her widower father drowns at sea, Gemma Hardy is taken from her native Iceland to Scotland to live with her kind uncle and his family. But the death of her doting guardian leaves Gemma under the care of her resentful aunt, and it soon becomes clear that she is nothing more than an unwelcome guest at Yew House. When she receives a scholarship to a private school, ten-year-old Gemma believes she's found the perfect solution and eagerly sets out again to a new home. However, at Claypoole she finds herself treated as an unpaid servant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Gemma's delight, the school goes bankrupt, and she takes a job as an au pair on the Orkney Islands. The remote Blackbird Hall belongs to Mr. Sinclair, a London businessman; his eight-year-old niece is Gemma's charge. Even before their first meeting, Gemma is, like everyone on the island, intrigued by Mr. Sinclair. Rich (by Gemma's standards), single, flying in from London when he pleases, Hugh Sinclair fills the house with life. An unlikely couple, the two are drawn to each other, but Gemma's biggest trial is about to begin: a journey of passion and betrayal, redemption and discovery, that will lead her to a life of which she's never dreamed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in Scotland and Iceland in the 1950s and '60s, &lt;em&gt;The Flight of Gemma Hardy&lt;/em&gt;--a captivating homage to Charlotte Brontë's &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;--is a sweeping saga that resurrects the timeless themes of the original but is destined to become a classic all its own.</description>

  <description>Wickedly hilarious and utterly recognizable, &lt;em&gt;Girls in White Dresses&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of three women grappling with heartbreak and career change, family pressure and new love—all while suffering through an endless round of weddings and bridal showers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isabella, Mary, and Lauren feel like everyone they know is getting married. On Sunday after Sunday, at bridal shower after bridal shower, they coo over toasters, collect ribbons and wrapping paper, eat minuscule sandwiches and doll-sized cakes. They wear pastel dresses and drink champagne by the case, but amid the celebration these women have their own lives to contend with: Isabella is working at a mailing-list company, dizzy with the mixed signals of a boss who claims she’s on a diet but has Isabella file all morning if she forgets to bring her a chocolate muffin. Mary thinks she might cry with happiness when she finally meets a nice guy who loves his mother, only to realize he’ll never love Mary quite as much. And Lauren, a waitress at a Midtown bar, swears up and down she won’t fall for the sleazy bartender—a promise that his dirty blond curls and perfect vodka sodas make hard to keep. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a wry sense of humor, Jennifer Close brings us through those thrilling, bewildering, what-on-earth-am-I-going-to-do-with-my-life years of early adulthood. These are the years when everyone else seems to have a plan, a great job, and an appropriate boyfriend, while Isabella has a blind date with a gay man, Mary has a crush on her boss, and Lauren has a goldfish named Willard. Through boozy family holidays and disastrous ski vacations, relationships lost to politics and relationships found in pet stores, &lt;em&gt;Girls in White Dresses&lt;/em&gt; pulls us deep inside the circle of these friends, perfectly capturing the wild frustrations and soaring joys of modern life.</description>

  <description>Katherine, the Duchess of Hampshire, has spent the past three years living a lie. Her marriage is one of convenience, and thanks to her husband John’s highly political nature and stuffy public persona, she’s smothered the fire that once burned within her. Thankfully, he’s a different man behind closed doors, and the more time she spends around him and his lover, an artist by the name of Henry Fletcher, the more she begins to wish for something she thinks can never be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes between the three of them after an otherwise uneventful evening. Words once left unsaid are spoken, repressed feelings can no longer be contained, and with just a few fevered whispers, their future’s are forever altered. But there is a darkness drawing closer to them, and just when they think they have a chance at true happiness, it’s snatched from their fingers by an unseen enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone knows their secret, and is not afraid to use it against them to get what they want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a desperate bid to avoid a scandal, the duke summons an old friend to aid them, a man with a shadowy past and secrets of his own. The more they discover about their blackmailer, the more they realize they may be facing a greater force than they could have imagined, and soon, everyone is a suspect, even the very man they thought was helping them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Warning: This book contains explicitly sexual scenes, including M/F, M/M, and M/F/M scenarios. Reader discretion is advised*&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>He’s thirty-eight. I’m twenty-three.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He speaks Spanish. I speak English.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He lives in Spain. I live in Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He dresses in thousand-dollar suits. I’m covered in tattoos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s married and has a five-year old daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m single and can’t commit to anyone or anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until now.Because when they say you can’t choose who you fall in love with, boy ain’t that the f*#king truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                            ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a restless dreamer like Vera Miles, it sounded like the experience of a lifetime. Instead of spending her summer interning for her astronomy major, she would fly to Spain where she’d spend a few weeks teaching conversational English to businessmen and women, all while enjoying free room and board at an isolated resort. But while Vera expected to get a tan, meet new people and stuff herself with wine and paella, she never expected to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mateo Casalles is unlike anyone Vera has ever known, let alone anyone she’s usually attracted to. While Vera is a pierced and tatted free spirit with a love for music and freedom, Mateo is a successful businessman from Madrid, all sharp suits and cocky Latino charm. Yet, as the weeks go on, the two grow increasingly close and their relationship changes from purely platonic to something…more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that makes Vera feel alive for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that can never, ever be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so she thinks.</description>

  <description>Avie Reveare has the normal life of a privileged teen growing up in L.A., at least as normal as any girl’s life is these days. After a synthetic hormone in beef killed fifty million American women ten years ago, only young girls, old women, men, and boys are left to pick up the pieces. The death threat is past, but fathers still fear for their daughters’ safety, and the Paternalist Movement, begun to "protect" young women, is taking over the choices they make.Like all her friends, Avie still mourns the loss of her mother, but she’s also dreaming about college and love and what she’ll make of her life. When her dad "contracts" her to marry a rich, older man to raise money to save his struggling company, her life suddenly narrows to two choices: Be trapped in a marriage with a controlling politician, or run. Her lifelong friend, student revolutionary Yates, urges her to run to freedom across the border to Canada. As their friendship turns to passion, the decision to leave becomes harder and harder. Running away is incredibly dangerous, and it’s possible Avie will never see Yates again. But staying could mean death.Romantic, thought-provoking, and frighteningly real, &lt;em&gt;A Girl Called Fearless&lt;/em&gt; is a story about fighting for the most important things in life—freedom and love.</description>

  <description>It's been several generations since a genetic experiment gone wrong caused the Reduction, decimating humanity and giving rise to a Luddite nobility who outlawed most technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elliot North has always known her place in this world. Four years ago Elliot refused to run away with her childhood sweetheart, the servant Kai, choosing duty to her family's estate over love. Since then the world has changed: a new class of Post-Reductionists is jumpstarting the wheel of progress, and Elliot's estate is foundering, forcing her to rent land to the mysterious Cloud Fleet, a group of shipbuilders that includes renowned explorer Captain Malakai Wentforth--an almost unrecognizable Kai. And while Elliot wonders if this could be their second chance, Kai seems determined to show Elliot exactly what she gave up when she let him go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Elliot soon discovers her old friend carries a secret--one that could change their society . . . or bring it to its knees. And again, she's faced with a choice: cling to what she's been raised to believe, or cast her lot with the only boy she's ever loved, even if she's lost him forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by Jane Austen's &lt;em&gt;Persuasion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;For Darkness Shows the Stars&lt;/em&gt; is a breathtaking romance about opening your mind to the future and your heart to the one person you know can break it.</description>

  <description>Rose Drayton lives on the Edge, between the world of the Broken (where people drive cars, shop at Wal-Mart, and magic is a fairy tale) and the Weird (where blueblood aristocrats rule, changelings roam, and the strength of your magic can change your destiny). Only Edgers like Rose can easily travel from one world to the next, but they never truly belong in either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose thought if she practiced her magic, she could build a better life for herself. But things didn’t turn out how she planned, and now she works a minimum wage, off the books job in the Broken just to survive. Then Declan Camarine, a blueblood noble straight out of the deepest part of the Weird, comes into her life, determined to have her (and her power).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a terrible danger invades the Edge from the Weird, a flood of creatures hungry for magic, Declan and Rose must work together to destroy them—or they’ll devour the Edge and everyone in it.</description>

  <description>Who will be the sacrifice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kami has lost the boy she loves, is tied to a boy she does not, and faces an enemy more powerful than ever before. With Jared missing for months and presumed dead, Kami must rely on her new magical link with Ash for the strength to face the evil spreading through her town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob Lynburn is now the master of Sorry-in-the-Vale, and he demands a death. Kami will use every tool at her disposal to stop him. Together with Rusty, Angela, and Holly, she uncovers a secret that might be the key to saving the town. But with knowledge comes responsibility—and a painful choice. A choice that will risk not only Kami’s life, but also the lives of those she loves most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This final book in the Lynburn Legacy is a wild, entertaining ride from beginning to shocking end.</description>

  <description>Five months ago, Valerie Leftman's boyfriend, Nick, opened fire on their school cafeteria. Shot trying to stop him, Valerie inadvertently saved the life of a classmate, but was implicated in the shootings because of the list she helped create. A list of people and things she and Nick hated. The list he used to pick his targets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, after a summer of seclusion, Val is forced to confront her guilt as she returns to school to complete her senior year. Haunted by the memory of the boyfriend she still loves and navigating rocky relationships with her family, former friends and the girl whose life she saved, Val must come to grips with the tragedy that took place and her role in it, in order to make amends and move on with her life.</description>

  <description>For centuries the people had lost their will to be represented by lawmakers. Politics was seen as an unfair game. Continuing to watch with disappointment in the nation's leadership, it was America that continued to take a turn for the worse; with high unemployment rates, homes being foreclosed, terrorism, and a lack of accountability by public officials. It was clear that the House of Representatives would not be able to get the support needed to turn the nation around for the better. It would take commitment to change. Maybe it was the cold midnight air, or the idea of one day returning to his roots-his love affair with government weighed heavy on the mind of one-time elected official Matt Logan. Having to make a choice, he would never be able to tell his most trusted confidants his decision. Miles away, in a crowded courtroom, a jury returned a stunning verdict against some of the finest aristocrats in history. No one ever imagined that the most well-known cities were holding a secret. It took power to run a city. It took certainty to unveil the most sophisticated crimes being watched by the world. What was safe anymore in politics? Top law enforcement agencies would love to know. But only Matt knew their deceit. On paper, a politician's situation looked good, but in the end only an Inceptor knows the true covenant that awaits him...</description>

  <description>Beyond the mirrored windows of the citys high-rise buildings; the landscape of a metropolis that holds itself to the outskirts of the Hudson River, leaves a city that set the standard for corruption and overshadowed itself by the darkness of political deception. Behind the thriving neighborhoods of cultural scenery, the sixth borough had become a blanket that was once woven with the challenges of deceit versus ethics. No one knows what tomorrow will bring, but for integrity to prevail, an awakening would need to be brought to the city streets that were once plagued by the mysteries of Wall Street West.</description>

  <description>Having earned a prestigious position, Matt Logan began his career working for the government. It was a welcome change from the life he had grown accustomed to in college-although Matt didn't know at the time that it would come to him with a cost. He carries in his mind a secret he must either learn how to live with or divulge. In the background are the remnants of the American antiquity that lead to a government and political downfall and challenge the ethics of an honest man. Today, with the biggest bust of criminal and corrupt politicians in history, written against the sweeping backdrop of historical and political events, there is an urgent and opportune relevance. In Dr. Cristina Guarneri's See No Evil, follow Matt's life in time from present day to the year 2029 as it unveils the mystery, the events, and the path of his future.</description>

  <description>Kula Baker never expected to find herself on the streets of San Francisco, alone but for a letter of introduction. Though she has come to the city to save her father from a cruel fate, Kula soon finds herself swept up in a world of art and elegance - a world she hardly dared dream of back in Montana, where she was no more than the daughter of an outlaw. And then there is the handsome David Wong, whose smiling eyes and soft-spoken manner have an uncanny way of breaking through Kula's carefully crafted reserve. Yet when disaster strikes and the wreckage threatens all she holds dear, Kula realizes that only by unlocking her heart can she begin to carve a new future for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Epic and provocative, STRAY is an original fairy tale in which magic is a curse that only women bear and society is dictated by a strict religious doctrine called The Path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Princess Aislynn knows all about the curse. Its magic is a part of her, like her awkward nose and thin fingers. It’s also something she can’t control. And girls who can’t control their abilities have a tendency to disappear. So for her own protection, Aislynn is sworn into the Order of Fairy Godmothers where she must spend the rest of her life chaste and devoted to serving another royal family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tasked with tending to the sweet, but sheltered Princess Linnea, Aislynn also finds a reluctant friend in the palace gardener, Thackery, who makes no secret of his disdain for her former life. The more time they spend together, though, the more she begins to doubt the rules she has observed so obediently. As Aislynn’s feelings threaten to undo the sacred vows she has taken, she risks not only her own life but Linnea’s as well. With the princess engaged to a devoted follower of The Path, there are some who would do anything to keep Aislynn from straying.</description>

  <description>Debut author Joshua McCune's gritty and heart-pounding novel is a masterful reimagining of popular dragon fantasy lore, set in a militant future reminiscent of Paolo Bacigalupi's Ship Breaker and Ann Aguirre's Outpost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a high school prank gone horribly wrong-sneaking onto the rez to pose next to a sleeping dragon-and now senior Melissa Callahan has become an unsuspecting pawn in a war between Man and Monster, between family and friends and the dragons she has despised her whole life. Chilling, epic, and wholly original, this debut novel imagines a North America where dragons are kept on reservations, where strict blackout rules are obeyed no matter the cost, where the highly weaponized military operates in chilling secret, and where a gruesome television show called Kissing Dragons unites the population. Joshua McCune's debut novel offers action, adventure, fantasy, and a reimagining of popular dragon lore.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;No one has set foot on Earth in centuries -- until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been 21 days since the hundred landed on Earth. They're the only humans to set foot on the planet in centuries...or so they thought. Facing an unknown enemy, Wells attempts to keep the group together. Clarke strikes out for Mount Weather, in search of other Colonists, while Bellamy is determined to rescue his sister, no matter the cost. And back on the ship, Glass faces an unthinkable choice between the love of her life and life itself.&lt;br&gt;In this pulse-pounding sequel to Kass Morgan's &lt;em&gt;The 100&lt;/em&gt;, secrets are revealed, beliefs are challenged, and relationships are tested. And the hundred will struggle to survive the only way they can -- together.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>"A scorching series opener not to be missed." - Kirkus &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A futuristic blend of Beth Revis's Across the Universe and Lenore Appelhans's Level 2, Burn Out will satisfy the growing desire for science fiction with a thrilling story of survival, intrigue, and adventure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people want to save the world; seventeen-year-old Tora Reynolds just wants to get the hell off of it. One of the last survivors in Earth's final years, Tora yearns to escape the wasteland her planet has become after the sun turns "red giant," but discovers her fellow survivors are even deadlier than the hostile environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holed up in an underground shelter, Tora is alone--her brilliant scientist father murdered, her mother and sister burned to death. She dreams of living on a planet with oceans, plants, and animals. Unfortunately, the oceans dried out ages ago, the only plants are giant cacti with deadly spines, and her pet, Trigger, is a gun--one of the bio-energetic weapons her father created for the government before his conscience kicked in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When family friend, Markus, arrives with mercenaries to take the weapons by force, Tora's fury turns to fear when government ships descend in an attempt to kill them all. She forges an unlikely alliance with Markus and his rag-tag group of raiders, including a smart but quiet soldier named James. Tora must quickly figure out who she can trust, as she must choose between saving herself by giving up the guns or honoring her father's request to save humanity from the most lethal weapons in existence.</description>

  <description>“A zippy, gripping psychological drama.” ~Kirkus Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s not evil, but she has certain... urges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lane is a typical teenager. Loving family. Good grades. Afterschool job at the local animal hospital. Martial arts enthusiast. But her secret obsession is studying serial killers. She understands them, knows what makes them tick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because she might be one herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lane channels her dark impulses by hunting criminals—delivering justice when the law fails. The vigilantism stops shy of murder. But with each visceral rush the line of self-control blurs.&lt;br&gt;And then a young preschool teacher goes missing. Only to return... in parts.&lt;br&gt;When Lane excitedly gets involved in the hunt for “the Decapitator,” the vicious serial murderer that has come to her hometown, she gets dangerously caught up in a web of lies about her birth dad and her own dark past. And once the Decapitator contacts Lane directly, Lane knows she is no longer invisible or safe. Now she needs to use her unique talents to find the true killer’s identity before she—or someone she loves—becomes the next victim...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Home is where the bodies are buried.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darkly humorous and heart-wrenchingly beautiful, Jennifer Longo’s YA debut about a girl stuck living in a cemetery will change the way you look at life, death, and love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Leigh sells graves for her family-owned cemetery because her father is too lazy to look farther than the dinner table when searching for employees. Working the literal graveyard shift, she meets two kinds of customers:&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Need:&lt;/strong&gt; They know what’s up. They bought their graves a long time ago, before they needed them.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At Need:&lt;/strong&gt; They are in shock, mourning a loved one’s unexpected death. Leigh avoids sponging their agony by focusing on things like guessing the headstone choice (mostly granite).&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Sarcastic and smart, Leigh should be able to stand up to her family and quit. But her world’s been turned upside down by the sudden loss of her best friend and the appearance of Dario, the slightly-too-old-for-her grave digger. Surrounded by death, can Leigh move on, if moving on means it’s time to get a life?</description>

  <description>In a world where an industrial revolution is powered by magic, Tyen, a student of archaeology, discovers a sentient book in an ancient tomb. Vella was once a young sorcerer-maker, until she was transformed into a useful tool by one of the greatest sorcerers of history. Since then she has been gathering information, including a vital clue to the disaster Tyen’s world faces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elsewhere, in a land ruled by the priests since a terrible war depleted all but a little magic, Rielle the dyer’s daughter has been taught that to use magic is to steal from the Angels. Yet she knows from her ability to sense the stain it leaves behind that she has a talent for it, and that there are people willing to teach her how to use it, should she ever need to risks the Angels’ wrath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Further away, a people called the Travelers live their entire lives on the move, trading goods from one world to another. They know that each world has its own store of magic, reducing or increasing a sorcerer’s abilities, so that if one entered a weak world they may be unable to leave it again. Each family maintains a safe trading route passed down through countless generations and modified whenever local strife makes visiting dangerous. But this is not the only knowledge the Travelers store within their stories and songs, collected over millennia spent roaming the universe. They know a great change is due, and that change brings both loss and opportunity.</description>

  <description>Beatrice Reece, Lady Fenwick, has retired from polite society. Everyone knows her late husband treated her abominably, and she simply cannot bear the whispers of the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt;. But it's the night of London's premier masquerade ball—and Beatrice's one chance to revel in anonymity. She hopes no one will recognize her beneath her mask, not even the sinfully sexy stranger across the room who holds her captive in his gaze. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrew Sinclair would know beautiful Beatrice anywhere from the gentle sway of her hips, the richness of her hair and the lushness of her body. When he asks her to dance, the attraction is instant and all-consuming. The only woman he's ever truly wanted is finally in his arms. But when the clock strikes twelve, will this one reckless night fade into the morning light?</description>

  <description>Summer, boys, and friendships gone sour. This new series has everything that perfect beach reads are made of!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gemma just got dumped and is devastated. She finds herself back in the Hamptons for the summer—which puts her at risk of bumping into Hallie, her former best friend that she wronged five years earlier. Do people hold grudges that long? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a small case of mistaken identity causes everyone, including Hallie and her dreamy brother Josh, to think she’s someone else, Gemma decides to go along with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gemma's plan is working (she's finding it hard to resist Josh), but she's finding herself in embarrassing situations (how could a bathing suit fall apart like that!?). Is it coincidence or is someone trying to expose her true identity?  And how will Josh react if he finds out who she is?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katie Finn hits all the right notes in this perfect beginning to a new summer series: A Broken Hearts &amp;amp; Revenge novel.</description>

  <description>The year is 2113. In Jenna Strong's world, ACID—the most brutal controlling police force in history—rule supreme. No throwaway comment or whispered dissent goes unnoticed—or unpunished. And it was ACID agents who locked Jenna away for life, for a horrendous crime she struggles to remember. But Jenna's violent prison time has taught her how to survive by any means necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious rebel group breaks her out, she must use her strength, speed, and skill to stay one step ahead of ACID, and try to uncover the truth about what really happened on that terrible night two years ago. They have taken her life, her freedom, and her true memories away from her. How can she reclaim anything when she doesn't know who to trust?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strong, gritty writing, irresistible psychological suspense, and action consume the novel as Jenna struggles to survive against the all-controlling ACID. &lt;em&gt;Seriously sinister stuff.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;   Calla thought that her boyfriend breaking up with her in a text message was the worst thing that could ever happen to her. But just two weeks later, her mother died in a freak accident, and life as she knew it was completely over. With her father heading to California for a new job, they decide that Calla should spend a few weeks with the grandmother she barely knows while he gets them set up.   &lt;br&gt;   To Calla's shock, her mother's hometown of Lily Dale is a town full of psychics--including her grandmother. Suddenly, the fact that her mother never talked about her past takes on more mysterious overtones. The longer she stays in town, the stranger things become, as Calla starts to experience unusual and unsettling events that lead her to wonder whether she has inherited her grandmother's unique gift. Is it this gift that is making her suspect that her mother's death was more than an accident, or is it just an overactive imagination? Staying in Lily Dale is the only way to uncover the truth. But will Calla be able to deal with what she learns about her mother's past and her own future?&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The end of the world happened quickly. The sun still shone, there was no explosion - just a tsunami-sized wave of human thought drowning the world in telepathic noise as everyone's inner-most secrets became audible. Everyone's thoughts, that is, except sixteen-year-old Danby.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone looked like bad actors in a poorly dubbed movie. Their expressions didn't match their emotions and their lips didn't sync with what they were saying. But they were all so loud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;God-he-looks-hot-Can't-she's-my-best-friend-How'd-she-lose-that-weight-No-don't-you-dare-Oh-no-please-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The end of the world happens in the blink of an eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When The Snap sweeps the globe, everyone can instantly hear everything that everyone else is thinking. As secrets and lies are laid bare, suburbs and cities explode into insanity and violence. What might have been an evolutionary leap instead initiates the apocalypse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Danby Armstrong's telepathy works very differently. She can tune into other people but they can't tune into her. With only this slender defence, Danby must protect her little brother and reach the safety of her mother's mountain retreat. But it's 100 kilometres away and the highways are blocked by thousands of cars and surrounded by millions of people coming apart at the psychic seams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danby's escape is made even more dangerous by another cataclysm that threatens humanity's extinction. And her ability to survive this new world will be tested by a charismatic young man whose power to save lives may be worse than death itself.</description>

  <description>In the future, only one rule will matter:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t. Ever. Peek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ari Alexander just broke that rule and saw the last person she expected hovering above her bed — arrogant Jackson Locke, the most popular boy in her school. She expects instant execution or some kind of freak alien punishment, but instead, Jackson issues a challenge: help him, or everyone on Earth will die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ari knows she should report him, but everything about Jackson makes her question what she’s been taught about his kind. And against her instincts, she’s falling for him. But Ari isn’t just any girl, and Jackson wants more than her attention. She’s a military legacy who’s been trained by her father and exposed to war strategies and societal information no one can know — especially an alien spy, like Jackson. Giving Jackson the information he needs will betray her father and her country, but keeping silent will start a war.</description>

  <description>The Bourne Identity meets Divergent in this heart-pounding debut.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Sarah has a rare chance at a new life. Or so the doctors tell her. She’s been undergoing a cutting-edge procedure that will render her a tabula rasa—a blank slate. Memory by memory her troubled past is being taken away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when her final surgery is interrupted and a team of elite soldiers invades the isolated hospital under cover of a massive blizzard, her fresh start could be her end. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Navigating familiar halls that have become a dangerous maze with the help of a teen computer hacker who's trying to bring the hospital down for his own reasons, Sarah starts to piece together who she is and why someone would want her erased. And she won’t be silenced again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A high-stakes thriller featuring a non-stop race for survival and a smart heroine who will risk everything, Tabula Rasa is, in short, unforgettable.</description>

Yet her innocent ruse takes a scandalous turn when "Kate" runs into a handsome gentleman on a secret quest of his own. A moment of passion could cost Daphne her reputation, but how can she ignore the stranger's searing kiss?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Arrangement Most Wicked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lord Cormack Northmore is determined to find the immoral peer who ruined his sister. So when he learns that the irresistible woman he knows as "Kate" is the Season's most sought-after debutante, Cormack plans to use her connections to help him set a trap. Now, the closer Cormack gets to uncovering the villain who haunts the&lt;em&gt; ton&lt;/em&gt;'s ballrooms, the more he realizes that the lovely lady is in danger herself. Will he abandon his quest for revenge-or risk losing his one chance at love? &lt;br&gt;(85,000 words)</description>

  <description>When Deanna's missing friend Hyde turns up at his father's funeral to claim his corporate empire and inheritance, she is swept into his glittering world of paparazzi and wealth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But re-kindling her friendship and the dizzying new emotions along for the ride are the least of her concerns. Because Deanna has a secret – and somebody knows. Someone who is out to get Hyde. And if she doesn't play along, and help the enemy destroy him…she will be sold to the highest bidder in the black market for human swans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Deanna is struggling to break free from the gilded cage that would trap her forever…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feather Bound is a dark debut reminiscent of Gabriel García Márquez's &lt;em&gt;A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings&lt;/em&gt;, and the twisted truth behind the fairy tale of Cinderella.</description>

  <description>All Hanna Euli wants is to become a proper witch – but unfortunately, she’s stuck as an apprentice to a grumpy fisherman. When their boat gets caught up in a mysterious storm and blown wildly off course, Hanna finds herself further away from home than she’s ever been before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she tries to get back, she learns there may be more to her apprentice master than she realized, especially when a mysterious, beautiful, and very non-human boy begins following her through the ocean, claiming that he needs Hanna’s help.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Alice Montgomery wakes up in the lobby of the B&amp;amp;B where she has been vacationing with her family to a startling discovery: no one can see or hear her. The cheap desk lights have been replaced with gas lamps and the linoleum floor with hardwood and rich Oriental carpeting. Someone has replaced the artwork with eerie paintings of Elizabeth Blackwell, the insane actress and rumored witch who killed herself at the hotel in the 1880s. Alice watches from behind the looking glass where she is haunted by Elizabeth Blackwell. Trapped in the 19th-century version of the hotel, Alice must figure out a way to break Elizabeth's curse--with the help of Elizabeth's old diary and Tony, the son of a ghost hunter who is investigating the haunted B&amp;amp;B--before she becomes the inn's next victim.</description>

  <description>Amara is never alone. Not when she's protecting the cursed princess she unwillingly serves. Not when they're fleeing across dunes and islands and seas to stay alive. Not when she's punished, ordered around, or neglected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; be alone, because a boy from another world experiences all that alongside her, looking through her eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nolan longs for a life uninterrupted. Every time he blinks, he's yanked from his Arizona town into Amara's mind, a world away, which makes even simple things like hobbies and homework impossible. He's spent years as a powerless observer of Amara's life. Amara has no idea . . . until he learns to control her, and they communicate for the first time. Amara is terrified. Then, she's furious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Amara and Nolan want is to be free of each other. But Nolan's breakthrough has dangerous consequences. Now, they'll have to work together to survive--and discover the truth about their connection.</description>

Overnight, her life of privilege becomes one of survival, and no matter where she turns, it seems like the world is out to get her. She's not going to fall apart, though.  She's a rebel and she's strong … determined to live life on her own terms … and nothing's going to stop her from getting things done and making things right. But when a twist of fate brings her to the doorstep of a different kind of Rebel, she's forced to figure out when something's worth fighting for and when something's worth letting go.</description>

  <description>IT HAPPENED IN VEGAS.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't be held responsible.  Things that happen there are supposed to stay there, right?  Right?  Yeeeah.  Not so much.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andie's just days away from tying the knot, but there's just ooooone little glitch.  Apparently, she's already married.  Or someone with her name is married to a guy out in Oregon of all places, and the courthouse won't issue her a marriage license until it's all cleared up.  Tripping her way through cow pies and country songs to meet up with a man who gets around places on horseback is her very last idea of how to have a good time, but if she's going to get married, make partner at the firm, and have two point five kids before she's thirty-five, she needs to get to the bottom of this snafu and fix it quick ... before her fiance finds out and everything she's been working toward goes up in flames.</description>

  <description>One People. One Union. One Future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wynne’s entire life is dictated by the Union: the clothes she wears, the books she reads, even the genes she inherited. And like every other girl in the Union, Wynne dreams of being chosen as a Carrier on her 16th birthday—one of the elite selected to carry the future generation within her womb. Wynne and her best friend Odessa are certain they will both make the cut, but when Odessa is chosen and whisked off to a life of privilege, Wynne is left behind to work as an assistant, delivering perfectly planned babies for the Union.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Odessa slips deeper and deeper into the role of Carrier, Wynne begins to see the Union for what it really is: a society that criminalizes the notion of love, and forbids words like mother and family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in her life, Wynne is faced with a choice: submit to the will of the Union, or find a way to escape and save Odessa before she is lost forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The toast of the town...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All London is at Julia Wentworth's feet—and anything she desires is hers for the asking. But the glamorous leading lady guards a shocking secret: a mystery husband whom she does not know, dares not mention ... and cannot love.&lt;p&gt;For years Damon Savage has been searching for the stranger his parents wed him to without his consent, hoping to legally free himself from matrimony's invisible chains. And he is astonished to discover his "bride" is none other than the exquisite lady he'd hoped to make his mistress! But though his wife by law, Julia will never truly be Damon's—until he conquers her fears, his formidable rivals ... and her proud, passionate, and independent heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The romantic sequel to Alienated takes long-distance relationships to a new level as Cara and Aelyx long for each other from opposite ends of the universe...until a threat to both their worlds reunites them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cara always knew life on planet L’eihr would be an adjustment. With Aelyx, her L’eihr boyfriend, back on Earth, working to mend the broken alliance between their two planets, Cara is left to fend for herself at a new school, surrounded by hostile alien clones. Even the weird dorm pet hates her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things look up when Cara is appointed as human representative to a panel preparing for a human colony on L’eihr. A society melding their two cultures is a place where Cara and Aelyx could one day make a life together. But with L’eihr leaders balking at granting even the most basic freedoms, Cara begins to wonder if she could ever be happy on this planet, even with Aelyx by her side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, on Earth, Aelyx, finds himself thrown into a full-scale PR campaign to improve human-L’eihr relations. Humans don’t know that their very survival depends on this alliance: only Aelyx’s people have the technology to fix the deadly contamination in the global water supply that human governments are hiding. Yet despite their upper hand, the leaders of his world suddenly seem desperate to get humans on their side, and hardly bat an eye at extremists’ multiple attempts on Aelyx’s life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Way clearly needs humans’ help . . . but with what? And what will they ask for in return?</description>

  <description>Sherwood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name immediately conjures up images of Richard Greene, Michael Praed and Russel Crowe. Or maybe that sly fox in the Disney version.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only, in Anne R. Allen's latest rom-com mystery the fox is a coyote and there's no Robin Hood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or is there?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her usual inimitable fashion Allen peels back the layers, one hilarious subplot after another, until you just never know what's real and what's not. Rather like the Robin Hood legend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Manners Doctor, Camilla Randall, flies into Robin Hood airport with a suitcase in one hand and a book contract in the other she thinks she's leaving all her problems behind and is about to start a new life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you look very carefully you may just spot the Sheriff of Nottingham, Maid Marian and even Little John hidden away. But as for Robin Hood himself... You'll just have to read it and find out.</description>

  <description>Book three in Joe Nobody's popular series continues the saga of Bishop and Terri, as their post-apocalyptic world attempts to recover. Caught up in a power struggle to lead the recovery, the young couple are drawn away from their West Texas retreat and must use all of their skills to survive. The year is 2015 and the government of the United States has all but ceased to exist. The military controls some of the larger cities, but its loyalties are divided between the President of the United States and a new, growing organization called The Independents. The Holding Their Own series, by bestselling author Joe Nobody, follows the adventures of a young couple as they survive in a world where anarchy prevails and society struggles to establish rule of law. In Pedestals of Ash, the third book in the series, Bishop and Terri are pulled away from their secluded retreat and thrust into the power struggle to rule.</description>

  <description>This first book of the Holding Their Own series, A Story of Survival, is set in the year 2015, when the world is burdened by the second Great Depression. The United States, already weakened by internal strife, becomes the target of an international terror plot. A series of attacks results in thousands of casualties and disables the country's core infrastructure. The combination of economic hardship and the staggering blow of the terror attacks results in a collapse of the government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a realistic story of how an average, middle class couple survives the cascading events brought on by international politics, high tech military actions and the eventual downfall of society. All of their survival skills are tested during the action packed expedition in a world that resembles the American West of 200 years past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holding Their Own II: The Independents&lt;br&gt;Holding Their Own III: Pedestals of Ash</description>

  <description>In this near-future dystopia with echoes of "The Giver" and "Among the Hidden," Tania Unsworth has created an unsettling page-turner fast-paced, smooth, filled with dread that s wholly satisfying and startlingly original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devin doesn t remember life before the world got hot; he has grown up farming the scorched earth with his grandfather in their remote valley. When his grandfather dies, Devin heads for the city. Once there, among the stark glass buildings, he finds scores of children, just like him, living alone on the streets. They tell him rumors of a place for abandoned children, with unlimited food and toys and the hope of finding a new family. But only the luckiest get there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An act of kindness earns Devin an invitation to the home, but it s soon clear that it s no paradise. As Devin investigates the intimidating administrator and the zombie-like sickness that afflicts some children, he discovers the home s horrific true mission. The only real hope is escape, but the place is as secure as a fortress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fans of dystopian fiction and spine-chilling adventure will devour "The One Safe Place"; its haunting themes will resonate long after readers have turned the final page.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The clock chimes midnight, a curse breaks, and a girl meets a prince . . . but what follows is not all sweetness and sugarplums.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New York City, 1899. Clara Stole, the mayor's ever-proper daughter, leads a double life. Since her mother's murder, she has secretly trained in self-defense with the mysterious Drosselmeyer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, on Christmas Eve, disaster strikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her home is destroyed, her father abducted--by beings distinctly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; human. To find him, Clara journeys to the war-ravaged land of Cane. Her only companion is the dethroned prince Nicholas, bound by a wicked curse. If they're to survive, Clara has no choice but to trust him, but his haunted eyes burn with secrets--and a &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; she can't define. With the dangerous, seductive faery queen Anise hunting them, Clara soon realizes she won't leave Cane unscathed--if she leaves at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by &lt;em&gt;The Nutcracker&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Winterspell&lt;/em&gt; is a dark, timeless fairy tale about love and war, longing and loneliness, and a girl who must learn to live without fear.</description>

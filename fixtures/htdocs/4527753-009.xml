  <description>&lt;em&gt;Her Cinderella Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sue Green just wanted one night to be the pretty one. But a few glasses of champagne and one wild disguise later, she’s in some serious trouble. Who knew the devastatingly handsome face of Lord Holden Ellis would get in the way of her foot?  And how exactly did all that high-kick dancing start in the first place? At least she blamed it all on her new persona—Suzanna. So Society’s most eligible bachelor will never find out the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Holden wants is the truth. Who was that vixen who seduced him so thoroughly, then disappeared? The only one who seems to have any answers about Suzanna is Miss Sue Green. She’s promised to help him find his mystery woman, but in truth she’s not being all that helpful. And in truth, the more time Holden spends with Sue—witty, pretty, and disarmingly honest—the more he realizes he may have found exactly what he’s been looking for all along…</description>

  <description>This book examines identity and the nature of European identity through analyzing different theories which help to define in which theories can European identity be ascribed to. It offers scholars' reflection over European identity and makes a definition of European identity. In the second chapter it explains the role of European identity on the constitutional ratification (2004) as well as demonstrates the contribution of the Constitutional Treaty (2004) on the consolidation of European identity. It draws conclusion over the European constitution and its future. The third chapter confronts European identity with national identities in EU and draws conclusions about weather European identity will supersede national identities of Europe, as well as demonstrates the erosion of national identities in Europe; conclusions are supported by statistical data published in several Eurobarometers. The data published in the form of a table in this chapter traces the consolidation degree of European identity from 1992 to 2008. The last chapter argues about the existence of a European civic demos as well as gives scholars criticisms over the national views on demos conceptualization. In the end the reader is left to decide about the answer to title question.</description>

  <description>She walks the line between the hunter and the hunted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vampires want her blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Witches consider her less-than-human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slayers simply want her dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if being in high school wasn't hard enough, Catherine Pierce has to deal with a whole other set of problems that arise from being a shifter that hasn't settled. Because after puberty, shifters are supposed to stop changing--and Catherine, well, hasn't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even among her own kind, Catherine is regarded as a freak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make matters worse, she'd caught the attention of the witches' Council because they think she's been dabbling in dark magic because of a stupid old book that popped up at her work. And she's been having nightmares about a terrifying man who calls himself the Shadow Thane and plans to end the world in a burst of darkness and dragon fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just in case that wasn't enough, a branch of Slayers are infiltrating Catherine's town, under the guise of a community youth group called Sterling Rep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Times are changing and that means, for Catherine, it's time to Change.</description>

  <description>Winner of the 2012 PEN New England Discovery Award!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s nothing real about reality TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Bonnie™ Baker has grown up on TV—she and her twelve siblings are the stars of one-time hit reality show Baker’s Dozen. Since the show’s cancellation and the scandal surrounding it, Bonnie™ has tried to live a normal life, under the radar and out of the spotlight. But it’s about to fall apart…because Baker’s Dozen is going back on the air. Bonnie™’s mom and the show’s producers won’t let her quit and soon the life she has so carefully built for herself, with real friends (and maybe even a real boyfriend), is in danger of being destroyed by the show. Bonnie™ needs to do something drastic if her life is ever going to be her own—even if it means being more exposed than ever before.</description>

  <description>Ask Aria Morse anything, and she must answer with the truth. Yet she rarely understands the cryptic words she‘s compelled to utter. Blessed—or cursed—with the power of an Oracle who cannot decipher her own predictions, she does her best to avoid anyone and everyone. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; But Aria can no longer hide when Jade, one of the few girls at school who ever showed her any kindness, disappears. Any time Aria overhears a question about Jade, she inadvertently reveals something new, a clue or hint as to why Jade vanished. But like stray pieces from different puzzles, her words never present a clear picture.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Then there’s Alex, damaged and dangerous, but the first person other than Jade to stand up for her. And Will, who offers a bond that seems impossible for a girl who’s always been alone. Both were involved with Jade. Aria may be the only one who can find out what happened, but the closer she gets to solving the crime, the more she becomes a target. Not everyone wants the truth to come out.</description>

  <description>In Magnolia Branch, Mississippi, the Cafferty and Marsden families are southern royalty. Neighbors since the Civil War, the families have shared vacations, holidays, backyard barbecues, and the overwhelming desire to unite their two clans by marriage. So when a baby boy and girl were born to the families at the same time, the perfect opportunity seemed to have finally arrived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jemma Cafferty and Ryder Marsden have no intention of giving in to their parents’ wishes. They’re only seventeen, for goodness’ sake, not to mention that one little problem: They hate each other! Jemma can’t stand Ryder’s nauseating golden-boy persona, and Ryder would like nothing better than to pretend stubborn Jemma doesn’t exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a violent storm ravages Magnolia Branch, it unearths Jemma’s and Ryder’s true feelings for each other as the two discover that the line between love and hate may be thin enough to risk crossing over.</description>

  <description>After a mysterious Sickness wipes out the rest of the population, the young survivors assemble into tightly run tribes. Jefferson, the reluctant leader of the Washington Square tribe, and Donna, the girl he's secretly in love with, have carved out a precarious existence among the chaos. But when another tribe member discovers a clue that may hold the cure to the Sickness, five teens set out on a life-altering road trip to save humankind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tribe exchanges gunfire with enemy gangs, escapes cults and militias, braves the wilds of the subway and Central Park...and discovers truths they could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>After nine years spent suffocating in the arid expanses of the Midwest, far from the sea where her mother drowned, Callie Morgan and her estranged father are returning to the coast. And miraculously, Callie can finally breathe easily. No more sudden, clawing attacks and week-long hospital stays. No more wary, pitying glances from classmates and teachers. She can be more than a sickly freak, coughing her way between nondescript inland towns every year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But something waits for Callie in the water. Just as her life begins to feel like her own, with an almost-family and a first love and a circle of loud-mouthed friends, her body starts to rebel in new ways. She finds herself fighting the intoxicating pull of the black waters right outside her window. Her dreams turn wild and real, and she wakes up with salt water in her hair. Family secrets and whispering doubts flood her brain as she leads herself and those around her into danger, jeopardizing everything she once longed for. Is it madness, or is there a voice, beckoning her to come to the sea’s deepest heart; to come home?</description>

  <description>Evalyn Ibarra never expected to be an accused killer and experimental prison test subject. A year ago, she was a normal college student. Now she’s been sentenced to a month in the compass room—an advanced prison obstacle course designed by the government to execute justice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she survives, the world will know she’s innocent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Locked up with nine notorious and potentially psychotic criminals, Evalyn must fight the prison and dismantle her past to stay alive. But the system prized for accuracy appears to be killing at random.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She doesn’t plan on making friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She doesn’t plan on falling in love, either.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The rules are clear—until they're broken. Lauren Layne puts a New Adult spin on Pygmalion, also the inspiration for Pretty Woman, and gives the classic love story its edgiest twist yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Who knew that pretending you're not falling for someone would be so much more difficult than pretending that you are?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephanie Kendrick gave up her whole summer to ace her NYU film school screenwriting course, so she's pissed to be stuck with a preppy, spoiled frat boy as her writing partner. Then again, with her piercings, black-rimmed eyes, and Goth wardrobe, Stephanie isn't exactly Ethan Price's type, either. He's probably got his eye on some leggy blonde with a trust fund... or does he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the summer scene kicks off in the Hamptons, Ethan is desperate to make his snobbish mother forget the pedigreed girl who broke his heart. While Stephanie's a stretch as a decoy, the right makeover and a pastel cardigan just might do the trick. She may not love the idea of playing Ethan's brainless Barbie girlfriend, but the free rent and luxurious digs make a tempting offer. So does the promise of a ready-made screenplay idea inspired by their charade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Stephanie steps into Ethan's privileged world, the "acting" begins to feel all too real. The kissing and touching that were intended to fool the Hamptons crowd wind up manipulating "them." And Stephanie faces a question she's too afraid to ask: Is Ethan falling for the real her or for the dolled-up princess he wants to see?</description>

  <description>From the remarkable imagination of acclaimed artist Jim Di Bartolo and the exquisite pen of bestselling author Kiersten White comes a spellbinding story of love, mystery, and dark conspiracy, told in an alternating narrative of words and pictures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cora and Minnie are sisters living in a small, stifling town where strange and mysterious things occur. Their mother runs the local boarding house. Their father is gone. The woman up the hill may or may not be a witch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas and Charles are brothers who’ve been exiled to the boarding house so Thomas can tame his ways and Charles can fight an illness that is killing him with increasing speed. Their family history is one of sorrow and guilt. They think they can escape from it . . . but they can’t.</description>

You’re dead. Those words continue to haunt Claire Cain months after she barely survived a brutal beating in Chicago. So when her father is offered a job in another state, Claire is hopeful that getting out will offer her a way to start anew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she arrives in Peculiar, Missouri, Claire feels an overwhelming sense of danger, and her fears are confirmed when she discovers the body of a popular high school student in the icy woods behind the school, surrounded by the town’s feral cats. While everyone is quick to say it was an accident, Claire knows there’s more to it, and vows to learn the truth about what happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the closer she gets to uncovering the mystery, the closer she also gets to realizing a frightening reality about herself and the damage she truly sustained in that Chicago alley….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holly Schindler’s gripping story is filled with heart-stopping twists and turns that will keep readers guessing until the very last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Full of romance and nature magic, this debut fantasy is perfect for fans of Shannon Hale, Juliet Marillier, and Kristin Cashore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lark has foreseen two things—she will fall for a young man with sage green eyes,and he will kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Lark Carew is happiest close to home, tending her garden and gathering herbs for medicines. But when her Sight warns her that monsters called Troths will soon invade her village, Lark is summoned on a journey to seek help from the legendary Riders of Tarnec. Little does she suspect that one of the Riders, Gharain, is the very man who has haunted her visions. Or that the people of Tarnec have called her there for another reason: Lark is the Guardian of Life, the first of four Guardians who must awaken their powers to recover four stolen amulets. Together, the amulets—Life, Death, Dark, and Light—keep the world in Balance. To take back the Life amulet, Lark will have to discover her true inner strength and give in to a love that she swears will be her downfall.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Michael Grant, author of the New York Times bestselling Gone series, has created a powerful and brilliant narrative that examines the nature of good and evil in every human.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mara wakes in a field of dead grass, a heavy mist pressing down on her. She is terrified, afraid that she is dead. Then a beautiful young man dressed in black appears. He calls himself Messenger of Fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This boy is able to move effortlessly through space and time. He also sees the darkness in human hearts. He sees the evils done: the destructive lies, the cruelty, the bullying, the violence. And if the world does not bring justice to those who do evil, he will. He offers the wicked a game. If they win, they go free. If they lose, they will live their greatest fear. Either way, their sanity will be challenged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a world of fair but harsh justice. Of retribution and redemption. And mystery. Why was Mara chosen to be the Messenger’s apprentice? What has she done to deserve this terrible fate? She won’t find out until three of the wicked receive justice. And when she does, she will be shattered.</description>

  <description>Tristan Moreau loves his job as chief administrative officer and personal assistant to Webber Kincaid, President, Chairman, and CEO of Kincaid International. It would be the perfect job… if only he hadn’t fallen in love with his boss as well as the work. After two years, he’s still doing everything in his power to keep his feelings hidden—mostly because he wants to protect the reputation of his famous boss but also because he wants to keep his job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Webber Kincaid has stayed in the closet, using his best friend and confidante as his beard. Everything in his life was working out just fine until he met Tristan Moreau. Within months, Tristan stole his heart and became his lifeline. But Webber knows the rules of the workplace better than anyone, so he’s kept his distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But two years is too long to wonder “what if?”—especially when business takes them to a private Caribbean island. When Tristan and Webber succumb to the tropical heat, their professionalism starts to backslide. It’s a seemingly impossible relationship, making a go at it under the paparazzi’s microscope. It may be the best—or the worst—business decision they ever made.</description>

  <description>Six months ago, I was happy. I was simply Naomi Carradine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One month ago, I was admitted into a psych ward. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Lachlan visited me. Kissed me. And told me that I’m starting to lose my mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hours later, Max haunted my thoughts, reminding me I’m not crazy and that he needs my help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few minutes ago, I drifted further from reality, trying to unravel the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now...everyone thinks I’m insane. But, I know he's real, and I know he needs me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you believe me?</description>

  <description>SUICIDE RIDE: THE FIX continues the saga of Johnny Gellis and Norman Dimond begun in the first book in the SUICIDE RIDE series, THE PLATINUM MAN. The basic premise remains the same. If you enjoyed THE PLATINUM MAN, you’ll &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; THE FIX! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;You hitch your lift with this man &lt;br&gt;You'll have your blood on your hand&lt;/em&gt; … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AN OLDER MAN WITH NO FUTURE, AND NOTHING TO LIVE FOR … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Norman Dimond is the Silver Man, an over-the-hill LA-based rock 'n roll record producer who has seen better days. A set-for-life bisexual with a hard spot for younger men, he squanders his nights hustling cash-strapped gay-for-pay desperadoes who swagger into his den on the Sunset Strip, looking for drive-by love in all the right places. Lonely and at loose ends, he longs for a worthy dance partner, but despairs of finding him … Until one night, when he least expects it, in waltzes … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A YOUNGER MAN WITH A PAST, AND A DEATH WISH … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johnny Gellis is the Platinum Man, a beautiful straight wreck who needs fixing—and who wants exactly what Norman Dimond has to give: a platform, a stage. But does he want it badly enough? Desperate to outrun his demons, he's driving himself crazy, and is heading straight for the edge. Can Norman save him, before it's too late? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TWO LIVES ABOUT TO COLLIDE IN A SUICIDE RIDE … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Norman meets Johnny, their heavy-metal fenders bend, sending the male-on-male sparks flying. Johnny's number-one-with-a-bullet hit "Suicide Ride" blows Norman's mind, while his number-99-with-an-anchor tattoo pricks up more than just his ears. And though this hell-bent, cliff-hanging headbanger is the man-boy of his dreams, keeping him on course turns out to be a waking nightmare. Can Norman do it? Can he put him on top while stopping him from breaking down and destroying them both? The deeper Dimond digs, the darker it gets; and as the secrets and suspense multiply, so, too, do the lies. Johnny is hiding something, that much Norman is sure of; and what's worse, he begins to feel the tug of even darker and ever more violent undertows—sinister, malevolent drags that Gellis himself cannot spin-rinse away.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A chilling, classically-inspired ghost story from Susan Hill, our reigning mistress of spine-tingling fiction. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For the last twenty years Sir James Monmouth has journeyed all over the globe in the footsteps of his hero, the great pioneering traveler Conrad Vane. In an effort to learn more about Vane’s early life—and his own—Sir James sets off for the remote Kittiscar Hall on a cold and rainy winter night. But he soon begins to feel as though something is warning him away at every turn; there are the intense feelings of being watched and the strange apparitions of a sad little boy. And as he learns more about his hero’s past, he discovers that they are only the beginning, for Kittiscar Hall is hiding terrible secret that will bind their lives together in ways he could never have imagined.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She has died countless times before, and she is not going to let it happen again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abbie Harper dies just before her eighteenth birthday. It has happened before, more times than she can remember — and always at the hands of the same man. Her dreams are plagued with past lives, cut short.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this latest dream feels different. Her past life as Penelope Broadhurst — an English pastor’s daughter in 1806 — keeps bleeding into her present life in ways both sinister and familiar. As Penelope meets and falls in love with the dashing Heath Lockwood, so too does Abbie meet the brothers Marcus and Rem Knight. One wants to love her; the other to kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time is running out for Penelope, but as Abbie mourns her inability to change the past, she chases the slim chance to save her future. To survive, she must solve the puzzle of an ancient love story…and Penelope just might be able to help</description>

  <description>How do you fall in love when your society has no word for it? "The Last Concubine" is an epic love story closely based on historical events, chronicling 19th century Japan's extraordinary change from a medieval to a modern country. This is the story of a shogun, a princess and the three thousand women of the women's palace - all of whom really existed - and of the civil war that brought their way of life to an end ...Japan, 1865: the women's palace in the great city of Edo is a sprawling complex much like a middle-eastern harem.Bristling with intrigue and erotic rivalries, the palace is home to three thousand women and only one man - the young shogun. Sachi, a beautiful fifteen-year-old girl, is chosen as his concubine. But Japan is changing. Black Ships have arrived from the West, bringing foreigners eager to add Japan to their colonial empires. As civil war erupts, Sachi flees for her life. Rescued by a rebel warrior, she finds unknown feelings stirring within her; but this is a world in which private passions have no place and there is not even a word for 'love'. Before she dare dream of a life with him, Sachi must unravel the mystery of her own origins - a mystery that encompasses a wrong so terrible that it threatens to destroy her ...From the timeless beauty of the Women's Palace in Edo to bloody battles fought outside its walls, "The Last Concubine" is an epic evocation of a country in revolution, and of a young woman's quest to find out who she really is.

  <description>If you walk around every day on eggshells, nervous about making a mistake or looking stupid, then you should read this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a "next big thing" in mind you want to do because you know it will be awesome (starting the business, making the big move, launching the nonprofit, writing the book) but are afraid of doing what it would take to make that thing happen, then you should read this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The universe is very big. You are very small. In fact, you're so small and so insignificant in the big picture that you don't even register to the eye of the cosmos. The universe was here before you were born and will be here long after you're gone, and your life is but a blip on its vast, vast radar. If your life is to matter, it's not going to matter to the universe. It's up to you make your life matter in the only way you can: by doing things that make a difference to you, to those around you, and to those whose lives you touch. Time is short. You have exactly NOW to do whatever it is you're here to do, or to let the inexorable passage of hours and days and years kill your potential like fruit left to die on a vine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The universe doesn’t hate you, but it doesn’t love you, either. You’re just an atom in its infinite workings. The universe doesn’t care if you live, die, suffer, or thrive. Whatever your life here will mean is up to you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stop worrying so much about what others think and start being who you're supposed to be. It's time to do some epic shit.</description>

  <description>What if your last kiss was with the wrong boy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cassidy Haines remembers her first kiss vividly. It was on the old covered bridge the summer before her freshman year with her boyfriend of three years, Ethan Keys. But her last kiss—the one she shared with someone at her seventeenth birthday party the night she died—is a blur. Cassidy is trapped in the living world, not only mourning the loss of her human body, but left with the grim suspicion that her untimely death wasn’t a suicide as everyone assumes. She can’t remember anything from the weeks leading up to her birthday and she’s worried that she may have betrayed her boyfriend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Cassidy is to uncover the truth about that fateful night and make amends with the only boy she’ll ever love, she must face her past and all the decisions she made—good and bad—that led to her last kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bethany Neal’s suspenseful debut novel is about the power of first love and the haunting lies that threaten to tear it apart.</description>

  <description>Delancy Sullivan has always known there’s more to reality than what people see. Every time someone makes a choice, a new, parallel world branches off from the existing one. Eating breakfast or skipping it, turning left instead of right, sneaking out instead of staying in bed ~ all of these choices create an alternate universe in which an echo self takes the road not travelled and makes the opposite decision. As a Walker, someone who can navigate between these worlds, Del’s job is to keep all of the dimensions in harmony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normally, Del can hear the dissonant frequency that each world emits as clear as a bell. But when a training session in an off-key world goes horribly wrong, she is forbidden from Walking by the Council. But Del’s not big on following the rules and she secretly starts to investigate these other worlds. Something strange is connecting them and it’s not just her random encounters with echo versions of the guy she likes, Simon Lane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Del’s decisions have unimaginable consequences and, as she begins to fall for the Echo Simons in each world, she draws closer to a truth that the Council of Walkers is trying to hide ~ a secret that threatens the fate of the entire multiverse.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Lori Adams gives New Adult a haunting paranormal twist with the first novel of The Soulkeepers, a series that blends ancient legends and new myths with an enchanting mix of thrills, humor, and high drama.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Sophia St. James learns that she’ll be moving from Los Angeles to a podunk town somewhere in Connecticut for her senior year of high school, she isn’t expecting an otherworldly encounter. But there is more to Haven Hurst than meets the eye: it’s home to a family of Guardian Angels, and she is the only one who can see them in spirit form. Sophia soon realizes she wants to see much more of Michael, an irresistible yet volatile Guardian who seems drawn to her too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As Michael battles his forbidden desire for the beautiful young newcomer, one of Hell’s most notorious Demon Knights arrives. Handsome and charismatic, Dante has come to claim the reincarnated soul of his lost lover trapped in Sophia. Cursed with the demon of Persuasion living inside him, Dante will use his seductive charms to lure Sophia into a dangerous game that ends with the kiss of death—unless Michael, who has captured Sophia’s heart, can now capture her soul.</description>

  <description>Alexa Costa has a life-altering secret…only she doesn’t know it yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confined by law to the kingdom of Alvair until the age of eighteen, Alexa has lived a sheltered existence under the watchful eye of her sword-wielding guardian, Ivy. Her love interest, Caleb Whitman, is exactly the opposite. A merchant sailor and seeker of rare artifacts, Caleb has lived a life of adventure in nearby San Lucero, the long-time rival of Alvair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her eighteenth birthday, Alexa’s quiet existence becomes tumultuous, and she realizes she does not need to seek to find adventure. Myths become real, legend becomes fact, and Alexa discovers that she possesses rare abilities which make her a target for both sides in a centuries-old struggle for power. She must use every resource available to her—including her talents with the supernatural Amulets— to help her friends, rekindle her romance with Caleb, and save her island home from destruction.</description>

  <description>From N. K. Jemisin’s &lt;a href="http://nkjemisin.com/2013/09/cover-for-the-fifth-season/" rel="nofollow"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Season&lt;/em&gt; is set in a world which has suffered frequent, repeated Extinction Level Events for millions of years, and all life (and magic) in this world has adapted to it. Hundreds of years might pass between these events—easy, plentiful years in which great cities rise, and people have the leisure for art and science and rapid advancement—but then, again and again, the cities fall. The world is littered with the detritus of these times of plenty, and this cover hints at them: past ages of decadence, now decaying; stone that endures beneath flaking gilt.</description>

  <description>In 1996 the Willis' and their friends were harvesting the good life. Secluded in the mountains of Northern California, they lived like simple farmers and ignored the rat race. They existed like many in working hard and paying their taxes. Unlike the majority, they were making their livelihood growing medicinal marijuana. In the blink of an eye, their harmony becomes shattered when Thomas Willis mistakenly shoots a federal agent. Barricading themselves in their home out of fear, the events quickly spiral out of control into a grueling thirteen day standoff. Armed with simple rifles and homemade weapons, they bide their time in a house with no electricity. Tormented by their would-be captors outside, Thomas decides to keep a journal, and page by page he documents the daily struggle of being imprisoned in his own home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the farming colony faces an uncertain fate, Thomas comes to the conclusion that he must get his son to safety before it is too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The novels of Joanne Harris are a literary feast for the senses. &lt;em&gt;Five Quarters of the Orange&lt;/em&gt; represents Harris's most complex and sophisticated work yet - a novel in which darkness and fierce joy come together to create an unforgettable story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Framboise Simon returns to a small village on the banks of the Loire, the locals do not recognize her as the daughter of the infamous Mirabelle Dartigen - the woman they still hold responsible for a terrible tragedy that took place during the German occupation decades before. Althrough Framboise hopes for a new beginning. She quickly discovers that past and present are inextricably intertwined. Nowhere is this truth more apparent than in the scrap book of recipes she has inherited from her dead mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this book, Framboise re-creates her mother's dishes, which she serves in her small creperie. And yet as she studies the scrapbook - searching for clues to unlock the contradiction between her mother's sensuous love of food and often cruel demeanor - she begins to recognize a deeper meaning behind Mirabelle's cryptic scribbles. Whithin the journal's tattered pages lies the key to what actually transpired the summer Framboise was nine years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich and dark. &lt;em&gt;Five Quarters of the Orange&lt;/em&gt; is a novel of mothers and daughters of the past and the present, of resisting, and succumbling, and an extraordinary work by a masterful writer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Try me... Test me... Taste me...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an exotic stranger, Vianne Rocher, arrives in the French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique directly opposite the church, Father Reynaud denounces her as a serious danger to his flock - especially as it is the beginning of Lent, the traditional season of self-denial. War is declared as the priest denounces the newcomer's wares as the ultimate sin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly Vianne's shop-cum-café means that there is somewhere for secrets to be whispered, grievances to be aired, dreams to be tested. But Vianne's plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community in a conflict that escalates into a 'Church not Chocolate' battle. As mouths water in anticipation, can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate éclair?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance. Rich, clever and mischievous, &lt;em&gt;Chocolat&lt;/em&gt; is a literary feast for all senses.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Seven o'clock, on a Monday morning, five hundred years after the end of the world, and goblins had been at the cellar again...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maddy Smith was born with a rusty-coloured runemark on her hand - a symbol of the old gods and definitely cause for suspicion. For magic is &lt;em&gt;dangerous.&lt;/em&gt; Or so everyone thinks. But Maddy &lt;em&gt;enjoys&lt;/em&gt; working magic. Even if it is just to control some pesky goblins. And every time her friend, One-Eye - a good-for-nowt Outlander - comes by, he teaches her more and more about the gods and the runes. Now he wants Maddy to open Red Horse Hill and descend into World Below to retrieve a relic of the old gods. Otherwise it is likely to be the End of Everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again...</description>

  <description>Recovering from a tragic accident I found recalling my past was my answer. When I was ten it was a magical time when I was given a chance by my grannie to have one wish come true...for a little while. I found Evernow, a realm between time and no time where only those who die with a pure heart can go. I was invited. There I discovered my true heritage, the power in a silver necklace, why there is no magic in our world and how evil can come to even the perfect places, but still be defeated with the help of a child. But we have to grow up, even if the perfect life we experienced has to be left behind. Let me tell you of my adventure during the summer when I was ten and you, too, might become a believer in magic once again. My only wish is to return and remain forever. Madison's memory reveals a fantastic world she entered to rescue her Grampy and return a necklace to the rightful owner. But ill intent found this sanctuary created for all magical creatures. Its good light can burn evil, so protection is conjured from the lost essence of the purest of creatures - unicorns. And an elf prince is held captive as ransom for the object of real power the realm was illegally entered to recover. Only the child can enter the lair to free the prince, but she has a lot of help and protection, and it is they who are in most danger. Quote from book: I kept going back for a long time, every chance I could during our stays with Grannie. I was sure it was a special place for something special to visit for me to see. And, finally something did.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ISBN 147764671X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the primary book for this story.  If you're interested in Large Print or the Kindle editions, look up &lt;em&gt;A Price for Love&lt;/em&gt;.  It's the same story.  Anyone who has marked a "flower" cover as to-read, read, or reviewed is a fake or "sock puppet" entry, because those editions no longer exist and, therefore, are no longer available for purchase or loan, and haven't been for quite some time..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A powerful suspense-filled romance; what discovery doesn't separate a broken promise could shatter.&lt;br&gt;Ariel was a victim at seventeen. She's now an unsung hero hidden for her protection. No one knows where she is or her real identity except her advocate. But strange events begin to occur around her home. It affects her sense of invisibility. As a writer in her early twenties living in a country cottage, Ariel devises an experiment to boost her writing and ease her perilously low funds. It's risky, but everything in Ariel's life is risky. Ariel's encounters bring back memories of how her ordeal began, as she learns to deal with the demons within. Her first real love is Jerry, the eighteen year old who cuts her grass and keeps back the "jungle" on her small acreage. Stuck at seventeen emotionally Ariel experiences the pleasant side of her previous horrors, and begins to trust love again. A puppy leads trouble into her life, bringing Danny, a local deputy, to her door. Drawn to her he appoints himself guardian, soon learning there's more to her than imagined. But Danny harbors regret. His hard lesson brings out his true strength when he learns of Ariel's plight, her risky trysts and her love for another. He must let her go to keep her safe, allowing her to heal herself in her own way, always there to look out for her…always loving her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CONTAINS SUGGESTIVE ADULT SITUATIONS</description>

  <description>This is how it begins...five friends partying in the woods. A discovery that shows a disturbing vision to each. For Riley, seeing himself in bed with his long-time crush is a tantalizing reminder of all he can't have. Because Sarah is dating his best friend, and Riley's not about to betray his trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one of the visions comes true...making one of Riley's friends the prime suspect in a gruesome murder. The others are determined to prove the police wrong, but Riley can't shake the hope that the visions were more than hallucinations. And that despite the cost, maybe he's seen how it ends.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Hailed as "epic fantasy on a George R. R. Martin scale, but on speed" (Fixed on Fantasy), the Broken Empire trilogy introduced a bold new world of dark fantasy with the story of Jorg Ancrath’s devastating rise to power. Now, Mark Lawrence returns to the Broken Empire with the tale of a less ambitious prince...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Red Queen is old but the kings of the Broken Empire dread her like no other. For all her reign, she has fought the long war, contested in secret, against the powers that stand behind nations, for higher stakes than land or gold. Her greatest weapon is The Silent Sister—unseen by most and unspoken of by all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Red Queen’s grandson, Prince Jalan Kendeth—drinker, gambler, seducer of women—is one who can see The Silent Sister. Tenth in line for the throne and content with his role as a minor royal, he pretends that the hideous crone is not there. But war is coming. Witnesses claim an undead army is on the march, and the Red Queen has called on her family to defend the realm. Jal thinks it’s all a rumor—nothing that will affect him—but he is wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After escaping a death trap set by the Silent Sister, Jal finds his fate magically intertwined with a fierce Norse warrior. As the two undertake a journey across the Empire to undo the spell, encountering grave dangers, willing women, and an upstart prince named Jorg Ancrath along the way, Jalan gradually catches a glimmer of the truth: he and the Norseman are but pieces in a game, part of a series of moves in the long war—and the Red Queen controls the board.</description>

  <description>A heartbroken girl. A fierce warrior. A hero in the making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen years ago the Kingdom of Winter was conquered and its citizens enslaved, leaving them without magic or a monarch. Now, the Winterians’ only hope for freedom is the eight survivors who managed to escape, and who have been waiting for the opportunity to steal back Winter’s magic and rebuild the kingdom ever since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned as an infant during Winter’s defeat, Meira has lived her whole life as a refugee, raised by the Winterians’ general, Sir. Training to be a warrior—and desperately in love with her best friend, and future king, Mather — she would do anything to help her kingdom rise to power again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when scouts discover the location of the ancient locket that can restore Winter’s magic, Meira decides to go after it herself. Finally, she’s scaling towers, fighting enemy soldiers, and serving her kingdom just as she’s always dreamed she would. But the mission doesn’t go as planned, and Meira soon finds herself thrust into a world of evil magic and dangerous politics – and ultimately comes to realize that her destiny is not, never has been, her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sara Raasch’s debut fantasy is a lightning-fast tale of loyalty, love, and finding one’s destiny.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Some lies lead to true adventure...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maeve, princess of Connacht, was born with her fists clenched. And it's her spirit and courage that make Maeve her father's favorite daughter. But once he becomes the High King, powerful men begin to circle—it's easy to love the girl who brings her husband a kingdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Maeve is more than a prize to be won, and she's determined to win the right to decide her own fate. In the court's deadly game of intrigue, she uses her wits to keep her father's friends and enemies close—but not too close. When she strikes up an unlikely friendship with the son of a visiting druid, Maeve faces a brutal decision between her loyalty to her family and to her own heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning author Esther Friesner has a remarkable gift for combining exciting myth and richly researched history. This fiery heroine's fight for independence in first-century Ireland is truly worthy of a bard's tale. Hand &lt;em&gt;Deception's Princess&lt;/em&gt; to fans of Tamora Pierce, Shannon Hale, and Malinda Lo.</description>

  <description>The New York Times bestselling author of Before I Fall and the Delirium trilogy makes her brilliant adult debut with this mesmerizing story in the tradition of The Lovely Bones, Her Fearful Symmetry, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane—a tale of family, ghosts, secrets, and mystery, in which the lives of the living and the dead intersect in shocking, surprising, and moving ways &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wealthy Richard Walker has just died, leaving behind his country house full of rooms packed with the detritus of a lifetime. His estranged family—bitter ex-wife Caroline, troubled teenage son Trenton, and unforgiving daughter Minna—have arrived for their inheritance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Walkers are not alone. Prim Alice and the cynical Sandra, long dead former residents bound to the house, linger within its claustrophobic walls. Jostling for space, memory, and supremacy, they observe the family, trading barbs and reminiscences about their past lives. Though their voices cannot be heard, Alice and Sandra speak through the house itself—in the hiss of the radiator, a creak in the stairs, the dimming of a light bulb. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The living and dead are each haunted by painful truths that will soon surface with explosive force. When a new ghost appears, and Trenton begins to communicate with her, the spirit and human worlds collide—with cataclysmic results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elegantly constructed and brilliantly paced, Rooms is an enticing and imaginative ghost story and a searing family drama that is as haunting as it is resonant.</description>

  <description>The virus came from deep in Africa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time they had a name for the disease it had wiped out half the continent. Within a year, it had decimated our world. Our species is on the verge of extinction. Only a few of us have survived; those of us lucky enough to be born with a natural immunity to the plague. We scavenge amongst the ruins of our old civilizations, picking out a living from the devastation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, I watched my family die one by one. Now, I am alone. The year is 2024; it has been a decade since the virus reduced humanity to a scattering of survivors strewn out across the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rules that governed our society are gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without laws to protect the innocent, I have seen the worst of humanity throughout the years. Now, I have found a new family who are determined to show me the best. But a fresh mutation of the virus has started turning the harmless, pathetic infected into monstrous predatory creatures bent on our destruction; even the wildlife is turning against us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are forced to leave our home and flee for our lives. It is only through unity that we stand any chance of survival. Enemies wait around every turn. For the sake of our children and our children’s children, we must find some way to survive and flourish again. If we fail, then the human species will cease to exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Sandy McDermott, and I am a survivor. This is my story.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the riveting sequel to the reimagined superhero story The Brokenhearted, Anthem Fleet takes on a powerful new villain and makes some startling discoveries about her family and her past that will forever change her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking up where The Brokenhearted ended, the sequel finds Anthem Fleet attempting to return to a normal life after an experimental surgery that left her with a bionic hummingbird heart and a terrifying new strength. But she can’t shake her suspicions about her father’s connection to the Syndicate and she can’t ignore the cries of help in the crime-ridden city of Bedlam. She finds new promise in her relationship with Ford, but after his lifesaving surgery, the Ford Anthem knew slips away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious new group called “The Invisible” starts attacking the privileged North Siders, Anthem has to step up and be the New Hope that Bedlam needs, or Bedlam will fall…once and for all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publishers Weekly called The Brokenhearted an “atmospheric, adventure-laced debut” with “graceful world-building, strong characterizations, and an enveloping plot.”</description>

  <description>No longer available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bury your face in the red sand, your eyes in the clear sky. The American Southwest shines with sunlight, clean air, and free range. Bone Pile, the mutated twin to Riley Hill’s Burn Pile, digs us out of the darkness to the light of day, where nothing can go wrong. Unless you’re down wind. These tales of terror, dark humor, and horror uncover what lurks in the open, in broad daylight. They Come to See Graves. Desert towns sometimes employ artificial means to survive. More in Bisby . Deserts have a way of stripping bare the reality of how close we are to help when we need it. Survivor. The desert offers a home to those who choose to live alone. Picacho Peak. Simple words and actions stir hidden forces. Dust to Dust. No matter who you are, the desert has a way of bringing you home. To justice.</description>

  <description>Twelve dark, intertwined stories embrace the dark side of common people, bound together on an island in Washington by weird circumstances, an immortal dog, a long trailer, and the omnipresent burn pile. Your neighbors have a dark side. Do you smell what's smoldering in the burn pile?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Evening After" sets the stage as Jim awakens on a beach holding the remnants of his dog's leash. The dog has vanished and, apparently, so have portions of the man's mind. It doesn't take long for him to notice something is wrong with his sense of place and very wrong in the field near the long trailer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Burning" embraces love. Love of nature. Love of memories. And love of who Grace believes she is. But can Grace find it in her heart to save the feral boy who is out to destroy the world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Milepost 4" peeks into the mind of a raptor, or is it the mind of the woman watching him? Is he dead or alive? And what is that strange thing in the field under his flight pattern?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Dark Smoke Things" reveals the light in the center of a young woman's joy. Is it the light of God or the light of fire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Mono-track" sticks us in the tunnel vision of a man focused on finding the truth of strange happenings on the island. Can he open up enough to see what is in front of him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Truth About Halloween" is told by a granny to her rowdy grandson who is too busy plotting pranks to pay heed. But Gran may have a few tricks up her own sleeve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Brutus" is an immortal dog that only wants to go home to his master. He can make it, if he completes a task and outwits the people on the island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sweet Well Water" holds a delicious surprise for those who partake of it. Is the smoking man who concocts it a chemist, or something else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Morning Before" trips us through a time loop, back to "The Evening After." What's with all this lost time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Smoking Man" patiently waits for the call that will free him from his prison on the island. Guilty of causing the death of his friends at the hands of secret American forces, his banishment to the island is coming to an end, and signifies the end of life as they know it to some of those around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Secret Life of Taylor" must remain a secret, since it revolves around knowledge learned while dead. Only Taylor, a brain-damaged man, knows the truth of what he has been shown about heaven and hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Meant to Be" teaches us the truth about holding on, letting go, and fills us in on the real secret of the island. How many will be left to tell the tale? How many will remember?</description>

  <description>No longer available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone is stealing souls, and Cay's is next. Where Cayenne Jensen grew up, Warrior Rock Lighthouse stands sentinel above waters split by Sauvie Island, Washington and Oregon states, and the good and evil intentions of a serial killer. Four-year-old Cay is found adrift in a storm-tossed boat on the Columbia River. She believes the lighthouse shadows have forever hidden the reason she was abandoned, and her mother's fate. Now, as an adult, she is drowning in the dark and frigid currents of losing her husband, her home, and being suspected of murder. The secrets of her past, and how they tie to her present, remain hidden—until an innocent encounter makes her the target of a twisted mind. To survive, Cay must cut open memories, face her fears, and follow a trail of raw bones into the killer's lair. Split River carries the reader through an idyllic world of lush vegetation, wildlife, and island people, as a young woman struggles to channel her fractured life streams and wash clear the mystery of Warrior Rock.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Kitchen Confidential&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Waiter Rant&lt;/em&gt;, a rollicking, eye-opening, fantastically indiscreet memoir of a life spent (and misspent) in the hotel industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jacob Tomsky never &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to go into the hotel business. As a new college graduate, armed only with a philosophy degree and a singular lack of career direction, he became a valet parker for a large luxury hotel in New Orleans. Yet, rising fast through the ranks, he ended up working in “hospitality” for more than a decade, doing everything from supervising the housekeeping department to manning the front desk at an upscale Manhattan hotel. He’s checked you in, checked you out, separated your white panties from the white bed sheets, parked your car, tasted your room-service meals, cleaned your toilet, denied you a late checkout, given you a wake-up call, eaten M&amp;amp;M's out of your minibar, laughed at your jokes, and taken your money. In &lt;em&gt;Heads in Beds&lt;/em&gt; he pulls back the curtain to expose the crazy and compelling reality of a multi-billion-dollar industry we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; we know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heads in Beds&lt;/em&gt; is a funny, authentic, and irreverent chronicle of the highs and lows of hotel life, told by a keenly observant insider who’s seen it all. Prepare to be amused, shocked, and amazed as he spills the unwritten code of the bellhops, the antics that go on in the valet parking garage, the housekeeping department’s dirty little secrets—not to mention the shameless activities of the guests, who are rarely on their best behavior. Prepare to be moved, too, by his candor about what it’s like to toil in a highly demanding service industry at the luxury level, where people expect to get what they pay for (and often a whole lot more). Employees are poorly paid and frequently abused by coworkers and guests alike, and maintaining a semblance of sanity is a daily challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along his journey Tomsky also reveals the secrets of the industry, offering easy ways to get what you need from your hotel without any hassle. This book (and a timely proffered twenty-dollar bill) will help you score late checkouts and upgrades, get free stuff galore, and make that pay-per-view charge magically disappear. Thanks to him you’ll know how to get the very best service from any business that makes its money from putting heads in beds. Or, at the very least, you will keep the bellmen from taking your luggage into the camera-free back office and bashing it against the wall repeatedly.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the sequel to Find Me, Wick Tate, sarcastic teen hacker, is back and once again dealing with criminals and corrupt cops…and a brooding new love interest. Will Wick persevere when some secrets refuse to stay hidden?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wick had thought her troubles were over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she should’ve known better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only is she embroiled in a new murder case, which starts with a body with “Remember Me” carved into it and doesn’t stop there, but she also discovers new evidence surrounding her mother’s suicide…which leads her right back to her imprisoned deadbeat dad. And she has to deal with her flirty new hacker friend, Milo, sniffing around—which her boyfriend, Griff, isn’t too happy about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pressure might be too much as secrets—including Wick’s own—climb to the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember Me is an edge-of-your-seat thrilling read that’ll have readers turning the pages at lightning speed! The paperback of Find Me is on sale simultaneously, and a digital original novella from Romily, featuring Griff, is on sale just a few weeks before!</description>

  <description>Hot girls get the fairy tales. No one cares about the stepsisters' story. Those girls don't get a sweet little ending; they get a lifetime of longing &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imogen Keegen has never had a happily ever after–in fact, she doesn’t think they are possible. Ever since her mother’s death seven years ago, Imogen has pulled herself in and out of therapy, struggled with an “emotionally disturbed” special ed. label, and loathed her perma-plus-sized status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Imogen’s new stepsister, the evil and gorgeous Ella Cinder, moves in down the hall, Imogen begins losing grip on the pieces she’s been trying to hold together. The only things that gave her solace–the theatre, cheese fries, and her best friend, Grant–aren’t enough to save her from her pain this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Imogen is enjoying her moment in the spotlight after the high school musical, the journal pages containing her darkest thoughts get put on display. Now, Imogen must resign herself to be crushed under the ever-increasing weight of her pain, or finally accept the starring role in her own life story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And maybe even find herself a happily ever after.</description>

  <description>Some sixteen-year-olds babysit for extra cash. Some work at the Gap. Becca Williamson breaks up couples.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After watching her sister get left at the altar, Becca knows the true damage that comes when people utter the dreaded L-word. For just $100 via paypal, she can trick and manipulate any couple into smithereens. With relationship zombies overrunning her school, and treating single girls like second class citizens, business is unfortunately booming. Even her best friend Val has resorted to outright lies to snag a boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, she receives a mysterious offer to break up the homecoming king and queen, the one zombie couple to rule them all: Steve and Huxley. They are a JFK and Jackie O in training, masters of sweeping faux-mantic gestures, but if Becca can split them up, then school will be safe again for singletons. To succeed, she'll have to plan her most elaborate scheme to date and wiggle her way back into her former BFF Huxley’s life – not to mention start a few rumors, sabotage some cell phones, break into a car, and fend off the inappropriate feelings she’s having about Val’s new boyfriend. All while avoiding a past victim out to expose her true identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one said being the Break-Up Artist was easy.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Crossing&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in a stunning new trilogy that follows the fate of Maryam and her unlikely companions - Joseph, Ruth and Lazarus. This is fast, suspenseful drama underpinned by a powerful and moving story about love and loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people of Onewere, a small island in the Pacific, know that they are special - chosen to survive the deadly event that consumed the Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, from the rotting cruise ship Star of the Sea, the elite control the population - manipulating old texts to set themselves up as living 'gods'. But what the people of Onewere don't know is this: the leaders will stop at nothing to meet their own blood-thirsty needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Maryam crosses from child to woman, she must leave everything she has ever known and make a crossing of another kind. But life inside the ship is not as she had dreamed, and she is faced with the unthinkable: obey the leaders and very likely die, or turn her back on every belief she once held dear.</description>

  <description>In Serjana Caelum’s world, gods exist. So do goddesses. Sera knows this because she is one of them. A secret long concealed by her parents, Sera is Lakshmi reborn, the human avatar of an immortal Indian goddess rumored to control all the planes of existence. Marked by the sigils of both heaven and hell, Sera’s avatar is meant to bring balance to the mortal world, but all she creates is chaos. A chaos that Azrath, the Asura Lord of Death, hopes to use to unleash hell on earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn between reconciling her past and present, Sera must figure out how to stop Azrath before the Mortal Realm is destroyed. But trust doesn’t come easy in a world fissured by lies and betrayal. Her best friend Kyle is hiding his own dark secrets, and her mysterious new neighbor, Devendra, seems to know a lot more than he’s telling. Struggling between her opposing halves and her attraction to the boys tied to each of them, Sera must become the goddess she was meant to be, or risk failing, which means sacrificing the world she was born to protect.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The only thing bigger than the world is fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy’s life by the pond has always been full. She has water and friends, laughter and the love of her adoptive mother, Lynn, who has made sure that Lucy’s childhood was very different from her own. Yet it seems Lucy’s future is settled already—a house, a man, children, and a water source—and anything beyond their life by the pond is beyond reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When disease burns through their community, the once life-saving water of the pond might be the source of what’s killing them now. Rumors of desalinization plants in California have lingered in Lynn’s mind, and the prospect of a “normal” life for Lucy sets the two of them on an epic journey west to face new dangers: hunger, mountains, deserts, betrayal, and the perils of a world so vast that Lucy fears she could be lost forever, only to disappear in a handful of dust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this companion to &lt;em&gt;Not a Drop to Drink&lt;/em&gt;, Mindy McGinnis thrillingly combines the heart-swelling hope of a journey, the challenges of establishing your own place in the world, and the gripping physical danger of nature in a futuristic frontier.</description>

  <description>The year is 1911. And at The Manor, nothing is as it seems . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Charlotte Edmonds: Beautiful, wealthy, and sheltered, Charlotte feels suffocated by the strictures of upper-crust society. She longs to see the world beyond The Manor, to seek out high adventure. And most of all, romance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Janie Seward: Fiery, hardworking, and clever, Janie knows she can be more than just a kitchen maid. But she isn't sure she possesses the courage -- or the means -- to break free and follow her passions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Charlotte and Janie are ready for change. As their paths overlap in the gilded hallways and dark corridors of The Manor, rules are broken and secrets are revealed. Secrets that will alter the course of their lives. . . forever.</description>

  <description>It's an oppressively hot and sticky morning in June when Sterling and her brother, Phin, have an argument that compels him to run into the town swamp -- the one that strikes fear in all the residents of Sticks, Louisiana. Phin doesn't return. Instead, a girl named Lenora May climbs out, and now Sterling is the only person in Sticks who remembers her brother ever existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sterling needs to figure out what the swamp's done with her beloved brother and how Lenora May is connected to his disappearance -- and loner boy Heath Durham might be the only one who can help her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This debut novel is full of atmosphere, twists and turns, and a swoon-worthy romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Knowing the outcome doesn’t always make a choice easier . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addison Coleman’s life is one big “What if?” As a Searcher, whenever Addie is faced with a choice, she can look into the future and see both outcomes. It’s the ultimate insurance plan against disaster. Or so she thought. When Addie’s parents ambush her with the news of their divorce, she has to pick who she wants to live with—her father, who is leaving the paranormal compound to live among the “Norms,” or her mother, who is staying in the life Addie has always known. Addie loves her life just as it is, so her answer should be easy. One Search six weeks into the future proves it’s not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one potential future, Addie is adjusting to life outside the Compound as the new girl in a Norm high school where she meets Trevor, a cute, sensitive artist who understands her. In the other path, Addie is being pursued by the hottest guy in school—but she never wanted to be a quarterback’s girlfriend. When Addie’s father is asked to consult on a murder in the Compound, she’s unwittingly drawn into a dangerous game that threatens everything she holds dear. With love and loss in both lives, it all comes down to which reality she’s willing to live through . . . and who she can’t live without.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A novel of Mary Cassatt and Edgar Degas’s great romance from the New York Times bestselling author of My Name Is Mary Sutter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The young Mary Cassatt never thought moving to Paris after the Civil War to be an artist was going to be easy, but when, after a decade of work, her submission to the Paris Salon is rejected, Mary’s fierce determination wavers. Her father is begging her to return to Philadelphia to find a husband before it is too late, her sister Lydia is falling mysteriously ill, and worse, Mary is beginning to doubt herself. Then one evening a friend introduces her to Edgar Degas and her life changes forever. Years later she will learn that he had begged for the introduction, but in that moment their meeting seems a miracle. So begins the defining period of her life and the most tempestuous of relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In I Always Loved You, Robin Oliveira brilliantly re-creates the irresistible world of Belle Époque Paris, writing with grace and uncommon insight into the passion and foibles of the human heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An enthralling historical novel about a young woman's struggle to become a doctor during the Civil War &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this stunning first novel, Mary Sutter is a brilliant, head­strong midwife from Albany, New York, who dreams of becoming a surgeon. Determined to overcome the prejudices against women in medicine-and eager to run away from her recent heartbreak- Mary leaves home and travels to Washington, D.C. to help tend the legions of Civil War wounded. Under the guidance of William Stipp and James Blevens-two surgeons who fall unwittingly in love with Mary's courage, will, and stubbornness in the face of suffering-and resisting her mother's pleas to return home to help with the birth of her twin sister's baby, Mary pursues her medical career in the desperately overwhelmed hospitals of the capital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Like Charles Frazier's &lt;em&gt;Cold Mountain&lt;/em&gt; and Robert Hicks's &lt;em&gt;The Widow of the South, My Name Is Mary Sutter&lt;/em&gt; powerfully evokes the atmosphere of the period. Rich with historical detail (including marvelous depictions of Lincoln, Dorothea Dix, General McClellan, and John Hay among others), and full of the tragedies and challenges of wartime, &lt;em&gt;My Name Is Mary Sutter&lt;/em&gt; is an exceptional novel. And in Mary herself, Robin Oliveira has created a truly unforgettable heroine whose unwavering determination and vulnerability will resonate with readers everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Welcome to Extraction testing."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clementine has spent her whole life preparing for her sixteenth birthday, when she’ll be tested for Extraction in the hopes of being sent from the planet Kiel’s toxic Surface to the much safer Core, where people live without fear or starvation. When she proves Promising enough to be “Extracted,” she must leave without Logan, the boy she loves. Torn apart from her only sense of family, Clem promises to come back and save him from brutal Surface life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she finds initially in the Core is a utopia compared to the Surface—it’s free of hard labor, gun-wielding officials, and the moon's lethal acid. But life is anything but safe, and Clementine learns that the planet's leaders are planning to exterminate Surface dwellers—and that means Logan, too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trapped by the steel walls of the underground and the lies that keep her safe, Clementine must find a way to escape and rescue Logan and the rest of the planet. But the planet leaders don't want her running—they want her subdued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With urgent writing, fluid dialogue, and a cast of unforgettable characters, &lt;em&gt;Extraction&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turning, gripping read, sure to entertain lovers of &lt;em&gt;Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/em&gt; and leave them breathless for more.</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Avery Roe wants only to take her rightful place as the witch of Prince Island, making the charms that keep the island’s whale men safe and prosperous at sea. But before she could learn how to control her power, her mother, the first Roe woman in centuries to turn her back on magic, stole Avery away from her grandmother. Avery must escape from her mother before her grandmother dies, taking with her the secrets of the Roes’ power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Avery awakens from a dream foretelling her own murder, she realizes time is running short—for her and for the people of her island, who, without the Roes, will lose their ships and the only life they know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of Tane, a tattooed harpoon boy from the Pacific Islands, Avery plots her escape from her mother and unravels the mysteries of her mother’s and grandmother’s pasts. Becoming a witch may prevent her murder and save her island from ruin, but Avery discovers it will also require a sacrifice she never expected—one she might not be able to make.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Love vs Life.&lt;br&gt;Good vs Evil.&lt;br&gt;War vs Warfare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which would you choose?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a solar flare wipes out most of the world’s inhabitants, it leaves behind nothing but a desolate earth and a desperate population. Existence is no longer a certainty. And with factions now fighting for the power to rule, people start to become reckless with their lives. The world has become a dangerous place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amongst the ensuing chaos, Nate and Hermia — two victims of the new world order — are taken against their will to The Compound. Joined by eight other teenagers all chosen for a specific reason, Nate and Hermia are forced to train as assassins to overthrow the current president and make way for a new leader of the free world. Here, they learn to plan, fight, and most importantly... to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except, despite the casual cruelty of their new existence, both Nate and Hermia — two very strong but very different people — begin to form fragile bonds within the group. But they soon realize their happiness is short lived...because their training is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A war awaits...regardless of how ready or willing they may be.</description>

  <description>Lisa McMann's&lt;em&gt; Dead to You&lt;/em&gt; meets Kate Ellison's &lt;em&gt;The Butterfly Clues&lt;/em&gt; in a psychological thriller full of romance, intrigue, and mystery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year ago, Callie was found in an abandoned apartment, scrawling words on the wall: "I KILLED HIM. His blood is on my hands. His heart is in my soul. I KILLED HIM." But she remembers nothing of that night or of the previous thirty-six hours. All she knows is that her father, the reverend at the Church of the Holy Promise, is missing, as is Hannah, a young girl from the parish. Their disappearances have to be connected and Callie knows that her father was not a righteous man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since that fateful night, she's been plagued by graphomania -- an unending and debilitating compulsion to write. The words that flow from Callie's mind and through her pen don't seem to make sense -- until now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the anniversary of Hannah's vanishing approaches, more words and memories bubble to the surface and a new guy in school might be the key to Callie putting together the puzzle. But digging up the secrets she's buried for so long might be her biggest mistake. </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A sweeping and suspenseful tale of secrets, intrigue, and lovers separated by time, all connected through the mystical qualities of a perfume created in the days of Cleopatra—and lost for 2,000 years.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jac L’Etoile has always been haunted by the past, her memories infused with the exotic scents that she grew up surrounded by as the heir to a storied French perfume company. In order to flee the pain of those remembrances—and of her mother’s suicide—she moves to America, leaving the company in the hands of her brother Robbie. But when Robbie hints at an earth-shattering discovery in the family archives and then suddenly goes missing—leaving a dead body in his wake—Jac is plunged into a world she thought she’d left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in Paris to investigate her brother’s disappearance, Jac discovers a secret the House of L’Etoile has been hiding since 1799: a scent that unlocks the mysteries of reincarnation. The Book of Lost Fragrances fuses history, passion, and suspense, moving from Cleopatra’s Egypt and the terrors of revolutionary France to Tibet’s battle with China and the glamour of modern-day Paris. Jac’s quest for the ancient perfume someone is willing to kill for becomes the key to understanding her own troubled past.</description>

  <description>An epic thriller of secrets, history and murder that will challenge how we think about who we are, and who we were.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE REINCARNATIONIST is equal parts modern-day thriller, historical fiction and love story. With one foot in present-day Rome and New York and another in Rome some 1,600 years ago, my story is about two worlds consumed by the fires of intrigue and passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photojournalist Josh Ryder survives a terrorist's bomb, only to be haunted by near hallucinatory memories of a past life in Rome as a pagan priest whose dangerous congress with Sabina, one of the Vestal Virgins, poses a transgression so serious the lovers will face a certain death if exposed. Scents of jasmine and sandalwood and images of furtive liaisons and violence descend on Josh at will, pulling him to an ancient yet strangely familiar Roman burial chamber harboring the remains of a woman clutching a wooden box.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A trail of present-day murders takes us deeper into a labyrinth at whose heart lies the enigma of a collection of ancient gems or memory stones whose origins trace back to both ancient Egypt and India. The stones' promise to "assist the wearer in reaching his next incarnation" sets the ancient and modern worlds on a collision course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The questions of who we are cannot be asked without first asking who we were. And I've tried to answer that using my own research into reincarnation theory - as well as the tenets and writings of those who have studied and believed in reincarnation over thousands of years.</description>

  <description>The Fearless. An army, powered by an incredible new serum that makes each soldier stronger, sharper, faster than their enemies. Intended as a force for good, the serum has a terrible side-effect - anyone who takes it is stripped of all humanity, empathy, love. And as the Fearless sweep through the country, forcing the serum on anyone in their path, society becomes a living nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cass remembers the night they passed through her village. Her father was Altered. Her mother died soon after. All Cass has left is her little brother - and when Jori is snatched by the Fearless and taken to their hellish lair, Cass must risk everything to get him back.</description>

The day that four passenger planes crash, at almost exactly the same moment, at four different points around the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are only four survivors. Three are children, who emerge from the wreckage seemingly unhurt. But they are not unchanged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the fourth is Pamela May Donald, who lives just long enough to record a voice message on her phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A message that will change the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The message is a warning.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;For fans of&lt;/em&gt; The Walking Dead &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; The Hunger Games&lt;em&gt; comes a YA novel about freedom, choice and family — and the terrifying disease that makes them mutually exclusive. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the day she was born, Lena has viewed the world through the jagged window of a razor-wired fence. The hundred-acre property she shares with her mother in the Australian outback may keep her safe from the Y-Carrier disease, but it is no longer enough to hold Lena’s interest, and her mother’s increasingly tight grip on her free will is stifling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as her curiosity blooms and her courage rises, she meets a boy through the fence — the first boy she has ever laid eyes on. His name is Patrick and he comes with a dangerous yet irresistible invitation of adventure beyond the fence, an invitation to which Lena cannot say no. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lena’s newfound freedom is short-lived and she soon discovers that the Y-Carrier disease is not the only enemy she faces on the outside. Her new enemies want something Lena has, and they are willing to do anything to get it...</description>

  <description>Ever since Viola's boyfriend broke up with her, she has spent her days silently wishing—to have someone love her again and, more importantly, to belong again—until one day she inadvertently summons a young genie out of his world and into her own. He will remain until she makes three wishes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jinn is anxious to return home, but Viola is terrified of wishing, afraid she will not wish for the right thing, the thing that will make her truly happy. As the two spend time together, the lines between master and servant begin to blur, and soon Jinn can't deny that he's falling for Viola. But it's only after Viola makes her first wish that she realizes she's in love with Jinn as well . . . and that if she wishes twice more, he will disappear from her life—and her world—forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson Pearce spins a magical tale about star-crossed lovers, what it means to belong . . . and how important it is to be careful what you wish for.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; comes a thrilling and scary young adult novel about blurred reality where characters in a story find that a deadly and horrifying world exists in the space between the written lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Emma Lindsay has problems: a head full of metal, no parents, a crazy artist for a guardian whom a stroke has turned into a vegetable, and all those times when she blinks away, dropping into other lives so ghostly and surreal it's as if the story of her life bleeds into theirs. But one thing Emma has never doubted is that she's real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she writes "White Space," a story about these kids stranded in a spooky house during a blizzard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, "White Space" turns out to be a dead ringer for part of an unfinished novel by a long-dead writer. The manuscript, which she's never seen, is a loopy &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Inkheart &lt;/em&gt;story in which characters fall out of different books and jump off the page. Thing is, when Emma blinks, she might be doing the same and, before long, she's dropped into the very story she thought she'd written. Trapped in a weird, snow-choked valley, Emma meets other kids with dark secrets and strange abilities: Eric, Casey, Bode, Rima, and a very special little girl, Lizzie. What they discover is that they--and Emma--may be nothing more than characters written into being from an alternative universe for a very specific purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now what they must uncover is why they've been brought to this place--a world between the lines where parallel realities are created and destroyed and nightmares are written--before someone pens their end.</description>

  <description>Catherine Hunter is the daughter of a senior government official on the island of Anglya. She’s one of the privileged – she has luxurious clothes, plenty to eat, and is protected from the Collections which have ravaged families throughout the land. But Catherine longs to escape the confines of her life, before her dad can marry her off to a government brat and trap her forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So Catherine becomes Cat, pretends to be a kid escaping the Collections, and stows away on the skyship Stormdancer. As they leave Anglya behind and brave the storms that fill the skies around the islands of Tellus, Cat’s world becomes more turbulent than she could ever have imagined, and dangerous secrets unravel her old life once and for all . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A riveting tale from the author of &lt;em&gt;The Orphanmaster &lt;/em&gt;about a wild girl from Nevada who lands in Manhattan’s Gilded Age society&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jean Zimmerman’s new novel tells of the dramatic events that transpire when an alluring, blazingly smart eighteen-year-old girl named Bronwyn, reputedly raised by wolves in the wilds of Nevada, is adopted in 1875 by the Delegates, an outlandishly wealthy Manhattan couple, and taken back East to be civilized and introduced into high society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Bronwyn hits the highly mannered world of Edith Wharton� era Manhattan like a bomb. A series of suitors, both young and old, find her irresistible, but the willful girl’s illicit lovers begin to turn up murdered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Zimmerman’s tale is narrated by the Delegate’s son, a Harvard anatomy student. The tormented, self-dramatizing Hugo Delegate speaks from a prison cell where he is prepared to take the fall for his beloved Savage Girl. This narrative—a love story and a mystery with a powerful sense of fable—is his confession.</description>

  <description>Princess Snow is missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her home planet is filled with violence and corruption at the hands of King Matthias and his wife as they attempt to punish her captors. The king will stop at nothing to get his beloved daughter back—but that’s assuming she wants to return at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essie has grown used to being cold. Temperatures on the planet Thanda are always sub-zero, and she fills her days with coding and repairs for the seven loyal drones that run the local mines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a mysterious young man named Dane crash-lands near her home, Essie agrees to help the pilot repair his ship. But soon she realizes that Dane’s arrival was far from accidental, and she’s pulled into the heart of a war she’s risked everything to avoid. With the galaxy’s future—and her own—in jeopardy, Essie must choose who to trust in a fiery fight for survival.</description>

  <description>Divided by day and night and on the run from authorities, star-crossed young lovers unearth a sinister conspiracy in this compelling romantic thriller.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Soleil Le Coeur is a Smudge—a night dweller prohibited by law from going out during the day. When she fakes an injury in order to get access to and kidnap her newborn niece—a day dweller, or Ray—she sets in motion a fast-paced adventure that will bring her into conflict with the powerful lawmakers who order her world, and draw her together with the boy she was destined to fall in love with, but who is also a Ray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a vivid alternate reality and peopled with complex, deeply human characters on both sides of the day-night divide, &lt;em&gt;Plus One&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliantly imagined drama of individual liberty and civil rights, and a fast-paced romantic adventure story.</description>

  <description>Rachel Caine, who’s behind the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Morganville Vampires&lt;/em&gt; series, signed a mid-six-figure deal with NAL for a young adult fantasy trilogy called &lt;em&gt;The Great Library&lt;/em&gt; that is set in an alternate reality. Anne Sowards took North American rights from Lucienne Diver at the Knight Agency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the trilogy, the Library of Alexandria (which housed one of the most significant manuscript collections of the ancient world and famously burned down) still exists. The library has become all-powerful, and, while there is unfettered access to information digitally, it is a crime to keep print books in any personal collection. Into this setup, Diver said, comes “a boy from a family of black market book smugglers and a girl who watched her city die.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diver described the series as “The Book Thief with Fahrenheit 451 by way of Harry Potter.” The first book in &lt;em&gt;The Great Library&lt;/em&gt; series is planned for summer 2015.</description>

  <description>In a world of shadows, anything is possible. Except escaping your fate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since she was a child, Ivy has been gripped by visions of strange realms just beyond her own. But when her sister goes missing, Ivy discovers the truth is far worse—her hallucinations are real, and her sister is trapped in a parallel realm. And the one person who believes her is the dangerously attractive guy who's bound by an ancient legacy to betray her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrian might have turned his back on those who raised him, but that doesn't mean he can change his fate…no matter how strong a pull he feels toward Ivy. Together they search for the powerful relic that can save her sister, but Adrian knows what Ivy doesn't: that every step brings Ivy closer to the truth about her own destiny, and a war that could doom the world. Sooner or later, it will be Ivy on one side and Adrian on the other. And nothing but ashes in between…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A high concept, cinematic read with a surprising twist, &lt;em&gt;MINDERS&lt;/em&gt; asks the question: who is really watching whom?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: If the boy you love commits a crime, would you turn him in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sadie Ames is a type-A teenager from the wealthy suburbs. She's been accepted to the prestigious Mind Corps Fellowship program, where she'll spend six weeks as an observer inside the head of Ford, a troubled boy with a passion for the crumbling architecture of the inner city. There's just one problem: Sadie's fallen in love with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What if the crime is murder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ford Winters is haunted by the murder of his older brother, James. As Sadie falls deeper into his world, dazzled by the shimmering pinpricks of color that form images in his mind, she begins to think she knows him. Then Ford does something unthinkable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What if you saw it happen from inside his mind?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Back in her own body, Sadie is faced with the ultimate dilemma. With Ford's life in her hands, she must decide what is right and what is wrong. And how well she can really ever know someone, even someone she loves.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Southern girl. A wounded soldier. A chilling force deep in the forest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All collide at night’s darkest hour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Seventeen-year-old Violet Dancey has been left at home in Mississippi with a laudanum-addicted stepmother and love-crazed stepsister while her father fights in the war—a war that has already claimed her twin brother. &lt;br&gt;       When she comes across a severely injured Union soldier lying in an abandoned lodge deep in the woods, things begin to change. Thomas is the enemy—one of the men who might have killed her own brother—and yet she's drawn to him. But Violet isn't Thomas's only visitor; someone has been tending to his wounds—keeping him alive—and it becomes chillingly clear that this care hasn't been out of compassion. &lt;br&gt;       Against the dangers of war and ominous powers of voodoo, Violet must fight to protect her home and the people she loves.&lt;br&gt;       From the author of &lt;em&gt;Strands of Bronze and Gold&lt;/em&gt; comes a haunting love story and suspenseful thriller based on the ancient fairy tale of “Tam Lin.”</description>

  <description>Sometimes danger is hard to see... until it’s too late. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Britt Pfeiffer has trained to backpack the Teton Range, but she isn't prepared when her ex-boyfriend, who still haunts her every thought, wants to join her. Before Britt can explore her feelings for Calvin, an unexpected blizzard forces her to seek shelter in a remote cabin, accepting the hospitality of its two very handsome occupants—but these men are fugitives, and they take her hostage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In exchange for her life, Britt agrees to guide the men off the mountain. As they set off, Britt knows she must stay alive long enough for Calvin to find her. The task is made even more complicated when Britt finds chilling evidence of a series of murders that have taken place there... and in uncovering this, she may become the killer’s next target. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nothing is as it seems in the mountains, and everyone is keeping secrets, including Mason, one of her kidnappers. His kindness is confusing Britt. Is he an enemy? Or an ally? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BLACK ICE is New York Times bestselling author Becca Fitzpatrick’s riveting romantic thriller set against the treacherous backdrop of the mountains of Wyoming. Falling in love should never be this dangerous…</description>

  <description>Katie never thought she'd be the girl with the popular boyfriend. She also never thought he would cheat on her-but the proof is in the photo that people at their boarding school can't stop talking about. Mark swears he doesn't remember anything. But Rose, the girl in the photo, is missing, and Mark is in big trouble. Because it looks like Rose isn't just gone…she's dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe Mark was stupid, but that doesn't mean he's a killer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katie needs to find out what really happened, and her digging turns up more than she bargained for, not just about Mark but about someone she loves like a sister: Tessa, her best friend. At Whitney Prep, it's easy to keep secrets…especially the cold-blooded kind.</description>

  <description>Only a few months into their marriage and everything seems grand. Learning to survive her marriage to Jay, without the snarkiness Cindy has come to rely on, is daunting to say the least. The Sugar Ticket chronicles the marital journey of two twice-divorced adults learning to embrace the sweetness of their present. When the inevitable complications arise, will the DeMatteo's gently overcome their obstacles by alleviating the sour taste of the past? Will their third attempt at matrimony flourish? Or will they sweep their issues under the proverbial taboo-topic carpet? Find out how these two mid-life adolescents meet their daily tribulations head on, as they conquer their fears, retirement woes, secrets revealed, and the most fundamental challenge of all: remaining in love forever.</description>

  <description>Twice divorced, cynical Cindy Layton feels like a relic with prehistoric baggage, and doubts she can muster the courage to establish a new relationship, even if it's on her own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her journey out of the Stone Age hits freaky, hilarious turbulence when she joins an Internet dating service. The scammers and weirdoes she meets in cyberspace make Cindy want to crawl back into her cave, until she receives an accidental email from Jay DeMatteo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jay has the dating blues, too, but after meeting Cindy, reconsiders his options. Now it's up to him to convince her it's never too late to pursue a meaningful relationship, even when a couple is struggling with midlife adolescence.</description>

  <description>In this new series told from multiple perspectives, teen members of a search and rescue team discover a dead body in the woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexis, Nick, and Ruby have very different backgrounds: Alexis has spent her life covering for her mom’s mental illness, Nick’s bravado hides his fear of not being good enough, and Ruby just wants to pursue her eccentric interests in a world that doesn’t understand her. When the three teens join Portland County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue, they are teamed up to search for a autistic man lost in the woods. What they find instead is a dead body. In a friendship that will be forged in danger, fear, and courage, the three team up to find the girl’s killer—before he can strike one of their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This first book in April Henry’s Point Last Seen YA mystery series is full of riveting suspense, putting readers in the middle of harrowing rescues and crime scene investigations.</description>

  <description>The door opened slowly, and she could see the outline of five men standing in the corridor. Her room was far enough away from the figures for no one to notice her nose pressing into the door frame. She was aware of her own breathing and tried to slow it down, slow down her heartbeat until she was invisible. The idea in these moments is to be completely invisible. There were a lot of invisible people in Prague, doing invisible things to other invisible people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What would you do to secure your own freedom?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;February 1993. Walls between East and West have dissolved, following the Velvet Revolution of 1989. It is a harsh winter in the newly formed Czech Republic, but the nation celebrates. Arriving in Letovice, Jana is trying to escape a personal loss and come to terms with the changes in her country and in her own life. She stays with the Martineks and meets their son, Miloš. When he leaves Letovice and she travels back to Prague, she encounters a deep and shocking betrayal. Jana meets Lukas, a conservator working on the restoration of a mosaic at the Cathedral of St Vitus. But who is he and what is he hiding?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An evocative portrayal of life during the fall of communism: It is a sometimes heartbreaking tale of deception, distrust and the need for redemption in the aftermath of a regime in which no one can be trusted, not even someone you thought you knew.</description>

  <description>Between revving engines, smoking tires, and high speeds, two friends form a vital bond in the shadows of the blaring spotlight. Sway Reins, a track owner’s only daughter, and Jameson Riley, a gritty NASCAR rookie driver, have been best friends since they were kids. Over the years, Sway becomes his safety shield during his rapid rise to the elite levels of auto racing. A night of celebrating a victory leaves Sway believing that she can convince Jameson to fall in love with her. She becomes determined to be more than just a pit lizard trolling the pits. Little does she know that this steadfast racer has his own idea of revelry. Soon their compression ratios are timed exactly right and all the reciprocating motions have led them to happy hour. As their passion revs, the inner workings of an internal combustion engine have never been so erotic. Just a taste turns into a thirst neither of them saw coming. Can she convince this rookie he can have love and his dream?</description>

  <description>Mitt Romney is a Mormon, but does that mean he's a Christian? Does he belong to a cult? Does he wear funny Mormon underwear? These questions and more are answered in this accessible and concise introduction to Mormonism, in which two sociologists of religion take an objective and often humorous look at 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney's beliefs. Geared to voters wondering whether Romney's Mormon faith should affect their vote, COULD I VOTE FOR A MORMON FOR PRESIDENT? comes at key time for those in search of unbiased information about the candidate and his faith.</description>

  <description>What is a religion? Why are people religious? Are religious people more educated than nonreligious people? Are religious people more moral, more humble, or happier? Are religious people more or less prejudiced than nonreligious people? Is religion good for your health? Are people becoming more or less religious? Studying religion as a social phenomenon, Ryan T. Cragun follows the scientific data to provide answers to these and other questions. At times irreverent, but always engaging and illuminating, &lt;em&gt;What You Don't Know About Religion (but Should)&lt;/em&gt; is for all those who have ever wondered whether religion helps or hurts society—or questioned what the future holds for religion.</description>

  <description>An ancient curse plagues the kingdom of Sherbourne, and unless it is stopped, all will fall to ruin. The King, obsessed with greed, cannot see the danger. But his teenage twin children, Aletha and Adin, know they must act. A hermit leads Adin to a magical map that will send him back in time to discover the origin of the curse. Once back, Adin must find the Keeper, who protects the Gate of Heaven, but all he has is a symbol as a clue to guide him. Unbeknown to Adin, Aletha follows her brother, but they both arrive in Sherbourne’s past at the precipice of a great war, and there is little time to discover how to counteract the curse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One unexpected disaster after another forces the twins to make difficult choices. Adin’s only hope to correct the past is to return to the future to manipulate events so his quest can succeed. Through his trials and failures, Adin learns that nothing can stop heaven from accomplishing its goal, and that all events work for the good of those who trust heaven. An epic fairy tale with surprising twists, embracing the enduring power of love and faith.</description>

  <description>In classic fairy tale style, we embark on an enchanted journey with a young blacksmith—Joran—whose only desire is to live a peaceful, uncomplicated life in his forest village, a desire shattered by the sudden and bizarre disappearance of his wife, Charris. Later, Joran is plagued by nightmares of an unimaginable sea, where Charris remains trapped in a sand castle at the whim of the Moon. The goose woman insists he will find no rest from his nightmares until he solves the riddle of three keys. She tells him to travel the treacherous journey to the house of the Moon to find the answers he seeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to ignore the urgings of his nightmares, Joran sets out north seeking the Moon. Leaving a town and family where he never felt truly at home, Joran’s journey becomes more than just a search for his wife. His path also leads inward, for he must face emotions that have tormented him his entire life—feelings of alienation and anger, of despair and hurt. Along the way he rescues a wolf—a huge, imposing creature that becomes a companion, and eventually a trusted friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joran has the uncanny ability to speak with animals, and learns from the wolf, Ruyah, that he can manipulate his dreams to affect the real world. With Ruyah’s humor and guidance, Joran finds the courage and fortitude to press on, despite setbacks and disappointments. With the wolf by his side he endures the darkness at the end of the world and the ravings of the lunatic Moon, who sends him off—more confused than before—to the Palace of the Sun with a seemingly useless gift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After trekking through a vast, unmerciful desert, Joran arrives at the Palace of the Sun, where he meets the Sun’s mother, Sola. She helps Joran understand part of his riddle and then sends him, with the gift of a sunstone, to the cave of the South Wind, whom, she says, will finally reveal the truth to him about his wife—if he dares hear it. He and Ruyah travel south through jungle, and finally arrive at the cave. There Joran is swept along a vision where he sees his past, and in horror, learns truths that send him into deep despair. The South Wind dismisses him with one last gift—but like the other two gifts, he has no idea what they are for or how they will help him rescue his wife. She tells him to find the sea of his dreams—far west, beyond his imagining.</description>

  <description>A minor penalty that is not called until the offending team gains control of the puck. As long as the non-offending team maintains possession, the referee allows play to continue and signals a delayed penalty by raising his arm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Evan Mason, an NHL hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks. I spend my nights roughing up two hundred pound defensemen and, at times, spend more time in the penalty box than I do on the ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s my job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night changed everything I thought I once knew about my life on, and off, the ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brutally beaten girl left to die in an alley.&lt;br&gt;I don’t know why or how but something made me stay that night after taking her to the hospital. I didn’t know her, nor did I have an obligation to stay but something inside of me rooted me there telling me I should stay. Saving a life is worth something. At least I thought so. And I wouldn’t have been me if I just simply left her there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any man who put his heart and soul into a game of hockey couldn’t just walk away when someone needed them. She had no one else right now. The same guy who saw determination where there was desire, now saw hope where there was once despair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t leave. That wouldn’t be me. No, not a man that put all he had into something some called just a game. I couldn’t walk away from her holding onto life, weak and powerless to something she had no control over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I stayed. In a room full of family members praying for their loved ones to pull through, I prayed for a girl I didn’t know and had never met before, to have a beating heart. While others’ sorrows turned to grieving pain, I sat waiting on the words of the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No bond is stronger than the ones you’ll bleed for.</description>

  <description>Bailey Gray is tired of her perfectly planned life. Everything about her life has been organized and lived out to the expectations set of her parents. She is the class valedictorian, has perfect grades, the perfect friends, a perfect boyfriend, basically perfect life...or so everyone thought. That's when she realizes the path planned isn't always the path chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On graduation day she makes a decision. One that changes everything she thought she knew about her intended future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a whim, she runs away with the town rebel, Dylan Wade, in search of the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Wade isn't looking to run away from anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows what he wants as he's been waiting on it for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a journey to find the unknown, they discover a friendship they once knew along the open highway and have not a care in the world. Between the yellow and white lines of the heated summer asphalt, a spark draws them together as Dylan's past and Bailey future try to rip them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could it be that Dylan and his GTO are exactly what her perfectly planned life needs?</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Taylor’s given up on happiness. He’s just trying to survive. Haunted by his brother’s death and pushed around at school, he spends his days searching for a quiet moment of peace, until he meets Elora. The enigmatic runaway gives him a hope he’s never had—the hope of truly connecting with another human being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the daughter of the Unseelie Queen has different plans for Taylor. Born into a world of corruption and war, Elora is determined to free her people from her mother’s tyranny. If she can gain the allegiance of the Seelie Queen, her mother’s loathed enemy, she and her rebels can crush the Dark Court and bring equality to Faerie. But to do that, she’ll need a proper offering . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To steal a mortal, Elora must become a mortal—at least, by all appearances. And infiltrating Taylor’s high school is surprisingly easy. But as she becomes entangled in his world, Elora realizes something startling: inequality in the human world isn’t so different from inequality in Faerie. Students are bullied, ostracized and attacked for being different. And just like she did in Faerie, she begins gathering up the outcasts, encouraging them to take back the school. Now Elora has two rebellions on her hands: a quickly mounting mutiny in Faerie, and a mortal uprising inspired by the boy she’s destined to betray.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From a former CIA officer comes the riveting account of a royal Middle Eastern family exiled to the American suburbs&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When her father is killed in a coup, 15-year-old Laila flees from the war-torn middle east to a life of exile and anonymity in the U.S. Gradually she adjusts to a new school, new friends, and a new culture, but while Laila sees opportunity in her new life, her mother is focused on the past. She’s conspiring with CIA operatives and rebel factions to regain the throne their family lost. Laila can’t bear to stand still as an international crisis takes shape around her, but how can one girl stop a conflict that spans generations? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; J.C. Carleson delivers a fascinating account of a girl—and a country—on the brink, and a rare glimpse at the personal side of international politics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; *Bonus Backmatter includes a note about the author's CIA past, and a commentary by RAND researcher and president of ARCH International, Dr. Cheryl Benard. Recommendations for further reading are also included. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Because chaos won’t banish itself…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kit is proud to be a Blackhart, now she’s encountered her unorthodox cousins and their strange lives. And her home-schooling now includes spells, fighting enemy fae and using ancient weapons. But it’s not until she rescues a rather handsome fae prince, fighting for his life on the edge of Blackhart Manor, that her training really kicks in. With her family away on various missions, Kit must protect Prince Thorn, rely on new friends and use her own unfamiliar magic to stay ahead of Thorn’s enemies. As things go from bad to apocalyptic, fae battle fae in a war that threatens to spill into the human world. Then Kit pits herself against the Elder Gods themselves – it’s that or lose everyone she’s learnt to love.</description>

  <description>It is written that three Sisters of Fate have the power &lt;br&gt;to change the world's destiny. &lt;br&gt;But only if they survive…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lockwood triplets have had the prophecy drummed into their heads since birth. Still, Raven, the eldest of the sisters, can't believe it's really happening. She's the reincarnation of a Norse goddess? One of the sisters is destined to die? When it starts snowing in summer in Florida, the sisters fear the worst has come to pass. Ragnarok, the Norse end of the world, has begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raven finds herself the secret protector of Vanir, a boy with two wolves, a knowledge of Norse magic and a sense of destiny he can't quite explain. He's intense, sexy and equally determined to save her when it becomes clear someone is endangering them. Raven doesn't know if getting closer to him will make a difference in the coming battle, but her heart isn't giving her a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahead of the sisters is the possibility of death at the hand of a warrior, death by snow, death by water or death by fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or even from something else…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sisters of Fate&lt;br&gt;The prophecy doesn't lie: one is doomed to die.</description>

  <description>In this timeless new trilogy about love and sacrifice, a princess must find her place in a reborn world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a society steeped in tradition, Princess Lia’s life follows a preordained course. As First Daughter, she is expected to have the revered gift of sight—but she doesn’t—and she knows her parents are perpetrating a sham when they arrange her marriage to secure an alliance with a neighboring kingdom—to a prince she has never met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the morning of her wedding, Lia flees to a distant village. She settles into a new life, hopeful when two mysterious and handsome strangers arrive—and unaware that one is the jilted prince and the other an assasin sent to kill her. Deception abounds, and Lia finds herself on the brink of unlocking perilous secrets—even as she finds herself falling in love.</description>

  <description>When your ex husband is a frightening psychopath and your new husband ends up mysteriously dead, it would seem logical to wonder... But Kate truly hadn’t. She had buried her tracks so deeply. And Lex’s death had seemed a tragic accident... Until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the space of three nights everything changes. A frightening encounter with a stranger on a lonely roadside, a prowler in the house when she returns home, a body found hanging in the bush...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear prods Kate into action. Has Wade found her after all these years? Was Lex’s death really an accident? She has to pull herself together and tamp down the impulse to cut all her ties and run as far and fast as she can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lots of people have secrets. This doesn’t have to be about her. How much did she know about Lex, really?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do people with a past somehow find each other?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A thrilling retelling of the star-crossed tale of Romeo and Juliet, from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of the Morganville Vampires series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Houses of Montague and Capulet, there is only one goal: power. The boys are born to fight and die for honor and—if they survive—marry for influence and money, not love. The girls are assets, to be spent wisely. Their wishes are of no import. Their fates are written on the day they are born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Benvolio Montague, cousin to Romeo, knows all this. He expects to die for his cousin, for his house, but a spark of rebellion still lives inside him. At night, he is the Prince of Shadows, the greatest thief in Verona—and he risks all as he steals from House Capulet. In doing so, he sets eyes on convent-bound Rosaline, and a terrible curse begins that will claim the lives of many in Verona…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…And will rewrite all their fates, forever.</description>

  <description>A whopping 85,000 women are raped in England and Wales every year, according to the Office of National Statistics, ONS, 2013. The numbers in South Asian countries, India being on top are outrageously alarming. Are we in a position to just sit and wonder why and do nothing about it? According to Shahla Khan, the author of I Want Back My SPARKLE, the answer is NO, we need to take control and it is a deficiency in our passion to end sexual violence which is why the statistics are ever increasing. For several years, across the globe, women and crimes against women were the last items on the list for economists and policy makers to be fixed. In the last 20 years, the scenario has changed drastically with regards to the research and implementation of Laws. For example, the recognition of rape in marriage as a crime in the UK, in 1985. Despite, these rational Laws and support centers, rape, domestic violence and stalking are still blooming. "It is all about knowledge. In western countries, the main factor responsible for these crimes is manipulation, while in South Asian communities, culture is the culprit," says Shahla. In her book, she has transformed complex research related information from Law, Forensic science, Psychology and Gender Studies into simple, yet useful information. The book basically opens up the horizon of knowledge for men and women to understand the strategy of manipulation and the lame excuse of culture, propelling these crimes. Shahla reports that another major cause of these crimes blooming is the myths around them. Most people believe in the myths, rather than the facts around these crimes. Women today, even though educated, are confused in this fantasy world of their prince charming dream and their willingness to stoop down to every level to make that fantasy true. This shuts their logic button to spot manipulation from strange and also known men, who play them just for fun. On the other hand in South Asian communities, society puts extreme premium on women who sacrifice their lives to run a home and the ultimate destination of every "good" woman according to the cultural and religious customs is the kitchen sink or the laundry room at most. Shahlas book comes from her excellent cultural insights from her life in Saudi Arabia, India, Switzerland and the UK. In, I Want Back My SPARKLE, the readers will learn how to: 1. Determine if they or someone they know is a victim. 2. End victimization and step out of an abusive relationship. 3. Avoid false claims of sexual harassment from men or women. 4. Create a wave of change in their home, community, at workplace and in the global scenario. 5. Be prepared to handle themselves in crisis. 6. Claim back their Status of respect Power of speech Access to freedom Right to happiness Knowledge and education Love not lust Existence as an equal!</description>

  <description>Mysterious. Magnificent. Creepy. Welcome to Rockford Manor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There's something hidden in the Maze." Seventeen-year-old Imogen has never forgotten the last words her father said to her seven years ago, before the blazing fire that consumed him, her mother, and the gardens of her family's English country manor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Haunted by her parents' deaths, Imogen moves to New York City with her new guardians. But when a letter arrives with the news of her cousin's untimely death, revealing that Imogen is now the only heir left to run the estate, she returns to England and warily accepts her role as duchess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All is not as it seems at Rockford, and Imogen quickly learns that dark secrets lurk behind the mansion's aristocratic exterior, hinting that the spate of deaths in her family were no accident. And at the center of the mystery is Imogen herself--and Sebastian, the childhood friend she has secretly loved for years. Just what has Imogen walked into?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combining a spine-tingling mystery, powerful romance, and unforgettable characters, SUSPICION is an action-packed thrill ride.</description>

  <description>In the future, food is no longer necessary—until Thalia begins to feel something unfamiliar and uncomfortable. She’s hungry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Thalia’s world, there is no need for food—everyone takes medication (or “inocs”) to ward off hunger. It should mean there is no more famine, no more obesity, no more food-related illnesses, and no more war. At least that's what her parents, who work for the company that developed the inocs, say. But when Thalia meets a boy who is part of an underground movement to bring food back, she realizes that most people live a life much different from hers. Worse, Thalia is starting to feel hunger, and so is he—the inocs aren’t working. Together they set out to find the only thing that will quell their hunger: real food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;H. A. Swain delivers an adventure that is both epic and fast-paced. Get ready to be &lt;em&gt;Hungry&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Princess Marie-Victoria, heir to the Lily Throne, and Aelwyn Myrddn, bastard daughter of the Mage of England, grew up together. But who will rule, and who will serve? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quiet and gentle, Marie has never lived up to the ambitions of her mother, Queen Eleanor the Second, Supreme Ruler of the Franco-British Empire. With the help of her Head Merlin, Emrys, Eleanor has maintained her stranglehold on the world's only source of magic. She rules the most powerful empire the world has ever seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even with the aid of Emrys' magic, Eleanor's extended lifespan is nearing its end. The princess must marry and produce an heir or the Empire will be vulnerable to its greatest enemy, Prussia. The two kingdoms must unite to end the war, and the only solution is a match between Marie and Prince Leopold VII, heir to the Prussian throne. But Marie has always loved Gill, her childhood friend and soldier of the Queen's Guard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, Marie and Aelwyn, a powerful magician in her own right, come up with a plan. Aelwyn will take on Marie's face, allowing the princess to escape with Gill and live the quiet life she's always wanted. And Aelwyn will get what she's always dreamed of--the chance to rule. But the court intrigue and hunger for power in Lenoran England run deeper than anyone could imagine. In the end, there is only rule that matters in Eleanor's court: trust no one.</description>

  <description>A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller!&lt;br&gt;They burned her home.&lt;br&gt;They stole her brother and sister.&lt;br&gt;But vengeance is following.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shy South hoped to bury her bloody past and ride away smiling, but she'll have to sharpen up some bad old ways to get her family back, and she's not a woman to flinch from what needs doing. She sets off in pursuit with only a pair of oxen and her cowardly old step father Lamb for company. But it turns out Lamb's buried a bloody past of his own. And out in the lawless Far Country the past never stays buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their journey will take them across the barren plains to a frontier town gripped by gold fever, through feud, duel and massacre, high into the unmapped mountains to a reckoning with the Ghosts. Even worse, it will force them into an alliance with Nicomo Cosca, infamous soldier of fortune, and his feckless lawyer Temple, two men no one should ever have to trust . . . &lt;br&gt;RED COUNTRY takes place in the same world as the First Law trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Best Served Cold, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt;The Heroes&lt;/em&gt;. This novel also represents the return of Logen Ninefingers, one of Abercrombie's most beloved characters.</description>

  <description>For centuries, the Furies have lived among us. Long ago they were called witches and massacred by the thousands. But they’re human just like us, except for a rare genetic mutation that they’ve hidden from the rest of the world for hundreds of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, a chance encounter with a beautiful woman named Ariel has led John Rogers into the middle of a secret war among the Furies. Ariel needs John’s help in the battle between a rebellious faction of the clan and their elders. The grand prize in this war is a chance to remake the human race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Alpert's &lt;em&gt;The Furies&lt;/em&gt; weaves cutting-edge science into an ingenious thriller, showing how a simple genetic twist could have inspired tales of witchcraft and sorcery, and how the paranormal could indeed be possible.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Cabaret&lt;/em&gt; meets Cassandra Clare-a haunting magical thriller set in a riveting 1930s-esque world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Thea Holder's mother is cursed with a spell that's driving her mad, and whenever they touch, Thea is chilled by the magic, too. With no one else to contribute, Thea must make a living for both of them in a sinister city, where danger lurks and greed rules.&lt;br&gt;Thea spends her nights waitressing at the decadent Telephone Club attending to the glitzy clientele. But when her best friend, Nan, vanishes, Thea is compelled to find her. She meets Freddy, a young, magnetic patron at the club, and he agrees to help her uncover the city's secrets-even while he hides secrets of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, they find a whole new side of the city. Unrest is brewing behind closed doors as whispers of a gruesome magic spread. And if they're not careful, the heartless masterminds behind the growing disappearances will be after them, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perfect for fans of Cassandra Clare, this is a chilling thriller with a touch of magic where the dead don't always seem to stay that way.</description>

  <description>The Jewel means wealth. The Jewel means beauty. The Jewel means royalty. But for girls like Violet, the Jewel means servitude. Not just any kind of servitude. Violet, born and raised in the Marsh, has been trained as a surrogate for the royalty––because in the Jewel the only thing more important than opulence is offspring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Purchased at the surrogacy auction by the Duchess of the Lake and greeted with a slap to the face, Violet (now known only as #197) quickly learns of the brutal truths that lie beneath the Jewel’s glittering facade: the cruelty, backstabbing, and hidden violence that have become the royal way of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet must accept the ugly realities of her existence . . . and try to stay alive. But then a forbidden romance erupts between Violet and a handsome gentleman hired as a companion to the Duchess’s petulant niece. Though his presence makes life in the Jewel a bit brighter, the consequences of their illicit relationship will cost them both more than they bargained for.</description>

  <description>If high school is all about social status, Indigo Blackwood has it made. Sure, her quirky mom owns an occult shop, and a nerd just won’t stop trying to be her friend, but Indie is a popular cheerleader with a football-star boyfriend and a social circle powerful enough to ruin everyone at school. Who wouldn’t want to be her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a guy dies right before her eyes. And the dusty old family Bible her mom is freakishly possessive of is stolen. But it’s when a frustratingly sexy stranger named Bishop enters Indie’s world that she learns her destiny involves a lot more than pom-poms and parties. If she doesn’t get the Bible back, every witch on the planet will die. And that’s seriously bad news for Indie, because according to Bishop, she’s a witch too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly forced into a centuries-old war between witches and sorcerers, Indie’s about to uncover the many dark truths about her life—and a future unlike any she ever imagined on top of the cheer pyramid.</description>

  <description>When a supernatural freak of nature forces her family to separate, seventeen-year-old Charlie Page must turn to her frustrating (yet gorgeous) neighbor, Seth, to help reunite them. Seth whisks Charlie to Ellauria—a magical world filled with the creatures of myths and legends—and tells her of the Fellowship, the group charged with protecting mystical beings from human discovery. (All except Bigfoot: that attention whore is a total lost cause.) But when Charlie learns that she's under the Fellowship's protection herself, well, "stressed" is an understatement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellauria should be the safest place for Charlie while the Fellowship works to find her family, but things in the mystical realm aren’t what they seem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Magic is failing, creatures are dying, and the Fellowship insists Charlie holds the key to saving everyone. With her family still missing and the danger in Ellauria growing, Charlie doesn't know who she can trust. She's dealing with a power she never asked for, falling for a guy she can't have, and being forced to choose between her destiny and her heart. And if she chooses wrong, she could destroy magic forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie may be in over her head.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;You may think me biased, being murdered myself. But my state of being has nothing to do with the curiosity toward my own species, if we can be called such. We do not go gentle, as your poet encourages, into that good night.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dead girl walks the streets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She hunts murderers. Child killers, much like the man who threw her body down a well three hundred years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when a strange boy bearing stranger tattoos moves into the neighborhood so, she discovers, does something else. And soon both will be drawn into the world of eerie doll rituals and dark Shinto exorcisms that will take them from American suburbia to the remote valleys and shrines of Aomori, Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the boy has a terrifying secret - one that would just &lt;em&gt;kill&lt;/em&gt; to get out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Girl from the Well&lt;/em&gt; is A YA Horror novel pitched as "Dexter" meets "The Grudge", based on a well-loved Japanese ghost story.</description>

  <description>Devi Morris isn't your average mercenary. She has plans. Big ones. And a ton of ambition. It's a combination that's going to get her killed one day - but not just yet. &lt;br&gt;That is, until she just gets a job on a tiny trade ship with a nasty reputation for surprises. The Glorious Fool isn't misnamed: it likes to get into trouble, so much so that one year of security work under its captain is equal to five years everywhere else. With odds like that, Devi knows she's found the perfect way to get the jump on the next part of her Plan. But the Fool doesn't give up its secrets without a fight, and one year on this ship might be more than even Devi can handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If Sigouney Weaver in &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; met Starbuck in &lt;em&gt;Battlestar Galactica&lt;/em&gt;, you'd get Deviana Morris -- a hot new mercenary earning her stripes to join an elite fighting force. Until one alien bite throws her whole future into jeopardy.</description>

  <description>Thyra Winther's seventeen, the Snow Queen, and immortal, but if she can't reassemble a shattered enchanted mirror by her eighteenth birthday she's doomed to spend eternity as a wraith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Armed with magic granted by a ruthless wizard, Thyra schemes to survive with her mind and body intact. Unencumbered by kindness, she kidnaps local boy Kai Thorsen, whose mathematical skills rival her own. Two logical minds, Thyra calculates, are better than one. With time rapidly melting away she needs all the help she can steal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A cruel lie ensnares Kai in her plan, but three missing mirror shards and Kai's childhood friend, Gerda, present more formidable obstacles. Thyra's willing to do anything – venture into uncharted lands, outwit sorcerers, or battle enchanted beasts -- to reconstruct the mirror, yet her most dangerous adversary lies within her breast. Touched by the warmth of a wolf pup's devotion and the fire of a young man's desire, the thawing of Thyra's frozen heart could be her ultimate undoing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CROWN OF ICE is a YA Fantasy that reinvents Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen" from the perspective of a young woman who discovers that the greatest threat to her survival may be her own humanity.</description>

  <description>Alessia Jacobs is a typical sixteen-year-old, dying to get out of her small town of Twin Willows, Maine. Things look up when a new family comes to town, but when she falls for the hot, mysterious son, Jonah, her life turns upside down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weird visions of transforming into an otherworldly falcon are just the beginning. Soon she learns she’s part of the Benandanti, an ancient cult of warriors with the unique power to separate their souls from their bodies and take on the forms of magnificent animals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alessia never would’ve suspected it, but her boring town is the site of an epic struggle between the Benandanti and the Malandanti to control powerful magic in the surrounding forest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Alessia is drawn into the Benandanti’s mission, her relationship with Jonah intensifies. When her two worlds collide, Alessia’s forced to weigh choices a sixteen-year-old should never have to make.</description>

  <description>Humanity is in danger of extinction from an otherworldly race of savage creatures hell bent on revenge for their banishment from the physical realm eons ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They aim to take back what was once theirs, the physical realm, by culling the human race. They are coming through an open portal into this realm in their thousands and spreading across the whole country, waiting for the signal to begin their invasion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a race against time as Elena has no choice but to join forces with her enemy and enter the forsaken realm to search for the lost items needed to re-enact the banishment of so long ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join them on their journey through the forsaken realm. Travel with them as they battle creatures, tackle obstacles, and seek to avoid letting the savageness of the realm change their very souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each group seeks the means to exorcise the other species from existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only one race can survive.</description>

  <description>In Eden City, the Wordless, or illiterate poor, would never even dream of meeting one of the all-powerful Words who run the city-state. Much less of running away with one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a drop-dead gorgeous girl literally falls in his lap during his routine trash run, seventeen-year-old Tavin Barnes isn’t sure if it’s the luckiest day of his life, or the beginning of the worst. Because Khaya is also the Word of Life, meaning that she could either heal a wound with a touch or command an ivy bush to devour a city block, depending on her mood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By helping Khaya escape the seemingly idyllic confines of Eden City into Europe beyond, Tavin unwittingly throws himself into the heart of a conflict that is threatening to tear the city apart… if not the world. Eden City’s elite will stop at nothing to protect the shocking secret Khaya hides, and enlists the help of the other Words, each with their own frightening powers—like the ability to spark a fire, raise a flood, or kill with a touch—to bring her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To survive, Tavin must confront the mysteries of his past… and risk sacrificing what he cares about most.</description>

  <description>Tate and his father don’t exactly get along. As Tate sees it, his father has unreasonably high expectations for Tate to be the best—at everything. Tate finally learns what he’s being prepared for when he steals one of his dad’s odd tech inventions and mercenaries ambush the school, killing his father in the process and sending Tate on the run from aliens who look just like humans. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Tate knows--like how to make weapons out of oranges and lighter fluid--may not be enough to save him as he’s plunged into a secret inter-species conflict that’s been going on for centuries. Aided only by his girlfriend and his estranged mother, with powerful enemies closing in on all sides, Tate races to puzzle out the secret behind his father’s invention and why so many are willing to kill for it. A riveting, fast-paced adventure, Scan is a clever alien thriller with muscle and heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I don't do dangerous.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smart, über-careful, ordinary Samantha-that's me. But I just couldn't pass up a surprise kiss from my number-one unattainable crush. A kiss that did something to me...something strange. Now I feel hungry all the time, but not for food. It's like part of me is missing-and I don't know if I can get it back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's Bishop. At first I thought he was just a street kid, but the secrets he's keeping are as intense as his unearthly blue eyes. If he's what I think he is, he may be the only one who can help me. But something terrifying is closing in, and the one chance Bishop and I have to stop it means losing everything I ever wanted and embracing the darkness inside me.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NIGHTWATCHERS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When angels and demons must work together, something beyond evil is rising...</description>

  <description>Roberta 'Bobbie' Rowe is not the kind of person who believes in ghosts. A Halloween dare at her ridiculously spooky boarding school is no big deal, especially when her best friend Naya and cute local boy Caine agree to join in too. They are ordered to summon the legendary ghost of 'Bloody Mary': say her name five times in front of a candlelit mirror, and she shall appear... But, surprise surprise, nothing happens. Or does it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next morning, Bobbie finds a message on her bathroom mirror... five days... but what does it mean? And who left it there? Things get increasingly weird and more terrifying for Bobbie and Naya, until it becomes all too clear that Bloody Mary was indeed called from the afterlife that night, and she is definitely not a friendly ghost. Bobbie, Naya and Caine are now in a race against time before their five days are up and Mary comes for them, as she has come for countless others before... A truly spine-chilling yet witty horror from shortlisted 'Queen of Teen' author James Dawson.</description>

  <description>A new killer is stalking the streets of London’s East End. Though newspapers have dubbed him ‘the Torso Killer’, this murderer’s work is overshadowed by the hysteria surrounding Jack the Ripper’s Whitechapel crimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The victims are women too, but their dismembered bodies, wrapped in rags and tied up with string, are pulled out of the Thames – and the heads are missing. The murderer likes to keep them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mayhem is a masterwork of narrative suspense: a supernatural thriller set in a shadowy, gaslit London, where monsters stalk the cobbled streets and hide in plain sight.</description>

  <description>The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I read once that water is a symbol for emotions. And for a while now, I've thought maybe my mother drowned in both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna's life is upended when her father accepts a job transfer the summer before her junior year. It's bad enough that she has to leave her friends and her life behind, but her dad is moving them to the beach where her parents first met and fell in love--a place awash in memories that Anna would just as soon leave under the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While life on the beach is pretty great, with ocean views and one adorable lifeguard in particular, there are also family secrets that were buried along the shore years ago. And the ebb and flow of the ocean's tide means that nothing--not the sea glass that she collects on the sand and not the truths behind Anna's mother's death--stays buried forever.</description>

  <description>I’ve battled the Reapers of Chaos before–and survived. But this time I have a Bad, Bad Feeling it’s going to be a fight to the death … most likely mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yeah, I’ve got my psychometry magic, my talking sword, Vic–and even the most dangerous Spartan on campus at my side, in Logan freaking Quinn, but I’m no match for Loki, the evil Norse god of chaos. I may be Nike’s Champion, but at heart, I’m still just Gwen Frost, that weird Gypsy girl everyone at school loves to gossip about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then someone I love is put in more danger than ever before, and something inside me snaps. This time, Loki and his Reapers are going down for good … or I am.</description>

Disguised as a boy, she enlists the help of the handsome but also cursed Prince Niklaas to fight legions of evil and free her brother from the ogre queen who stole Aurora's throne ten years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Aurora triumph over evil and reach her brother before it's too late? Can Aurora and Niklaas break the curses that will otherwise forever keep them from finding their one true love?</description>

But everything is turned around when the boy Sylvie’s loved since fifth grade falls for Cassie.

  <description>Fans of Ally Carter, especially her Heist Society readers, will love this teen mystery/thriller with sarcastic wit, a hint of romance, and Ocean’s Eleven–inspired action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julep Dupree tells lies. A lot of them. She’s a con artist, a master of disguise, and a sophomore at Chicago’s swanky St. Agatha High, where her father, an old-school grifter with a weakness for the ponies, sends her to so she can learn to mingle with the upper crust. For extra spending money Julep doesn’t rely on her dad—she runs petty scams for her classmates while dodging the dean of students and maintaining an A+ (okay, A-) average.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she comes home one day to a ransacked apartment and her father gone, Julep’s carefully laid plans for an expenses-paid golden ticket to Yale start to unravel. Even with help from St. Agatha’s resident Prince Charming, Tyler Richland, and her loyal hacker sidekick, Sam, Julep struggles to trace her dad’s trail of clues through a maze of creepy stalkers, hit attempts, family secrets, and worse, the threat of foster care. With everything she has at stake, Julep’s in way over her head . . . but that’s not going to stop her from using every trick in the book to find her dad before his mark finds her. Because that would be criminal.</description>

  <description>Fed up with her wild behavior, sixteen-year-old Lex's parents ship her off to upstate New York to live with her Uncle Mort for the summer, hoping that a few months of dirty farm work will whip her back into shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But Uncle Mort's true occupation is much dirtier than shoveling manure. He's a Grim Reaper. And he's going to teach Lex the family business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She quickly assimilates into the peculiar world of Croak, a town populated by reapers who deliver souls from this life to the next. But Lex can't stop her desire for justice - or is it vengeance? - whenever she encounters a murder victim, craving to stop the attackers before they can strike again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she ditch Croak and go rogue with her reaper skills?</description>

  <description>Ever since the car accident that killed his twin brother, Marshall Windsor has been consumed with guilt and crippled by secrets of that fateful night. He has only one chance to make amends, to right his wrongs and set things right. He must find a Thin Space—a mythical point where the barrier between this world and the next is thin enough for a person to step through to the other side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, when a new girl moves into the house next door, the same house Marsh is sure holds a thin space, she may be the key—or the unraveling of all his secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they get closer to finding a thin space—and closer to each other—Marsh must decide once and for all how far he’s willing to go to right the wrongs of the living…and the dead.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The first book in a new series by Cate Tiernan, written in her signature tone of dark, mesmerising, and intriguing...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is your birthright?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since she discovered the truth when she turned 13, Vivi Neves has rejected everything her parents hold dear - their heritage, culture, traditions, and especially their dark family secret. They are haguari - cat people, shapeshifters who turn into jaguars, as their ancestors have done for thousands of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, tragically, her parents are killed. Vivi can cling to her own beliefs and live her life the way she wants - or she can embrace her heritage and avenge her parents' deaths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With danger closing in on her, her decision is forced... and she's pulled deeper into a mystery that gets darker and more dangerous. Finally, she must face her heritage... or die.</description>

  <description>I am weak.&lt;br&gt;I am lonely.&lt;br&gt;I am a slut.&lt;br&gt;I am strong.&lt;br&gt;I am Dominant.&lt;br&gt;I am independent.&lt;br&gt;I am Seven James.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My entire life, no one has wanted me, and that was fine, because I sure as shit didn't need anyone else. Blah, Blah Blah, insert sad story here about negligent parents, and shitty siblings, and you have my life story in a nut shell. When my college boyfriend dumped me, it was just icing on the cake. Five years, and a booming career later I am here to collect my revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was until a delicious plaything walked into the kink club I frequent, and rocked my typically un-rockable world. Causing me to break the one rule I have lived by since Daniel Alexander walked out of my life, never have sex with the same person twice. Ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Warning!!!! Hers contains sexually explicit situations that may be uncomfortable for some. These include FF, FMF, and MFM interactions.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A compelling debut novel asks what happens when children develop inexplicable abilities—and the government sees them as a threat. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re known as Firestarters. Boomers. Skychangers. The government calls them Illegals — children with inexplicable abilities — and detains them in menacing facilities so that society is kept out of harm’s way. Ashala Wolf and her Tribe of fellow Illegals have taken refuge in the Firstwood, a forest eerily conscious of its inhabitants, where they do their best to survive and where they are free to practice their abilities. But when Ashala is compelled to venture outside her territory, she is betrayed by a friend and captured by an enemy. Injured and vulnerable, with her own Sleepwalker ability blocked, Ashala is forced to succumb to a machine that will pull secrets from her mind. It’s only a matter of time before the machine ferrets out the location of the Tribe. Her betrayer, Justin Connor, is ever-present, saving her life when she wishes to die and watching her every move. Will the Tribe survive the interrogation of Ashala Wolf?</description>

  <description>It began as a sudden strange fancy...Polly Perks had to become a boy in a hurry. Cutting off her hair and wearing trousers was easy. Learning to fart and belch in public and walk like an ape took more time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now she's enlisted in the army, and is searching for her lost brother. But there's a war on and whatever anyone says, their side's coming off worse. Polly and her fellow recruits are suddenly in the thick of it, without any training, and the enemy is hunting them." All they have on their side is the most artful sergeant in the army, a vampire with a lust for coffee and a readiness to fight dirty. And as they take the war to the heart of the enemy, they have to use all the resources of...the Monstrous Regiment.</description>

  <description>Twenty years ago, the robots designed to fight our wars abandoned the battlefields. Then they turned their weapons on us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a few escaped the robot revolution of 2071. Kevin, Nick, and Cass are lucky —they live with their parents in a secret human community in the woods. Then their village is detected and wiped out. Hopeful that other survivors have been captured by bots, the teens risk everything to save the only people they have left in the world—by infiltrating a city controlled by their greatest enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revolution 19 is a cinematic thriller unlike anything else. With a dynamic cast of characters, this surefire blockbuster has everything teen readers want—action, drama, mystery, and romance. Written by debut novelist Gregg Rosenblum, this gripping story shouldn’t be missed.</description>

  <description>Scarlet’s true identity has been revealed, but her future is uncertain. Her forced marriage to Lord Gisbourne threatens Robin and Scarlet’s love, and as the royal court descends upon Nottingham for the appointment of a new Sheriff, the people of Nottingham hope that Prince John will appoint their beloved Robin Hood. But Prince John has different plans for Nottingham that revolve around a fateful secret from Scarlet’s past even she isn’t yet aware of. Forced to participate at court alongside her ruthless husband, Scarlet must bide her time and act the part of a noblewoman—a worthy sacrifice if it means helping Robin’s cause and a chance at a future with the man she loves. With a fresh line of intrigue and as much passion as ever, the next chapter in Scarlet’s tale will have readers talking once again.</description>

  <description>Move over, Sookie Stackhouse—the witches of Savannah are the new talk of the South. Bold, flirty, and with a touch of darkness, debut author J.D. Horn spins a mesmerizing tale of a family of witches . . . and the problem that can arise from being so powerful. As Charlaine Harris’ series winds down—and as Deborah Harkness’ series heats up—Witching Savannah is new contemporary fantasy that will be sure to enchant new readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mercy Taylor, the youngest member of Savannah’s preeminent witching family, was born without the gift of magic.  She is accustomed to coming in a distant second to the minutes older, exquisite and gifted twin she adores.  Hopelessly in love with her sister’s boyfriend, she goes to a Hoodoo root doctor for a love spell.  A spell that will turn her heart to another man, the best friend who has loved her since childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aunt Ginny, the family’s matriarch, would not approve. But Mercy has more to worry about than a love triangle when Aunt Ginny is brutally murdered. Ginny was the Taylor family’s high commander in the defense of the bewitched line that separates humankind from the demons who once ruled our realm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A demon invasion looms now that the line is compromised. Worse yet, some within the witching world stand to gain from a demon takeover. Mercy, entangled in the dark magic of her love spell, fighting for her sister’s trust, and hopelessly without magic, must tap the strength born from being an outcast  to protect the line she doesn’t feel a part of...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this riveting contemporary fantasy, Horn delivers the full betrayal, blood, and familial discord of the best of Southern gothic.</description>

  <description>Available in both paperback and e-versions, Baby Gone Bye tells the story of high school senior Gabe Delgado who is trying to trade his bad boy days for clean living. He remembers nothing about the night a mysterious girl loved and left him at a party except ...&lt;br&gt;there was kind of magic around her. Now, he finds that "magic" in a basket on his doorstep, cooing at him like a happy little bird. Now, Gabe must not only finish school and try for a basketball scholarship but also keep his daughter safe. Her unique abilities make her highly sought after by the Scientific Academy of Merit, a shadowy organization whose goal is to clone the perfect human specimen. Fortunately, Gabe has the help of next door neighbor, Abby, who has some unique abilities of her own.</description>

  <description>Anna and Abel couldn’t be more different. They are both seventeen and in their last year of school, but while Anna lives in a nice old town house and comes from a well-to-do family, Abel, the school drug dealer, lives in a big, prisonlike tower block at the edge of town. Anna is afraid of him until she realizes that he is caring for his six-year-old sister on his own. Fascinated, Anna follows the two and listens as Abel tells little Micha the story of a tiny queen assailed by dark forces. It’s a beautiful fairy tale that Anna comes to see has a basis in reality. Abel is in real danger of losing Micha to their abusive father and to his own inability to make ends meet. Anna gradually falls in love with Abel, but when his “enemies” begin to turn up dead, she fears she has fallen for a murderer. Has she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning author Antonia Michaelis moves in a bold new direction with her latest novel: a dark, haunting, contemporary story that is part mystery, part romance, and part melodrama.</description>

  <description>It's been nine months since the virus hit, killing almost everyone it touched. Seventeen-year-old Cora and her little brother, Coby, haven't left home since. Not after the power cut out; not even after sirens faded in the distance and the world outside their backyard fence fell silent. But when a blistering drought forces Cora to go in search of water, she discovers that the post-apocalyptic world isn't as deserted as she thought when she meets Brooks, a drop-dead sexy army deserter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fighting their way back home, Cora finds her house ransacked and Coby missing - kidnapped by the military for dangerous medical experiments in the name of finding a cure. Brooks knows exactly where Cora can find her brother, except he says it's a suicide mission. Cora doesn't care. But Brooks can't let her go...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;First there are nightmares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every night Ellie is haunted by terrifying dreams of monstrous creatures that are hunting her, killing her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then come the memories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ellie meets Will, she feels on the verge of remembering something just beyond her grasp.  His attention is intense and romantic, and Ellie feels like her soul has known him for centuries.  On her seventeenth birthday, on a dark street at midnight, Will awakens Ellie's power, and she knows that she can fight the creatures that stalk her in the grim darkness.  Only Will holds the key to Ellie's memories, whole lifetimes of them, and when she looks at him, she can no longer pretend anything was just a dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now she must hunt.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellie has power that no one can match, and her role is to hunt and kill the reapers that prey on human souls.  But in order to survive the dangerous and ancient battle of the angels and the Fallen, she must also hunt for the secrets of her past lives and truths that may be too frightening to remember.</description>

  <description>Vampires? No Such Thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aliens, though, that's something else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They've been here, living quietly among us, since before the Industrial Revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their goal: To ensure we never leave our Solar System. We have a bad habit of wiping out indigenous populations, and theirs is the nearest inhabited planet to ours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when a scientist at Sydney University harnesses the power of wormholes, making interstellar travel a virtual walk in the park, one of these tall, pale-skinned aliens, Callum, is forced to choose: destroy us, or help us survive the inevitable Armageddon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8 billion Earthlings, and our survival is in the hands of one guy - alien - meant to wipe us out.</description>

  <description>Jason seems destined to screw things up. After capping off a burglary and a bar fight with a car wreck, he quickly finds himself on the wrong side of the law. And since his father's the governor, that means his punishment is about as public as it gets. Jason's thrown into the first Scared Straight program Florida has ever run in their updated, state-of-the-art Blackenbush Penitentiary. Along with a documentary crew led by Sasha, a young woman in way over her head, and a handful of other kids a year and a strike away from jail, Jason comes face to face with his inevitable future on the other side of a heavily guarded prison wall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that's just the beginning. The tour has barely begun when one of the inmates makes a move. Before long the entire penitentiary is under siege, surrounded by the feds and overrun with prisoners let loose from their cells. Jason slips away with Sasha in the chaos, but they won't be able to escape without help. And the only thing worse than being stuck in prison, is being stuck in a prison run by the inmates.</description>

  <description>LONDON, 1873 - In the foggy city, polluted by coal smoke from the factories along the river, 15-year-old Wren is clinging to a small thread of hope: the shimmering silver dream of a better life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wren and her brothers, Henry and Max, are orphans. They wish to be adopted, but no one wants to take in all three of them. Wren won’t be separated from her family, but no matter how hard she fights to keep them together, she fears she will lose them nonetheless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wants more for both of them - for herself. She wants an escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prompted by a world she sees in a dream, Wren begins to tell her brothers stories of a place where they can be carefree forever - a place called Nevermor. It is an island at the edge of the universe, where all dreams go. There is a boy who guards it, and he is known only as the Rifter. Wren believes that this place truly exists and desires her own life there, where she can keep her family together without anyone tearing them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wren gets more than she bargained for when she is kidnapped by the arrogant and volatile Rifter and taken to Nevermor against her will. It is not completely unwelcome, however. The land is beautiful and there is freedom. The Rifter and his pack of wild boys accept her, and she feels that her brothers will be happy in this place too.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wren falls in love with Nevermor - and with the Rifter - and yet the more she learns of the conflict between the Rifter and a wicked man called the Scourge, the more she comes to realize that Nevermor is not a place for children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nevermor is a dark fantasy based on the legend of Peter Pan.</description>

  <description>WHEN introverted doctor Ben Hardy's high maintenance girlfriend wants to introduce a little more kink into their love life, he doesn't expect it to come in the form of the hunky EMT who just moved to Blackwood. Ben's not gay, but DAMN! He can definitely see why all the women turn to mush when the new guy's around. Baby blue eyes, flirtatious smile, body of an underwear model...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prospect of being naked in the same room with him is horrifying. So why the hell is Ben actually considering it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COREY Butler desperately needs to leave his shady past behind, and the microscopic town of Blackwood is just the place to do it. No drama, no danger, no sleeping under bridges... What he doesn't need is a huge crush on someone who's completely out of his league. When Dr. Hardy's gorgeous girlfriend propositions him for a threesome, he knows the smart thing would be to say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course it would. But then Corey's never been known for making smart decisions.</description>

  <description>***CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ANGELBOUND***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen-year-old Myla Lewis has transformed into the Great Scala, the only being with the power to move human souls to Heaven or Hell. Although she no longer fights demons in the Arena, Myla still has tons of ass-kicking to do as she redefines the afterlife and rebuilds Purgatory's government. Unfortunately, her world falls apart faster than she can put it together. An enemy out of Myla's past is sapping her powers, making her weaker by the day. Even worse, her angel bound-love Lincoln has mysteriously disappeared. As her true enemy becomes clear, Myla discovers that all the after-realms are at risk. After losing so much power, does she still have the strength to save her world?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kari plunges into the world of espionage on a mission to save her parents while trying to impress the guy she’s been in love with forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sixteen-year-old Kari’s dad sends her an unexpected text, she and her brother immediately go into hiding. Because when your parents are superspies and your dad declares a Code Black, it can only mean something bad. Very bad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kari soon discovers that her parents have been disavowed and declared traitors, and she’s determined to clear their names. Breaking into the Agency seems like a reasonable plan, especially with the help of a team that includes her longtime crush, Luke, as well as her two best friends—an expert hacker with attitude and a master martial artist—and Luke’s popular, vindictive twin sister. Oh, and a new guy, who’s as cute as he is complicated...</description>

  <description>In the decades following World War II, American scientists were celebrated for their contributions to social and technological progress. They were also widely criticized for their increasingly close ties to military and governmental power--not only by outside activists but from among the ranks of scientists themselves. "Disrupting Science" tells the story of how scientists formed new protest organizations that democratized science and made its pursuit more transparent. The book explores how scientists weakened their own authority even as they invented new forms of political action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing extensively from archival sources and in-depth interviews, Kelly Moore examines the features of American science that made it an attractive target for protesters in the early cold war and Vietnam eras, including scientists' work in military research and activities perceived as environmentally harmful. She describes the intellectual traditions that protesters drew from--liberalism, moral individualism, and the New Left--and traces the rise and influence of scientist-led protest organizations such as Science for the People and the Union of Concerned Scientists. Moore shows how scientist protest activities disrupted basic assumptions about science and the ways scientific knowledge should be produced, and recast scientists' relationships to political and military institutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Disrupting Science" reveals how the scientific community cumulatively worked to unbind its own scientific authority and change how science and scientists are perceived. In doing so, the book redefines our understanding of social movements and the power of insider-led protest.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;THE FORSYTE SAGA&lt;/em&gt;, a sweeping historical novel that spans three generations, telling the dark secrets of a family torn apart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Larkswood House. The very name suggests birdsong, peace and elegance. It is home to the Hamilton children - Edward, Cynthia and Harriet - who enjoy the freedom and excitement of privilege. But in the glorious summer of 1896, with absent parents and a departed governess, disaster strikes the family, leaving it cruelly divided.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than forty years later, on the eve of the Second World War, Louisa Hamilton, newly presented at court but struck down with glandular fever, is sent to Larkswood to recuperate. There, for the first time, she meets her grandfather, Edward, home after decades in India. Haunted by terrible memories, the arrival of his granddaughter begins to gladden his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Louisa begins to fall under the spell of Larkswood, she realises it holds the key to the mystery that shattered her family two generations before. Will she find the courage to unravel the dark secrets of the past? And can Larkswood ever become home to happiness again?</description>

  <description>Tempest Maguire wants nothing more than to surf the killer waves near her California home; continue her steady relationship with her boyfriend, Mark; and take care of her brothers and surfer dad. But Tempest is half mermaid, and as her seventeenth birthday approaches, she will have to decide whether to remain on land or give herself to the ocean like her mother. The pull of the water becomes as insistent as her attraction to Kai, a gorgeous surfer whose uncanny abilities hint at an otherworldly identity as well. And when Tempest does finally give in to the water's temptation and enters a fantastical underwater world, she finds that a larger destiny awaits her-and that the entire ocean's future hangs in the balance.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>"You must never do anything that might expose our secret. This means that, in general, you cannot form close bonds with humans. You can speak to us, and you can always commune with the Ocean, but you are deadly to humans. You are, essentially, a weapon. A very beautiful weapon. I won't lie to you, it can be a lonely existence, but once you are done, you get to live. All you have to give, for now, is obedience and time..." &lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same speech has been given hundreds of times to hundreds of beautiful girls who enter the sisterhood of sirens. Kahlen has lived by these rules for years now, patiently waiting for the life she can call her own. But when Akinli, a human, enters her world, she can't bring herself to live by the rules anymore. Suddenly the life she's been waiting for doesn't seem nearly as important as the one she's living now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Magic was seeping out of me, black and agonizing. I could see it drifting away. The magic that would let me pass the Road to reach home again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sixteen-year-old Anya learns that her aunt, Queen of the Faerie Kingdom of Chrior, will soon die, her grief is equalled only by her despair for the future of the kingdom. Her young cousin, Illumina, is unfit to rule, and Anya is determined not to take up the queen's mantle herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Convinced that the only solution is to find Prince Zabriel, who long ago disappeared into the human realm of Warckum, and persuade him to take up his rightful crown, Anya journeys into the Warckum Territory to bring him home. But her journey is doomed to be more harrowing than she ever could have imagined.</description>

  <description>A year ago Hurricane Josephine swept through Savannah, Georgia, leaving behind nothing but death and destruction — and taking the life of Dovey's best friend, Carly. Since that night, Dovey has been in a medicated haze, numb to everything around her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But recently she's started to believe she's seeing things that can't be real ... including Carly at their favorite cafe. Determined to learn the truth, Dovey stops taking her pills. And the world that opens up to her is unlike anything she could have imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Dovey slips deeper into the shadowy corners of Savannah — where the dark and horrifying secrets lurk — she learns that the storm that destroyed her city and stole her friend was much more than a force of nature. And now the sinister beings truly responsible are out to finish what they started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dovey's running out of time and torn between two paths. Will she trust her childhood friend Baker, who can't see the threatening darkness but promises to never give up on Dovey and Carly? Or will she plot with the sexy stranger, Isaac, who offers all the answers — for a price? Soon Dovey realizes that the danger closing in has little to do with Carly ... and everything to do with Dovey herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An edgy, realistic, and utterly captivating novel from an exciting new voice in teen fiction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexi Littrell hasn't told anyone what happened to her over the summer. Ashamed and embarrassed, she hides in her closet and compulsively scratches the back of her neck, trying to make the outside hurt more than the inside does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bodee Lennox, the quiet and awkward boy next door, comes to live with the Littrells, Alexi discovers an unlikely friend in "the Kool-Aid Kid," who has secrets of his own. As they lean on each other for support, Alexi gives him the strength to deal with his past, and Bodee helps her find the courage to finally face the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A searing, poignant book, Faking Normal is the extraordinary debut novel from an exciting new author-Courtney C. Stevens.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Lisa McMann's Wake trilogy meets the blockbuster Inception in this dark page-turner from #1 New York Times bestselling author Aprilynne Pike.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oracles see the future but are never supposed to interfere. Charlotte learned that the hard way. If she hadn't tried to change one of her childhood visions, her father would still be alive. Since the accident, Charlotte has suppressed her visions to avoid making the same mistake. But when she receives a premonition of a classmate's murder, she can no longer ignore her powerful gift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Charlotte meets someone who not only knows her secret but who also has a way for her to stop the killer. He offers to teach her how to manipulate her visions to change the future. But doing so will put Charlotte in the path of the murderer.…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aprilynne Pike's bestselling Wings series was called "remarkable" by Stephenie Meyer, bestselling author of the Twilight Saga. And her most recent novel, Life After Theft, was cheered as a "whirlwind adventure" by School Library Journal. Now Aprilynne returns with this exhilarating departure from her previous novels. Sleep No More is a psychological thrill ride that is sure to keep readers' hearts racing until the very end.</description>

  <description>There are no men in Claysoot. There are boys—but every one of them vanishes at midnight on his eighteenth birthday. The ground shakes, the wind howls, a blinding light descends…and he’s gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They call it the Heist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gray Weathersby’s eighteenth birthday is mere months away, and he’s prepared to meet his fate–until he finds a strange note from his mother and starts to question everything he’s been raised to accept: the Council leaders and their obvious secrets. The Heist itself. And what lies beyond the Wall that surrounds Claysoot–a structure that no one can cross and survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Climbing the Wall is suicide, but what comes after the Heist could be worse. Should he sit back and wait to be taken–or risk everything on the hope of the other side?</description>

  <description>Life for Kansas was perfect until the day the world changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has been hiding out for four years in solitude. It's the only way to survive. The only way not to draw the living dead. Helping a small group of people, she learns the new world might not be what she assumes. Venturing out of her refuge and comfort zone, she meets Rudy, who helps her find a greater purpose. She realizes that the world has moved on without her. Only it's not what she expects. Her knowledge of the living dead grows and only makes her more curious as humanity continues to hang on by a thread. While on her search for answers she finds comfort in new friendships and love, but her past seems as if it will haunt her forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kansas takes it upon herself to help other survivors, which would be easy if the famished were the only obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a trilogy plot thick with twists and turns, this adult dark fantasy is emotional as much as it is horrifyingly gripping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Not intended for a young audience. Mature content.*</description>

  <description>Sebastian Malheur is the most dangerous sort of rake: an educated one. When he’s not scandalizing ladies in the bedchamber, he’s outraging proper society with his scientific theories. He’s desired, reviled, acclaimed, and despised—and he laughs through it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet Waterfield, the widowed Countess of Cambury, on the other hand, is entirely respectable, and she’d like to stay that way. But Violet has a secret that is beyond ruinous, one that ties her irrevocably to England’s most infamous scoundrel: Sebastian’s theories aren’t &lt;em&gt;his.&lt;/em&gt; They’re&lt;em&gt; hers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Sebastian threatens to dissolve their years-long conspiracy, she’ll do anything to save their partnership...even if it means opening her vulnerable heart to the rake who could destroy it for good.</description>

  <description>Inhale. Exhale. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world is dead. &lt;br&gt;The survivors live under the protection of Breathe, the corporation that found a way to manufacture oxygen-rich air. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALINA&lt;br&gt;has been stealing for a long time. She’s a little jittery, but not terrified. All she knows is that she’s never been caught before. If she’s careful, it’ll be easy. If she’s careful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;QUINN&lt;br&gt;should be worried about Alina and a bit afraid for himself, too, but even though this is dangerous, it’s also the most interesting thing to happen to him in ages. It isn’t every day that the girl of your dreams asks you to rescue her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEA&lt;br&gt;wants to tell him that none of this is fair; they’d planned a trip together, the two of them, and she’d hoped he’d discover her out here, not another girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as they walk into the Outlands with two days’ worth of oxygen in their tanks, everything they believe will be shattered. Will they be able to make it back? Will they want to?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The second installment in our epic Starbound trilogy introduces a new pair of star-crossed lovers on two sides of a bloody war.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jubilee Chase and Flynn Cormac should never have met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lee is captain of the forces sent to Avon to crush the terraformed planet's rebellious colonists, but she has her own reasons for hating the insurgents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rebellion is in Flynn's blood. Terraforming corporations make their fortune by recruiting colonists to make the inhospitable planets livable, with the promise of a better life for their children. But they never fulfilled their promise on Avon, and decades later, Flynn is leading the rebellion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate for any advantage in a bloody and unrelentingly war, Flynn does the only thing that makes sense when he and Lee cross paths: he returns to base with her as prisoner. But as his fellow rebels prepare to execute this tough-talking girl with nerves of steel, Flynn makes another choice that will change him forever. He and Lee escape the rebel base together, caught between two sides of a senseless war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stunning second novel in the Starbound trilogy is an unforgettable story of love and forgiveness in a world torn apart by war.</description>

  <description>Small towns are nothing if not friendly. Friendship, Wisconsin (population: &lt;s&gt;689&lt;/s&gt; 688) is no different. Around here, everyone wears a smile. And no one ever locks their doors. Until, that is, high school sweetheart Ruth Fried is found murdered. Strung up like a scarecrow in the middle of a cornfield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Friendship’s police are more adept at looking for lost pets than catching killers. So Ruth’s best friend, Kippy Bushman, armed with only her tenacious Midwestern spirit and Ruth’s secret diary (which Ruth’s mother had asked her to read in order to redact any, you know, sex parts), sets out to find the murderer. But in a quiet town like Friendship—where no one is a suspect—anyone could be the killer.</description>

  <description>“My parents suck ass. Banning me from the phone and restricting my computer privileges are the most tyrannical parental gestures I can think of.

I don’t see how things could get any worse.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her best friend, Hope Weaver, moves away from Pineville, New Jersey, hyperobservant sixteen-year-old Jessica Darling is devastated. A fish out of water at school and a stranger at home, Jessica feels more lost than ever now that the only person with whom she could really communicate has gone. How is she supposed to deal with the boy- and shopping-crazy girls at school, her dad’s obsession with her track meets, her mother salivating over big sister Bethany’s lavish wedding, and her nonexistent love life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fresh, funny, utterly compelling fiction debut by first-time novelist Megan McCafferty, &lt;strong&gt;Sloppy Firsts&lt;/strong&gt; is an insightful, true-to-life look at Jessica’s predicament as she embarks on another year of teenage torment--from the dark days of Hope’s departure through her months as a type-A personality turned insomniac to her completely mixed-up feelings about Marcus Flutie, the intelligent and mysterious “Dreg” who works his way into her heart. Like a John Hughes for the twenty-first century, Megan McCafferty taps into the inherent humor and drama of the teen experience. This poignant, hilarious novel is sure to appeal to readers who are still going through it, as well as those who are grateful that they don’t have to go back and grow up all over again.</description>

  <description>James is skilled, efficient, and deadly, a hired blade navigating the shifting alliances of a deteriorating Assassin’s Guild.  Then he meets Thalia, an alluring but troubled dancing girl who offers him a way out—if he’ll help her kill a powerful nobleman.  With the Guild falling apart, it just might be worth the risk. But when you live, breathe, and love in a world that’s forever flirting with death, the slightest misstep can be poison. Poison dance is approximately 14,000 words, or 54 printed pages.</description>

  <description>Natividad is Pure, one of the rare girls born able to wield magic. Pure magic can protect humans against the supernatural evils they only half-acknowledge – the blood kin or the black dogs. In rare cases – like for Natividad’s father and older brother – Pure magic can help black dogs find the strength to control their dark powers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before Natividad’s mother can finish teaching her magic their enemies find them. Their entire village in the remote hills of Mexico is slaughtered by black dogs. Their parents die protecting them. Natividad and her brothers must flee across a strange country to the only possible shelter: the infamous black dogs of Dimilioc, who have sworn to protect the Pure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the snowy forests of Vermont they are discovered by Ezekiel Korte, despite his youth the strongest black dog at Dimilioc and the appointed pack executioner. Intrigued by Natividad he takes them to Dimilioc instead of killing them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now they must pass the tests of the Dimilioc Master. Alejandro must prove he can learn loyalty and control even without his sister’s Pure magic. Natividad’s twin Miguel must prove that an ordinary human can be more than a burden to be protected. And even at Dimilioc a Pure girl like Natividad cannot remain unclaimed to cause fighting and distraction. If she is to stay she must choose a black dog mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, first, they must all survive the looming battle.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Meet Arcadia Bell: bartender, renegade magician, fugitive from the law. . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being the spawn of two infamous occultists (and alleged murderers) isn’t easy, but freewheeling magician Arcadia “Cady” Bell knows how to make the best of a crummy situation. After hiding out for seven years, she’s carved an incognito niche for herself slinging drinks at the demon-friendly Tambuku Tiki Lounge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she receives an ultimatum when unexpected surveillance footage of her notorious parents surfaces: either prove their innocence or surrender herself. Unfortunately, the only witness to the crimes was an elusive Æthyric demon, and Cady has no idea how to find it. She teams up with Lon Butler, an enigmatic demonologist with a special talent for sexual spells and an arcane library of priceless stolen grimoires. Their research soon escalates into a storm of conflict involving missing police evidence, the decadent Hellfire Club, a ruthless bounty hunter, and a powerful occult society that operates way outside the law. If Cady can’t clear her family name soon, she’ll be forced to sacrifice her own life . . . and no amount of running will save her this time.</description>

  <description>Ethan Godrick, bookstore employee and struggling grad student, always thought the stories he'd been told as a boy were just myths - he'd always believed none of it was real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when he comes across a musty, old book written about the legend that's mystified humankind for centuries, he finds himself catapulted into the very universe he'd dismissed as mere fantasy: Medieval Camelot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With King Arthur ascending the throne, his half-sister Morgana le Fay has dispatched assassins to end the King's life. Dissension has been born in Camelot, and dark magic is tearing the medieval city apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what role does Ethan play in all of this? Why did the book bring him to Camelot? How can an adventurous, technology-dependant nobody be of any use in a place where magic thrives off the weak, eradicates the strong, and makes even the least of us...into kings?</description>

  <description>"I was sixteen the second time I had my first kiss...."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of AMBER HOUSE, Sarah made a choice that transformed everything--and now she must choose it all again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things are very different--better--for Sarah and her family:  her Aunt Maggie grew up; her parents are happily married; her grandmother died after a long, productive and respected life.  But other things are different too, and not for the better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After growing up in the free country of the Pacific Northwest, Sarah Parsons has settled in at Amber House, the stately Maryland home that's been in her family for generations. But the world surrounding the House feels deeply wrong to Sarah. It's a place where the colonists lost the 1776 Insurrection, where the American Confederation of States still struggles with segregation, and where Sarah is haunted by echoes of a better world that she knows never existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her friend Jackson shares these visions of a different world--and together, they manage both to remember the way things ought to be, and to plan a daring mission that will reset the universe once again. Sarah must figure out what has changed, and why, and how she can fix it--how she can find her way to another otherwhen.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;First rule in this line of business: don’t sleep with the client.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name’s Kate Kane, and when an eight-hundred-year-old vampire prince came to me with a case, I should have told her no. But I’ve always been a sucker for a femme fatale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It always goes the same way. You move too fast, you get in too deep, and before you know it, someone winds up dead. Last time it was my partner. This time it could be me. Yesterday a werewolf was murdered outside the Velvet, the night-time playground of one of the most powerful vampires in England. Now half the monsters in London are at each other’s throats, and the other half are trying to get in my pants. The Witch Queen will protect her own, the wolves are out for vengeance, and the vampires are out for, y’know, blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve got a killer on the loose, a war on the horizon, and a scotch on the rocks. It’s going to be an interesting day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This title is #1 of the Kate Kane, Paranormal Investigator series.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Dani travels west to the BBR ranch to help her grieving sister Victoria get over the death of John, Victoria's ranch owner husband. At the BBR ranch Dani is distracted by two men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of them, although he obviously cares for Dani, he seems guarded and does not show any initiative in having a romantic relationship with her. She is very attracted to him; he is extremely good looking but that is not the only reason she feels drawn to him. Her connection to this man affects her emotionally and she tries to understand how he thinks about life and love. He is a third generation cowboy who operates in simple terms with no emotional baggage additions or deletions but with an embracement of the clear truths that are actually present and confirmed and he is totally against using GMO's at the ranch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other man whom Dani is somewhat attracted to and has fun with, is interested in a relationship with her and makes a point to tell her. This man is not as handsome as the other man, but he is good looking in his own right and knows that women need romance, gentle talking and laughing in order for their hearts to be melted. He is a southern boy who charms Dani every chance he gets and says what she needs to hear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through friendships with both men Dani discovers many things about each of them as well as about herself. She comes to the conclusion that our willingness to wait reveals the value we place on the object we are waiting for, and unless she can have the man she longs for physically, intellectually, emotionally and spiritually she does not want anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the end will she discover that the man she is attracted to has walls too tall to scale? If he is truly worth the wait, can she endure the waiting? Will she end up alone and lonely for a man that she cannot have? A man she dreams about, has fantasies about and writes poems about? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or will she settle for the man she understands, a man who understands her; a good person who treats her well but that she is only marginally attracted to knowing that love and desire will grow in time?</description>

  <description>In a glittering underwater world, nothing is as it seems...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the past twelve months since her parents’ death, seventeen-year-old Miranda Sun has harboured a dark secret — a secret that has strained the close relationship she once shared with her older sister, Lauren. In an effort to repair this broken bond, Miranda’s grandparents whisk the siblings away on a secluded beach holiday. Except before Miranda gets a chance to confess her life-changing secret, she’s dragged underwater by a mysterious stranger while taking a midnight swim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Awakening days later, Miranda discovers that she’s being held captive in a glittering underwater city by an arrogant young man named Marko...the King of this underwater civilisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen-year-old Marko intends to marry Miranda in order to keep his crown from falling into the sinister clutches of his half-brother, Damir. There’s only one problem. Miranda is desperate to return home to right things with her sister and she wants nothing to do with Marko. Trying to secure her freedom, Miranda quickly forms an alliance with Robbie — Marko’s personal guard. However, she soon discovers that even underwater, people are hiding dangerous secrets...</description>

  <description>Sunspots is personal. A personal journey of grieving, a personal journey of self-discovery, and a personal journey geographically. A young woman from Brooklyn, Aurora, a man from Austin, Texas, Jake, meet accidentally in NYC and it changes the trajectory of their lives. Aurora decides to grab on to what she perceives may be her only chance at the comfy married existence that has so far eluded her. But it is no hardship to leave NYC and her stalled acting career for this apparently wealthy, dynamic, handsome lover who whisks her off her feet. But after the honeymoon, reality sets in and she realizes that marriage can be isolating, and that the socio-economic differences between her and Jake can become a wedge. How can Aurora adjust to these changes? How can she regain the independent personality she had before Jake became her only focus in life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward two years, and Aurora finds herself a widow. An accident. Unexpected. And then her journey becomes one of accepting the harsh reality of encounters with Jake's ghost, the real nature of her time travel experiences, and Jake's true character. Viola Parker is her guide through these episodes not of this world. Viola, a ghost who has a connection with Aurora's past, leads her to find, Cliff, her true soulmate, her true love in this life erasing the pain of her mistakes with Jake Stein through the centuries. Sometimes from the ashes, sometimes from blackness awaits the brilliant light of a life of happiness.</description>

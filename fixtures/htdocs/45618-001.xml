  <description>A burnt and half-eaten megalodon shark corpse is found beached. A priest commits suicide. A previously unknown volcano rises from the China Sea and brings about a tsunami that destroys Shanghai. Yellowstone erupts after 640,000 years of silence. A pit in Nicaragua known as the "mouth of hell" begins violently spewing lava.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Reporter Mick Cathcart and Marine Biologist Agnes Brach set out looking for answers, they never expected to stumble upon the biblical end times. Yet with sharks made of lava shooting from volcanoes to devour anyone in their way, how could anyone deny it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of a beleaguered priest and a billionaire industrialist, Mick and Agnes scramble to shutter the volcanoes and put down the lava sharks before the whole world burns to a cinder.</description>

  <description>An illustrated pocket field guide that enables anyone to quickly identify psychotic, violent or mentally unstable bird species. We are only just discovering the reality of our avian adversaries, with their reptilian brains, their appetites for mayhem and the fact that they fly mostly to spite us.  To ignore the information found within this volume may be at the peril of your very life.</description>

  <description>Inside the Dome, Patridge has taken his father's place as leader of the Pures. His struggle has led him here, intent upon bringing down the Dome from the inside, with the help of a secret resistance force. But things are not as simple from his new position of power and he finds himself tempted by his father's words: perhaps if the world is to survive it needs the Dome - and Partridge - to rule it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Partridge's resolve weakens, Pressia and Bradwell continue piecing together the clues left to them from the time before the Detonations. It is their hope that they will be able to heal the Wretches, and free them from their monstrous fusings and the Dome's oppression once and for all. But everything depends, too, on Partridge. Separated by distance and history, can they still trust their friend and ally? Or is the world doomed to an eternity of war and hardship?</description>

  <description>The Yellowstone supervolcano nearly wiped out the human race. Now, almost a year after the eruption, the survivors seem determined to finish the job. Communities wage war on each other, gangs of cannibals roam the countryside, and what little government survived the eruption has collapsed completely. The ham radio has gone silent. Sickness, cold, and starvation are the survivors' constant companions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it becomes apparent that their home is no longer safe and adults are not facing the stark realities, Alex and Darla must create a community that can survive the ongoing disaster, an almost impossible task requiring even more guts and more smarts than ever â and unthinkable sacrifice. If they fail . . . they, their loved ones, and the few remaining survivors will perish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This epic finale has the heart of &lt;em&gt;Ashfall&lt;/em&gt;, the action of &lt;em&gt;Ashen Winter&lt;/em&gt;, and a depth all its own, examining questions of responsibility and bravery, civilization and society, illuminated by the story of an unshakable love that transcends a post-apocalyptic world and even life itself.</description>

  <description>A winsome collection of 50 full-color, all-breed canine portraits, each posed with a favorite play toy and accompanied by an affectionate anecdote. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dirty Wow Wow was ranked #3 on Entertainment Weekly's "Ten Things We Love" List &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The creators of the popular book DIRTY WOW WOW present this brand new album, featuring beloved family pets and the raggedy objects of their affection. Big dogs, small dogs, mixed breeds, purebreds, puppies, and seniors tug, chase, chew, guard, nuzzle, sleep on, and play with their shredded teddies, blankies, and chewies. Each dog portrayed has formed a bond with a self-selected favorite, and many of them remain loyal to just one toy. Among the toys that have survived the perils of puppyhood, many continue to give comfort and joy to their aging pooches. Every lovingly photographed image of our best friends with their best friends will resonate with dog lovers and the readers who love them.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The seductive and chilling debut novel from the critically acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;The King of Limbo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In isolated British Columbia, girls, mostly native, are vanishing from the sides of a notorious highway. Leo Kreutzer and his four friends are barely touched by these disappearancesâuntil a series of mysterious and troublesome outsiders come to town. Then it seems as if the devil himself has appeared among them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this intoxicatingly lush debut novel, Adrianne Harun weaves together folklore, mythology, and elements of magical realism to create a compelling and unsettling portrait of life in a dead-end town. &lt;em&gt;A Man Came Out of a Door in the Mountain&lt;/em&gt; is atmospheric and evocative of place and a group of people, much in the way that Jesmyn Wardâs &lt;em&gt;Salvage the Bones&lt;/em&gt; conjures the South, or Charles Bockâs &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Children &lt;/em&gt;provides a glimpse of the Las Vegas underworld: kids left to fend for themselves in a broken worldârendered with grit and poetry in equal measure.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Written with the riveting storytelling and moral seriousness of authors like Emma Donoghue, Adam Johnson, Ann Patchett, and Curtis Sittenfeld, &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel &lt;/em&gt;is a suspenseful and haunting novel of an American foreign exchange student arrested for murder, and a father trying to hold his family together.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Lily Hayes arrives in Buenos Aires for her semester abroad, she is enchanted by everything she encounters: the colorful buildings, the street food, the handsome, elusive man next door. Her studious roommate Katy is a bit of a bore, but Lily didnât come to Argentina to hang out with other Americans.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; Five weeks later, Katy is found brutally murdered in their shared home, and Lily is the prime suspect. But who is Lily Hayes? It depends on whoâs asking. As the case takes shapeârevealing deceptions, secrets, and suspicious DNAâLily appears alternately sinister and guileless through the eyes of those around her: the media, her family, the man who loves her and the man who seeks her conviction. With mordant wit and keen emotional insight, &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel&lt;/em&gt; offers a prismatic investigation of the ways we decide what to seeâand to believeâin one another and ourselves.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; Jennifer duBoisâs debut novel, &lt;em&gt;A Partial History of Lost Causes,&lt;/em&gt; was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut Fiction and was honored by the National Book Foundationâs 5 Under 35 program. In &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel,&lt;/em&gt; duBois delivers a novel of propulsive psychological suspense and rare moral nuance. Who is Lily Hayes? What happened to her roommate? No two readers will agree. &lt;em&gt;Cartwheel&lt;/em&gt; will keep you guessing until the final page, and its questions about how much we really know about ourselves will linger well beyond.</description>

  <description>In the belief of the Gond tribe, the lives of humans and trees are closely entwined. Trees contain the cosmos; when night falls, the spirits they nurture glimmer into life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A visual ode to trees rendered by tribal artists from India, this handcrafted edition showcases three of the finest living Gond masters. This collection of their distinctive styles is enchantingâan excellent gift for those fascinated by trees, art or folk traditions.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Inspired by the gothic classic &lt;em&gt;Wuthering Heights&lt;/em&gt;, this stunning new fantasy from the author of the Books of Pellinor is a fiercely romantic tale of betrayal and vengeance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a savage land sustained by wizardry and ruled by vendetta, Lina is the enchanting but willful daughter of a village lord. She and her childhood companion, Damek, have grown up privileged and spoiled, and theyâre devoted to each other to the point of obsession. But Linaâs violet eyes betray her for a witch, and witches are not tolerated in a brutally patriarchal society. Her rank protects her from persecution, but it cannot protect her from tragedy and heartbreak. An innocent visitor stands witness to the devastation that ensues as destructive longing unleashes Linaâs wrath, and with it her forbidden power. Whether drawn by the romantic, the magical, or the gothic, readers will be irresistibly compelled by the passion of this tragic tale.</description>

  <description>You know the story. . . Mary and Joseph make the journey to Bethlehem, only to find there's no room at the inn. Then along come angels, shepherds, and three kings from afar to worship the baby Jesus in the manger. &lt;em&gt;A Guinea Pig Nativity &lt;/em&gt;is the classic Christmas story as you've never seen it before: with (you guessed it) guinea pigs photographed in the starring roles. Sweet, humble, and funny, they bring their own guinea-pig-joyfulness to the nativity in a way that is completely irresistible.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Heâs exquisitely hot. Exquisitely tousled. Exquisitely screwed in the head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cammibelle Hicks just wants to survive her first year of college. Desperate to forget her troubled past, she throws herself into her degree and book review blog. So what if her life is one long tumblr page of grumpy cat GIFs? She doesnât need to get out more, and she definitely doesnât need a man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter von Styles approaches life like heâs spoiling for a fight: with a tempting scowl. A cage-fighting, ex-rocker billionaire, itâs unclear why Hunterâs at college. Frankly, it makes no sense. Then Cammie falls into himâliterallyâat a party, and heâs obsessed. He needs her more than a moist towelette at a barbecue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Cammieâs friends warn her against Hunter, she canât resist his charms; especially not when he buys her shoes. And GoodReads. And a unicorn. But when her handsome best friend, medieval reenactor Archer Riddick, makes a play for her heartâand challenges Hunter to a jousting matchâit turns out that Hunter has demons of his own. Demons that arenât real ones, but metaphorical onesâwhich are MUCH WORSE, when you think about itâ¦&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Hunter and Cammie on an emotionally exhausting journey into love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And co-dependence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And probably therapy.</description>

  <description>Two friends, both of them vocational snoots, sat down to film an interview in February 2006. Their subjects: language and writing. The interviewee drove more than an hour, from Claremont to downtown Los Angeles. The interviewer flew from Dallas. They spoke on film for 67 minutes and then walked uphill to a nearby seafood restaurant, where they continued the running conversation they had started five years earlier. They liked each other, and they seemed to understand each other. The rest is history. This is the last long interview with David Foster Wallace.</description>

  <description>This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative--like maybe someone who isnât me wrote it--but I soon discovered that Iâm not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pictures&lt;br&gt;Words&lt;br&gt;Stories about things that happened to me&lt;br&gt;Stories about things that happened to other people because of me&lt;br&gt;Eight billion dollars*&lt;br&gt;Stories about dogs&lt;br&gt;The secret to eternal happiness*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!</description>

  <description>Quiet, brilliant Portia has just moved to a new neighborhood with her mom. Adjusting to life without a father is hard enough, but school is boring and her classmates are standoffish -- and even Portia's mom is strangely distant. But things start looking up when Portia mounts a late-night excursion into the woods behind her house and discovers a shy, sweet-natured purple monster. Life with Jellaby is a lot more exciting, but Portia's purple friend has secrets of his own; secrets that may even lead to the mystery of Portia's father's disappearance!</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Night of Cake &amp;amp; Puppets&lt;/em&gt;, Taylor brings to life a night only hinted at in the &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone &lt;/em&gt;trilogyâthe magical first date of fan-favorites Zuzana and Mik. Told in alternating perspectives, itâs the perfect love story for fans of the series and new readers alike. Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her ârabid fairy,â her âvoodoo eyesâ are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or âViolin Boy,â her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to meet him, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. Itâs a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winterâs night before finally leading him to the treasure: herself! Violin Boyâs not going to know what hit him.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A new Newsflesh novella from the New York Times bestselling author that brought you Feed, Mira Grant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Post-Rising Australia can be a dangerous place, especially if you're a member of the government-sponsored Australia Conservation Corps, a group of people dedicated to preserving their continent's natural wealth until a cure can be found. Between the zombie kangaroos at the fences and the zombie elephant seals turning the penguin rookery at Prince Phillip Island into a slaughterhouse, the work of an animal conservationist is truly never done--and is often done at the end of a sniper rifle.</description>

  <description>In the aftermath of Ireland's financial collapse, dangerous tensions surface in an Irish town. As violence flares, the characters face a battle between public persona and inner desires. Through a chorus of unique voices, each struggling to tell their own kind of truth, a single authentic tale unfolds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spinning Heart&lt;/em&gt; speaks for contemporary Ireland like no other novel. Wry, vulnerable, all-too human, it captures the language and spirit of rural Ireland and with uncanny perception articulates the words and thoughts of a generation. Technically daring and evocative of Patrick McCabe and J.M. Synge, this novel of small-town life is witty, dark and sweetly poignant.</description>

  <description>Cody Miller is on the brink of having it all: an MBA, a high-powered job in corporate finance, and the girl of his dreams. And then one mistake, one unfortunate accident, takes it all away in the blink of an eye. His future, his health and his hopeâgoneâup in flames, leaving him the victim of an unimaginably horrific injury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upon emerging from a coma, Cody discovers his life and plans have been shattered. As he struggles to find the strength to go on and a reason to live, he slowly begins to realize things may not be as they seem. His life has changed more than he could've ever imagined, but someoneâ¦or somethingâ¦may be working beneath the surfaceâ¦changing the world around him, altering lives and procuring victimsâ¦an ancient evil that hides in plain sight and destroys as it consumes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To uncover the truth, Cody will have to forget everything he thought he knew about reality in order to salvage his sanity and save the life of the woman he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How much would you give, how far would you go, what would you sacrifice, to save the person you love more than life itself? From deep within the flames, Cody Miller is about to find out.</description>

  <description>A goat who wants to sell you some meth. &lt;br&gt;A giraffe who might be violating his restraining order. &lt;br&gt;An alpaca with a very dirty secret. &lt;br&gt;A cat whoâs &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;mad at you for cancelling Netflix instant. &lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;These are just a few of the hilariously human animals youâll meet in &lt;em&gt;Animals Talking in All Caps. &lt;/em&gt;Inspired by the wildly popular blog of the same name and including some of the siteâs best-loved entries as well as gobs of never-before-seen material, these pages provide a brilliantly unhinged glimpse into the animal mind.Â Â </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Magical realism, lyrical prose, and the pain and passion of human love haunt this hypnotic generational saga.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foolish love appears to be the Roux family birthright, an ominous forecast for its most recent progeny, Ava Lavender. Avaâin all other ways a normal girlâis born with the wings of a bird. In a quest to understand her peculiar disposition and a growing desire to fit in with her peers, sixteen-year old Ava ventures into the wider world, ill-prepared for what she might discover and naÃ¯ve to the twisted motives of others. Others like the pious Nathaniel Sorrows, who mistakes Ava for an angel and whose obsession with her grows until the night of the Summer Solstice celebration. That night, the skies open up, rain and feathers fill the air, and Avaâs quest and her familyâs saga build to a devastating crescendo. First-time author Leslye Walton has constructed a layered and unforgettable mythology of what it means to be born with hearts that are tragically, exquisitely human.</description>

  <description>Award-winning photographer Mark Nixon has created a trove of quirky and nostalgic portraits of teddy bears and other stuffed animals that have been lovingly abused after years of play. &lt;em&gt;MuchLoved&lt;/em&gt; collects 60 of these images along with their accompanying background tales. An exhibit in the photographerâs studio led to a small sensation on the Internet when a few of the pictures circulated unofficially on scores of blogs and on many legitimate news sites. Viewers have been intrigued by the funny, bittersweet images and their ironic juxtaposition of childhood innocence and aged, loving wear and tear.Â  When you see these teddy bears and bunnies with missing noses and undone stuffing, you canât help but think back to childhood and its earliest companions who asked for nothing and gave a lot back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Praise for &lt;em&gt;Much Loved: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ï¿½&lt;em&gt;Much Loved &lt;/em&gt;is impossibly endearing in its entirety.â âBrain Pickings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Poor T-Rex. Itâs hard to be the Lizard King when you canât even change a light bulb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Drawn from Hugh Murphyâs wildly popular Tumblr feed of the same name, &lt;em&gt;T-Rex Trying&lt;/em&gt; depicts the stubby-armed tyrant in a range of hilariousâyet pathos-inducingâactivities that we humans take for granted. Murphyâs 100 drawings include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt; T-Rex Trying to Paint His House&lt;br&gt; T-Rex Trying to Use a Drive-Through ATM&lt;br&gt; T-Rex Trying to Apply Sunscreen&lt;br&gt; T-Rex Trying to Break Into a Vending Machine&lt;br&gt; T-Rex Trying to Ask for a New Roll of Toilet Paper from the Next Stall&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; Looks like the ancient beast isnât so tough after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Based on the runaway web phenomenon (&lt;a href="http://www.dogshaming.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.dogshaming.com&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Dog Shaming&lt;/em&gt; features the most hilarious, most shameful, and never-before-seen doggie misdeeds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Our dogs are our best friends. They are always happy to see us. They comfort us in our times of need. They also eat our shoes, stain our carpets, and embarrass us in front of our guests. &lt;br&gt; Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  &lt;br&gt;Dog owners everywhere have found their outlet in Dog Shaming, where they can confess their dogs' biggest (and often grossest!) sins, which turn out to be recognizably universalâcomplete with snapshots of ridiculously cute but shamed pups who don't seem capable of humping humans, pooping on pillows, or snagging steak straight from a grill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So share in the shaming and laugh through your frustration as &lt;em&gt;Dog Shaming&lt;/em&gt; reminds us that unconditional love goes both ways.</description>

  <description>It was supposed to be a happy occasion- a visit to your hometown by the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy. But no sooner had he arrived than he was gunned down in cold blood! You're a brilliant kid detective on your toughest case ever! Your Dad, the Chief of Police, has a suspect in custody, a Marxist named Lee Harvey Oswald. But is he really the assassin? You're not so sure- since the deeper you look, the more it seems like everyone from the Mafia, the Cubans, and the Military-Industrial Complex wanted him dead! And they might not be finished!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How will you fail to solve this mystery? If you question the suspect in custody, turn to page 4. Or if you follow-up on a tip from the mysterious Dr. Vivalzi, turn to page 12.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices you make. How badly will you fall in your quest for the truth? Only you can find out! And the worst part is you can keep on re-reading until you've had not one but many incredibly depressing defeats!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Set against the backdrop of the historic 1927 Mississippi Flood, a story of murder and moonshine, sandbagging and saboteurs, dynamite and deluge-and a man and a woman who find unexpected love-from Tom Franklin, author of the bestselling Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter, and his wife, Pushcart Prize-winning poet Beth Ann Fennelly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1927. As rains swell the Mississippi, the mighty river threatens to burst its banks and engulf all in its path, including federal revenue agent Ted Ingersoll and his partner, Ham Johnson. Arriving in the tiny hamlet of Hobnob, Mississippi, to investigate the disappearance of two fellow agents on the trail of a local bootlegger, they unexpectedly find an abandoned baby boy at a crime scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An orphan raised by nuns, Ingersoll is determined to find the infant a home, a search that leads him to Dixie Clay Holliver. A lonely woman married too young to a charming and sometimes violent philanderer, Dixie Clay has lost her only child to illness and is powerless to resist this second chance at motherhood. From the moment they meet, Ingersoll and Dixie Clay are drawn to each other. He has no idea that she's the best bootlegger in the county and may be connected to the missing agents. And while he seems kind and gentle, Dixie Clay knows he is the enemy and must not be trusted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a deadly new peril arises, endangering them all. A saboteur, hired by rich New Orleans bankers eager to protect their city, is planning to dynamite the levee and flood Hobnob, where the river bends precariously. Now, with time running out, Ingersoll, Ham, and Dixie Clay must make desperate choices, choices that will radically transform their lives-if they survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From two-time Carnegie Medal winner Patrick Ness comes an enthralling and provocative new novel chronicling the life â or perhaps afterlife â of a teen trapped in a crumbling, abandoned world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A boy named Seth drowns, desperate and alone in his final moments, losing his life as the pounding sea claims him. But then he wakes. He is naked, thirsty, starving. But alive. How is that possible? He remembers dying, his bones breaking, his skull dashed upon the rocks. So how is he here? And where is this place? It looks like the suburban English town where he lived as a child, before an unthinkable tragedy happened and his family moved to America. But the neighborhood around his old house is overgrown, covered in dust, and completely abandoned. Whatâs going on? And why is it that whenever he closes his eyes, he falls prey to vivid, agonizing memories that seem more real than the world around him? Seth begins a search for answers, hoping that he might not be alone, that this might not be the hell he fears it to be, that there might be more than just this. . . .</description>

  <description>Sloth's phone rings and rings. He races across the room to answer the call, but he's a sloth, so it takes a while. The phone says he's won an afternoon shopping spree! Can the sloth get to the store in time to claim his prize? Yes, but it's going to take an impromptu zipline, a missed bus, a parkful of trees, an oblivious ice-cream vendor, a rainbow hang glider, and an out-of-control shopping cart to make it happen. As soon as the spree begins, the sloth crashes into a pillow display and falls asleep, exhausted from excitement. When he awakes, he finds himself the proud and happy owner of&lt;br&gt;several fine new pillows. Mission accomplished.</description>

  <description>Sometimes I like to curl up in a ball&lt;br&gt;So no one can see me&lt;br&gt;because I'm so small.&lt;br&gt;Little wombat spends a day doing favorite things--what could they be? Are they your favorites, too? Let's look and see! He especially enjoys walking around and around, and doing a pigeon step till he falls down. Or sticking out his pink tongue--and pulling funny faces (now that can be fun)! And maybe he'll jump just as high as he can, and see how much noise he will make when he lands. But when the day ends and the sun starts to fall...he goes back home to mama and curls into a ball. Good night! Soft-toned illustrations portray an endearing little wombat and the warm and friendly world around him--and every page is filled with charming details that stand up to repeat viewings: cute mice, rabbits and turtles peering from behind tall grass, marching pigeons, and a menagerie of other adorable animals. The images, along with the lyrically rhyming text, combine to make a sweet-spirited bedtime story to ease young ones to sleep.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Maddie is a sweet-tempered coonhound who accompanied her owner, Theron, on a yearlong, cross-country trip while he worked on a photojournalism project. In his spare time, Theron took photos of Maddie doing what she does best: standing on things. From bicycles to giant watermelons to horses to people, there really isn't anything that Maddie won't stand on with grace and patience. The poignant Instagram photos of this beautiful dog and her offbeat poses have captured the imagination of all those who long for a road trip with a good dog for company. &lt;em&gt;Maddie on Things&lt;/em&gt; celebrates the strange talent of one special dog and will resonate with any dog lover who appreciates the quirky hearts (and extraordinary balance) of canines.</description>

  <description>Meet Little Penis, the cute dinky winky you bring to life when you put your finger in the puppet in this delightfully crass and hilarious parody board book for adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This board book parodies children&amp;amp;#8217;s finger puppet books with its bold colors and simple illustrations, but this book is not for children! Instead, put your finger in the hole in the back of the book, and follow the adventures of Little Penis as he goes swimming (poor shrinking Penis!); gets out of bed early, so big and tall; gets a gentle kiss and hug (along with a good hard tug); head to a bar, gets drunk, and hooks up; and more&amp;amp;#8212;getting bigger and bigger with the turn of each page. Sometimes he&amp;amp;#8217;s up and sometimes he&amp;amp;#8217;s down, but there&amp;amp;#8217;s a happy ending as he finds his snug, warm place called home!</description>

  <description>Good Dog marks the welcome return of alternative cartoonist Graham Chaffee, who, after his successful 2003 collection of short stories, The Most Important Thing and other Stories, took a detour to devote himself to the art of tattooing, before charging back with his new, beautifully conceived graphic novel. Ivan, who is plagued by terrible nightmares about chickens and rabbits, is a good dog--if only someone would notice. Readers accompany the stray as he navigates dog society, weathers pack politics, and surveys canine-human interactions. Good Dog's story and pen-and-ink art are deceptively simple, but Chaffee uses the approachability of the subject matter as a device to explore topics such as independence, security, assimilation, loyalty, and violence. Preteen-and-up dog fanciers, especially, will warm to the well-meaning Ivan and his exploits with a motley assortment of Scotties, Bulldogs, and mutts. Chaffee combines illustrative gravitas with cartooning verve and creates a richly textured, dog's-eye view of the world. The story is a rousing Jack Londonesque adventure as well as a moral parable.</description>

  <description>Middle school romance is hard enough, but cannibalism really gets in the way. This humorous look at first crushes and family secrets is sure to be devoured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ferrell Savage is finally twelve, and finally eligible to compete in The Big Sled Race on Golden Hill&amp;amp;#8212;the perfect chance to impress Mary Vittles. Mary is Ferrell&amp;amp;#8217;s best friend&amp;amp;#8230;and maybe, someday, something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except the &amp;amp;#8220;more&amp;amp;#8221; Ferrell first finds is more information about his family. It turns out that his great, great, great uncle had an encounter with Mary&amp;amp;#8217;s great, great grandfather. And the encounter was, well, let&amp;amp;#8217;s just say&amp;amp;#8230;edible. Sure, the circumstances were extreme, but some facts might just be romantically indigestible. At least now Ferrell understands why his family is vegan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even as Ferrell and Mary encounter blackmail, a second sled race, and a particularly enticing bag of beef jerky, Ferrell realizes that he might still have a chance with Mary. If, that is, his family secret doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t eat them alive.</description>

  <description>Fans of David Attenborough will enjoy experiencing the wonders of nature through Mike Spinak's pictures and words. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine witnessing hummingbird chicks being raised on the nest from front row seats, with every step shown as it unfolds, accompanied by fundamental explanations of the "whys" behind what you're seeing. In Mike Spinak's "Growing Up Humming", you'll see hummingbirds as you've never seen them before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The elder chick has flown from the nest, and now follows her mother while learning how to live like an adult. The younger chick hasn't yet fledged, and life will be easier for her mother when both are flying. What happens when a mother hummingbird wants her chick to leave the nest, but the chick isn't ready? This fact-filled, true story, photo book shows the answers in a heartwarming tale the entire family can enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The photos are so captivating you just want to gaze at them for hours rather than turn the page to continue the story." - Katie H.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The story itself is wondrous - Mike simply wrought words from inspiration that the hummingbirds gave him." - Nataliya Field&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I gave a copy to my 10 year old niece who enjoyed it so much that she read the whole thing front to back in one setting (and then spent a couple of hours wowing the adults with hummingbird facts)." - James Beswick, Amazon Top 1000 Reviewer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...delightful for persons of any age ... a breathtaking microcosm that few people have witnessed and which somehow makes you feel blessed ... marvelous, awesome story." - P.B. Sharp, Amazon Top 500 Reviewer</description>

  <description>Everyone thinks that Sophie is an orphan. True, there were no other recorded female survivors from the shipwreck which left baby Sophie floating in the English Channel in a cello case, but Sophie remembers seeing her mother wave for help. Her guardian tells her it is almost impossible that her mother is still alive, but that means still possible. You should never ignore a possible. So when the Welfare Agency writes to her guardian threatening to send Sophie to an orphanage, she takes matters into her own hands and flees to Paris to look for her mother, starting with the only clue she has - the address of the cello maker. Evading the French authorities, she meets Matteo and his network of rooftoppers - urchins who live in the sky. Together they scour the city for Sophie's mother before she is caught and sent back to London, and most importantly before she loses hope.</description>

  <description>This fun and interactive board book features 16 colorful spreads of Domo activities perfect for every die-hard Domo fan, young or old. Users can bake a Domo cake, make a Domo bento box, make a Domo costume (for a human and for a dog!), make a Domo Cubee, paint Domo on their fingernails, apply temporary tattoos, and Domo-ize T-shirts, tote bags, skateboards, and more! Extras are packaged in a resealable envelope at the back of the book. Extras include Domo-themed temporary tattoos, a Domo Cubee, and a Domo stencil sheet.&lt;br&gt;Domo is the funny, square-ish, brown creature that began life as a mascot for a Japanese TV network, but who has blown up into a beloved international phenomenon. His fuzzy, grinning mug has appeared everywhere from plush toys to figurines, T-shirts to key chains, as well as on more than one million fan sites and on his official Facebook page, where he has made over 230,000 friends. But Domo has never had his own activity book . . . until now.</description>

  <description>From its explosive opening to its eerie climax, &lt;em&gt;The Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turning, labyrinthine thrill ride that returns to Niceville . . . where evil lives far longer than men do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When two plane crashes set off a spellbinding chain reaction of murder, inadvertent kidnapping, corporate corruption, and financial double-dealing, itâs not enough that Niceville detective Nick Kavanaugh (exâSpecial Forces) has to investigate. He and his wife, family lawyer Kate, have also just taken in brutally orphaned Rainey Teague. Something bothers Nick about Raineyâand it isnât just that the woman in charge of attendance at Raineyâs prep school has disappeared. In fact, people have long been disappearing from seemingly placid Niceville, including, most disturbingly, Kateâs father. Using his files, Kate and Nick start to unearth Nicevilleâs blood stained history, but something (or is it &lt;em&gt;Nothing&lt;/em&gt;?) stands in their way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once again, Carsten Stroud gives us unforgettable characters, including Coker, the steely, amoral police sniper, and Harvill Endicott, an urbanely manipulative psychopath, not to mention Warren Smoles, the most conniving lawyer you will ever meet. Stroudâs unique storytelling gifts bring us into a world where protecting your family from the unknown becomes almost impossible but essential for survival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Anything is possible in &lt;em&gt;The Homecoming.Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>With fearlessness and grace, &lt;em&gt;Bough Down&lt;/em&gt; reports from deep inside the maelstrom of grief. In this profoundly beautiful and intensely moving lament, artist and writer Karen Green conjures the inscrutable space of love and loss, clarity and contradiction, sense and madness. She summons memory and the machination of the interior mind with the emotional acuity of music as she charts her passage through the devastation of her husband's suicide. In crystalline fragments of text, Green's voice is paradoxically confessional and non-confessional: moments in her journey are devastating but also luminous, exacting in sensation but also ambiguous and layered in meaning. Her world is haunted by the unnameable, and yet she renders that world with poetic precision in her struggle to make sense of not only of death but of living. In counterpoint, tiny visual collages punctuate the text, each made of salvaged language and scraps of the material world-pages torn from books, bits of paper refuse, drawings and photographs, old postage stamps and the albums which classify them. Each collage â and the creative act of making it â evinces the reassembling of life. A breathtaking lyric elegy, &lt;em&gt;Bough Down&lt;/em&gt; uses music and silence, color and its absence, authority of experience and the doubt that trembles at its center to fulfill a humane artistic vision. This is a lapidary, keenly observed work, awash with the honesty of an open heart.</description>

  <description>Terra has never known anything but life aboard the &lt;em&gt;Asherah&lt;/em&gt;, a city-within-a-spaceship that left Earth five hundred years ago in search of refuge. At sixteen, working a job that doesn't interest her, and living with a grieving father who only notices her when he's yelling, Terra is sure that there has to be more to life than what she's got.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she inadvertently witnesses the captain's guard murdering an innocent man, Terra is suddenly thrust into the dark world beneath her ship's idyllic surface. As she's drawn into a secret rebellion determined to restore power to the people, Terra discovers that her choices may determine life or death for the people she cares most about. With mere months to go before landing on the long-promised planet, Terra has to make the decision of a lifetime--one that will determine the fate of her people.</description>

  <description>Erin Saldin's &lt;em&gt;The Girls of No Return&lt;/em&gt; is a lacerating young adult debut about girls, knives, and redemption. The Alice Marshall School, set within a glorious 2-million acre wilderness area, is a place where teenage girls are sent to escape their histories and themselves. Lida Wallace has tried to negate herself in every way possible. At Alice Marshall, she meets Elsa Boone, Jules, and Gia Longchamps, whose glamour entrances the entire camp. As the girls prepare for a wilderness trek, Lida is both thrilled and terrified to be chosen as Gia's friend. Everyone has their secrets â the âThingsâ they try to protect; and when those come out, the knives do as well.</description>

  <description>Customer (holding up a book): Whatâs this? The Secret Garden? Well, itâs not so secret now, is it, since they bloody well wrote a book about it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops was a Sunday Times bestseller, and could be found displayed on bookshop counters up and down the country. The response to the book from booksellers all over the world has been one of heartfelt agreement: it would appear that customers are saying bizarre things all over the place - from asking for books with photographs of Jesus in them, to hunting for the best horse ownerâs manual that has a detailed chapter on unicorns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Customer: I had such a crush on Captain Hook when I was younger. Do you think this means I have unresolved issues?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops has yet more tales from the antiquarian bookshop where Jen Campbell works, and includes a selection of âWeird Things...â sent in from other booksellers across the world. The book is illustrated by the BAFTA winning Brothers McLeod.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There is NOTHING boring about being a kid, but one little girl is going to have to prove it in this anything-but-boring picture book from comedian Michael Ian Black.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when a little girl thinks she couldn&amp;amp;#8217;t possibly be more bored, she stumbles upon a potato who turns the tables on her by declaring that children are boring. But this girl isn&amp;amp;#8217;t going to let a vegetable tell her what&amp;amp;#8217;s what, so she sets out to show the unimpressed potato all the amazing things kids can do. Too bad the potato is anything but interested&amp;amp;#8230;.&lt;br&gt;This tongue-in-cheek twist on a familiar topic is sure to entertain anyone who&amp;amp;#8217;s ever been bored&amp;amp;#8212;or had to hear about someone else being bored&amp;amp;#8212;and is filled with comedian Michael Ian Black&amp;amp;#8217;s trademark dry wit, accompanied by charismatic illustrations from newcomer Debbie Ridpath Ohi.</description>

  <description>THE GIRL WHO WOULDN'T DIE HUNTS THE KILLER WHO SHOULDN'T EXIST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The future is not as loud as war, but it is relentless. It has a terrible fury all its own." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harper Curtis is a killer who stepped out of the past. Kirby Mazrachi is the girl who was never meant to have a future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kirby is the last shining girl, one of the bright young women, burning with potential, whose lives Harper is destined to snuff out after he stumbles on a House in Depression-era Chicago that opens on to other times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the urging of the House, Harper inserts himself into the lives of the shining girls, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. He's the ultimate hunter, vanishing into another time after each murder, untraceable-until one of his victims survives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to bring her would-be killer to justice, Kirby joins the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; to work with the ex-homicide reporter, Dan Velasquez, who covered her case. Soon Kirby finds herself closing in on the impossible truth . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SHINING GIRLS is a masterful twist on the serial killer tale: a violent quantum leap featuring a memorable and appealing heroine in pursuit of a deadly criminal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Professional thief Terrier Rand hasnât gotten caught yet. Itâs only his conscience chasing at his heels.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the follow-up to Tom Piccirilliâs acclaimed novel &lt;em&gt;The Last Kind Words, &lt;/em&gt;prodigal thief Terrier Rand has come home to the family that has lawbreaking in its blood. With generations of Rands keeping secrets from the outside worldânot to mention from oneÂ  anotherâTerry is sure of one thing: He owes it to the woman he loved and lost to make sure her husband stays alive.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; Kimmyâs husband, Terryâs old friend Chub, hasnât been seen since he supplied a getaway car for a heist that went wrong. When Terry investigates the ominous disappearance, he discovers that Chub was involved with a strange, violent gang of heavy hittersâguys who donât take kindly to Terry asking questions. But before Terry can find his friend, a curvaceous divorcÃ©e takes him for a walk on the wild side, estranged relatives pull him into their horror movie empire, his sister Dale sets her sights on Hollywood after scoring a hit viral video, and his own uncle recruits Terry to rip off his partner.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; In a world of larceny, grift, and fraud, no amount of loyaltyâto friends, wives, or loversâcan compete with the Rand family drama. Terry just wants to bring Chub home to his wife and child. Instead, heâs dodging mobsters, moguls, and murderers . . . and the truth about one crime of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Whisper in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; takes readers on a wild, rollicking ride with an eclectic crowd of fascinating charactersâfrom a well-mannered killer who drives needles into his victimsâ brains to a young gangster struggling to live up to his fatherâs expectations. Bonds of honor, bonds of blood, and betrayals of both make this the most powerful read yet from the heralded Tom Piccirilli.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Tom Piccirilliâs &lt;em&gt;The Last Kind Words&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; âPerfect crime fiction . . . a convincing world, a cast of compelling characters, and above all a great story.ââLee Child&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; âA crime noir mystery as hard-boiled as any in recent memory, recalling the work of Chandler, Pelecanos and Connelly . . . Readers will be pinned to their seats until the last page is turned.ââBookreporter&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; âAt once a dark and brooding page-turner and a heartfelt tale about the ties that bind.ââLisa Unger, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Heartbroken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; â[A] caustic thriller . . . The characters have strong voices and bristle with funny quirks.â&lt;em&gt;âThe New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt; â[Piccirilli] deserves a breakout novel and this just might be it.ââ&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Â &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; âFor the first time since&lt;em&gt; The Godfather,&lt;/em&gt; a family of criminals has stolen my heart. This is a brilliant mix of love and violence, charm and corruption. I loved it.ââNancy Pickard, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Scent of Rain and Lightning&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>NEW YORK TIMES bestseller and Goodreads Choice Award Nominee! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A page-turning thriller for readers of Stephen King, Gillian Flynn, and Stieg Larsson, Night Film tells the haunting story of a journalist who becomes obsessed with the mysterious death of a troubled prodigyâthe daughter of an iconic, reclusive filmmaker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a damp October night, beautiful young Ashley Cordova is found dead in an abandoned warehouse in lower Manhattan. Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding Ashleyâs life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive cult-horror-film director Stanislas Cordovaâa man who hasnât been seen in public for more than thirty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about Cordovaâs dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driven by revenge, curiosity, and a need for the truth, McGrath, with the aid of two strangers, is drawn deeper and deeper into Cordovaâs eerie, hypnotic world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time he got close to exposing the director, McGrath lost his marriage and his career. This time he might lose even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Night Film, the gorgeously written, spellbinding new novel by the dazzlingly inventive Marisha Pessl, will hold you in suspense until you turn the final page.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;em&gt;Extraordinary Chickens&lt;/em&gt; comes the latest extraordinary animal--the pig. One of the most intelligent animals on earth, the pig is a fascinating creature with an abundance of personality. Photographer Stephen Green-Armytage captures these lively and energetic animals as they play and forage on the farm, prance around in the show ring, or strut across a studio backdrop.Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extraordinary Pigs&lt;/em&gt; displays an enormous variety of swine, 38 in total, including tiny Kunekunes, wrinkled Meishans, spotted Gloucester Old Spots, curly-coated Mangalitzas, wild boars, and some miniatures, which are highly prized as pets. Breeds from around the world are featured here--from the United States, England, Wales, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, New Zealand, China, Vietnam, Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love and dared to imagine a world free of bloodshed and war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not that world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Art student and monster's apprentice Karou finally has the answers she has always sought. She knows who she isâand &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; she is. But with this knowledge comes another truth she would give anything to undo: She loved the enemy and he betrayed her, and a world suffered for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this stunning sequel to the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Daughter of Smoke &amp;amp; Bone&lt;/em&gt;, Karou must decide how far she'll go to avenge her people. Filled with heartbreak and beauty, secrets and impossible choices, &lt;em&gt;Days of Blood &amp;amp; Starlight&lt;/em&gt; finds Karou and Akiva on opposing sides as an age-old war stirs back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Karou and her allies build a monstrous army in a land of dust and starlight, Akiva wages a different sort of battle: a battle for redemption. For &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can any hope be salvaged from the ashes of their broken dream?</description>

  <description>On a cold and snowy night in 1910, Ursula Todd is born, the third child of a wealthy English banker and his wife. Sadly, she dies before she can draw her first breath. On that same cold and snowy night, Ursula Todd is born, lets out a lusty wail, and embarks upon a life that will be, to say the least, unusual. For as she grows, she also dies, repeatedly, in any number of ways. Clearly history (and Kate Atkinson) have plans for her: In Ursula rests nothing less than the fate of civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wildly inventive, darkly comic, startlingly poignant â this is Kate Atkinson at her absolute best, playing with time and history, telling a story that is breathtaking for both its audacity and its endless satisfactions.</description>

  <description>Bookcases are so much more than just a place to store oneâs books. They've become experiments in engineering and explorations into modern art, covetable in their own right. Financial analysts at Bloomberg have even used the IKEA Billy bookcase as an index of economic growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these pages you will find plenty of inspiration and diversity, from âJuxtaposed,â a shelf capitalizing on limited space to display seven books containing the worldâs most influential religions, to Sakura Adachiâs âTrick,â a bookcase that constantly mutates into a table and two chairs. Shelves can even be re-imagined: the way laundry is dried in China informed Dutch designers Studio Ditte as they created their Kwan bookcase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So while we appreciate the efficient book storage of e-readers, let us marvel at physical bookshelves that are shaped like trees, or hold books upside down, or can even walk. This beautifully crafted book will bring joy to book lovers everywhere.</description>

  <description>Two young children tour their noisy house with fresh eyes, discovering along the way that all is not as it seems. Featuring heat-sensitive, color-changing ink on every page, this book contains dozens of delightful surprises. Among them: a giant dog slumbering in a piano, a wishing puddle full of dimes, a raccoon that is actually a robot, and a camera that is secretly made of cheese.</description>

  <description>Here is the third volume in George R.R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes &lt;em&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt;.  Together, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as alliances are made and broken.  Joffrey sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, victim of the sorceress who holds him in her thrall.  Young Robb still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun.  Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world.  And as opposing forces maneuver for the final showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost limits of civilization, accompanied by a horde of mythical Othersâa supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords...</description>

  <description>A seven-year-old girl puts a nail gun to her grandmother's neck and fires. An isolated incident, say the experts. The experts are wrong. Across the world, children are killing their families. Is violence contagious? As chilling murders by children grip the country, anthropologist Hesketh Lock has his own mystery to solve: a bizarre scandal in the Taiwan timber industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hesketh has never been good at relationships: Asperger's Syndrome has seen to that. But he does have a talent for spotting behavioral patterns and an outsider's fascination with group dynamics. Nothing obvious connects Hesketh's Asian case with the atrocities back home. Or with the increasingly odd behavior of his beloved stepson, Freddy. But when Hesketh's Taiwan contact dies shockingly and more acts of sabotage and child violence sweep the globe, he is forced to acknowledge possibilities that defy the rational principles on which he has staked his life, his career, and, most devastatingly of all, his role as a father. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part psychological thriller, part dystopian nightmare, &lt;em&gt;The Uninvited&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful and viscerally unsettling portrait of apocalypse in embryo.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The exuberant, exhilarating photographs of dogs underwater that have become a sensation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the water's surface, it's a simple exercise: a dog's leap, a splash, and then a wet head surfacing with a ball, triumphant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But beneath the water is a chaotic ballet of bared teeth and bubbles, paddling paws, fur and ears billowing in the currents. From leaping Lab to diving Dachshund, the water is where a dog's distinct personality shines through; some lounge in the current, paddling slowly, but others arch their bodies to cut through the water with the focus and determination of a shark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In more than eighty portraits, award-winning pet photographer and animal rights activist Seth Casteel captures new sides of our old friends with vibrant underwater photography that makes it impossible to look away. Each image bubbles with exuberance and life, a striking reminder that even in the most loveable and domesticated dog, there are more primal forces at work. In &lt;em&gt;Underwater Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, Seth Casteel gives playful and energetic testament to the rough-and-tumble joy that our dogs bring into our lives.</description>

  <description>In a starred review &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; raves: "Itâs an avant-garde, surrealist story with a Hollywood-style tearjerker lurking withinâand a surprisingly charming and affecting one at that."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning poet Matthea Harvey and illustrator extraordinaire Giselle Potter team up to create an indescribably unique picture book about wanting to be normal, then coming to appreciate being different. Ruby would love to be like everyone elseânot easy when you have a tiara-wearing mother and a father who spends his time trimming outrageous topiary. She'd also like to get a nice normal pet, maybe a dog. Then, on a family vacation to Norway, she finds herself adopted by a small, affectionate glacier. How Cecil, as the ice pet is named, proves himself to Rubyârisking his own meltdownâis a story sure to thrill and delight young readers.</description>

  <description>Highly anticipated since its initial online appearance and immediate viral proliferation, first-time authors and ersatz Victorian scholars Joy DeLyria and Sean Michael Robinson have painstakingly created a satirical and fictional world based on the characters and narrative of television's most loved drama, &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; To be published in time to celebrate &lt;em&gt;The Wire's&lt;/em&gt; tenth anniversary, &lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Down in the Hole: the unWired World of H.B. Ogden&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; is a collection of excerpts and illustrations from &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;, a Victorian serial novel of DeLyria and Robinson's invention, credited to fictional author H.B. Ogden. Excerpts from Ogden's work are knit together by the history of the novel, its author and illustrator, and the adventures of the passionate archivists who uncovered this forgotten text.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Baltimore Sun&lt;/em&gt; writes: "...[This] quintessentially Victorian vision of Ogden's &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;...is a scintillating piece of faux-scholarship. It's set in an alternate universe where the HBO series doesn't existâand where &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; in any form, including Horatio Bucklesby Ogden's, has yet to be discovered."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; asks: "So, how long before we can actually buy this illustrated version of &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;? I'd put it on my Amazon wish list now if I could."</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Double Feature&lt;/em&gt; Brings together two authors of the horrific into one volume, pairing Vernon D. Burns's insane creativity with the blossoming talent of Albert C. Clapp. Burns contributes the brand new novella, &lt;em&gt;Furry Piranha&lt;/em&gt;, followed by Clapp's &lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Skrewnicorn&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you get when you mix a batch of American tourists, a nuclear experiment gone wrong, a jungle, two ethnic tour guides, and the strangest evolution Earth has ever seen? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Furry piranha!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the depths of the South American jungle, the sultry Amanda Handy wants nothing but to have a relaxing vacation while not falling in love with anyone. Love, after all, can hurt. But she hadn't factored into her equation the dashing Cliff Parker, a tall and chiseled man with puppy dog eyes that could melt a girl's heart like it was wax. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither one of them, however, recognized the true dangers surrounding them: a tribe of fearsome cannibals; the mutant fish flooding the river; and the dangers of traveling with a whole group of people with a past! Only by reading Furry Piranha will you learn just who the flesh eating bastards really are: us or the fish. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;+ + +&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her untimely death in a freak car accident, Carrie finds herself alive once again in the body of a horse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, she is not just any horse. An ethically questionable scientist has made her the very first unicorn, affixing a large, sharp screw to her head. All is well until she finds herself cast out by the scientist who created her, and must find her way in a brutal world on her own. And it drives her insane. And she starts killing people at random. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Curse of the Skrewnicorn&lt;/em&gt; is a unique tale of what happens when mankind does not take responsibility for its creations, begging the question, who is really the monster: the scientists, or the homicidal horse with a woman's brain.</description>

  <description>Cat lovers will laugh out loud at the quirkiness of their feline friends with these insightful and curious poems from the singular minds of housecats. In this hilarious book of tongue-in-cheek poetry, the author of the internationally syndicated comic strip Sally Forth helps cats unlock their creative potential and explain their odd behavior to ignorant humans. With titles like "Who Is That on Your Lap?," "This Is My Chair," "Kneel Before Me," "Nudge," and "Some of My Best Friends Are Dogs," the poems collected in I Could Pee on This perfectly capture the inner workings of the cat psyche. With photos of the cat authors throughout, this whimsical volume reveals kitties at their wackiest, and most exasperating (but always lovable).</description>

  <description>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, &lt;em&gt;Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings.  "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"  Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</description>

  <description>Pagan Taupe is the wealthiest man in all of Arkansas. Heâs got a home with a working refrigerator, a private rickshaw driver, and a respected empire of taxidermy/fro-yo chain stores. The only thing thatâs missing is a whiny young codependent named Alexandra Aluminum. From the moment he sees her tripping over an angry raccoon, itâs clear that Alexandra dills his pickle. Pagan becomes obsessed with Alexandra at a level normally portrayed by Rob Lowe in Lifetime movies. But unlike Rob Lowe, Pagan doesnât want to beat her with a tire iron and bury her beneath the town bridgeâhe wants to make her his live-in sex slave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if eager young Alexandra wants to feel the caress of Paganâs ear hair against her cheek, sheâs going to have to play by his rules. When Pagan reveals the special room heâs built to live out his sexual proclivities, Alexandraâs natural reaction is to cold cock him and call the police. But the clown chained to the wall assures Alexandra that Pagan is a stand-up guy, and if she gives him a chance he can introduce her to a world of unimaginable pleasure. Alexandra takes the leap and agrees to be Paganâs unquestioning âsubmissive,â and the two embark on a sexual journey that would make Gloria Steinem put a loaded gun to her temple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A COUPLA SHADES OF TAUPE is a romantic, tender tale of blossoming emotions and hardcore schtupping. A Pulitzer is inevitable.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />so this book is pretty awesome, i gotta say. it stays pretty parodically true to the original, but i don't think it is necessary to have read fifty shades to get what you need to out of it; if you don't know the plot of fifty shades, you are living under a rock, and probably have bigger concerns...]]>

  <description>In a world where the undead outnumber the living, Moses Todd roams the post-apocalyptic plains of America. His reprobate brother, Abraham â his only companion â has known little else. Together, they journey because they have to; because they have nowhere to go, and no one to answer to other than themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling the bloody wastelands of this ruined world, Moses is looking for a kernel of truth, and a reason to keep going. And a chance encounter presents him with the Vestal Amata, a beguiling and mysterious woman who may hold the key to salvation. But he is not the only one seeking the Vestal. For the Vestal has a gift: a gift that might help save what is left of humanity. And it may take everything he has to free her from the clutches of those who most desire her.</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>1987. Thereâs only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old June Elbus, and thatâs her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finnâs company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, Juneâs world is turned upside down. But Finnâs death brings a surprise acquaintance into Juneâs lifeâsomeone who will help her to heal, and to question what she thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Finnâs funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd. A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful teapot she recognizes from Finnâs apartment, and a note from Toby, the stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time together, June realizes sheâs not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she needs the most.</description>

  <description>A magnificent selection of song lyrics and poems from across the storied career of one of the most daring and affecting poet-ongwriters in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the more than half century since his first book of poems was published, Leonard Cohen has evolved into an international cult figure who transcends genres and generations. This anthology contains a cross section of his five decades of influential work, including such legendary songs as âSuzanne,â âSisters of Mercy,â âBird on the Wire,â âFamous Blue Raincoat,â and âIâm Your Manâ and searingly memorable poems from his many acclaimed poetry collections, including &lt;em&gt;Flowers for Hitler, Beautiful Losers, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Death of a Ladyâs Man.&lt;/em&gt; Encompassing the erotic and the melancholy, the mystical and the sardonic, this volume showcases a writer of dazzling intelligence and live-wire emotional immediacy.</description>

  <description>Harry Radcliffe is a brilliant prize-winning architect---witty and remarkable. He's also a self-serving opportunist, ready to take advantage of whatever situations, and women, come his way. But now, newly divorced and having had an inexplicable nervous breakdown, Harry is being wooed by the extremely wealthy Sultan of Saru to design a billion-dollar dog museum. In Saru, he finds himself in a world even madder and more unreal than the one he left behind, and as his obsession grows, the powers of magic weave around him, and the implications of his strange undertaking grow more ominous and astounding....&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Time is out of joint. The summer of peace and plenty, ten years long, is drawing to a close, and the harsh, chill winter approaches like an angry beast. Two great leadersâLord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheonâwho held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a prophecy of doom cuts across the skyâa comet the color of blood and flameâsix factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddardâs son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over Kingâs Landing. Robertâs two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the  men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Audacious, inventive, brilliantly imagined, &lt;em&gt;A Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; is a novel of dazzling beauty and boundless enchantmentâa tale of pure excitement you will never forget.</description>

  <description>A Winner of the Alex Award, a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for First Fiction, named a Best Book of the Year by NPR, Los Angeles Times, and San Francisco Chronicle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Great Recession has shuffled Clay Jannon away from life as a San Francisco web-design drone and into the aisles of Mr. Penumbraâs 24-Hour Bookstore. But after a few days on the job, Clay discovers that the store is more curious than either its name or its gnomic owner might suggest. The customers are few, and they never seem to buy anythingâinstead, they âcheck outâ large, obscure volumes from strange corners of the store. Suspicious, Clay engineers an analysis of the clienteleâs behavior, seeking help from his variously talented friends. But when they bring their findings to Mr. Penumbra, they discover the bookstoreâs secrets extend far beyond its walls. Rendered with irresistible brio and dazzling intelligence, Robin Sloan's Mr. Penumbraâs 24-Hour Bookstore is exactly what it sounds like: an establishment you have to enter and will never want to leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(description from Amazon.com)</description>

  <description>â&lt;em&gt;Iâve not always been what I am now&lt;/em&gt;â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a fit of drunken anger, Michael Henchard sells his wife and baby daughter for five guineas at a country fair. Over the course of the following years, he manages to establish himself as a respected and prosperous pillar of the community of Casterbridge, but behind his success there always lurk the shameful secret of his past and a personality prone to self-destructive pride and temper. Subtitled âA Story of a Man of Characterâ, Hardyâs powerful and sympathetic study of the heroic but deeply flawed Henchard is also an intensely dramatic work, tragically played out against the vivid backdrop of a close-knit Dorsetshire town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This edition includes an introduction, chronology of Hardyâs life and works, the illustrations for the original Serial Issue, place names, maps, glossary, full explanatory notes as well as Hardyâs prefaces to the 1895 and 1912 editions.</description>

  <description>For more than thirty years, Edie and Richard Middlestein shared a solid family life together in the suburbs of Chicago. But now things are splintering apart, for one reason, it seems: Edie's enormous girth. She's obsessed with food--thinking about it, eating it--and if she doesn't stop, she won't have much longer to live. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Richard abandons his wife, it is up to the next generation to take control. Robin, their schoolteacher daughter, is determined that her father pay for leaving Edie. Benny, an easy-going, pot-smoking family man, just wants to smooth things over. And Rachelle-- a whippet thin perfectionist-- is intent on saving her mother-in-law's life, but this task proves even bigger than planning her twin children's spectacular b'nai mitzvah party. Through it all, they wonder: do Edie's devastating choices rest on her shoulders alone, or are others at fault, too?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With pitch-perfect prose, huge compassion, and sly humor, Jami Attenberg has given us an epic story of marriage, family, and obsession. &lt;em&gt;The Middlesteins&lt;/em&gt; explores the hopes and heartbreaks of new and old love, the yearnings of Midwestern America, and our devastating, fascinating preoccupation with food.</description>

  <description>Rise up while you can. -Georgia Mason&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year was 2014. The year we cured cancer. The year we cured the common cold. And the year the dead started to walk. The year of the Rising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year was 2039. The world didn't end when the zombies came, it just got worse. Georgia and Shaun Mason set out on the biggest story of their generation. They uncovered the biggest conspiracy since the Rising and realized that to tell the truth, sacrifices have to be made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the year is 2041, and the investigation that began with the election of President Ryman is much bigger than anyone had assumed. With too much left to do and not much time left to do it in, the surviving staff of After the End Times must face mad scientists, zombie bears, rogue government agencies-and if there's one thing they know is true in post-zombie America, it's this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things can always get worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackout&lt;/em&gt; is the conclusion to the epic trilogy that began in the Hugo-nominated &lt;em&gt;Feed&lt;/em&gt; and the sequel, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Fashion goes to the dogs in this lovable follow-up to "Say Hello to Zorro!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mister Bud and Zorro get along just great. They wake up together, have walk time together, and take naps together. But something is about to interrupt their schedule: Zorro has to wear a fancy outfit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zorro is embarrassed, mortified, aghast. Mr. Bud tries to cheer him up, but nothing works. Everyone makes fun of Zorro, and he refuses to participate in chew-on-a-stick time. Mister Bud doesn't know what to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when another dog, a "very cool" dog shows up in an outfit and does amazing tricks and beats all the other dogs in a race, Zorro discovers that wearing clothes might not be so bad after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything is back on schedule.</description>

  <description>This Sunday Times Bestseller is a miscellany of hilarious and peculiar bookshop moments:&lt;br&gt;'Can books conduct electricity?'&lt;br&gt;'My children are just climbing your bookshelves: that's ok... isn't it?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A John Cleese Twitter question ['What is your pet peeve?'], first sparked the 'Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops' blog, which grew over three years into one bookseller's collection of ridiculous conversations on the shop floor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From 'Did Beatrix Potter ever write a book about dinosaurs?' to the hunt for a paperback which could forecast the next year's weather; and from 'I've forgotten my glasses, please read me the first chapter' to'Excuse me... is this book edible?'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This full-length collection illustrated by the Brothers McLeod also includes top 'Weird Things' from bookshops around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sequel, 'More Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops' is also available &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16174631-more-weird-things-customers-say-in-bookshops#other_reviews" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Knockemstiff&lt;/em&gt;âcalled âpowerful, remarkable, exceptionalâ by the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;âcomes a dark and riveting vision of America that delivers literary excitement in the highest degree. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Devil All the Time&lt;/em&gt;, Donald Ray Pollock has written a novel that marries the twisted intensity of Oliver Stoneâs &lt;em&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;/em&gt; with the religious and Gothic overÂ­tones of Flannery OâConnor at her most haunting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in rural southern Ohio and West Virginia, &lt;em&gt;The Devil All the Time&lt;/em&gt; follows a cast of compelling and bizarre characters from the end of World War II to the 1960s. Thereâs Willard Russell, tormented veteran of the carnage in the South Pacific, who canât save his beautiful wife, Charlotte, from an agonizing death by cancer no matter how much sacrifiÂ­cial blood he pours on his âprayer log.â Thereâs Carl and Sandy Henderson, a husband-and-wife team of serial killÂ­ers, who troll Americaâs highways searching for suitable models to photograph and exterminate. Thereâs the spider-handling preacher Roy and his crippled virtuoso-guitar-playing sidekick, Theodore, running from the law. And caught in the middle of all this is Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotteâs orphaned son, who grows up to be a good but also violent man in his own right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donald Ray Pollock braids his plotlines into a taut narrative that will leave readers astonished and deeply moved. With his first novel, he proves himself a master storyteller in the grittiest and most uncompromising American grain.</description>

  <description>Winter, 1862. A malevolent spirit roams the cold and gloomy streets of Victorian London, the vampiric ghost of John Polidori, the onetime physician of the mad, bad and dangerous Romantic poet Lord Byron. Polidori is also the supernatural muse to his niece and nephew, poet Christina Rossetti and her artist brother Dante Gabriel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Polidori's taste for debauchery has grown excessive. He is determined to possess the life and soul of an innocent young girl, the daughter of a veterinarian and a reformed prostitute he once haunted. And he has resurrected Dante's dead wife, transforming her into a horrifying vampire. The Rossettis know the time has come â Polidori must be stopped. Joining forces with the girl's unlikely parents, they are plunged into a supernatural London underworld whose existence they never suspected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These wildly mismatched allies â a strait-laced animal doctor, and ex-prostitute, a poet, a painter, and even the Artful Dodger-like young daughter â must ultimately choose between the banality and constraints of human life and the unholy immortality that Polidori offers. Sweeping from high society to grimy slums, elegant West End salons to pre-Roman catacombs beneath St. Paul's cathedral, Hide Me Among The Graves blends the historical and the supernatural in a dazzling, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride.</description>

  <description>Welcome to the world of lateral thinking puzzles: mind exercises that encourage cleverness and innovation in problem solving. Coined by Dr. Edward de Bono in 1970, lateral thinking is a non-traditional way of approaching a problem, sometimes called "thinking outside the box." Often used to train business executives and others in the art of creative thinking, these puzzles are sometimes proposed to job applicants at software and high-tech firms. &lt;p&gt;What's the Story? features more than 20 puzzles-some classic, some new-in two formats. Available as a book and as a boxed deck of cards, both editions have been compiled and are illustrated by Matthew Johnstone, whose work is as thought-provoking as the puzzles themselves. Do the illustrations hold clues to the solutions? Perhaps, but you probably won't recognize the clues until you've found the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect for long car trips or dull dinner parties, these fascinating puzzles will generate hours of mind-bending fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When two baby teeth came knocking at her door, artist Inhae Lee did what anyone would do: she invited them to live with her and started photographing their hilarious, miniature antics. The resulting blog phenomenon has captivated legions of devoted fans with its refreshingly sweet sentiment and hip appeal. Featuring brand-new stories alongside classic adventures, &lt;em&gt;My Milk Toof&lt;/em&gt; follows two baby teeth named ickle and Lardee as they navigate the pleasures and perils of being very small in a very big world. With perfect comedic timing, the photographic tales in this book explore the world from the tiny perspective of a baby tooth (or milk toof), from taking a bath to exploring the outside world. Showcasing the intricate handcrafted universe that Lee has created, &lt;em&gt;My Milk Toof&lt;/em&gt; has a quirky appeal that speaks to all ages. Whether they're baking a cake or spending a day at the pool, these two little guys are achingly sweetâbut without the cavities.</description>

  <description>Davidâs wife is dead. At least, he thinks sheâs dead. But he canât figure out what killed her or why she had to die, and his efforts to sort out whatâs happened have been interrupted by his discovery of a series of elaborate and escalating threats hidden in strange places around his homeâone buried in the sugar bag, another carved into the side of his television. These disturbing threats may be the best clues to his wifeâs death:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CURL UP ON MY LAP. LET ME BRUSH YOUR HAIR WITH MY FINGERS. I AM SINGING YOU A LULLABY. I AM TESTING FOR STRUCTURAL WEAKNESS IN YOUR SKULL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Chico is also on the case, and is intent on asking David questions he doesnât know the answers to and introducing him to people who donât appear to have Davidâs or his wifeâs best interests in mind. With no one to trust, David is forced to rely on his own memories and facultiesâbut they too are proving unreliable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;THREATS&lt;/em&gt;, Amelia Gray builds a world that is bizarre yet familiar, violent yet tender. It is an electrifying story of love and loss that grabs you on the first page and never loosens its grip.</description>

  <description>Roaming the natural and urban world with a camera for over 16 years, often alone, on foot and keeping a low profile, Ed Panar has repeatedly been caught in the act of photography--not by other people, but by a random assortment of familiar animals: cows, cats, frogs, dogs, turtles, deer, geese. The animal sees Ed; Ed sees the animal. An unspoken message passes between them. If the photographer is lucky, the moment is captured on film, cataloged and tagged for future reference. In "Animals That Saw Me (Volume One)," Panar brings together the first collection of his most surprising and unexpected encounters with ordinary beasts--a brief, beautifully deadpan field study of the uncanny moment of recognition between species. What exactly have these animals seen? Panar's photographs serve as a reminder that we must appear at least as strange to them as they do to us.</description>

  <description>Mister Bud is a dog of routine. He has wake up time, nap time, rest time, dinner time, etc. And everyone knows to follow his schedule. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then disaster strikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A stranger comes home at "make a fuss time" and throws everything off! Zorro is little bit bossy and Mister Bud wants nothing to do with him. But when the dogs discover they like the same things (like chasing the cat and napping), everything becomes more fun. As long as everyone follows the schedule.</description>

  <description>When Willy woke up there was trouble. Where was Bobo? Willy needs Bobo. But, Earl the cat likes Bobo, too. A favorite toy is hard to share&amp;amp;#8230;even when it&amp;amp;#8217;s a sock monkey. With sparse text and a modern-nostalgic vibe, this retro-fun book about friends (sock monkeys) and frenemies (devious cats) is an ode to favorite toys everywhere. Oh, Earl! Leave Bobo alone.</description>

  <description>Alaska, 1920: a brutal place to homestead, and especially tough for recent arrivals Jack and Mabel. Childless, they are drifting apart--he breaking under the weight of the work of the farm; she crumbling from loneliness and despair. In a moment of levity during the season's first snowfall, they build a child out of snow. The next morning the snow child is gone--but they glimpse a young, blonde-haired girl running through the trees. This little girl, who calls herself Faina, seems to be a child of the woods. She hunts with a red fox at her side, skims lightly across the snow, and somehow survives alone in the Alaskan wilderness. As Jack and Mabel struggle to understand this child who could have stepped from the pages of a fairy tale, they come to love her as their own daughter. But in this beautiful, violent place things are rarely as they appear, and what they eventually learn about Faina will transform all of them.</description>

  <description>Even in Space . . . Nature Finds a Way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a wrong turn into a black hole, the last hope for humanity crash lands on planet 58-B, a lush land where life is short and brutal for any but the most badass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;War rages on between the raptors and a race of part-scorpion, part-humans known as the Skjerdals. Conflicts between members of the sex-crazed crew run high as hearts are broken and heads decapitated. Will humanity's last hope ever get off of this planet, or is humanity's last stand to be taken sitting down? And what ancient horrors are the raptor shamans trying to raise with their strange wicker doll?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answers to these questions, and many others that you don't want to know the answers to, can only be answered by the GODS OF THE JUNGLE PLANET!</description>

  <description>Itâs been over six months since the eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano. Alex and Darla have been staying with Alexâs relatives, trying to cope with the new reality of the primitive world so vividly portrayed in &lt;em&gt;Ashfall,&lt;/em&gt; the first book in this series. Itâs also been six months of waiting for Alexâs parents to return from Iowa. Alex and Darla decide they can wait no longer and must retrace their journey into Iowa to find and bring back Alexâs parents to the tenuous safety of Illinois. But the landscape they cross is even more perilous than before, with life-and-death battles for food and power between the remaining communities. When the unthinkable happens, Alex must find new reserves of strength and determination to survive.</description>

  <description>Domo is the funny, square-ish, brown creature that began life as a mascot for a Japanese TV network, but who has blown up into a beloved international phenomenon. His fuzzy, grinning mug has appeared everywhere from plush toys to figurines, T-shirts to key-chains, as well as on more than one million fansites and on his official Facebook page, where he has made over 230,000 friends. But Domo has never had his own book . . . until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring original photography and haiku, &lt;em&gt;Domo in the World &lt;/em&gt;shows our plush hero making his way through the world, whether flying a kite (or is the kite flying him?), wooing a pillow that looks suspiciously familiar, or eating anything in sight. At last, thereâs a witty and quirky love letter to the inimitable little guy whoâs dug by fans of all ages around the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;Domo in the World&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âEntertaining silliness with a generous pinch of ironyâ&lt;br&gt;â&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;â&lt;em&gt;Domo in the World&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect introduction to the Domo phenomenonâand a real treat for his large preexisting fan base as well!â&lt;br&gt;Â â&lt;em&gt;MTV Geek&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Imagine that you are all alone in the sleeping city. In the darkness even the most familiar places take on a different aspect, sometimes beautiful, sometimes eerie and even frightening. Perhaps mysterious things are happening: a giant pterodactyl spreads its wings above the city; far below ghost riders stare from the windows of a long-lost subway car; paintings in a museum come to life. In this fascinating book, award-winning illustrator Stephen T. Johnson takes readers on a nocturnal adventure to an unseen world that just might exist.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;World Fantasy Award Winner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Michael Crawford is forced to flee when discovers his bride brutally murdered in their wedding bed. Yet it is not the revengeful townspeople he fears but the deadly embrace of the malignant spirit that is claiming him as her bridegroom.&lt;br&gt;Crawford will not travel alone; soon he is aided by his fellow victims, the greatest poets of his dayâByron, Keats, and Shelley. Together they embark upon a desperate journey, crisscrossing Europe and battling the vampiric fiend who seeks her ultimate pleasure in their ravaged bodies and imperiled souls.&lt;br&gt;Telling a secret history of passion and terror, Tim Powers (&lt;em&gt;The Anubis Gates&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Declare&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Three Days to Never&lt;/em&gt;) masterfully recasts the tragic lives of the Romantics into a uniquely frightening tale. Back in print for the first time since 1994, this newly revised edition of &lt;em&gt;The Stress of Her Regard&lt;/em&gt; will thrill both Powers fans and newcomers to this gripping Gothic tour de force.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Prentisstown isn't like other towns. Everyone can hear everyone else's thoughts in an overwhelming, never-ending stream of Noise. Just a month away from the birthday that will make him a man, Todd and his dog, Manchee -- whose thoughts Todd can hear too, whether he wants to or not -- stumble upon an area of complete silence. They find that in a town where privacy is impossible, something terrible has been hidden -- a secret so awful that Todd and Manchee must run for their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how do you escape when your pursuers can hear your every thought?&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;If Hugo Hippo and Bella Bird are going to make it to their costume party, they simply must learn to agree! A bright and cheerful picture book about friendship and compromise.&lt;/strong&gt;Hugo Hippo has a best bird. Bella Bird has a best hippo. They make a perfect pair, and they are going to the Fairy Tale Dress-Up party together, of course: Hugo will be the princess, and Bella will be the pea. &lt;p&gt;No, wait: &lt;em&gt;Bella&lt;/em&gt; will be the princess, and &lt;em&gt;Hugo&lt;/em&gt; will be the peaâ¦.No, the first way. No, the second way. Wait, now, &lt;em&gt;which &lt;/em&gt;way? If these two pals canât agree on who will be the pea, their party plan will fall to pieces. But when a couple of surprise compromises lead to a new costume solution, Hugo and Bella learn that sometimes it feels better to make someone else happy than to get your own wayâand that when it comes to friendship, theyâre two peas in a pod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Hugo and Bella mirror real-life give-and-take: Hippos and birds have symbiotic relationships in nature!&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So did his father before him, until he was gruesomely murdered by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father's mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. They follow legends and local lore, destroy the murderous dead, and keep pesky things like the future and friends at bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Searching for a ghost the locals call Anna Dressed in Blood, Cas expects the usual: track, hunt, kill. What he finds instead is a girl entangled in curses and rage, a ghost like he's never faced before. She still wears the dress she wore on the day of her brutal murder in 1958: once white, now stained red and dripping with blood. Since her death, Anna has killed any and every person who has dared to step into the deserted Victorian she used to call home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet she spares Cas's life.</description>

  <description>Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs back into his life - dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge - he follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After their all-nighter ends and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues - and they're for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer Q gets, the less Q sees the girl he thought he knew.</description>

  <description>The answer to &lt;em&gt;Porn for Women&lt;/em&gt;, this collection of 38 photographs of hot guys holding baby animals will have you laughing&amp;amp;mdash;both at the humorous pairings and at the brilliant simplicity of the idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you sick and tired of studly male models showing off their perfectly sculpted muscles? Have you had enough of cuddly baby animals flaunting their perfect newborn fuzzy cuteness? We didn't think so. Shirtless guys and puppy dog eyes take over with this collection of &lt;strong&gt;Hot Guys and Baby Animals&lt;/strong&gt; by Audrey Khuner and Carolyn Newman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hot Guys and Baby Animals&lt;/strong&gt; features photos of gorgeous guys and their fuzzy friends, along with tongue-in-cheek captions detailing the likes and dislikes of each guy and baby animal. Let the &amp;amp;quot;ohs&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;ahs&amp;amp;quot; begin as male models play with puppies, snuggle kittens, nuzzle lambs, and even coo at a few chicks (baby chickens, that is). Perhaps the Sundance Channel says it best in its review of the California calendar that started it all: &amp;amp;quot;Hot guys + baby animals = genius.&amp;amp;quot;</description>

  <description>A holiday-themed follow-up to the New York Times best-seller Cake Wrecks, Wreck the Halls features over 150 all new four-color, what-were-they-thinking cake wrecks from author and award-winning blogger Jen Yates. Cakewrecks.com receives over 4.6 million page views per month and is ranked one of the top humor blogs on the web.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning blogger Jen Yates has focused on confectionery calamities at her popular Web site &lt;a href="http://www.cakewrecks.blogspot.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.cakewrecks.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt; since May 2008, while her debut book, &lt;em&gt;Cake Wrecks: When Professional Cakes Go Hilariously Wrong&lt;/em&gt;, quickly climbed the charts to become a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-seller within weeks of its release. Now, Yates is back with &lt;em&gt;Wreck the Halls&lt;/em&gt;, a fresh mix of fan favorites and plenty of never-before-seen holiday wreckage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From thankless Thanksgiving turkeys and confusing Christmas conundrums, to less-than-happy Hanukkah horrors and New Year's meltdowns, &lt;em&gt;Wreck the Halls&lt;/em&gt; has an icing-smeared disaster for every occasion. With additional chapters on Black Friday, family communication, and navigating the murky waters of politically correct cake greetings (&amp;amp;quot;Winter!&amp;amp;quot;), &lt;em&gt;Wreck the Halls&lt;/em&gt; combines Yates's signature blend of wit and sarcasm with the most hilarious frosting fails this side of winter solstice. Find sweet relief from the holiday madness (not to mention plenty of laughs) with &lt;em&gt;Wreck the Halls&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>In this wry take on the post-apocalyptic horror novel, a pandemic has devastated the planet. The plague has sorted humanity into two types: the uninfected and the infected, the living and the living dead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the plague is receding, and Americans are busy rebuildÂ­ing civilization under orders from the provisional governÂ­ment based in Buffalo. Their top mission: the resettlement of Manhattan. Armed forces have successfully reclaimed the island south of Canal Streetâaka Zone Oneâbut pockets of plague-ridden squatters remain. While the army has eliminated the most dangerous of the infected, teams of civilian volunteers are tasked with clearing out a more innocuous varietyâthe âmalfunctioningâ stragglers, who exist in a catatonic state, transfixed by their former lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Spitz is a member of one of the civilian teams workÂ­ing in lower Manhattan. Alternating between flashbacks of Spitzâs desperate fight for survival during the worst of the outbreak and his present narrative, the novel unfolds over three surreal days, as it depicts the mundane mission of straggler removal, the rigors of Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder, and the impossible job of coming to grips with the fallen world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then things start to go wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both spine chilling and playfully cerebral, &lt;em&gt;Zone One&lt;/em&gt; brilÂ­liantly subverts the genreâs conventions and deconstructs the zombie myth for the twenty-first century.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Zombies have infested a fallen America. A young girl named Temple is on the run. Haunted by her past and pursued by a killer, Temple is surrounded by death and danger, hoping to be set free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty-five years, civilization has survived in meager enclaves, guarded against a plague of the dead. Temple wanders this blighted landscape, keeping to herself and keeping her demons inside her heart. She can't remember a time before the zombies, but she does remember an old man who took her in and the younger brother she cared for until the tragedy that set her on a personal journey toward redemption. Moving back and forth between the insulated remnants of society and the brutal frontier beyond, Temple must decide where ultimately to make a home and find the salvation she seeks.</description>

  <description>After the loss of his family farm, John Moon is a desperate man. A master hunter, his ability to poach game in-season or out is the only thing that stands between him and the soup kitchen line. Until Moon trespasses on the wrong land, hears a rustle in the brush, and fires a single fateful shot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the bloody trail, he comes upon a shocking scene: an illegal, deep woods campground filled with drugs, bundles of cash and the body of a dead young woman, killed by Moon's stray bullet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faced with an ultimate dilemma, Moon has to make a choice: does he take the money and ignore his responsibility for the girl's death? Or confess? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before he has a chance to decide, Moon finds himself on the run, pursued by those who think the money is theirs. Men who don't care about right and wrong and who want only one thing from John Moon: his body, face down in a ditch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matthew F. Jones' &lt;em&gt;A Single Shot&lt;/em&gt; is a rare, visionary thriller reminiscent of the work of Tom Franklin, Ron Rash, Daniel Woodrell, and Cormac McCarthy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Unavailable for twenty years, this harrowing allegory of obedience to authority is esteemed as âone of the defining literary texts of the post-Stalin period.â (&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in a remote Siberian depot immediately following the demolition of one of the gulagâs notorious camps and the emancipation of its prisoners, &lt;em&gt;Faithful Ruslan&lt;/em&gt; is an embittered &lt;em&gt;cri de coeur&lt;/em&gt; from a writer whose circumstances obliged him to resist the violence of arbitrary power. âEvery writer who writes anything in this country is made to feel he has committed a crime,â Georgi Vladimov said. &lt;em&gt;Dissident&lt;/em&gt;, he said, is a word that âthey force on you.â His mother, a victim of Stalinâs anti-Semitic policy, had been interred for two years in one of the camps from which Vladimov derived the wrenching detail of &lt;em&gt;Faithful Ruslan&lt;/em&gt;. The novel circulated in &lt;em&gt;samizdat&lt;/em&gt; for more than a decade, often attributed to Solzhenitsyn, before its publication in the West led to Vladimovâs harassment and exile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A starving stray, tortured and abandoned by the godlike âMasterâ whom he has unconditionally loved, Ruslan and his cadre of fellow guard dogs dutifully wait for the arrival of new prisonersâbut the unexpected arrival of a work party provokes a climactic bloodletting. Fashioned from the perceptions of an uncomprehending animal, Vladimovâs insistently ironic indictment of the gulag spirals to encompass all of Manâs inexplicable cruelty.</description>

      <![CDATA[oh, my god.<br />what a fantastic book. <br /><br />don't get me wrong, it is <strong>insanely</strong> sad, but for most of the book, it is sad in the way it is sad when you are still desperately in love with someone who has lost interest in you and moved on- there is a masochistic pleasure in the depths of your misery as you tai...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A charming, smart and hilarious debut novel about the tricky period between college graduation and moving out of your parentsâ house &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Stein, 26, captures the voice of the young 20-something prodigal daughter with the clarion call of authenticity in her debut novel. ... Steinâs light, accessible, self-deprecating prose makes this coming-of-age story a pleasure."â&lt;strong&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Beautiful, funny, thrilling and true."â &lt;strong&gt;Gary Shteyngart (Super Sad True Love Story)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just graduated from college, Esther Kohlerâs post-graduate plans include: returning to her parentsâ house, taking old prescription tranquilizers, hanging out with Jack, her unrequited high school crush, and re-reading her favorite childrenâs books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Estherâs parents decide she should do somethingâ anythingâwhile mulling her future. So they volunteer her to work as a nanny for their neighbors, the Browns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Itâs a tricky assignment: six months earlier, the Brownsâ youngest child had died. Still, as Esther finds herself falling in love with their surviving daughter May, sheâs impressed by how well they seem to be coping. And as Esther and her old high school flame resume a confusing relationship, she finds it easier to escape to the Browns' house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, though, she finds herself assuming the role of mother to May, confidante to Mayâs mother Amy, and partner in crime to Amyâs husband Nate.... And when these conflicting alliances inevitably collide, Esther is forced to create her own definition of who she really is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both witty and heartbreaking, &lt;em&gt;The Fallback Plan&lt;/em&gt; is a beautifully written and moving story of what we must leave behind, and what we manage to hold on to, as we navigate the treacherous terrain between youth and adulthood.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It could happen tomorrow . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An electromagnetic pulse flashes across the sky, destroying every electronic device, wiping out every computerized system, and killing billions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex hiked into the woods to say good-bye to her dead parents and her personal demons. Now desperate to find out what happened after the pulse crushes her to the ground, Alex meets up with Tomâa young soldierâand Ellie, a girl whose grandfather was killed by the EMP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this improvised family and the others who are spared, itâs now a question of who can be trusted and who is no longer human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Ilsa J. Bick crafts a terrifying and thrilling post-apocalyptic novel about a world that could become ours at any moment, where those left standing must learn what it means not just to survive, but to live amidst the devastation.</description>

  <description>Tom Franklin's narrative power and flair for characterization have been compared to the likes of Harper Lee, Flannery O'Connor, Elmore Leonard, and Cormac McCarthy. &lt;p&gt;Now the Edgar Award-winning author returns with his most accomplished and resonant novel so far; an atmospheric drama set in rural Mississippi. In the late 1970s, Larry Ott and Silas "32" Jones were boyhood pals. Their worlds were as different as night and day: Larry, the child of lower-middle-class white parents, and Silas, the son of a poor, single black mother. Yet for a few months the boys stepped outside of their circumstances and shared a special bond. But then tragedy struck: Larry took a girl on a date to a drive-in movie, and she was never heard from again. She was never found and Larry never confessed, but all eyes rested on him as the culprit. The incident shook the countyâ and perhaps Silas most of all. His friendship with Larry was broken, and then Silas left town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than twenty years have passed. Larry, a mechanic, lives a solitary existence, never able to rise above the whispers of suspicion. Silas has returned as a constable. He and Larry have no reason to cross paths until another girl disappears and Larry is blamed again. And now the two men who once called each other friend are forced to confront the past they've buried and ignored for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"Pancakes are a luxury, like smoking marijuana or having sex. Thatâs why I came up with the names Ho Cakes and Slutty Cakes. These are extra decadent, but in a way, every pancake is a Ho Cake.â Thus speaks Kenny Shopsin, legendary (and legendarily eccentric, ill-tempered, and lovable) chef and owner of the Greenwich Village restaurant (and institution), Shopsinâs, which has been in existence since 1971.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kenny has finally put together his 900-plus-item menu and his unique philosophyâimagine Elizabeth David crossed with Richard Pryorâto create &lt;em&gt;Eat Me&lt;/em&gt;, the most profound and profane cookbook youâll ever read. His rantsâon everything from how the customer is not always right to the art of griddling; from how to run a small, ethical, and humane business to how we all should learn to cook in a &lt;em&gt;Goodnight Moon &lt;/em&gt;world where everything you need is already in your own home and headâwill leave you stunned or laughing or hungry. Or all of the above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more than 120 recipes including such perfect comfort foods as High School Hot Turkey Sandwiches, Cuban Bean Polenta Melt, and Cornmeal-Fried Green Tomatoes with Comeback Sauce, plus the best soups, egg dishes, and hamburgers youâve ever eaten, &lt;em&gt;Eat Me &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;em&gt;White Trash Cooking &lt;/em&gt;for the twenty-first century, as unforgettable and mind-boggling as its author.</description>

  <description>Photographers Arne Svenson and Ron Warren--co-authors of the popular "Sock Monkeys"--here turn their attention to those masses of slobbered-over yarn, remnants and stuffing that ordinarily go the way of all pet toy casualties and get discarded without a second glance. Before their lenses, once-plush cuddly creatures and formerly bouncy rubber toys are transformed into intriguing eyeless, armless, one-legged sculptures--snatched, from the jaws, so to speak, of oblivion. A headless bunny rabbit, mutated plastic rat, masticated rubber hotdog or donut--each is a beloved pet's dream companion, transfigured by the sharp teeth and powerful jaws of the overinfatuated animal. Svenson and Warren have photographed the chewed victims in a formal yet irreverent style appropriate to the perspective of the pet; the result is a humorous appraisal of beauty, devotion and contentment. With more than 130 full-color photographs, "Chewed" includes delightful, twisted and poignant short stories by a variety of contributors writing about their favorite chewed creature, including writer Augusten Burroughs; artists Roz Chast, Maira Kalman, Rick Meyerowitz and William Wegman; designers Isaac Mizrahi and Todd Oldham; and food-world personality Andrew Zimmern.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Animals should definitely &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; wear clothing.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt; ...because a snake would lose it, a billy goat would eat it for lunch, and it would always be wet on a walrus! This well-loved book by Judi and Ron Barrett shows the very youngest why animals' clothing is perfect...just as it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Summers span decades. Winter can last a lifetime. And the struggle for the Iron Throne has begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Warden of the north, Lord Eddard Stark counts it a curse when King Robert bestows on him the office of the Hand. His honour weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will, not what he must â¦ and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The old gods have no power in the south, Starkâs family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, the vengeance-mad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities. He claims the Iron Throne.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;âThe best biography of Lord Byron ever written,â according to Poet Laureate W. S. Merwin, is now back in print after decades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of the hundreds of books on Byron and his work, not one has been devoted to the immediate aftermath of his life; and yet it is these first twenty posthumous years that yield the most unexpected and exciting discoveries about the character of the poet and the behavior of those who once surrounded himâwife, sister, friends, enemies.&lt;br&gt;Â Â  With the burning of his memoirs almost as soon as news of his death reach England in May 1924, there began the sequence of impassioned controversies that have followed one another like the links in a chain ever since. What sort of man was the begetter of these dramas? Unflagging in energy and acumen, Doris Lang- ley Moore sifts the various witnesses, their motives and credentials, and not only reveals how much questionable evidence has been accepted but develops a corrected picture that appeals and persuades.&lt;br&gt;Â Â  Drawing upon a very large amount of unpublished material, from the Lovelace Papers, Murray manuscripts, and Hobhouse archives, she reaches the conclusion that, as to his chroniclers, a great man has too often fallen among thieves. The story she tells needs no special knowledge of Byron. It is written for everyone who enjoys literary detective work and human drama.</description>

  <description>"A perfect translation of a near-perfect novella of bourgeois adultery and guilt."âJonathan Bate, &lt;em&gt;Times Literary Supplement&lt;/em&gt;, Book of the Year 2010&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding her comfortable bourgeois existence as wife and mother predictable after eight years of marriage, Irene Wagner brings a little excitement into it by starting an affair with a rising young pianist. Her lover's former mistress begins blackmailing her, threatening to give her secret away to her husband. Irene is soon in the grip of agonizing fear.Written in the spring of 1913, and first published in 1920, this novella is one of Stefan Zweig's most powerful studies of a woman's mind and emotions. La Paura (1954) the Roberto Rossellini film based on the Stefan Zweig novel Fear was the last of the extraordinary features in which Rossellini directed Ingrid Bergman, his wife.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>Creepy-Ass Dolls is full of twisted little porcelain and plastic playmates with chilling thoughts, sinister plans, and disturbing enjoyments. This book offers a glimpse into the secret life of dolls with a yearbook approach--not only based around portrait photos, but also what the dolls are "most likely" to do, personal mottos and quotes, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fun and kooky book sheds light on the otherwise unknown lives of these creepy little playmates. Remember, there's a reason they were kept in a toy box.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Stacey Brooks is a graphic designer and freelance artist, and is the co-founder of G.H.O.S.T (Ghosts, Hauntings, and Other Strange Things) Paranormal Society...and she keeps the door to her doll room boarded up at all times.</description>

  <description>The fifty contestants in the Miss Teen Dream pageant thought this was going to be a fun trip to the beach, where they could parade in their state-appropriate costumes and compete in front of the cameras. But sadly, their airplane had another idea, crashing on a desert island and leaving the survivors stranded with little food, little water, and practically no eyeliner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's a beauty queen to do? Continue to practice for the talent portion of the program - or wrestle snakes to the ground? Get a perfect tan - or learn to run wild? And what should happen when the sexy pirates show up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the heart of non-exfoliated darkness. Your tour guide? None other than Libba Bray, the hilarious, sensational, Printz Award-winning author of A Great and Terrible Beauty and Going Bovine. The result is a novel that will make you laugh, make you think, and make you never see beauty the same way again.</description>

  <description>A macabre mash-up of the childrenâs classic &lt;em&gt;Pat the Bunny&lt;/em&gt;Â and the present-day zombie phenomenon, with the tactile features of the original book revoltingly re-imagined for an adult audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the hemorrhagic vein of other zombie parodies, &lt;em&gt;Pat the Zombie&lt;/em&gt; presents trusting toddler Judy playing peek-a-boo with a putrefying Paul. Grownup fans of &lt;em&gt;Pat the Bunny&lt;/em&gt; (seven million of them) will find their favorite touch-and-feel features disturbingly re-created: Judy reaches for Zombieâs decaying jaw instead of daddyâs cheek; Paul caresses Mummyâs empty eye socket instead of her wedding ring. Ximmâs twisted wit, Soofiâs sick artistic sensibility, and clever packaging that mimics the original book will bring the undead lurchingly to life in this camp popculture romp.</description>

  <description>Under the bubbling hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone National Park is a supervolcano. Most people don't know it's there. The caldera is so large that it can only be seen from a plane or satellite. It just could be overdue for an eruption, which would change the landscape and climate of our planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Alex, being left alone for the weekend means having the freedom to play computer games and hang out with his friends without hassle from his mother. Then the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, plunging his hometown into a nightmare of darkness, ash, and violence. Alex begins a harrowing trek to seach for his family and finds help in Darla, a travel partner he meets along the way. Together they must find the strength and skills to survive and outlast an epic disaster.</description>

  <description>The astonishing saga of polar explorer Ernest Shackleton's survival for over a year on the ice-bound Antarctic seas, as Time magazine put it, "defined heroism." Alfred Lansing's scrupulously researched and brilliantly narrated book -- with over 200,000 copies sold -- has long been acknowledged as the definitive account of the Endurance's fateful trip. To write their authoritative story, Lansing consulted with ten of the surviving members and gained access to diaries and personal accounts by eight others. The resulting book has all the immediacy of a first-hand account, expanded with maps and illustrations especially for this edition.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Dad has warned Henry and Eve: If you whine too much, monsters will eat you. Henry and Eve donât listen, of course. The only problem is, when the monster comes, he canât find the right recipe for whiny childrenâand neither can his monster friends! A whiny child salad doesnât work because thereâs paprika in the dressing. A whiny child cake wonât do because the flour spills all over the floor. And whiny child burgers are out of the question because the grill is too hard to light up. Arguments and hilarity ensue. And just when our persnickety monsters decide on the perfect dishâ¦the worst thing of all happensâ¦.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A tale of malevolence and violence set in rural West Virginia, the locale Benedict has made his own, dogs of god tells of Tannhauser, a crazed backwoodsman turned tyrannical drug lord, and the odd cast of characters - gun runners, federal agents, corrupt cops, local eccentrics, drifters - enticed into his destructive orbit. Innocently into their midst comes a young man called Goody, whose reputation as a formidable amateur boxer pits him against one of Tannhauser's goons in a bare-fisted boxing match - a fight that Goody realizes too late will require more than just a knockout to win. As in all of Benedict's fiction, the writing is explosive and colorful, full of the rhythms of Appalachian speech, and the action takes place on the unsettling border between the absurd and the terrifying. dogs of god unquestionably proves what so many have already said: that Pinckney Benedict is one of the outstanding voices of his generation.</description>

  <description>Just when seventeen-year-old Cullen Witter thinks he understands everything about his small and painfully dull Arkansas town, it all disappears. . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer before Cullen's senior year, a nominally-depressed birdwatcher named John Barling thinks he spots a species of woodpecker thought to be extinct since the 1940s in Lily, Arkansas. His rediscovery of the so-called Lazarus Woodpecker sparks a flurry of press and woodpecker-mania. Soon all the kids are getting woodpecker haircuts and everyone's eating "Lazarus burgers." But as absurd as the town's carnival atmosphere has become, nothing is more startling than the realization that Cullenâs sensitive, gifted fifteen-year-old brother Gabriel has suddenly and inexplicably disappeared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Cullen navigates his way through a summer of finding and losing love, holding his fragile family together, and muddling his way into adulthood, a young missionary in Africa, who has lost his faith, is searching for any semblance of meaning wherever he can find it. As distant as the two stories seem at the start, they are thoughtfully woven ever closer together and through masterful plotting, brought face to face in a surprising and harrowing climax. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complex but truly extraordinary, tinged with melancholy and regret, comedy and absurdity, this novel finds wonder in the ordinary and emerges as ultimately hopeful. It's about a lot more than what Cullen calls, âthat damn bird.â Itâs about the dream of second chances.</description>

  <description>Shudder as you stitch&amp;amp;#226;&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#166;ZOMBIES A ARE CULT FAVORITE with a lot of projects in 2010 and beyond for books and movies. Charming, easy-to-make, and undead, Zombie Felties contains 16 irresistibly haunting projects to celebrate the zombie zeitgeist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicola Tedman and Sarah Skeate awaken their inner George A. Romero and focus their creative attention on the malleable, fuzzy softness of felt inside &lt;em&gt;Zombie Felties: How to Raise 16 Gruesome Felt Creatures from the Undead&lt;/em&gt;. Inside, crafters will find instructions for more than 15 zombie creatures, including a Romero-esque Day of the Dead Zombie. Additional Zombie Feltie projects include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Zombie Bride&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Zombie Puppy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Vampire Zombie&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Zombie Bunny&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Folklore Zombie&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Zombie Surfer, and more!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With only the most basic of sewing skills, crafters can raise their own macabre multitude of &lt;em&gt;Zombie Feltie&lt;/em&gt; creations from the undead with an average construction time of less than one hour per pattern. Each design includes a full-color photograph of the finished project, as well as an illustrated, instructional overview, pattern diagrams, and a convenient list of everything needed to complete the project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zombie Feltie&lt;/em&gt; friends can be customized with limitless embellishments and they make great Halloween decorations, party favors, finger puppets, key rings, and even mobile phone mascots. Get ready to shudder as you stitch!</description>

  <description>The year is 1911. In Cold Spring Harbour, New York, the newly formed Eugenics Records Office is sending its agents to catalogue the infirm, the insane, and the criminal - with an eye to a cull, for the betterment of all. Near Cracked Wheel, Montana, a terrible illness leaves Jason Thistledown an orphan, stranded in his dead mother's cabin until the spring thaw shows him the true meaning of devastation - and the barest thread of hope. At the edge of the utopian mill town of Eliada, Idaho, Doctor Andrew Waggoner faces a Klansman's noose and glimpses wonder in the twisting face of the patient known only as Mister Juke. And deep in a mountain lake overlooking that town, something stirs, and thinks, in its way: Things are looking up. Eutopia follows Jason and Andrew as together and alone, they delve into the secrets of Eliada - industrialist Garrison Harper's attempt to incubate a perfect community on the edge of the dark woods and mountains of northern Idaho. What they find reveals the true, terrible cost of perfection - the cruelty of the surgeon's knife - the folly of the cull - and a monstrous pact with beings that use perfection as a weapon, and faith as a trap.</description>

  <description>Orphaned Kit Tyler knows, as she gazes for the first time at the cold, bleak shores of Connecticut Colony, that her new home will never be like the shimmering Caribbean island she left behind. In her relatives' stern Puritan community, she feels like a tropical bird that has flown to the wrong part of the world, a bird that is now caged and lonely. The only place where Kit feels completely free is in the meadows, where she enjoys the company of the old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond, and on occasion, her young sailor friend Nat. But when Kit's friendship with the "witch" is discovered, Kit is faced with suspicion, fear, and anger. She herself is accused of witchcraft!</description>

  <description>Some bears will go to any length to get some honey. This one recruits every animal that comes along to form, well, a stack. The result? Tail of the duck to the gluteus maximus of the duck-billed platypus (with many other rears in between). Readers will giggle with delight at the bird's eye view of some hysterical animal bottoms. Follow this back-sided journey up the tree - where the real surprise awaits. The pairing of Black's minimal text with Hawkes's visual story line will keep you chuckling from the bottom up.</description>

  <description>In this lyrical, absorbing, award-winning novel, nothing is as it seems, and every clue leads to more questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At age eleven, Taylor Markham was abandoned by her mother. At fourteen, she ran away from boarding school, only to be tracked down and brought back by a mysterious stranger. Now seventeen, Taylor's the reluctant leader of her school's underground community, whose annual territory war with the Townies and visiting Cadets has just begun. This year, though, the Cadets are led by Jonah Griggs, and Taylor can't avoid his intense gaze for long. To make matters worse, Hannah, the one adult Taylor trusts, has disappeared. But if Taylor can piece together the clues Hannah left behind, the truth she uncovers might not just settle her past, but also change her future.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Feel Better, Little Buddy&lt;/em&gt; is a great get-well gift for kids with boo-boos, friends on the mend, and anyone who needs a little love and healing inspiration. Julia Segal follows a menagerie of absolutely adorable pets as they recover from their injuriesâwith stories about the "uh-oh" moments that led to the casts and follow-up visits with the fully recovered patients. Dudley the dog, Waffle the rabbit, Thistle the hedgehog, Mariah the sloth, and George the kitten are just a few of the irresistible creatures whose feats of derring-do (and the necessary recoveries) make up this sweet book.</description>

  <description>âWe are all walking around this city with our hearts sadly swimming in our chests, like dying fish on the surface of a still pond. Itâs enough to make you give up entirely.â &lt;strong&gt;âfrom &lt;em&gt;Instant Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we donât give up. We keep trying. Weâre either too stupid to learn from our mistakes or we honestly believe that the next time will be different; itâs hard to say which. Driven by the mad hopefulness that is part of the human condition, we are constantly falling in and out of love with a slightly different version of the person who came before. Jami Attenberg chronicles those exact moments with heartbreaking realism in her powerful debut, &lt;em&gt;Instant Love&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told through the eyes of three young women and their friends and lovers,&lt;em&gt; Instant Love&lt;/em&gt; explores what it means to be in love, what it means to be lonely, and what it means to be both at the same time. Holly turns to computer dating to find love even as she thinks wistfully of a former boyfriend who loved her well and fed her ice cream. Maggie recounts the story of her one crazy summer to her disbelieving husband and feels the distance between them grow wider than the void across their king-sized bed. And Sarah Lee remembers the one who got away and the one she ran away from, all the while moving toward the one she can actually love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Holly, Maggie, and Sarah Lee move through the rituals of modern love, they have to decide who is worth taking a chance on in a world where things donât fall into place easily, people are often difficult, and disappointment is the rule. Through their stories, Attenberg presents a rare, honest look at love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also available as an eBook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>In a peaceful neighbourhood, two little girls are born five days apart. Lucie lives with her mother, Aurore, who struggles to make ends meet; Claire lives with her wealthy mother, Suzanne, who struggles to make her marriage work. The girls are inseparable. For 10 years, Aurore weaves a rich skein of tales for Lucie and Claire. Then, when the girls turn 15, Aurore tells the final tale in her tapestry, and disappears forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several years later, Lucie gives birth to a little girl, Odyssee, and she and Claire take turns telling stories to the child. But one day something unspeakable happens. Into the terrible silence, a woman without a name wanders, trying to find the broken pieces of herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Breakwater House&lt;/em&gt; is the story of the complex love between mothers, daughters, and friends. With this thrilling puzzle of a novel, Governor General's Literary Award winner and Giller Prize nominee Pascale Quiviger shows that she is a writer who is capable of combining stylistic brilliance, philosophical depth, and sheer un-put-downable storytelling.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the 2010 John Newbery Medal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four mysterious letters change Mirandaâs world forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;By sixth grade, Miranda and her best friend, Sal, know how to navigate their New York City neighborhood. They know where itâs safe to go, like the local grocery store, and they know whom to avoid, like the crazy guy on the corner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But things start to unravel. Sal gets punched by a new kid for what seems like no reason, and he shuts Miranda out of his life. The apartment key that Mirandaâs mom keeps hidden for emergencies is stolen. And then Miranda finds a mysterious note scrawled on a tiny slip of paper: &lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am coming to save your friendâs life, and my own. &lt;br&gt;I must ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The notes keep coming, and Miranda slowly realizes that whoever is leaving them knows all about her, including things that have not even happened yet. Each message brings her closer to believing that only she can prevent a tragic death. Until the final note makes her think sheâs too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Better than a cold shower-and aÂ lot funnier. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Choke the chicken, spank the monkey, charm the snake-however you refer to it, none of the images in this book will encourage you to pleasure yourself. This deceptively simple and strangely addictive book presents a laugh-out-loud collection of random pictures virtually guaranteed to dampen the urge of even the strongest libido.&lt;br&gt; Â </description>

  <description>A history teacher begins his unorthodox senior course with clips from an ominous surveillance video, causing a student's home life to deteriorate along with the lessons. A girl with a second head that changes into different historical and fictional identities tries to find her father while figuring out how to handle Mom and the book club. A blog documents society's slow, unexplained, but inexorable end, or is it only a collection of pixel-sized paranoia? A once-awkward teen holes up in a kiddie-themed amusement park after the end of the world, and schemes to take Cinderella's Castle by force. This collection by Paul G. Tremblay (author of The Little Sleep and No Sleep Till Wonderland) features fifteen stories of fear and paranoia, stories of apocalypses both societal and personal, and stories of longing and coping.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hotly anticipated third novel of the Dublin murder squad from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Back in 1985, Frank Mackey was nineteen, growing up poor in Dublin's inner city, and living crammed into a small flat with his family on Faithful Place. But he had his sights set on a lot more. He and Rosie Daly were all ready to run away to London together, get married, get good jobs, break away from factory work and poverty and their old lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But on the winter night when they were supposed to leave, Rosie didn't show. Frank took it for granted that she'd dumped him-probably because of his alcoholic father, nutcase mother, and generally dysfunctional family. He never went home again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Neither did Rosie. Everyone thought she had gone to England on her own and was over there living a shiny new life. Then, twenty-two years later, Rosie's suitcase shows up behind a fireplace in a derelict house on Faithful Place, and Frank is going home whether he likes it or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Getting sucked in is a lot easier than getting out again. Frank finds himself straight back in the dark tangle of relationships he left behind. The cops working the case want him out of the way, in case loyalty to his family and community makes him a liability. Faithful Place wants him out because he's a detective now, and the Place has never liked cops. Frank just wants to find out what happened to Rosie Daly-and he's willing to do whatever it takes, to himself or anyone else, to get the job done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Quite possibly the best birth control on the market, &lt;em&gt;Sh*t My Kids Ruined &lt;/em&gt;is a pictorial tribute to the filthy, distasteful, gross, and painful moments of parenthood, and the children who make it all possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; Kids: they are the light of your lifeâand the enemy of all things fragile, intact, and clean. But why cry over spilt milk . . . or paint . . . or the entire contents of a full-size swimming pool? A testament to the messiness of childhood (and parenting), and a memorial to the household items that perished along the way, here are never-before-seen photos and outrageous stories of VCRs jammed with toys, toilets clogged with clothes, and furniture accented with permanent marker. Torn-up computer keyboards and torn-out hair, botched family photos and mustard-covered treadmillsânothing is off limits to your darling, destructive offspring. So raise a broken glass and embrace the madness, because laughter is the only surefire way to keep your sh*t together.</description>

  <description>Meet Manny. He's your average shut-in with a penchant for late night television and looting local fountains for coins. With eight locks on his door and newspapers covering his windows, he's more than a bit paranoid too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wasn't a great life, but it was comfortable-at least it was until the morning he awoke with an egg between his legs. But what might have been a curse becomes a charm as this unlikely event leads him to all night diner, where he finds inedible pie, undrinkable coffee, and the girl of his dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can this unexpected chance at love survive after the egg cracks and time itself turns against him, dead-set on rerouting history and putting a shovel to the face of the one person who could bring real and lasting change to Manny's world?</description>

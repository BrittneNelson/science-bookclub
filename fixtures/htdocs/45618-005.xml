  <description>The crumbling summerhouse called Wild Fell, soaring above the desolate shores of Blackmore Island, has weathered the violence of the seasons for more than a century. Built for his family by a 19th-century politician of impeccable rectitude, the house has kept its terrible secrets and its darkness sealed within its walls. For a hundred years, the townspeople of Alvina have prayed that the darkness inside Wild Fell would stay there, locked away from the light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jameson Browning, a man well acquainted with suffering, has purchased Wild Fell with the intention of beginning a new life, of letting in the light. But what waits for him at the house is devoted to its darkness and guards it jealously. It has been waiting for Jameson his whole life . . . or even longer. And now, at long last, it has found him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the Sunburst and Aurora Award-nominated author of &lt;em&gt;Enter, Night&lt;/em&gt; comes an unforgettable contemporary ghost story in the classic tradition of Henry James’s &lt;em&gt;The Turn of the Screw&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; comes a thrilling and scary young adult novel about blurred reality where characters in a story find that a deadly and horrifying world exists in the space between the written lines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Emma Lindsay has problems: a head full of metal, no parents, a crazy artist for a guardian whom a stroke has turned into a vegetable, and all those times when she blinks away, dropping into other lives so ghostly and surreal it's as if the story of her life bleeds into theirs. But one thing Emma has never doubted is that she's real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she writes "White Space," a story about these kids stranded in a spooky house during a blizzard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, "White Space" turns out to be a dead ringer for part of an unfinished novel by a long-dead writer. The manuscript, which she's never seen, is a loopy &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Inkheart&lt;/em&gt; story in which characters fall out of different books and jump off the page. Thing is, when Emma blinks, she might be doing the same and, before long, she's dropped into the very story she thought she'd written. Trapped in a weird, snow-choked valley, Emma meets other kids with dark secrets and strange abilities: Eric, Casey, Bode, Rima, and a very special little girl, Lizzie. What they discover is that they--and Emma--may be nothing more than characters written into being from an alternative universe for a very specific purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now what they must uncover is why they've been brought to this place--a world between the lines where parallel realities are created and destroyed and nightmares are written--before someone pens their end.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From one of &lt;em&gt;Granta&lt;/em&gt;'s Best Young British Novelists, a stunningly insightful, emotionally powerful new novel about an outsider haunted by an inescapable past: a story of loneliness and survival, guilt and loss, and the power of forgiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Jake Whyte is living on her own in an old farmhouse on a craggy British island, a place of ceaseless rains and battering winds. Her disobedient collie, Dog, and a flock of sheep are her sole companions, which is how she wanted it to be. But every few nights something—or someone—picks off one of the sheep and sets off a new deep pulse of terror. There are foxes in the woods, a strange boy and a strange man, rumors of an obscure, formidable beast. But there is also Jake's past—hidden thousands of miles away and years ago, held in the silences about her family and the scars that stripe her back—a past that threatens to break into the present. With exceptional artistry and empathy, &lt;em&gt;All the Birds, Singing&lt;/em&gt; reveals an isolated life in all its struggles and stubborn hopes, unexpected beauty, and hard-won redemption.</description>

  <description>From the author of the&lt;em&gt; New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Eleanor &amp;amp; Park&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath is a Simon Snow fan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Cath, being a fan is her life — and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Cath, the question is: Can she do this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</description>

  <description>A departure from the stories Elizabeth Gaskell wrote for Charles Dickens’s &lt;em&gt;Household Words&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;em&gt;, The Poor Clare&lt;/em&gt; is a dark, gothic novella of thwarted love and a family curse that vividly illustrates the social tensions of Victorian England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The purposeful slaying of lonely Bridget’s beloved dog unleashes a torrent of rage that surges down through the generations. In her desire for revenge, Bridget utters a fearsome curse upon the dog’s killer: All that the murderer loves most, he will lose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This haunting story of “the sins of the father being visited upon the children” brilliantly shows off Gaskell’s pioneering understanding of the tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and the harsh realities of class society. &lt;em&gt;The Poor Clare&lt;/em&gt; stands as an innovative and exciting gem in Elizabeth Gaskell’s oeuvre.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Steve Rasnic Tem's new novel &lt;em&gt;Blood Kin&lt;/em&gt; is set in the southern Appalachians of the U.S., alternating between the 1930s and the present day. It's a dark Southern Gothic vision of ghosts, witchcraft, secret powers, snake-handling, Kudzu, Melungeons, and the Great Depression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Kin&lt;/em&gt; is told from the dual points of view of &lt;strong&gt;Michael Gibson&lt;/strong&gt; and of his grandmother &lt;strong&gt;Sadie&lt;/strong&gt;. Michael has returned to the quiet Appalachian home of his forebears following a suicide attempt and now takes care of his grandmother; old and sickly but with an important story to tell about growing up poor and Melungeon (a mixed race group of mysterious origin) while bedeviled by a snake-handling uncle and empathic powers she but barely understands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In a field not far from the Gibson family home lies an iron-bound crate within a small shack buried four feet deep under Kudzu vine. Michael somehow understands that hidden inside that crate is potentially his own death, his grandmother's death, and perhaps the deaths of everyone in the valley if he does not come to understand her story well enough.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Burden Hill—a picturesque little town adorned with white picket fences and green, green grass, home to a unique team of paranormal investigators. Beneath this shiny exterior, Burden Hill harbors dark and sinister secrets, and it’s up to a heroic gang of dogs—and one cat—to protect the town from the evil forces at work. These are the Beasts of Burden Hill—Pugs, Ace, Jack, Whitey, Red and the Orphan—whose early experiences with the paranormal (including a haunted doghouse, a witches’ coven, and a pack of canine zombies) have led them to become members of the Wise Dog Society, official animal agents sworn to protect their town from evil. This turns out to be no easy task, as they soon encounter demonic cannibal frogs, tortured spirits, a secret rat society, and a bizarre and deadly resurrection in the Burden Hill cemetery—events which lead to fear and heartbreak as our four-legged heroes discover that the evil within Burden Hill is growing and on the move. Can our heroes overcome these supernatural menaces? Can evil be bested by a paranormal team that doesn’t have hands? And even more importantly, will Pugs ever shut the hell up?</description>

  <description>The Asherah has finally reached Zehava, the long-promised planet. There, Terra finds harsh conditions and a familiar foe—Aleksandra Wolff, leader of her ship’s rebel forces. Terra and Aleksandra first lock horns with each other . . . but soon realize they face a much more dangerous enemy in violent alien beasts—and alien hunters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Terra finally discovers Vadix. The boy who has haunted her dreams may be their key to survival—but his own dark past has yet to be revealed. And when Aleksandra gets humanity expelled from the planet, it’s up to Terra, with Vadix by her side, to unite her people—and to forge an alliance with the alien hosts, who want nothing more than to see humanity gone forever.</description>

  <description>In the end, the zombie apocalypse was nothing more than a waste disposal problem. Burn them in giant ovens? Bad optics. Bury them in landfill sites? The first attempt created acres of twitching, roiling mud. The acceptable answer is to jettison the millions of immortal automatons into orbit. Soon earth’s near space is a mesh of bodies interfering with the sunlight and having an effect on our minds that we never saw coming. Aggressive hypochondria, rampant depressive disorders, irresistible suicidal thought—resulting in teenage suicide cults, who want nothing more than to orbit the earth as living dead. Life on earth has slowly become not worth living. And death is no longer an escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;em&gt;The n-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horror can be a hard thing to recommend. What might be standard fare for one reader is far beyond the boundaries of another, and &lt;em&gt;The n-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt; gleefully probes and pulls apart whatever comfort zones it encounters. With a fresh take on the undead genre and excellent execution—horror delivered with all the craft of literary fiction—the book is a finely wrought and exciting work, but one that has the capacity to disarm, disgust and profoundly distress. For a test of literary hard limits, and an exploration of the darker aspects of the human imagination, &lt;em&gt;The n-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt; excels. Just as the post-cataclysmic world Burgess builds creates a crucible in which the human mind is melted down, the reading experience is similarly harrowing. It’s a novel that’s inflicted upon the reader. —&lt;em&gt;National Post&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>"&lt;em&gt;To sell a book, you need a description on the back. So here's mine: My name is Fiona Loomis. I was born on August 11, 1977. I am recording this message on the morning of October 13, 1989. Today I am thirteen years old. Not a day older. Not a day younger&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiona Loomis is Alice, back from Wonderland. She is Lucy, returned from Narnia. She is Coraline, home from the Other World. She is the girl we read about in storybooks, but here's the difference: She is real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twelve-year-old Alistair Cleary is her neighbor in a town where everyone knows each other. One afternoon, Fiona shows up at Alistair's doorstep with a strange proposition. She wants him to write her biography. What begins as an odd vanity project gradually turns into a frightening glimpse into a clearly troubled mind. For Fiona tells Alistair a secret. In her basement there's a gateway and it leads to the magical world of Aquavania, the place where stories are born. In Aquavania, there's a creature called the Riverman and he's stealing the souls of children. Fiona's soul could be next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alistair has a choice. He can believe her, or he can believe something else...something even more terrifying.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An enthralling debut novel about a teenage girl who finds refuge--but perhaps not--in an 1840s Shaker community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this exquisite, transporting debut, 15-year-old Polly Kimball sets fire to the family farm, killing her abusive father. She and her young brother find shelter in a Massachusetts Shaker community called The City of Hope. It is the Era of Manifestations, when young girls in Shaker enclaves all across the Northeast are experiencing extraordinary mystical visions, earning them the honorific of "Visionist" and bringing renown to their settlements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The City of Hope has not yet been blessed with a Visionist, but that changes when Polly arrives and is unexpectedly exalted. As she struggles to keep her dark secrets concealed in the face of increasing scrutiny, Polly finds herself in a life-changing friendship with a young Shaker sister named Charity, a girl who will stake everything--including her faith--on Polly's honesty and purity.</description>

  <description>Within the whacked-out worlds of these twisted tales, only one thing remains the same:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything is better when laced with the tears of a clown…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a sexually adventurous couple decides to spice things up by bringing bees into the mix, they learn it’s never wise to dial 811 in case of an emergency. A deadbeat dad gains employment as a lady-in-waiting in a fairytale bromance where every character looks exactly like someone else from John Carpenter’s The Thing. The unknowing victim of a cruel prank, a simpleton spends his entire life waiting on a park bench for the hottest girl in school. Using only his twenty-sided die and good old-fashioned D&amp;amp;D magic, a man must continually resurrect the neighborhood kid regularly murdered on his own front lawn. An aging slaughterhouse worker and the iconic figure from Edvard Munch’s The Scream hit the clubs every weekend in a vain attempt to get laid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These and many more absurdities await in Clown Tear Junkies, the debut collection from Douglas Hackle.</description>

  <description>“One hot summer day, Michael Salter, nineteen-year-old scion of a posh Highland family, disappears. When his childlike aunt claims she drowned him during a fight, the family close ranks. No police. No memorial service. No titbits for village gossips. A decade of deceit begins.” — &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Salter family orbits around Peattie House, their crumbling Scottish highlands estate filled with threadbare furniture, patrician memories, and all their inevitable secrets. While gathered to celebrate grandmother's seventieth birthday, someone breaks the silence. The web begins to unravel. But what is the white lie? How many others are built upon it? How many lives have been shaped by its shadow? Only one person knows the whole truth. From beyond the grave, Michael loops back into the past until we see, beyond perception and memory, how deeply our decisions resound, and just what is the place—and price—of grandeur.</description>

  <description>Limited to 400 copies, this novella from critically-acclaimed author Paul G. Tremblay expands upon the short story of the same name (published in &lt;em&gt;Compositions for the Young and Old&lt;/em&gt;, 2004, rev. 2005).&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Harlequin &amp;amp; the Train&lt;/em&gt; is an experimental fiction narrative that requires you to interact with it using a simple yellow highlighter. This novella is about paranoia, choice, and the horror of individual and collective consequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plot Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rudy has only been on the job as a train engineer for a few months. While at the helm of a commuter train headed to Boston, Massachusetts, it hits a harlequin clown, and in the chaotic aftermath, he witnesses the horrific and inexplicable actions of a group of people who were seemingly laying in wait for the accident. There are other accidents and as the group infiltrates his life (present and past), and as random global acts of violence and suffering seem to be connected, what Rudy believes about others and himself will be forever warped as he makes his final choice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>With The Last Days of California, Mary Miller bursts into the literary world, taking up the mantle of Southern fiction and rendering it her own with wry vulnerability and contemporary urgency. Miller's revelatory protagonist, Jess, is fourteen years old and waiting for the world to end. Her evangelical father has packed up the family and left their Montgomery home to drive west to California, hoping to save as many souls as possible before the Second Coming. With her long-suffering mother and rebellious (and secretly pregnant) sister, Jess hands out tracts to nonbelievers at every rest stop, waffle house, and gas station along the way. As Jess's belief frays, her teenage myopia evolves into awareness about her fracturing family. Using deadpan humor and savage charm belying deep empathy for her characters, Miller's debut captures the angst, sexual rivalry, and escalating self-doubt of teenage life in America while announcing Miller as a fierce new voice.</description>

  <description>The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered—fractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she’s known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tris’s new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature—and of herself—while facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, Allegiant, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the Divergent series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A powerfully suspenseful story narrated by a young girl who must fend for herself and her little brother after a brutal bear attack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While camping with her family on a remote island, five-year-old Anna awakes in the night to the sound of her mother screaming. A rogue black bear, 300 pounds of fury, is attacking the family's campsite, pouncing on her parents as prey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At her dying mother's faint urging, Anna manages to get her brother into the family's canoe and paddle away. But when the canoe dumps the two children on the edge of the woods, and the sister and brother must battle hunger, the elements, and a dangerous wilderness, we see Anna's heartbreaking love for her family--and her struggle to be brave when nothing in her world seems safe anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in the honest, raw voice of five-year-old Anna, this is a riveting story of love, courage, and survival.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A New York Times Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyle Keeley is the class clown, popular with most kids, (if not the teachers), and an ardent fan of all games: board games, word games, and particularly video games. His hero, Luigi Lemoncello, the most notorious and creative gamemaker in the world, just so happens to be the genius behind the building of the new town library.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucky Kyle wins a coveted spot to be one of the first 12 kids in the library for an overnight of fun, food, and lots and lots of games. But when morning comes, the doors remain locked. Kyle and the other winners must solve every clue and every secret puzzle to find the hidden escape route. And the stakes are very high.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this cross between &lt;em&gt;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Night in the Museum,&lt;/em&gt; Agatha Award winner Chris Grabenstein uses rib-tickling humor to create the perfect tale for his quirky characters. Old fans and new readers will become enthralled with the crafty twists and turns of this ultimate library experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;'If you were to ask me to tell you about my wife, I would have to warn you at the outset that I don't know a great deal about her. Or at least, not as much as I thought I did...'&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So speaks Alex, the narrator of this unforgettable literary thriller. Alex is in his thirties, a solitary man who has finally found love in the form of his beautiful and vivacious wife, Rachel. When Rachel is brutally murdered one Midsummer Night by the lake in the grounds of their alma mater, Worcester College, Oxford, Alex's life as he knew it vanishes. He returns to Oxford that winter, and through the shroud of his shock and grief, begins to try to piece together the mystery surrounding his wife's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Playing host to Alex's winter visit is Harry, Rachel's former tutor and trusted mentor, who turns out to have been involved in some way in almost every significant development of their relationship throughout their undergraduate years. In his exploration of Rachel's history, Alex also turns to Evie, Rachel's self-centred and difficult godmother, whose jealousy of her charge has waxed and waned over the years. And then there are her university friends, Anthony and Cissy, who shared with Rachel her love of Browning and a taste for the illicit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Alex delves deep into the past to uncover shocking secrets and constantly shifting versions of the truth, it is with these virtual strangers as his guides that he begins to confront the terrifying reality that neither his life, nor his love, are the things he thought them to be.</description>

  <description>When nineteen year old Davey finds himself drunk, beaten and alone, he is rescued by the oddly-assorted inhabitants of an abandoned and beautiful house in the West Country. Their only condition for letting him join them is that he asks them no questions.&lt;br&gt;More than thirty years ago in that same house, burned-out rock star Jack Laker writes a ground-breaking comeback album, and abandons the girl who saved his life to embark on a doomed and passionate romance with a young actress. His attempt to escape his destructive lifestyle leads to deceit, debauchery and even murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Davey and his fellow housemate Priss try to uncover the secrets of the house's inhabitants, both past and present, it becomes clear that the five strangers have all been drawn there by the events and the music of that long-ago summer.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A mesmerizing first novel about trust, dependence, and fear, from a major new writer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ruth is widowed, her sons are grown, and she lives in an isolated beach house outside of town. Her routines are few and small. One day a stranger arrives at her door, looking as if she has been blown in from the sea. This woman—Frida—claims to be a care worker sent by the government. Ruth lets her in.&lt;br&gt;     Now that Frida is in her house, is Ruth right to fear the tiger she hears on the prowl at night, far from its jungle habitat? Why do memories of childhood in Fiji press upon her with increasing urgency? How far can she trust this mysterious woman, Frida, who seems to carry with her her own troubled past? And how far can Ruth trust herself?&lt;br&gt;     &lt;em&gt;The Night Guest&lt;/em&gt;, Fiona McFarlane’s hypnotic first novel, is no simple tale of a crime committed and a mystery solved. This is a tale that soars above its own suspense to tell us, with exceptional grace and beauty, about aging, love, trust, dependence, and fear; about processes of colonization; and about things (and people) in places they shouldn’t be. Here is a new writer who comes to us fully formed, working wonders with language, renewing our faith in the power of fiction to describe the mysterious workings of our minds.</description>

  <description>A decade in the future, humanity thrives in the absence of sickness and disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We owe our good health to a humble parasite - a genetically engineered tapeworm developed by the pioneering SymboGen Corporation. When implanted, the tapeworm protects us from illness, boosts our immune system - even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost every human being has a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives...and will do anything to get them.</description>

  <description>No one is coming to your aid. We have ensured this.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Six strangers wake up on a remote island in the Florida Keys with no memory of their arrival. They soon discover their common bond: all of them are heroin addicts. As the first excruciating pangs of withdrawal make themselves felt, the six notice a yacht anchored across open water. On it lurk four shadowy figures, protected by the hungry sharks that patrol the waves. So begins a dangerous game. The six must undertake the impossible—swim to the next island where a cache of heroin awaits, or die trying. When alliances form, betrayal is inevitable. As the fight to survive intensifies, the stakes reach terrifying heights—and their captors’ motives finally begin to emerge.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>When a group of food-obsessed academics at Oxford University form a secret dining society, they happily devote themselves to investigating exotic and forgotten culinary treasures. Until a dish is suggested that takes them all by surprise. Professor Arthur Plantagenet has been told he has a serious heart problem and decides that his death should not be in vain. He sets out his bizarre plan in a will, that on his death, tests the loyalty of his closest friends, the remaining members of this exclusive dining society. A dead Japanese diplomat, police arrests and charges of grave robbing. These are just some of the challenges these culinary explorers must overcome in tackling gastronomy's ultimate taboo: cannibalism.</description>

  <description>The Changed are on the move. The Spared are out of time. The End...is now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her parents died, Alex thought things couldn't get much worse-until the doctors found the monster in her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She headed into the wilderness as a good-bye, to leave everything behind. But then the end of the world happened, and Alex took the first step down a treacherous road of betrayal and terror and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, with no hope of rescue-on the brink of starvation in a winter that just won't quit-she discovers a new and horrifying truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Change isn't over.&lt;br&gt;The Changed are still evolving.&lt;br&gt;And...they've had help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this final volume of The Ashes Trilogy, Ilsa J. Bick delivers a riveting, blockbuster finish, returning readers to a brutal, post-apocalyptic world where no one is safe and hope is in short supply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world where, from these ashes, the monsters may rise.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fifty leading writers retell myths from around the world in this dazzling follow-up to the bestselling &lt;em&gt;My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Icarus flies once more. Aztec jaguar gods again stalk the earth. An American soldier designs a new kind of Trojan horse—his cremains in a bullet. Here, in beguiling guise, are your favorite mythological figures alongside characters from Indian, Punjabi, Inuit, and other traditions.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aimee Bender&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of the&lt;strong&gt; Titans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madeline Miller&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Galatea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Wilson&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Phaeton,&lt;/strong&gt; from Ovid’s &lt;em&gt;Metamorphoses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emma Straub and Peter Straub&lt;/strong&gt; retell the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Persephone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heidi Julavits&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Orpheus and Euridice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron Currie, Jr.&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Dedalus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maile Meloy&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Demeter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zachary Mason&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Narcissus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Williams&lt;/strong&gt; retells the myth of &lt;strong&gt;Argos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; Odysseus’ dog.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; If �xo” signals a goodbye, then &lt;em&gt;xo Orpheus&lt;/em&gt; is a goodbye to an old way of mythmaking. Featuring talkative goats, a cat lady, a bird woman, a beer-drinking ogre, a squid who falls in love with the sun, and a girl who gives birth to cubs, here are extravagantly imagined, bracingly contemporary stories, heralding a new beginning for one of the world’s oldest literary traditions.</description>

  <description>A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller? Oh, you know the dogs weren't going to let the cats get away with that! This canine companion to &lt;em&gt;I Could Pee on This&lt;/em&gt;, the beloved volume of poems by cats, &lt;em&gt;I Could Chew on This&lt;/em&gt; will have dog lovers laughing out loud. Doggie laureates not only chew on quite a lot of things, they also reveal their creativity, their hidden motives, and their eternal (and sometimes misguided) effervescence through such musings as "I Dropped a Ball," "I Lose My Mind When You Leave the House," and "Can You Smell That?" Accompanied throughout by portraits of the canine poets in all their magnificence, &lt;em&gt;I Could Chew on This&lt;/em&gt; is a work of unbridled enthusiasm, insatiable appetite, and, yes, creative genius.</description>

  <description>Boy Scouts live by the motto “Be Prepared.” However, nothing can prepare this group of young boys and their scoutmaster for what they encounter on a small, deserted island, as they settle down for a weekend of campfires, merit badges, and survival lessons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes when a haggard stranger in tattered clothing appears out of nowhere and collapses on the campers’ doorstep. Before the night is through, this stranger will end up infecting one of the troop’s own with a bioengineered horror that’s straight out of their worst nightmares. Now stranded on the island with no communication to the outside world, the troop learns to battle much more than the elements, as they are pitted against something nature never intended…and eventually each other.</description>

Juliette and JoAnne have never got over one of them sleeping with the other's boyfriend. Sissy secretly blames someone for the death of her husband. Natasha knows one of them is having an affair with her partner. Siobhan annoys everyone. Katie is annoyed by everyone. Camilla desperately tries to keep the peace. So when their picnic in the park goes horribly wrong and one of them ends up in the Serpentine, who knows what really happened? And just what secrets from the past are about to unfold, changing everyone's lives forever?</description>

  <description>They called it the killing day. Twelve people dead, all in the space of a few hours. Five murderers: neighbors, relatives, friends. All of them so normal. All of them seemingly harmless. All of them now dead by their own hand . . . except one. And that one has no answers to offer the shattered town. She doesn't even know why she killed—or whether she'll do it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something is waking in the sleepy town of Oleander's, Kansas—something dark and hungry that lives in the flat earth and the open sky, in the vengeful hearts of upstanding citizens. As the town begins its descent into blood and madness, five survivors of the killing day are the only ones who can stop Oleander from destroying itself. Jule, the outsider at war with the world; West, the golden boy at war with himself; Daniel, desperate for a different life; Cass, who's not sure she deserves a life at all; and Ellie, who believes in sacrifice, fate, and in evil. Ellie, who always goes too far. They have nothing in common. They have nothing left to lose. And they have no way out. Which means they have no choice but to stand and fight, to face the darkness in their town—and in themselves. </description>

  <description>What would you do if you found an alligator in your garage? Or if you spotted a mountain lion downtown? In cities and suburbs around the world, wild creatures are showing up where we least expect them. Not all of them arrive by accident, and some are here to stay. As the human population tops seven billion, animals are running out of space. Their natural habitats are surrounded and sometimes even replaced by highways, shopping centers, office parks, and subdivisions. The result? A wildlife invasion of our urban neighborhoods. What kinds of animals are making cities their new home? How can they survive in our ecosystem of concrete, steel, and glass? And what does their presence there mean for their future and ours? Join scientists, activists, and the folks next door on a journey around the globe to track down our newest wild animal neighbors. Discover what is bringing these creatures to our backyards and how we can create spaces for people and animals to live side by side.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Paintings by two of Canada’s most influential contemporary fine artists&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animals with Sharpies&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of paintings with hand-lettered texts. In each painting, Michael Dumontier and Neil Farber have depicted an animal holding a Sharpie, ostensibly writing a message. These messages are varied in nature: political and religious tracts, confessions, recipes, arithmetic problems, and more. Above all, these paintings are funny, but they are also startlingly poignant and jarring for the humanness of the suffering and longing depicted in these animals’ simple words.&lt;br&gt;     Dumontier and Farber, two of the founding members of the highly influential art collective the Royal Art Lodge, have been collaborating on art projects for more than fifteen years. Their collaborative style is unique from that found in their individual works and is respected internationally: they’ve exhibited together in France, Switzerland, Canada, the United States, Belgium, Spain, England, and Germany.      Dumontier and Farber have a strong sense of the absurd, but they are also deeply insightful about the world in which their art is created. &lt;em&gt;Animals with Sharpies&lt;/em&gt; is a mixture of new, previously unseen pieces and older pieces.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;ALA Reading List Award for History, Short List&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Love and vengeance at the dark dawn of the East Texas oil boom from Joe Lansdale, "a true American original" (Joe Hill, author of &lt;em&gt;Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Parker thought he'd already seen his fair share of tragedy. His grandmother was killed in a farm accident when he was barely five years old. His parents have just succumbed to the smallpox epidemic sweeping turn-of-the-century East Texas--orphaning him and his younger sister, Lula.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then catastrophe strikes on the way to their uncle's farm, when a traveling group of bank-robbing bandits murder Jack's grandfather and kidnap his sister. With no elders left for miles, Jack must grow up fast and enlist a band of heroes the likes of which has never been seen if his sister stands any chance at survival. But the best he can come up with is a charismatic, bounty-hunting dwarf named Shorty, a grave-digging son of an ex-slave named Eustace, and a street-smart woman-for-hire named Jimmie Sue who's come into some very intimate knowledge about the bandits (and a few members of Jack's extended family to boot). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the throes of being civilized, East Texas is still a wild, feral place. Oil wells spurt liquid money from the ground. But as Jack's about to find out, blood and redemption rule supreme. In &lt;em&gt;The Thicket&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning novelist Joe R. Lansdale lets loose like never before, in a rip-roaring adventure equal parts &lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Stand by Me--&lt;/em&gt;the perfect introduction to an acclaimed writer whose work has been called "as funny and frightening as anything that could have been dreamed up by the Brothers Grimm--or Mark Twain" (&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Penelope (Pen) has lost everything—her home, her parents, and her ten-year-old brother. Like a female Odysseus in search of home, she navigates a dark world full of strange creatures, gathers companions and loses them, finds love and loses it, and faces her mortal enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her signature style, Francesca Lia Block has created a world that is beautiful in its destruction and as frightening as it is lovely. At the helm is Pen, a strong heroine who holds hope and love in her hands and refuses to be defeated.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the Philip K. Dick Award: In a nuclear-ravaged California, a humble musician sets out on a dangerous quest to rescue his lost love from the clutches of a soul-devouring religious cult&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the twenty-second century, the City of Angels is a tragic shell of its former self, having long ago been ruined and reshaped by nuclear disaster. Before he was in a band in Ellay, Gregorio Rivas was a redeemer, rescuing lost souls trapped in the Jaybirds cult of the powerful maniac Norton Jaybush. Rivas had hoped those days were behind him, but a desperate entreaty from a powerful official is pulling him back into the game. The rewards will be plentiful if he can wrest Urania, the official’s daughter and Gregorio’s first love, from Jaybush’s sinister clutches. To do so, the redeemer reborn must face blood-sucking hemogoblins and other monstrosities on his way to discovering the ultimate secrets of this neo-Californian civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most ingeniously imaginative writers of our time, Tim Powers dazzles in an early work that displays his unique creative genius. Alive with wit, intelligence, and wild invention, &lt;em&gt;Dinner at Deviant’s Palace&lt;/em&gt; is a mad adventure across a dystopian future as only Tim Powers could have imagined it.</description>

  <description>Spring 1832: Donegal, north west Ireland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coll Coyle wakes to a blood dawn and a day he does not want to face. The young father stands to lose everything on account of the cruel intentions of his landowner’s heedless son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although reluctant, Coll sets out to confront his trouble. And so begins his fall from the rain-soaked, cloud-swirling Eden, and a pursuit across the wild bog lands of Donegal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behind him is John Faller – a man who has vowed to hunt Coll to the ends of the earth – in a pursuit that will stretch to an epic voyage across the Atlantic, and to greater tragedy in the new American frontier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Red Sky in Morning is a dark tale of oppression bathed in sparkling, unconstrained imagery. A compassionate and sensitive exploration of the merciless side of man and the indifference of nature, it is both a mesmerizing feat of imagination and a landmark piece of fiction.</description>

  <description>When Ann LeSage was a little girl, she had an invisible friend - a poltergeist, that spoke to her with flying knives and howling winds. She called it the Insect. And with a little professional help, she contained it. And the nightmare was over, at least for a time. But the nightmare never truly ended. As Ann grew from girl into young woman, the Insect grew with her. It became more than terrifying. It became a thing of murder. Now, as she embarks on a new life married to Michael Voors, a successful young lawyer, Ann believes that she finally has the Insect under control. But there are others vying to take that control away from her. They may not know exactly what they're dealing with, but they know they want it. They are the 'Geisters. And in pursuing their own perverse dream, they risk spawning the most terrible nightmare of all.</description>

  <description>An alternate ending to the first novel in the Newsflesh trilogy, Feed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can be read also on the webpage of orbit books - orbitbooks.net&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be advised there are major spoilers for FEED contained therein.  If you haven’t read FEED yet, don’t go any further.  These books are fantastic as the many Newsflesh fans will tell you. You’ll want to enjoy every surprising twist and turn on what has been one wild ride for the Mason siblings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if the crew of After the End Times are old friends of yours, then by all means continue and read FED or download a pdf. Available at &lt;a&gt;orbitbooks.net&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>For Amber, helping children build custom dolls isn’t exactly her dream job, especially when business is so slow. But when 7-foot-inch, 400-pound childlike Bobby Milton walks into the store one day with his caretaker, things around LYLAS Dolls start to get interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby comes back every week to make a new doll, but each time he leaves, he takes something from the store...something that points to his involvement in a string of child disappearances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Bobby as innocent as he seems, or is he a wolf among sheep? A predator...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Among Prey.</description>

  <description>"I first met my demon the morning that Mum said Dad had gone." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alex Connolly is ten years old, likes onions on toast, and can balance on the back legs of his chair for fourteen minutes. His best friend is a 9000-year-old demon called Ruen. When his depressive mother attempts suicide yet again, Alex meets child psychiatrist Anya. Still bearing the scars of her own daughter's battle with schizophrenia, Anya fears for Alex's mental health and attempts to convince him that Ruen doesn't exist. But as she runs out of medical proof for many of Alex's claims, she is faced with a question: does Alex suffer from schizophrenia, or can he really see demons?</description>

  <description>An NYRB Classics Original&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a sunny summer Sunday in a remote Swiss village, and a christening is being celebrated at a lovely old farmhouse. One of the guests notes an anomaly in the fabric of the venerable edifice: a blackened post that has been carefully built into a trim new window frame. Thereby hangs a tale, one that, as the wise old grandfather who has lived all his life in the house proceeds to tell it, takes one chilling turn after another, while his audience listens in appalled silence. Featuring a cruelly overbearing lord of the manor and the oppressed villagers who must render him service, an irreverent young woman who will stop at nothing, a mysterious stranger with a red beard and a green hat, and, last but not least, the black spider, the tale is as riveting and appalling today as when Jeremias Gotthelf set it down more than a hundred years ago. &lt;em&gt;The Black Spider&lt;/em&gt; can be seen as a parable of evil in the heart or of evil at large in society (Thomas Mann saw it as foretelling the advent of Nazism), or as a vision, anticipating H. P. Lovecraft, of cosmic horror. There’s no question, in any case, that it is unforgettably creepy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The American master's first novel since &lt;em&gt;Winter's Bone&lt;/em&gt; (2006) tells of a deadly dance hall fire and its impact over several generations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alma DeGeer Dunahew, the mother of three young boys, works as the maid for a prominent citizen and his family in West Table, Missouri. Her husband is mostly absent, and, in 1929, her scandalous, beloved younger sister is one of the 42 killed in an explosion at the local dance hall. Who is to blame? Mobsters from St. Louis? The embittered local gypsies? The preacher who railed against the loose morals of the waltzing couples? Or could it have been a colossal accident?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alma thinks she knows the answer-and that its roots lie in a dangerous love affair. Her dogged pursuit of justice makes her an outcast and causes a long-standing rift with her own son. By telling her story to her grandson, she finally gains some solace-and peace for her sister. He is advised to "Tell it. Go on and tell it"-tell the story of his family's struggles, suspicions, secrets, and triumphs.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake&lt;/em&gt; returns with a wondrous collection of dreamy, strange, and magical stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truly beloved by readers and critics alike, Aimee Bender has become known as something of an enchantress whose lush prose is “moving, fanciful, and gorgeously strange” (&lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt;), “richly imagined and bittersweet” (&lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;), and “full of provocative ideas” (&lt;em&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;). In her deft hands, “relationships and mundane activities take on mythic qualities” (&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this collection, Bender’s unique talents sparkle brilliantly in stories about people searching for connection through love, sex, and family—while navigating the often painful realities of their lives. A traumatic event unfolds when a girl with flowing hair of golden wheat appears in an apple orchard, where a group of people await her. A woman plays out a prostitution fantasy with her husband and finds she cannot go back to her old sex life. An ugly woman marries an ogre and struggles to decide if she should stay with him after he mistakenly eats their children. Two sisters travel deep into Malaysia, where one learns the art of mending tigers who have been ripped to shreds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these deeply resonant stories—evocative, funny, beautiful, and sad—we see ourselves reflected as if in a funhouse mirror. Aimee Bender has once again proven herself to be among the most imaginative, exciting, and intelligent writers of our time.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A chilling psychological thriller about a marriage, a way of life, and how far one woman will go to keep what is rightfully hers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jodi and Todd are at a bad place in their marriage. Much is at stake, including the affluent life they lead in their beautiful waterfront condo in Chicago, as she, the killer, and he, the victim, rush haplessly toward the main event. He is a committed cheater. She lives and breathes denial. He exists in dual worlds. She likes to settle scores. He decides to play for keeps. She has nothing left to lose. Told in alternating voices, The Silent Wife is about a marriage in the throes of dissolution, a couple headed for catastrophe, concessions that can’t be made, and promises that won’t be kept. Expertly plotted and reminiscent of Gone Girl and These Things Hidden, The Silent Wife ensnares the reader from page one and does not let go.</description>

  <description>Compost won't mean the same thing after readers have seen the amazing transformation of Jack from grinning pumpkin to mold-mottled wreckage to hopeful green shoot. The story of decomposition is vividly told so that science comes to life (and death). Part story, part science, and a whole lot of fun. Features a teacher guide in the back of the book, and additional material (including instructions on how to put on a Rotten Pumpkin play in your school) are on the Creston and Author websites.</description>

  <description>Meet Charlie. People think he's crazy. But he's not. People think he's stupid. But he's not. People think he's innocent...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's the Gamal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie has a story to tell, about his best friends Sinead and James and the bad things that happened. But he can't tell it yet, at least not 'til he's worked out where the beginning is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is the beginning long ago when Sinead first spoke up for him after Charlie got in trouble at school for the millionth time? Or was it later, when Sinead and James followed the music and found each other? Or was it later still on that terrible night when something unspeakable happened after closing time and someone chose to turn a blind eye?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie has promised Dr Quinn he'll write 1,000 words a day, but it's hard to know which words to write. And which secrets to tell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of the dark heart of an Irish village, of how daring to be different can be dangerous, and how there is nothing a person will not do for love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exhilarating, bitingly funny and unforgettably poignant, this is a story like no other. This is the story of the Gamal.</description>

  <description>“A dramatic, thoroughgoing investigation of the complexities of sexuality and gender.…A warmly human coming-of-age story…emotionally engaging, and genuinely unforgettable” (Booklist, starred review).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max Walker is a golden boy. Attractive, intelligent, and athletic, he’s the perfect son, the perfect friend, and the perfect crush for the girls in his school. He’s even really nice to his little brother. Karen, Max’s mother, is determined to maintain the façade of effortless excellence she has constructed through the years, but now that the boys are getting older, she worries that the façade might soon begin to crumble. Adding to the tension, her husband Steve has chosen this moment to stand for election to Parliament. The spotlight of the media is about to encircle their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Walkers are hiding something, you see. Max is special. Max is different. Max is intersex. When an enigmatic childhood friend named Hunter steps out of his past and abuses his trust in the worst possible way, Max is forced to consider the nature of his well-kept secret. Why won’t his parents talk about it? What else are they hiding from Max about his condition and from each other? The deeper Max goes, the more questions emerge about where it all leaves him and what his future holds, especially now that he’s starting to fall head over heels for someone for the first time in his life. Will his friends accept him if he is no longer the Golden Boy? Will anyone ever want him—desire him—once they know? And the biggest one of all, the question he has to look inside himself to answer: Who is Max Walker, really?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written by twenty-six-year-old rising star Abigail Tarttelin, Golden Boy is a novel you’ll read in one sitting but will never forget; at once a riveting tale of a family in crisis, a fascinating exploration of identity, and a coming-of-age story like no other.</description>

  <description>In this darkly hilarious debut collection, misfit women and girls in every strata of society are investigated through various ill-fated jobs. One is the main course of dinner, another the porn star contracted to copulate in space for a reality TV show. They become futuristic ant farms, get knocked up by the star high school quarterback and have secret abortions, use parakeets to reverse amputations, make love to garden gnomes, go into air conditioning ducts to confront their mother’s ghost, and do so in settings that range from Hell to the local white-supremacist bowling alley.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;“Precise and wryly hilarious...Gauld's both a literature nerd and a science-fiction nerd whose deadpan mashups belong on the same shelf as R. Sikoryak, Michael Kupperman, and Kate Beaton.”—NPR, Best Books of 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new collection from the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; cartoonist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times Magazine&lt;/em&gt; cartoonist Tom Gauld follows up his widely praised graphic novel &lt;em&gt;Goliath&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;You’re All Just Jealous of My Jetpack&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of cartoons made for &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. Over the past eight years, Gauld has produced a weekly cartoon for the Saturday Review section of Britain’s best-regarded newspaper. Only a handful of comics from this huge and hilarious body of work have ever been printed in North America—and these have been available exclusively within the pages of the prestigious &lt;em&gt;Believer&lt;/em&gt; magazine. &lt;br&gt;     &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;re All Just Jealous of My Jetpack&lt;/em&gt; distills perfectly Gauld’s dark humor, impeccable timing, and distinctive style. Arrests by the fiction police and imaginary towns designed by Tom Waits intermingle hilariously with piercing observations about human behavior and whimsical imaginings of the future. Again and again, Gauld reaffirms his position as a first-rank cartoonist, creating work infused with a deep understanding of both literary and cartoon history.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A haunting historical eNovella about three slave girls with mystical powers living on an eerie island off the coast of Georgia, whose lives intertwine in their quest for freedom.&lt;/strong&gt;Meet Emmaline, Celestia, and Liza, three slave girls on a haunted barrier island in Georgia lowcountry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emmaline is a mouthy, stubborn young woman who has magic in her blood and conjures the strongest spells with hardly any effort. Celestia was ten when her mother was sold and taken from the island. She’s never stopped longing for her, even when the talking chain—a verbal underground railroad—sends word that her mother has been taken to a plantation in North Carolina. By the time she turns sixteen, she can no longer bring her mother’s face to mind, but she can still hear her urging Celestia to be thankful and keep safe. Liza was a birthday gift to the plantation’s mistress. Her mama was killed for throwing a spell on her master. Before she died she gave Liza her book of conjures, so she could protect herself. And when Liza hatches a plan for all three of them to escape, the three girls’ lives collide. What they don’t realize is that their chances of successfully escaping are slim, and the possibility that all three will die before they leave the island is more likely...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THEY SEARCHED FOR GOLD. THEY FOUND DEATH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iraq 2005. Seven mercenaries hear an enticing rumor: somewhere, abandoned in the swirling desert sands, lies an abandoned Republican Guard convoy containing millions of pounds of Saddam's gold.  They form an unlikely crew of battle-scarred privateers, killers and thieves, veterans of a dozen war zones, each of them anxious to make one last score before their luck runs out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After liberating the sole surviving Guard member from US capture, the team makes their way to the ancient ruins where the convoy was last seen.  Although all seems eerily quiet and deserted when they arrive, they soon find themselves caught in a desperate battle for their lives, confronted by greed, betrayal, and an army that won't stay dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ---&lt;br&gt; “A high-voltage shock to the system. It’s smart, witty, crammed with action and disturbingly plausible. Highly recommended.” –Jonathan Maberry, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A brilliant, gripping portrait of survival in the face of complete annihilation perfect for fans of Jonathan Maberry and Guillermo Del Toro's &lt;em&gt;The Strain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; An unputdownable military thriller that SFFworld.com called "Three Kings meets The Walking Dead,” &lt;em&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/em&gt; is a heart-pounding, fast-paced read that doesn’t let up until the last page.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A vertiginous gothic masterpiece from the best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;The Quincunx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charles Palliser's work has been hailed as "so compulsively absorbing that reality disappears" (New York Times). Since his extraordinary debut, &lt;em&gt;The Quincunx&lt;/em&gt;, his works have sold over one million copies worldwide. With his new novel, &lt;em&gt;Rustication&lt;/em&gt;, he returns to the town of Thurchester, which he evoked so hauntingly in &lt;em&gt;The Unburied&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is winter 1863, and Richard Shenstone, aged seventeen, has been sent down — "rusticated" — from Cambridge under a cloud of suspicion. Addicted to opium and tormented by sexual desire, he finds temporary refuge in a dilapidated old mansion on the southern English coast inhabited by his newly impoverished mother and his sister, Effie. Soon, graphic and threatening letters begin to circulate among his neighbors, and Richard finds himself the leading suspect in a series of crimes and misdemeanors ranging from vivisection to murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atmospheric, lurid, and brilliantly executed, &lt;em&gt;Rustication&lt;/em&gt; confirms Palliser's reputation as "our leading contemporary Victorian novelist" (&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>The dark is rising . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detective Inspector James Quill is about to complete the drugs bust of his career. Then his prize suspect Rob Toshack is murdered in custody. Furious, Quill pursues the investigation, co-opting intelligence analyst Lisa Ross and undercover cops Costain and Sefton. But nothing about Toshack’s murder is normal. Toshack had struck a bargain with a vindictive entity, whose occult powers kept Toshack one step ahead of the law – until his luck ran out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the team must find a 'suspect' who can bend space and time and alter memory itself. And they will kill again. As the group starts to see London’s sinister magic for themselves, they have two choices: panic or use their new abilities. Then they must hunt a terrifying supernatural force the only way they know how: using police methods, equipment and tactics. But they must all learn the rules of this new game - and quickly. More than their lives will depend on it.</description>

  <description>Celeste Price is an eighth-grade English teacher in suburban Tampa. She's undeniably attractive. She drives a red Corvette with tinted windows. Her husband, Ford, is rich, square-jawed, and devoted to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Celeste's devotion lies elsewhere. She has a singular sexual obsession—fourteen-year-old boys. Celeste pursues her craving with sociopathic meticulousness and forethought; her sole purpose in becoming a teacher is to fulfill her passion and provide her access to her compulsion. As the novel opens, fall semester at Jefferson Jr. High is beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mere weeks, Celeste has chosen and lured the lusciously naive Jack Patrick into her web. Jack is enthralled and in awe of his teacher, and, most important, willing to accept Celeste's terms for a secret relationship—car rides after school; rendezvous at Jack's house while his single father works late; body-slamming encounters in Celeste's empty classroom between periods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever mindful of the danger—the perpetual risk of exposure, Jack's father's own attraction to her, and the ticking clock as Jack leaves innocent boyhood behind—the hyperbolically insatiable Celeste bypasses each hurdle with swift thinking and shameless determination, even when the solutions involve greater misdeeds than the affair itself. In slaking her sexual thirst, Celeste Price is remorseless and deviously free of hesitation, a monstress driven by pure motivation. She deceives everyone, and cares nothing for anyone or anything but her own pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With crackling, rampantly unadulterated prose, &lt;em&gt;Tampa&lt;/em&gt; is a grand, uncompromising, seriocomic examination of want and a scorching literary debut.</description>

  <description>It was the summer of 2014, and the true horrors of the Rising were only just beginning to reveal themselves.  Fans from all over the world gathered in San Diego, California for the annual comic book and media convention, planning to forget about the troubling rumors of new diseases and walking dead by immersing themselves in a familiar environment.  Over the course of five grueling days and nights, it became clear that the news was very close to home…and that most of the people who picked up their badges would never make it out alive.</description>

  <description>On Pine Street, the houses begin to shake. The earth begins to move. The streets crack open and yards split asunder...and rising from subterranean depths far below, a viscid black muck bubbles up and floods the neighborhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In it are a ravenous army of gigantic worms seeking human flesh. They wash into houses, they come up through the sewers, through plumbing, filling toilets and tubs, seeking human prey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cut off from the rest of the town, the people of Pine Street must wage a war of survival or they'll never see morning. As bad as the worms are, there's something worse—and far larger—waiting to emerge.</description>

  <description>In this epic, mythical debut novel, a newly-wed couple escapes the busy confusion of their homeland for a distant and almost-uninhabited lakeshore. They plan to live there simply, to fish the lake, to trap the nearby woods, and build a house upon the dirt between where they can raise a family. But as their every pregnancy fails, the child-obsessed husband begins to rage at this new world: the song-spun objects somehow created by his wife's beautiful singing voice, the giant and sentient bear that rules the beasts of the woods, the second moon weighing down the fabric of their starless sky, and the labyrinth of memory dug into the earth beneath their house.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; This novel, from one of our most exciting young writers, is a powerful exploration of the limits of parenthood and marriage—and of what happens when a marriage’s success is measured solely by the children it produces, or else the sorrow that marks their absence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Award-winning author Stephen M. Irwin returns with a thrilling, supernatural crime novel built around an intriguing question: What happens when every single person is haunted by a ghost only they can see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Without warning, a boy in the middle of a city intersection sends Detective Oscar Mariani's car careening into a busy sidewalk. The scene is bedlam as every person becomes visited by something no one else can see. We are all haunted. Usually, the apparition is someone known: a lost relative, a lover, an enemy. But not always. For Oscar Mariani, the only secret that matters is the unknown ghost who now shares his every waking moment . . . and why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worldwide aftershock of what becomes known as "Gray Wednesday" is immediate and catastrophic, leaving governments barely functioning and economies devastated . . . but some things don't change. When Detective Mariani discovers the grisly remains of an anonymous murder victim in the city sewage system, his investigation will pit him against a corrupt police department and a murky cabal conspiring for power in the new world order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephen M. Irwin has created an unforgettable crime novel and an intense, textured vision of the near-future. &lt;em&gt;The Broken Ones&lt;/em&gt; is the riveting search for hope in the darkest corners of the imagination.</description>

  <description>With the boys' new fort finally finished, everything that summer was going great. And then the killer showed up. During the summer of 1987, from their tree house fort in the woods, neighborhood boys Tim, Scott, and Luke spot a man holding a gun to missing sixteen-year-old Molly Peterson's back. The problem is, nobody believes their story, not even the police. As search efforts to find Molly dwindle, the boys know that she, and the man with the gun, are nearby ? and that they must now find and save Molly themselves. A growing sense of honor and urgency forces the boys to take action ? to find Molly, to protect themselves, and to stand guard for the last long days of summer.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the 2012 Story Prize&lt;br&gt; Recipient of the 2012 American Academy of Arts and Letters Rosenthal Foundation Award&lt;br&gt; A National Book Foundation "5 Under 35" fiction writer of 2012&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Like the work of Cormac McCarthy, Denis Johnson, Richard Ford, and Annie Proulx, &lt;em&gt;Battleborn &lt;/em&gt;represents a near-perfect confluence of sensibility and setting, and the introduction of an exceptionally powerful and original literary voice. In each of these ten unforgettable stories, Claire Vaye Watkins writes her way fearlessly into the mythology of the American West, utterly reimagining it. Her characters orbit around the region's vast spaces, winning redemption despite - and often because of - the hardship and violence they endure. The arrival of a foreigner transforms the exchange of eroticism and emotion at a prostitution ranch. A prospecting hermit discovers the limits of his rugged individualism when he tries to rescue an abused teenager. Decades after she led her best friend into a degrading encounter in a Vegas hotel room, a woman feels the aftershock. Most bravely of all, Watkins takes on � and reinvents � her own troubled legacy in a story that emerges from the mayhem and destruction of Helter Skelter. Arcing from the sweeping and sublime to the minute and personal, from Gold Rush to ghost town to desert to brothel, the collection echoes not only in its title but also in its fierce, undefeated spirit the motto of her home state. </description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In this haunting, suspenseful debut novel, John Mantooth takes readers to a town in rural Alabama where secrets are buried deep, reality is relative, and salvation requires a desperate act of faith.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; When Danny was fourteen, his mother and sister disappeared during a violent storm. The police were baffled. There were no clues, and most people figured they were dead.  Only Danny still holds out hope that they’ll return.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Months later, a disheveled Vietnam vet named Walter Pike shows up at Danny’s front door, claiming to know their whereabouts. The story he tells is so incredible that Danny knows he shouldn’t believe him. Others warn him about Walter Pike’s dark past, his shameful flight from town years ago, and the suspicious timing of his return.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; But he’s Danny’s last hope, and Danny needs to believe…</description>

  <description>In the stories of Mad Hope, Journey Prize winner Heather Birrell finds the heart of her characters and lets them lead us into worlds both recognizable and alarming. A science teacher and former doctor is forced to re-examine the role he played in Ceauşescu’s Romania after a student makes a shocking request; a tragic plane crash becomes the basis for a meditation on motherhood and its discontents; women in an online chat group share (and overshare) their anxieties and personal histories; and a chance encounter in a waiting room tests the ties that bind us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using precise, inventive language, Birrell creates astute and empathetic portraits of people we thought we knew – and deftly captures the lovely, maddening mess of being human.</description>

  <description>Bright and fresh with an innovative art style, this debut picture book from a huge new talent is sure to win lots of fans!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bird wakes up feeling grumpy. Too grumpy to eat or play -- too grumpy even to fly. "Looks like I'm walking today," says Bird. He walks past Sheep, who offers to keep him company. He walks past Rabbit, who also could use a walk. Raccoon, Beaver, and Fox join in, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before he knows it, a little exercise and companionship help Bird shake his bad mood. This winsome, refreshingly original picture book is sure to help kids (and grown-ups) giggle away theirs, too!</description>

  <description>A stunning debut reminiscent of the beloved novels of John Hart and Tom Franklin, &lt;em&gt;A Land More Kind Than Home&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing literary thriller about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small western North Carolina town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a curious boy like Jess Hall, growing up in Marshall means trouble when your mother catches you spying on grown-ups. Adventurous and precocious, Jess is enormously protective of his older brother, Christopher, a mute whom everyone calls Stump. Though their mother has warned them not to snoop, Stump can't help sneaking a look at something he's not supposed to—an act that will have catastrophic repercussions, shattering both his world and Jess's. It's a wrenching event that thrusts Jess into an adulthood for which he's not prepared. While there is much about the world that still confuses him, he now knows that a new understanding can bring not only a growing danger and evil—but also the possibility of freedom and deliverance as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told by three resonant and evocative characters—Jess; Adelaide Lyle, the town midwife and moral conscience; and Clem Barefield, a sheriff with his own painful past—&lt;em&gt;A Land More Kind Than Home&lt;/em&gt; is a haunting tale of courage in the face of cruelty and the power of love to overcome the darkness that lives in us all. These are masterful portrayals, written with assurance and truth, and they show us the extraordinary promise of this remarkable first novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted for the PEN/Robert W. Bingham Prize ($25,000): To an author whose debut work—a first novel or collection of short stories published in 2012—represents distinguished literary achievement and suggests great promise.</description>

  <description>Rachel and Alice are an extremely rare kind of identical twins-so identical that even their aunt and uncle, whom they've lived with since their parents passed away, can't tell them apart. But the sisters are connected in a way that goes well beyond their surfaces: when one experiences pain, the other exhibits the exact same signs of distress. So when one twin mysteriously disappears, the other immediately knows something is wrong-especially when she starts experiencing serious physical traumas, despite the fact that nobody has touched her. As the search commences to find her sister, the twin left behind must rely on their intense bond to uncover the truth. But is there anyone around her she can trust, when everyone could be a suspect? And ultimately, can she even trust &lt;em&gt;herself&lt;/em&gt;?</description>

  <description>When a down-on-her-luck divorcee meets a determined-to-dominate detective, they find out that falling in love can be murder... &lt;br&gt;Nell Dysart's in trouble. Weighed down by an inexplicable divorce and a loss of appetite for everything, Nell is sleepwalking through life until her best friend finagles a job for her with a shabby little detective agency that has lots of potential and a boss who looks easy to manage. &lt;br&gt;Gabe McKenna isn't doing too well, either. His detective agency is wasting time on a blackmail case, his partner has decided he hates watching cheating spouses for money, and his ex-wife has just dumped him...again. The only thing that's going his way is that his new secretary looks efficient, boring, and biddable. &lt;br&gt;But looks can be deceiving and soon Nell and Gabe are squaring off over embezzlement, business cards, vandalism, dog-napping, blackmail, Chinese food, unprofessional sex, and really ugly office furniture, all of which turn out to be the least of their problems. Because soon, somebody starts killing people. And shortly after that, they start falling in love...&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What happens when everything you’ve got to give isn’t enough to save someone you love?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s Maine. It’s winter. And it’s FREEZING STINKIN’ COLD! Dinah is wildly worried about her best friend, Skint. He won’t wear a coat. Refuses to wear a coat. It’s twelve degrees out, and he won’t wear a coat. So Dinah’s going to figure out how to help. That’s what Dinah does—she helps. But she’s too busy trying to help to notice that sometimes, she’s doing more harm than good. Seeing the trees instead of the forest? That’s Dinah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Skint isn’t going to be the one to tell her. He’s got his own problems. He’s worried about a little boy whose dad won’t let him visit his mom. He’s worried about an elderly couple in a too-cold house down the street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the wedge between what drives Dinah and what concerns Skint is wide enough for a big old slab of ice. Because Skint’s own father is in trouble. Because Skint’s mother refuses to ask for help even though she’s at her breaking point. And because Dinah might just decide to…help. She thinks she’s cracking through a sheet of ice, but what’s actually there is an entire iceberg.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Suspenseful and atmospheric, this extraordinary novel portrays both the hardship and grace in the life of a man struggling to realize his destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Samuel Tyne emigrated from the Gold Coast (now Ghana) in 1955, he was determined to accomplish great things. He excelled at Oxford and then came to Canada with the uncle who raised him, leaving the traditions and hard life of his homeland behind. Here, in this nation of immigrants, Samuel would surely be free to follow his destined path to success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That new beginning didn’t live up to Samuel’s expectations. As the novel opens fifteen years later, he is working as an economic forecaster for the government in Calgary. It’s a stiflingly bureaucratic, dead-end job, where petty managerial types and lifeless co-workers make Samuel’s days almost unbearable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes for Samuel when he finds out that his Uncle Jacob has died. Samuel and his uncle had grown apart. They had not spoken for a number of years, though Jacob had raised Samuel and, in a way, sacrificed himself for Samuel’s future. Jacob’s death weighs heavily on Samuel, yet his reaction seems more about having “a singular chance to get all his sadness out” than about familial love. Samuel is jolted out of his sadness and his workaday world when he receives a call telling him he has inherited Jacob’s old mansion in the small town of Aster, Alberta. The town, originally settled by freed slaves from Oklahoma, sounds to Samuel like the perfect place to start a new life, one that would allow him to live up to his potential, and he decides to exchange the drudgery of the city for the simplicity of small-town existence. When Samuel leaves his office for good after yet another minor humiliation, we cheer his resolve and look forward to what the coming days will bring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samuel believes that he is setting on a path to fulfill his personal expectations, but we begin to see the signs of what one reviewer has called Samuel’s “pathological temerity.” He doesn’t tell his family what has happened: not that he’s inherited the house, or that he plans to move there or even that he’s quit his job. Instead, he spends his days tinkering in the shed, emerging at just the right time to make it seem like he’s coming home from work. The truth comes out only when one of his daughters discovers his secret. His deception points to a paralyzing inability to communicate with others and suggests that this new beginning may be as fruitless as the last.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maud and the twins, Chloe and Yvette, resist the move to Aster, but are helpless in the face of Samuel’s conviction that this is the right thing to do. And when they arrive, their new home — a gloomy, worn-down remnant of days long past — doesn’t exactly fill them with hope. But the seeds of renewal have been sown, the move has been made and they hesitantly take up their new lives. At first, the Tynes seem to be settling in — they meet some of their neighbours, Samuel sets up his own electronics shop, Maud begins to fix up the house and the twins are curious enough to at least begin exploring their new home. However, the idealized Aster of Samuel’s imagination proves to be as false as his family’s veneer of acceptance, and a dark undercurrent of small-mindedness, racism and violence soon turns on the town’s newest residents. When mysterious fires begin to destroy local buildings, and the bizarre yet brilliant twins retreat into their own dark world, Samuel’s fabled second chance slips slowly out of his grasp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Second Life of Samuel Tyne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a harrowing and beautifully written work of fiction, one that shows us how fragile our dreams can be in the face of the relentless march of time. Esi Edugyan’s evocative writing and pitch-perfect ability to get into the minds of her characters confirm that this book heralds the arrival of a major new novelist.</description>

  <description>Set in the reign of King John, when the whole of England was under sentence of excommunication (among other issues, King John wouldn't accept the Pope's choice of Archbishop). Can you imagine the chaos - all the churches closed, King John in retaliation arresting every priest who hadn't fled and the people terrified of dying in sin without the last rites? No burials were permitted on consecrated land, no marriages were conducted, no babies baptized. But I don't want to reveal much more, except to say the plot involves people-trafficking, murder and, oh yes... a very feisty dwarf and a eunuch with a hunger for revenge.</description>

  <description>A contemporary take on the classic creature-feature genre. INFESTATION is a thrilling, fast-paced story that will leave your skin crawling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Andy Greenwood is sent to the Reclamation School for Boys he expects the lousy food, mean drill sergeant instructors, and brutal bullies. What he doesn't expect is an infestation of weirdly large and aggressive ants, or the itching welts all over the staff and students. Even odder, Andy learns that kids never leave the school when they're supposed to. They just seem to get stuck there indefinitely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following a ground-splitting earthquake, however, things quickly go from bad to horrifying. The school is overrun by monstrous bugs, and Andy himself comes face to face with mutant ants the size of humans, equipped with pinchers that can cut steel. Trapped in a cinderblock institutional building in the New Mexico desert, miles from civilization, Andy must figure out a way to save himself and the surviving boys from this nightmare.</description>

A skeleton crew of fifteen fight boredom and despair as they wait for a relief ship to take them home. But the world beyond their frozen wasteland has gone to hell. Cities lie ravaged by a global pandemic. One by one TV channels die, replaced by silent wavebands. The Rampart crew are marooned.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Of course it was love for my children, love for my son, that caused me to act as I did. It was a lapse of judgement. If I could have foreseen the rippling aftershocks that followed I would have acted differently, but by the time I realised the extent of the consequences, it was too late.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MacBrides have always gone to Far Barn in Devon for Bonfire Night, but this year everything is different. Lydia, the matriarch, is dead; Sophie, the eldest daughter, is desperately trying to repair a crumbling marriage; and Felix, the youngest of the family, has brought a girlfriend with him for the first time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The girl, Kerry, seems odd in a way nobody can quite put their finger on - but when they leave her looking after Sophie's baby daughter, and return to find both Kerry and the baby gone, they are forced to ask themselves if they have allowed a cuckoo into their nest...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gripping and chilling, with a killer twist, &lt;em&gt;The Burning Air&lt;/em&gt; reaffirms Erin Kelly as one of Britain's foremost psychological thriller writers.</description>

  <description>Rebecca Lee, one of our most gifted and original short story writers, guides readers into a range of landscapes, both foreign and domestic, crafting stories as rich as novels. A student plagiarizes a paper and holds fast to her alibi until she finds herself complicit in the resurrection of one professor's shadowy past. A dinner party becomes the occasion for the dissolution of more than one marriage. A woman is hired to find a wife for the one true soulmate she's ever found. In all, Rebecca Lee traverses the terrain of infidelity, obligation, sacrifice, jealousy, and yet finally, optimism. Showing people at their most vulnerable, Lee creates characters so wonderfully flawed, so driven by their desire, so compelled to make sense of their human condition, that it's impossible not to feel for them when their fragile belief in romantic love, domestic bliss, or academic seclusion fails to provide them with the sort of force field they'd expected.</description>

  <description>Hidden away in an Oxford back street is a crumbling Georgian mansion, unknown to any but the few who possess a key to its unassuming front gate. Its owner is the mercurial, charismatic Mark Winters, whose rackety trust-fund upbringing has left him as troubled and unpredictable as he is wildly promiscuous. Mark gathers around him an impressionable group of students: glamorous Emmanuella, who always has a new boyfriend in tow; Franny and Simon, best friends and occasional lovers; musician Jess, whose calm exterior hides passionate depths. And James, already damaged by Oxford and looking for a group to belong to. For a time they live in a charmed world of learning and parties and love affairs. But university is no grounding for adult life, and when, years later, tragedy strikes they are entirely unprepared. Universal in its themes of ambition, desire and betrayal, this spellbinding novel reflects the truth that the lessons life teaches often come too late.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A blistering collection of stories from an exhilarating new voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One man kills another after neither will move his pickup truck from the road. A female sheriff in a flooded town attempts to cover up a murder. When a farmer harvesting a field accidentally runs over his son, his grief sets him off walking, mile after mile. A band of teens bent on destruction runs amok in a deserted town at night. As these men and women lash out at the inscrutable churn of the world around them, they find a grim measure of peace in their solitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throughout &lt;em&gt;Volt&lt;/em&gt;, Alan Heathcock’s stark realism is leavened by a lyric energy that matches the brutality of the surface. And as you move through the wind-lashed landscape of these stories, faint signs of hope appear underfoot. In &lt;em&gt;Volt&lt;/em&gt;, the work of a writer who’s hell-bent on wrenching out whatever beauty this savage world has to offer, Heathcock’s tales of lives set afire light up the sky like signal flares touched off in a moment of desperation.</description>

  <description>It is a poem that narrates the triumphs of a war hero. With the essence of romanticism, the poem highlights the genius of Byron as a poet of that era. The skilful amalgamation of emotions and intellect of characters with the plot creates a continuous flow of ideas. This factor combined with Byron's writing prowess resulted in this classic.</description>

  <description>Kailey Rooke, timid accountant, dedicated to philanthropic work, finds herself spiraling into a deep depression after she suffers a horrifyingly odd and humiliating assault, to only discover more of these freakish assaults occurring across the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance discovery leads Kailey to a meeting with elderly Gunthreon, actual master of persuasion. Gunthreon, who seems to know too much of Kailey's history for her liking, opens Kailey's eyes to a coexisting realm she never knew existed: Renhala, while entrusting her with the knowledge of her newfound power as karmelean, serving as a beacon to the Higher Ones. Kailey slowly starts revealing new talents, and Gunthreon is fascinated with what she starts achieving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She soon discovers that Renhala is in danger, and this danger has been leaking into her own realm. As she uncovers secrets within herself, and attempts to toughen up, she fuses with an unlikely band of fellow travelers (including a dragon, woodsprite, six-hundred-pound greble, her faithful female canine companion, and a "giver"), falls into an unexpected love triangle, deals with her sexy and flirtatious best friend’s “issues,” and finds the courage to master a new deadly weapon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her mission to save Renhala, Kailey will find herself running from life-threatening disasters, such as greble Tartarin, who likes to remind Kailey that when he catches her, he plans on eating her brains with ice cream; she'll run from the deadly meeples: small cute bunnies with talons and an undeniable thirst for imposing self-destruction on others. Kailey will also run into the possibility that a centuries-old Renhalan rumor is true, that advanced technology existing in Kailey's realm shortens all life spans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As blood is shed and puzzles near completion, Kailey pulls from deep within herself, conjuring up mystical qualities that enable her to astonish as once predicted at her birth, but despite the newfound strength, Kailey will discover that monsters not only come in ugly packages, but can be easily disguised as those she has come to love and trust.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Soon there must come a day when I can say for myself: This and that I shall do, this and that I shall not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Philida is the mother of four children by Francois Brink, the son of her master. The year is 1832 and the Cape is rife with rumours about the liberation of the slaves. Philida decides to risk her whole life by lodging a complaint against Francois, who has reneged on his promise to set her free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His father has ordered him to marry a white woman from a prominent Cape Town family, and Philida will be sold on to owners in the harsh country up north. Unwilling to accept this fate, Philida continues to test the limits of her freedom, and with the Muslim slave Labyn she sets off on a journey across the great wilderness on the banks of the Gariep River, to the far north of Cape Town. &lt;em&gt;Philida&lt;/em&gt; is an unforgettable story of one woman’s determination to survive and be free.</description>

  <description>PEN/Faulkner Award finalist and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Ron Rash turns again to Appalachia to capture lives haunted by violence and tenderness, hope and fear, in unforgettable stories that span from the Civil War to the present day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the title story, two drug-addicted friends return to the farm where they worked as boys to steal their former boss's gruesomely unusual war trophies. In "The Trusty," which first appeared in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, a prisoner sent to fetch water for his chain gang tries to sweet-talk a farmer's young wife into helping him escape, only to find that she is as trapped as he is. In "Something Rich and Strange," a diver is called upon to pull a drowned girl's body free from under a falls, but he finds her eerily at peace below the surface. The violence of Rash's characters and their raw settings are matched only by their resonance and stark beauty, a masterful combination that has earned Rash an avalanche of praise.</description>

  <description>Ruprecht Van Doren is an overweight genius whose hobbies include very difficult maths and the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence.  Daniel 'Skippy' Juster is his roommate.  In the grand old Dublin institution that is Seabrook College for Boys, nobody pays either of them much attention.  But when Skippy falls for Lori, the Frisbee-playing Siren from the girls' school next door, suddenly all kinds of people take an interest – including Carl, part-time drug-dealer and official school psychopath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While his teachers battle over modernisation, and Ruprecht attempts to open a portal into a parallel universe, Skippy, in the name of love, is heading for a showdown – in the form of a fatal doughnut-eating race that only one person will survive. This unlikely tragedy will explode Seabrook's century-old complacency and bring all kinds of secrets into the light, until teachers and pupils alike discover that the fragile lines dividing past from present, love from betrayal – and even life from death – have become almost impossible to read . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A bold, arresting new work of fiction from the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Everything Matters!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this tour de force of imagination, Ron Currie asks why literal veracity means more to us than deeper truths, creating yet again a genre-bending novel that will at once dazzle, move, and provoke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The protagonist of Ron Currie, Jr.’s new novel has a problem­—or rather, several of them. He’s a writer whose latest book was destroyed in a fire. He’s mourning the death of his father, and has been in love with the same woman since grade school, a woman whose beauty and allure is matched only by her talent for eluding him. Worst of all, he’s not even his own man, but rather an amalgam of fact and fiction from Ron Currie’s own life. When Currie the character exiles himself to a small Caribbean island to write a new book about the woman he loves, he eventually decides to fake his death, which turns out to be the best career move he’s ever made. But fame and fortune come with a price, and Currie learns that in a time of twenty-four-hour news cycles, reality TV, and celebrity Twitter feeds, the one thing the world will not forgive is having been told a deeply satisfying lie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What kind of distinction could, or should, be drawn between Currie the author and Currie the character?  Or between the book you hold in your hands and the novel embedded in it? Whatever the answers, Currie, an inventive writer always eager to test the boundaries of storytelling in provocative ways, has essential things to impart along the way about heartbreak, reality, grief, deceit, human frailty, and blinding love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;For readers of Jonathan Franzen and Richard Russo, Jonathan Dee’s novels are masterful works of literary fiction. In this sharply observed tale of self-invention and public scandal, Dee raises a trenchant question: what do we really want when we ask for forgiveness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a privileged and loving couple, the Armsteads have now reached a breaking point. Ben, a partner in a prestigious law firm, has become unpredictable at work and withdrawn at home—a change that weighs heavily on his wife, Helen, and their preteen daughter, Sara. Then, in one afternoon, Ben’s recklessness takes an alarming turn, and everything the Armsteads have built together unravels, swiftly and spectacularly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrust back into the working world, Helen finds a job in public relations and relocates with Sara from their home in upstate New York to an apartment in Manhattan. There, Helen discovers she has a rare gift, indispensable in the world of image control: She can convince arrogant men to admit their mistakes, spinning crises into second chances. Yet redemption is more easily granted in her professional life than in her personal one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she is confronted with the biggest case of her career, the fallout from her marriage, and Sara’s increasingly distant behavior, Helen must face the limits of accountability and her own capacity for forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;We want our son returned. This girl is proof that we can save you all. If you ignore our plea, we will kill our hostages one at a time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be a Pure is to be perfect, untouched by Detonations that scarred the earth and sheltered inside the paradise that is the Dome. But Partridge escaped to the outside world, where Wretches struggle to survive amid smoke and ash. Now, at the command of Partridge’s father, the Dome is unleashing nightmare after nightmare upon the Wretches in an effort to get him back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Partridge’s side is a small band of those united against the Dome: Lyda, the warrior; Bradwell, the revolutionary; El Capitan, the guard; and Pressia, the young woman whose mysterious past ties her to Partridge in way she never could have imagined. Long ago a plan was hatched that could mean the earth’s ultimate doom. Now only Partridge and Pressia can set things right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To save millions of innocent lives, Partridge must risk his own by returning to the Dome and facing his most terrifying challenge. And Pressia, armed only with a mysterious Black Box, containing a set of cryptic clues, must travel to the very ends of the earth, to a place where no map can guide her. If they succeed, the world will be saved. But should they fail, humankind will pay a terrible price...</description>

  <description>"I love these poems." &lt;strong&gt;—Joe Dunthorne, author of &lt;em&gt;Submarine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Funny, surprising and lyrical, these poems range from the deserts of the Southwest to the abysses of Facebook. From online dating to beauty pageants, Greek mythology to road trips, Leigh Stein gives us resilient young women in longing and in love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Post-confessional—like Sylvia Plath raised on MTV, or Anne Sexton on Twitter—the poems seduce with a narrative hook or startle with a pop culture reference, all the while wrestling fresh meaning out of our fantasy-saturated modern lives.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Leigh Stein’s first novel, &lt;em&gt;The Fallback Plan&lt;/em&gt;, was hailed as “beautiful, funny, thrilling, and true” by Gary Shteyngart (&lt;em&gt;Super Sad True Love Story&lt;/em&gt;). A former &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; staffer and frequent contributor to its “Book Bench” blog, Stein is also the author of the poetry chapbook &lt;em&gt;How to Mend a Broken Heart with Vengeance&lt;/em&gt;, and is the winner of the Amy Award from &lt;em&gt;Poets &amp;amp; Writers&lt;/em&gt; magazine. She lives in Brooklyn.</description>

  <description>He's nameless, faceless, and has nothing left to lose - and now he has a gun! Alone except for his beloved bulldog, Churchill, a man who's failed at his career, his marriage, and his own simple hopes makes his way across the American landscape and the spectacle of his own bitter past, heading home to his brother when he knows there's no home left for him. Tom Piccirilli brings us a story for our current struggling times, taken directly from a broken heart. It is full of realism, grit, and a depth that gives voice to the fears most of us can barely imagine. The terror of loss, the overwhelming dread of failure, the horror of missed-out, mediocre dreams. And the all-too average explosive rage.</description>

  <description>Stewart Gilmour is back in Stonemouth, Scotland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After five years in exile his presence is required at the funeral of local patriarch Joe Murston, even though the last time Stewart saw the Murstons he was running for his life. An estuary town north of Aberdeen, Stonemouth, with its five mile beach, can be beautiful on a sunny day. On a bleak one it can seem to offer little more than sea fog, gangsters, cheap drugs, and a suspension bridge irresistible to suicides. And although there's supposed to be a temporary truce between Stewart and the town's biggest crime family, it's soon clear that only Stewart is taking this promise of peace seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before long a quick drop into the cold, grey Stoun River begins to look like the easy option, but as he steps back into the minefield of his past to confront his guilt and all that it has lost him, Stewart uncovers ever darker stories, and his homecoming takes a more lethal turn than even he had anticipated. Tough, funny, fast-paced, and touching, renowned storyteller Iain Banks poignantly evokes adolescence, love, brotherhood, and vengeance in a rite-of-passage novel unlike any other.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Something is wrong in Niceville&lt;/strong&gt;. . .  &lt;br&gt;A boy literally disappears from Main Street.  A security camera captures the moment of his instant, inexplicable vanishing. An audacious bank robbery goes seriously wrong: four cops are gunned down; a TV news helicopter is shot and spins crazily out of the sky, triggering a disastrous cascade of events that ricochet across twenty different lives over the course of just thirty-six hours. &lt;br&gt;Nick Kavanaugh, a cop with a dark side, investigates. Soon he and his wife, Kate, a distinguished lawyer from an old Niceville family, find themselves struggling to make sense not only of the disappearance and the robbery but also of a shadow world, where time has a different rhythm and where justice is elusive.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. . .Something is wrong in Niceville, where evil lives far longer than men do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compulsively readable, and populated with characters who leap off the page, &lt;em&gt;Niceville&lt;/em&gt; will draw you in, excite you, amaze you, horrify you, and, when it finally lets you go, make you sorry you have to leave.&lt;br&gt;Read the first thirty-five pages.  Find out why Harlan Coben calls Carsten Stroud the master of “the nerve-jangling thrill ride.”</description>

  <description>From the author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best seller &lt;em&gt;Swamplandia!&lt;/em&gt;—a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize—a magical new collection of stories that showcases Karen Russell’s gifts at their inimitable best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A dejected teenager discovers that the universe is communicating with him through talismanic objects left behind in a seagull’s nest.  A community of girls held captive in a silk factory slowly transmute into human silkworms, spinning delicate threads from their own bellies, and escape by seizing the means of production for their own revolutionary ends. A massage therapist discovers she has the power to heal by manipulating the tattoos on a war veteran’s lower torso. When a group of boys stumble upon a mutilated scarecrow bearing an uncanny resemblance to the missing classmate they used to torment, an ordinary tale of high school bullying becomes a sinister fantasy of guilt and atonement. In a family’s disastrous quest for land in the American West, the monster is the human hunger for acquisition, and the victim is all we hold dear. And in the collection’s marvelous title story—an unforgettable parable of addiction and appetite, mortal terror and mortal love—two vampires in a sun-drenched lemon grove try helplessly to slake their thirst for blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Karen Russell is one of today’s most celebrated and vital writers—honored in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s list of the twenty best writers under the age of forty, Granta’s Best of Young American Novelists, and the National Book Foundation’s five best writers under the age of thirty-five.  Her wondrous new work displays a young writer of superlative originality and invention coming into the full range and scale of her powers.  &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A new breed…a new evil…&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hidden deep beneath its landfill lair of trash and filth, a strange new organism has come to life.  When an accidental fire drives it out, the mysterious creature escapes across the drought-blasted Kansas prairie and finds the home of elderly hoarder Anna Grish.  In desperate need of shelter, it burrows in, concealed amidst the squalor and mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Adult Protective Services force Anna to vacate her junk-riddled home, she moves in with her son and his family.  But there is something wrong with Anna, something more than her declining mental condition and severe hoarding disorder.  Something sinister has taken hold of her, and it’s not only getting stronger, it’s spreading.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amidst the wide-open Kansas plains, with endless blue sky above and flat, open vista stretching from one horizon to the next, there is nowhere to hide from…THE HOARD.</description>

  <description>WEREWOLVES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Crispin has engineered the saviors of mankind: Pavlov’s Dogs, a team of soldiers capable of transforming into fearsome beasts. But when Crispin and his team welcome a new talented neurotechnician to the island, Dr. Crispin quickly realizes his masterwork has fallen into the hands of a man he does not trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ZOMBIES&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back on the mainland, Ken Bishop and his best friend Jorge get caught in a traffic jam on their way home from work. There’s a wreck up ahead. And something worse. The first sign of a major outbreak—and Ken and Jorge are stuck in the gridlock. They quickly realize that they not only need to escape, but they also need to save as many people as possible on the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ARMAGEDDON&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Dr. Crispin and his team must make a terrible decision. Should they send the Dogs out into the zombie apocalypse to rescue survivors? Or should they listen to the new neurotechnician, who would have them hoard their resources and post the Dogs as island guards?</description>

  <description>He looked to the sky, praying for rain, a downpour, some sign from the heavens that he should refuse the abomination contained in that flask. But all he saw was the bloated white face of the moon smiling down on him …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the sky around it was cold and clear and black …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They made their circle of blood. And only the moon witnessed the slaughter that followed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Jamie Mackie, summer holidays in the coastal town of Rocky Head mean surfing, making money, and good times at the local music festival. But this year, vampires are on the festival’s line-up … fulfilling a pact made on the wreck of the Batavia, four hundred years ago. If their plans succeed, nobody in Rocky Head will survive to see out the new year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Page-turning and suspenseful, Saltwater Vampires is a distinctly Australian vampire thriller.</description>

  <description>The village of Hemmersmoor is a place untouched by time and shrouded in superstition: There is the grand manor house whose occupants despise the villagers, the small pub whose regulars talk of revenants, the old mill no one dares to mention. This is where four young friends come of age—in an atmosphere thick with fear and suspicion. Their innocent games soon bring them face-to-face with the village's darkest secrets in this eerily dispassionate, astonishingly assured novel, evocative of Stephen King's classic short story "Children of the Corn" and infused with the spirit of the Brothers Grimm.</description>

  <description>This lyrical tale of evil, loss, and redemption is a stunning addition to the Southern gothic tradition of Flannery O’Connor and Harry Crews.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Choir of Ill Children&lt;/strong&gt; is the startling story of Kingdom Come, a decaying, swamp backwater that draws the lost, ill-fated, and damned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since his mother’s disappearance and his father’s suicide, Thomas has cared for his three brothers—conjoined triplets with separate bodies but one shared brain—and the town’s only industry, the Mill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of his family’s prominence, Thomas is feared and respected by the superstitious swamp folk. Granny witches cast hexes while Thomas’s childhood sweetheart drifts through his life like a vengeful ghost and his best friend, a reverend suffering from the power of tongues, is overcome with this curse as he tries to warn of impending menace. All Thomas learns is that “the carnival is coming.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn by responsibility and rage, Thomas must face his tormented past as well as the mysterious forces surging toward the town he loves and despises.</description>

  <description>Poetry. Each new volume by Stuart Ross is a more confounding grab bag than the last. In YOU EXIST. DETAILS FOLLOW., his seventh full-length collection of poetry, Stuart Ross veers in opposite directions: narrative confessionalism poems, and works that might be considered abstract expressionist, and a lot both in between and beyond those boundaries. Still, each poem breathes with the signature weirdness, the sharp wit and gentle awe that Ross is known for. Here you'll find poems from Ross's ongoing auto-biographical Razovsky series, one-line poems, centos, fractured sonnets, poems composed through surrealist strategies, and more.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;A mind-bending, genre-twisting debut novel&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In West Akron, there lived a reclusive elderly man who always wore mittens, even in July. He had no friends and no family; all over town, he was known only as the Man from Primrose Lane. And on a summer day in 2008, someone murdered him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years later, David Neff is a broken man. The bestselling author of a true-crime book about an Ohio serial killer, Neff went into exile after his wife’s inexplicable suicide. That is, until an unexpected visit from an old friend introduces him to the strange mystery of “the man with a thousand mittens.” Soon Neff finds himself drawn back into a world he thought he had left behind forever. But the closer he gets to uncovering the true identity of the Man from Primrose Lane, the more he begins to understand the dangerous power of his own obsessions and how they may be connected to the deaths of both his beloved wife and the old hermit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a deft and singular blend of suspense, literature, and horror, &lt;em&gt;The Man from Primrose Lane&lt;/em&gt; boasts as many twists and turns as a roller coaster. It’s a spellbinding journey of redemption and a reflection on the roles of fate, destiny, and obsession when it comes to matters of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the fields and forests of western New York State in the late 1960s, several dozen idealists set out to live off the land, founding what becomes a famous commune centered on the grounds of a decaying mansion called Arcadia House. Arcadia follows this lyrical, rollicking, tragic, and exquisite utopian dream from its hopeful start through its heyday and after. The story is told from the point of view of Bit, a fascinating character and the first child born in Arcadia.</description>

  <description>It is Christmas afternoon and Peter Martin gets an unexpected phone call from his parents, asking him to come round. It pulls him away from his wife and children and into a bewildering mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He arrives at his parents house and discovers that they have a visitor. His sister Tara. Not so unusual you might think, this is Christmas after all, a time when families get together. But twenty years ago Tara took a walk into the woods and never came back and as the years have gone by with no word from her the family have, unspoken, assumed that she was dead. Now she's back, tired, dirty, disheveled, but happy and full of stories about twenty years spent traveling the world, an epic odyssey taken on a whim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her stories don't quite hang together and once she has cleaned herself up and got some sleep it becomes apparent that the intervening years have been very kind to Tara. She really does look no different from the young woman who walked out the door twenty years ago. Peter's parents are just delighted to have their little girl back, but Peter and his best friend Richie, Tara's one time boyfriend, are not so sure. Tara seems happy enough but there is something about her. A haunted, otherworldly quality. Some would say it's as if she's off with the fairies. And as the months go by Peter begins to suspect that the woods around their homes are not finished with Tara and his family...</description>

  <description>A #1 best seller in Canada, award-winning author Kathleen Winter's debut novel is an intimate portrait of the family of a mixed-gendered child born into a remote, blue-collar sea-side town in Eastern Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1968, into the devastating, beautiful landscape of Labrador, a child is born: a baby who appears to be neither fully boy nor fully girl, but both at once. Only three people are privy to the secret--the baby's parents, Jacinta and Treadway, and their trusted neighbor and midwife, Thomasina. Though Treadway makes the difficult decision to raise the child as a boy named Wayne, the women continue to quietly nurture the child's female side. And as Wayne grows into adulthood within the hypermasculine hunting society of his father, his shadow-self, a girl he thinks of as "Annabel", is never entirely extinguished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Wayne finally escapes the confines of his hometown and settles in St. John's, the anonymity of the city grants him the freedom to confront his dual identity. His ultimate choice will once again call into question the integrity and allegiance of those he loves most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kathleen Winter has crafted a literary gem about the urge to unveil a mysterious truth in a culture that shuns contradiction, and the body's insistence on coming home. A daringly unusual debut full of unforgettable beauty, &lt;em&gt;Annabel&lt;/em&gt; introduces a remarkable new voice to American readers.</description>

  <description>A collection of stories and novellas about the choices we face and where those decisions lead us, including “A Day Meant to Do Less,” a &lt;em&gt;Best American Mystery Stories 2008 &lt;/em&gt;selection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A schoolteacher escapes East Berlin at night, swimming the Spree River three times carrying elderly relatives on her back, so she can make her way to West Palm Beach, Florida, and “ruin the lives of fifth grade boys.” A young husband reckons with the likelihood that his wife’s troubled pregnancy will end with her death before Christmas. A preacher bathes his ill and elderly mother, not knowing that she has mistaken him for the long-lost cousin she watched murder his brother in her father’s tobacco field. In six stories that read like novels in miniature, Kyle Minor plumbs the depths of human mystery, where they meet our kindnesses and our cruelties, our generosities and our pettiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyle Minor&lt;/strong&gt;’s work has appeared widely in magazines and anthologies, among them &lt;em&gt;Best American Mystery Stories 2008&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Southern Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Gettysburg Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Surreal South&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Twentysomething Essays by Twentysomething Writers: The Best New Voices of 2006&lt;/em&gt;. His work has been twice nominated for the Pushcart Prize. Kyle received his MFA from Ohio State University and is currently a visiting professor at the University of Toledo.</description>

  <description>A breakout novel for a young writer whose last book was shortlisted for the Trillium Prize alongside Anne Michaels and Margaret Atwood, and whom the &lt;em&gt;Toronto Star &lt;/em&gt;called a "force of nature."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hazel Hayes is a grad student living in New York City. As the novel opens, she learns she is pregnant (from an affair with her married professor) at an apocalyptically bad time: random but deadly attacks on passers-by, all by blonde women, are terrorizing New Yorkers. Soon it becomes clear that the attacks are symptoms of a strange illness that is transforming blondes--whether CEOs, flight attendants, skateboarders or accountants--into rabid killers. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Hazel, vulnerable because of her pregnancy, decides to flee the city--but finds that the epidemic has spread and that the world outside New York is even stranger than she imagined. She sets out on a trip across a paralyzed America to find the one woman--perhaps blonde, perhaps not--who might be able to help her. Emily Schultz's beautifully realized novel is a mix of satire, thriller, and serious literary work. With echoes of &lt;strong&gt;Blindness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;The Handmaid's Tale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;amplified by a biting satiric wit, &lt;strong&gt;The Blondes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is at once an examination of the complex relationships between women, and a merciless but giddily enjoyable portrait of what happens in a world where beauty is--literally--deadly.</description>

  <description>This unusual fictional account - in good part autobiographical - narrates without self-pity and often with humor the adventures of a penniless British writer among the down-and-out of two great cities. The Parisian episode is fascinating for its expose of the kitchens of posh French restaurants, where the narrator works at the bottom of the culinary echelon as dishwasher, or plongeur.  In London, while waiting for a job, he experiences the world of tramps, street people, and free lodging houses. In the tales of both cities we learn some sobering Orwellian truths about poverty and society.</description>

  <description>In this unforgettable work of fiction, Donald Ray Pollock peers into the soul of a tough Midwestern American town to reveal the sad, stunted but resilient lives of its residents. &lt;strong&gt;Knockemstiff &lt;/strong&gt;is a genuine entry into the literature of place.Spanning a period from the mid-sixties to the late nineties, the linked stories that comprise &lt;strong&gt;Knockemstiff &lt;/strong&gt;feature a cast of recurring characters who are irresistibly, undeniably real. A father pumps his son full of steroids so he can vicariously relive his days as a perpetual runner-up body builder. A psychotic rural recluse comes upon two siblings committing incest and feels compelled to take action. Donald Ray Pollock presents his characters and the sordid goings-on with a stern intelligence, a bracing absence of value judgments, and a refreshingly dark sense of bottom-dog humor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Join Farm today! It's only six years of your life! Farm is the mega-conglomerate food supplier for City, populated with rabidly bureaucratic superiors, antagonistic and sexually deviant tour guides dressed in chicken and duck suits, and farm animals illegally engineered for silence. City is sprawling, technocratic, and rests hundreds of feet above the coastline on the creaking shoulders of a giant wooden pier. When the narrator's single mother, whom he left behind in City, falls out of contact, he fears the worst: his mother is homeless and subsequently to be deported under City to the Pier. On his desperate search to find his mother, he encounters ecoterrorists wearing plush animal suits, an election that hangs in the balance as the City's all-powerful Mayor is infatuated with magic refrigerators and outlaw campaigns, and a wise-cracking, over-sexed priest who may or may not have ESP, but who is most certainly his deadbeat dad. Whether rebelling against the regimented and ridiculous nature of Farm life, exploring the all-too-familiar and consumer-obsessed world of City, experiencing the all-too-real suffering of the homeless in Pier, or confronting the secrets of his own childhood, Swallowing a Donkey's Eye's narrator is a hilarious, neurotic, and rage-filled Quixote searching for his mother, his own dignity, and the meaning of humanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A Thousand Morons&lt;/em&gt;, Quim Monzó's latest collection of short stories, is rife with very unfortunate characters.  There's the young boy in "A Cut" who is upbraided by his teacher when he rudely shows up for class with a huge gash in his neck.  And the prince in "One Night" who tries everything to awaken a sleeping princess - yet fails completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seeing that this is a Quim Monzó collection, absurdity offsets the "moronic" sadness. Such as "Love is Eternal," which features a man who decides to finally overcome his commitment issues and marry his dying girlfriend, only to have everything backfire; or, "The Fullness of Summer," in which a family meticulously records every meticulous moment of their gathering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An excellent combination of longer, elegiac stories of "morons," aging, and the passage of time with short, flashier pieces that display Monzó's wit and playfulness make this one of the strongest collections in the oeuvre of Catalan's short fiction master.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Today's best known writer in Catalan. He is also, no exaggeration, one of the world's great short-story writers."&lt;br&gt;     -&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A gifted writer, he draws well on the rich tradition of Spanish surrealism . . . to sustain the lyrical, visionary quality of his imagination."&lt;br&gt;     -&lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>"Your mother hollers that you're going to miss the bus. She can see it coming down the street. You don't stop and hug her and tell her you love her. You don't thank her for being a good, kind, patient mother. Of course not--you launch yourself down the stairs and make a run for the corner. &lt;br&gt;""Only, if it's the last time you'll ever see your mother, you sort of start to wish you'd stopped and did those things. Maybe even missed the bus. &lt;br&gt;""But the bus was barreling down our street, so I ran. &lt;br&gt;"Fourteen kids. One superstore. A million things that go wrong. &lt;br&gt;In Emmy Laybourne's action-packed debut novel, six high school kids (some popular, some not), two eighth graders (one a tech genius), and six little kids trapped together in a chain superstore build a refuge for themselves inside. While outside, a series of escalating disasters, beginning with a monster hailstorm and ending with a chemical weapons spill, seems to be tearing the world--as they know it--apart.</description>

  <description>Who is leading the rabble to victory? Toreth shifted against the wall, trying to get comfortable. Between bruises and handcuffs, he didn't have much success. On the first day, in the first cell, the lights had been on, the water dispenser working, and the prisoner feeding schedule still running. Then the lights went out, and things had gone steadily downhill from there. Now, he sat in darkness so absolute that he couldn't see a hand in front of his face, if he'd been in a position to check. The last time he'd been taken out of the cell it had been light in the corridors, which was something. If the power to the building failed totally, they would suffocate down here. At the moment, the air cycling was still functional, feeding chill air into the cell--like the lights, the heating systems had been switched off or had broken down. He couldn't accurately estimate when he'd last eaten. Two days or so, probably, but he was starting to feel the effects. The water system worried him most. It worked only intermittently and the water had an unpleasant, overly chemical flavor. The systems were failing. Something had gone badly wrong, and had continued to go wrong for so long that he'd been forced unwillingly to conclude that it had to have hit more than I&amp;amp;I. Revolution has come to the Administration, as the citizens rise up against government and corporate oppression. With old and new enemies all around them, what will the new future hold for despised para-investigator Val Toreth, and corporate highflier Keir Warrick? And how long will that future last?</description>

  <description>Based on an actual crime in 1955, this YA novel is at once a mystery and a coming-of-age story. The brutal murder of two teenage girls on the last day of Nora Cunningham's junior year in high school throws Nora into turmoil. Her certainties, friendships, religion, her prudence, her resolve to find a boyfriend taller than she is - are shaken or cast off altogether. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people in Elmgrove, Maryland, share the comforting conviction that Buddy Novak, who had every reason to want his ex-girlfriend dead, is responsible for the killings. Nora agrees at first, then begins to doubt Buddy's guilt, and finally comes to believe him innocent - the lone dissenting voice in Elmgrove.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told from several different perspectives, including that of the murderer, &lt;em&gt;Mister Death's Blue-Eyed Girls&lt;/em&gt; is a suspenseful page-turner with a powerful human drama at its core.</description>

  <description>Ivan, a one-time world traveler, and Francesca, a ravishing Italian heiress, are the owners of a bookstore that is anything but ordinary. Rebelling against the business of bestsellers and in search of an ideal place where their literary dreams can come true, Ivan and Francesca open a store where the passion for literature is given free reign. Tucked away in a corner of Paris, the store offers its clientele a selection of literary masterpieces chosen by a top-secret committee of likeminded literary connoisseurs. To their amazement, after only a few months, the little dream store proves a success. And that is precisely when their troubles begin. At first, both owners shrug off the anonymous threats that come their way and the venomous comments concerning their store circulating on the Internet, but when three members of the supposedly secret committee are attacked, they decide to call the police. One by one, the pieces of this puzzle fall ominously into place, as it becomes increasingly evident that Ivan and Francesca’s dreams will be answered with pettiness, envy and violence.</description>

  <description>"NW" is Zadie Smith's masterful novel about London life. Zadie Smith's brilliant tragi-comic "NW" follows four Londoners - Leah, Natalie, Felix and Nathan - after they've left their childhood council estate, grown up and moved on to different lives. From private houses to public parks, at work and at play, their city is brutal, beautiful and complicated. Yet after a chance encounter they each find that the choices they've made, the people they once were and are now, can suddenly, rapidly unravel. A portrait of modern urban life, "NW" is funny, sad and urgent - as brimming with vitality as the city itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for "NW": &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Her dialogue sings and soars; terse, packed and sassy. Smith is simply wonderful: Dickens' legitimate daughter". (Boyd Tonkin, "Independent"). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Astonishing, dazzling. Really - without exaggeration - not since Dickens has there been a better observer of London scenes. Zadie Smith is a genius. It's hard to imagine a better novel this year - or this decade". (A.N. Wilson). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Intensely funny, richly varied, always unexpected. A joyous, optimistic, angry masterpiece. No better English novel will be published this year". ("Philip Hensher, "Daily Telegraph"). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Absolutely brilliant. So electrically authentic". ("Time). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Captivating. Funny, sexy, weird, full of acute social comedy, like London. She's up there with the best around". ("Evening Standard"). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Marvellous ...crackles with reflections on race, music and migration. A lyrical fiction for our times". ("Spectator"). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Undeniably brilliant ...rush out and buy this book". ("Observer"). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zadie Smith was born in north-west London in 1975. She is the author of the novels "White Teeth", "The Autograph Man" and "On Beauty", and of a collection of essays, "Changing My Mind". She is also the editor of "The Book of Other People".</description>

  <description>“&lt;strong&gt;As original as &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, set within the walls of a high school exactly like yours.” – Kami Garcia, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;best-selling co-author of the &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Creatures&lt;/em&gt; novels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was just another ordinary day at McKinley High—until a massive explosion devastated the school. When loner David Thorpe tried to help his English teacher to safety, the teacher convulsed and died right in front of him. And that was just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, McKinley has descended into chaos. All the students are infected with a virus that makes them deadly to adults. The school is under military quarantine. The teachers are gone. Violent gangs have formed based on high school social cliques. Without a gang, you’re as good as dead. And David has no gang. It’s just him and his little brother, Will, against the whole school. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In this frighteningly dark and captivating novel, Lex Thomas locks readers inside a school where kids don’t fight to be popular, they fight to stay alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Take Michael Grant's &lt;em&gt;Gone&lt;/em&gt; and Veronica Roth's &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt;, rattle them in a cage until they're ready to fight to the death, and you'll have something like this nightmarish debut...Thomas' whirlwind pace, painful details, simmering sexual content, and moments of truly shocking ultra-violence thrust this movie-ready high school thriller to the head of the class." - &lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)</description>

  <description>Are the woods behind St. Bede's Academy really haunted, or does bad stuff just happen there? When Calista Wood, a new student, arrives midway through her junior year, St. Bede's feels like a normal school... until she discovers that a girl had disappeared a couple of months earlier. Some kids think she ran away, others think she was murdered, but it's only when Cally starts digging around that she finds the startling truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch as Cally enters a world of privilege, weekend-long parties, high school romances, and... well-kept secrets. This page-turner will appeal to teens looking for a fast-paced thriller. Written in a voice at once gripping and crystal clear, debut novelist, McCormick Templeman, will take readers on a twisting and turning journey as only a "new girl" can experience.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The town of Stillwater has a very unwelcome resident.&lt;/em&gt; The town of Stillwater has been dying—the long and painful death of a town ravaged by floods and haunted by the ghosts of all who had lived there. Yet this most recent flood has brought something with it—a creature that nests among the good folks of Stillwater...and feeds off them. The children who haven't disappeared whisper the same word—“vampire.” But they’re wrong. What has come to Stillwater is something much more horrific.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses a moment of experience from which to look ahead..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; "This is a record of hate far more than of love," writes Maurice Bendrix in the opening passages of &lt;strong&gt;The End of the Affair&lt;/strong&gt;, and it is a strange hate indeed that compels him to set down the retrospective account of his adulterous affair with Sarah Miles.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Now, a year after Sarah's death, Bendrix seeks to exorcise the persistence of his passion by retracing its course from obsessive love to love-hate. At first, he believes he hates Sarah and her husband, Henry. Yet as he delves further into his emotional outlook, Bendrix's hatred shifts to the God he feels has broken his life, but whose existence at last comes to recognize.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Originally published in 1951, &lt;strong&gt;The End of the Affair&lt;/strong&gt; was acclaimed by William Faulkner as "for me one of the best, most true and moving novels of my time, in anybody's language." &lt;strong&gt;This Penguin Deluxe Edition features an introduction by Michael Gorra.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Connor, Risa, and Lev are running for their lives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Second Civil War was fought over reproductive rights.  The chilling resolution: Life is inviolable from the moment of conception until age thirteen.  Between the ages of thirteen and eighteen, however, parents can have their child "unwound," whereby all of the child's organs are transplanted into different donors, so life doesn't technically end.  Connor is too difficult for his parents to control.  Risa, a ward of the state is not enough to be kept alive.  And Lev is a tithe, a child conceived and raised to be unwound.  Together, they may have a chance to escape and to survive.</description>

  <description>Award-winning author Jennifer Egan brilliantly conjures a world from which escape is impossible and where the keep-–the tower, the last stand-–is both everything worth protecting and the very thing that must be surrendered in order to survive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two cousins, irreversibly damaged by a childhood prank, reunite twenty years later to renovate a medieval castle in Eastern Europe. In an environment of extreme paranoia, cut off from the outside world, the men reenact the signal event of their youth, with even more catastrophic results. And as the full horror of their predicament unfolds, a prisoner, in jail for an unnamed crime, recounts an unforgettable story that seamlessly brings the crimes of the past and present into piercing relation.</description>

  <description>For bank teller Charlie Colquitt, it was just another Saturday. For Hobe Hicklin, an ex-con with nothing to lose, it was just another score. For Hobe’s drug-addled, sex-crazed girlfriend, it was just more lust, violence, and drugs. But in this gripping narrative, nothing is as it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hicklin's first mistake was double-crossing his partners in the Aryan Brotherhood. His second mistake was taking a hostage. But he and Charlie can only hide out for so long in the mountains of north Georgia before the sins of Hicklin's past catch up to them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hot on Hicklin's trail are a pair of ruthless Brotherhood soldiers, ready to burn a path of murder and mayhem to get their revenge. GBI Special Agent Sallie Crews and Sheriff Tommy Lang catch the case, themselves no strangers to the evil men are capable of. Soon Crews is making some dangerous connections while for the hard-drinking, despondent Lang, rescuing Charlie Colquitt might be the key to personal salvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prodigious talent Peter Farris has written a backwoods fairy tale of fate and flight that is also a dark, modern thriller. Like the bastard child of Stephen Hunter's &lt;em&gt;Dirty White Boys&lt;/em&gt; and Cormac McCarthy's &lt;em&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Last Call for the Living&lt;/em&gt; is a smashing debut from a writer whose unique and disturbing vision of the world cannot be ignored.</description>

  <description>Postcard-perfect Jar Island is the kind of place where nobody locks their doors at night, where parents can sleep easy, knowing their daughters are tucked away safe and sound in their beds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But bad things can happen, even to good girls . . . and sometimes, the only way to make things right is to do something wrong.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lillia used to trust boys, but not anymore. Not after what happened this summer. And she’ll do whatever it takes to protect her little sister from the same fate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kat is over the rumors, the insults, the cruel jokes made at her expense. It all goes back to one person--her ex-best friend. Someone needs to teach her a lesson, and, with Lillia and Mary behind her, Kat feels up to the task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four years ago, Mary left Jar Island because of a boy. But she’s not the same girl anymore. Now that she’s got friends who have her back, he's going to be in big trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three very different girls who come together to make things right. Will they go too far?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived–and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who’ve long forgotten her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for details–proof they hope may free Ben–Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club… and maybe she’ll admit her testimony wasn’t so solid after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby’s doomed family members–including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started–on the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>Shortly before his death, the great Romantic poet Lord Byron wrote an erotic memoir detailing his multitudinous sexual conquests. He left instructions that it was to be published upon his death. His publisher in London, however, found the manuscript too prurient for his tastes and those of the times. After consulting several of the poet's detractors in literary London at the time, the only copy of Byron's sexual memoir was burned. Lord Byron's Coda finds the spirit of one of literature's most enduring lights railing against his perfidious publisher, an unresponsive Deity, and eternity alone. The monologue provides challenges to actors, producers and designers alike. Graced with the subtitle A Monologue on Censorship and Sensuality for a Young Thespian, this intriguing and incisive rant reflects on one of literature's most enduring figures. Poetic, raunchy, without boundaries - like the great poet himself - Lord Byron's Coda is the consummate solo performance piece.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note: Alt cover image for ISBN:9780434021772&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pa'nop'ti'con (noun). A prison so constructed that the inspector can see each of the prisoners at all times, without being seen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anais Hendricks, fourteen, is in the back of a police car, headed for The Panopticon, a home for chronic young offenders. She can't remember the events that led her here, but across town a policewoman lies in a coma and there is blood on Anais's school uniform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smart, funny and fierce, Anais is a counter-culture outlaw, a bohemian philosopher in sailor shorts and a pillbox hat. She is also a child who has been let down, or worse, by just about every adult she has ever met. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The residents of The Panopticon form intense bonds, heightened by their place on the periphery, and Anais finds herself part of an ad-hoc family there. Much more suspicious are the social workers, especially Helen, who is about to leave her job for an elephant sanctuary in India but is determined to force Anais to confront the circumstances of her mother's death before she goes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking up at the watchtower that looms over the residents, Anais knows her fate: she is part of an experiment, she always was, it's a given, a liberty - a fact. And the experiment is closing in</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The mesmerizing fourth novel of the Dublin murder squad by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Tana French&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mick "Scorcher" Kennedy, the brash cop from Tana French’s bestselling &lt;em&gt;Faithful Place&lt;/em&gt;, plays by the book and plays hard. That’s what’s made him the Murder squad’s top detective—and that’s what puts the biggest case of the year into his hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one of the half-built, half-abandoned "luxury" developments that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children are dead. His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, Scorcher and his rookie partner, Richie, think it’s going to be an easy solve. But too many small things can’t be explained. The half dozen baby monitors, their cameras pointing at holes smashed in the Spains’ walls. The files erased from the Spains’ computer. The story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder who was slipping past all the locks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Broken Harbor holds memories for Scorcher. Seeing the case on the news sends his sister Dina off the rails again, and she’s resurrecting something that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control: what happened to their family one summer at Broken Harbor, back when they were children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her signature blend of police procedural and psychological thriller, French’s new novel goes full throttle with a heinous crime, creating her most complicated detective character and her best book yet.</description>

  <description>Profound . . . with more to say on the human condition than most full books. . . . A remarkable collection, with pitch-perfect leaps of imagination.” —&lt;strong&gt;Minneapolis &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horvath seems to be channeling, all at once, Borges and Calvino and Kevin Brockmeier. And it all works.” —&lt;strong&gt;REBECCA MAKKAI&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Borrower&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tim Horvath is a fluid, inventive writer who deftly interweaves the palpably real and the pyrotechnically fantastic. At once playful, deeply moving, and sharply funny, &lt;em&gt;Understories&lt;/em&gt; satisfies the mind, the heart, and the gut.” —&lt;strong&gt;KATE CHRISTENSEN&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Astral&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Great Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remarkable writing and remarkably rewarding reading: stories equally saturated in contemporary fact and transfactual acids. An atlas of canny and uncanny maps, mainly cityscapes, of the branching imagination and convoluted heart. Move over, Mercator and Google Earth: make way for Horvath’s haunting projections.” —&lt;strong&gt;BRIAN BOYD&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Stalking Nabokov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understories&lt;/em&gt; is fueled by a wonderfully inventive mind, but ultimately, it is a mind in service to the heart. Horvath’s attention is always squarely on us: who we are, who we have been, and how a great story can transform us.” —&lt;strong&gt;MATT BELL&lt;/strong&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;Cataclysm Baby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if there were a city that consisted only of restaurants? What if Paul Gauguin had gone to Greenland instead of Tahiti? What if there were a field called umbrology, the study of shadows, where physicists and shadow puppeteers worked side by side? Full of speculative daring though firmly anchored in the tradition of realism, Tim Horvath’s stories explore all of this and more— blending the everyday and wondrous to contend with age-old themes of loss, identity, imagination, and the search for human connection. Whether making offhand references to &lt;em&gt;Mystery Science Theater,&lt;/em&gt; providing a new perspective on Heidegger’s philosophy and forays into Nazism, or following the imaginary travels of a library book, Horvath’s writing is as entertaining as it is thought provoking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Tim Horvath&lt;/strong&gt; teaches creative writing at the New Hampshire Institute of Art and Boston’s Grub Street writing center. He has also worked part-time as a counselor in a psychiatric hospital, primarily with autistic children and adolescents. He lives in New Hampshire with his wife and daughter.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this apocalyptic sequel to &lt;em&gt;Dark Inside&lt;/em&gt;’s “well-balanced, realistic suspense” (&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;), four teens continue the struggle for survival as they face a world gone mad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aries, Clementine, Mason and Michael have survived the first wave of the apocalypse that wiped out most of the world’s population, and turned many of the rest into murderous Baggers. Now, they’re hiding out in an abandoned house in Vancouver with a ragtag group of surviving teens, and trying to figure out their next move. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aries is trying to lead, but it’s hard to be a leader when there are no easy answers, and every move feels wrong. Clementine is desperate to find her brother Heath, but it’s impossible to know where he’d be, even if he is still alive. Michael is still haunted by the memories of his actions during his harrowing struggle to survive. And Mason is struggling with something far worse: the fear that he may be a danger to his friends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Baggers begin to create a new world order, Aries, Clementine, Mason and Michael will have to trust and rely on each other in order to survive.</description>

  <description>From International Thriller Writers Award winner and Edgar Award nominee Tom Piccirilli, this mesmerizing suspense novel explores the bonds of family and the ways they’re stretched by guilt, justice, and the chance for redemption.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Raised in a clan of small-time thieves and grifters, Terrier Rand decided to cut free from them and go straight after his older brother, Collie, went on a killing spree that left an entire family and several others dead. Five years later, only days before his scheduled execution, Collie contacts Terry and asks him to return home. He claims he wasn’t responsible for one of the murders—and insists that the real killer is still on the loose.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Uncertain whether his brother is telling the truth, and dogged by his own regrets, Terry is drawn back into the activities of his family: His father, Pinsch, who once made a living as a cat burglar but retired after the heartbreak caused by his two sons. His cardsharp uncles, Mal and Grey, who’ve recently incurred the anger of the local mob. His grandfather, Old Shep, who has Alzheimer’s but is still a first-rate pickpocket. His teenage sister, Dale, who’s flirting with the lure of the criminal world. And Kimmy, the fiancée he abandoned, who’s now raising a child with his former best friend.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; As Terry starts to investigate what really happened on the day of Collie’s crime spree, will the truth he uncovers about their secrets tear the Rands apart?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Walking the razor-sharp edge between love and violence, with the atmospheric noir voice that is his trademark, &lt;em&gt;The Last Kind Words&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates why Tom Piccirilli has become a must-read author.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Earthy, magical, and utterly charming, this tale of family life in turn-of-the-century Mexico became a best-selling phenomenon with its winning blend of poignant romance and bittersweet wit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number one bestseller in Mexico and America for almost two years, and subsequently a bestseller around the world, "Like Water For Chocolate" is a romantic, poignant tale, touched with moments of magic, graphic earthiness, bittersweet wit - and recipes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sumptuous feast of a novel, it relates the bizarre history of the all-female De La Garza family. Tita, the youngest daughter of the house, has been forbidden to marry, condemned by Mexican tradition to look after her mother until she dies. But Tita falls in love with Pedro, and he is seduced by the magical food she cooks. In desperation, Pedro marries her sister Rosaura so that he can stay close to her. For the next twenty-two years, Tita and Pedro are forced to circle each other in unconsummated passion. Only a freakish chain of tragedies, bad luck and fate finally reunite them against all the odds.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Midwesterner Gary D. Schmidt won Newbery Honor awards for &lt;em&gt;Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boys&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Wednesday Wars&lt;/em&gt;, two coming-of-age novels about unlikely friends finding a bond. &lt;em&gt;Okay For Now&lt;/em&gt;, his latest novel, explores another seemingly improbable alliance, this one between new outsider in town Doug Swieteck and Lil Spicer, the savvy spitfire daughter of his deli owner boss. With her challenging assistance, Doug discovers new sides of himself. Along the way, he also readjusts his relationship with his abusive father, his school peers, and his older brother, a newly returned war victim of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In this Newbery Honor-winning novel, Gary D. Schmidt offers an unforgettable antihero.&lt;em&gt; The Wednesday Wars &lt;/em&gt;is a wonderfully witty and compelling story about a teenage boy’s mishaps and adventures over the course of the 1967–68 school year in Long Island, New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Holling Hoodhood, a seventh-grader at Camillo Junior High, who must spend Wednesday afternoons with his teacher, Mrs. Baker, while the rest of the class has religious instruction. Mrs. Baker doesn’t like Holling—he’s sure of it. Why else would she make him read the plays of William Shakespeare outside class? But everyone has bigger things to worry about, like Vietnam. His father wants Holling and his sister to be on their best behavior: the success of his business depends on it. But how can Holling stay out of trouble when he has so much to contend with? A bully demanding cream puffs; angry rats; and a baseball hero signing autographs the very same night Holling has to appear in a play in yellow tights! As fate sneaks up on him again and again, Holling finds Motivation—the Big M—in the most unexpected places and musters up the courage to embrace his destiny, in spite of himself.</description>

  <description>Climbing to the top of the social ladder is hard—falling from it is even harder.  Regina Afton used to be a member of the &lt;em&gt;Fearsome Fivesome&lt;/em&gt;, an all-girl clique both feared and revered by the students at Hallowell High... until vicious rumors about her and her best friend's boyfriend start going around.  Now Regina's been "frozen out" and her ex-best friends are out for revenge.  If Regina was guilty, it would be one thing, but the rumors are far from the terrifying truth and the bullying is getting more intense by the day.  She takes solace in the company of Michael Hayden, a misfit with a tragic past who she herself used to bully.  Friendship doesn't come easily for these onetime enemies, and as Regina works hard to make amends for her past, she realizes Michael could be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than just a friend... if threats from the &lt;em&gt;Fearsome Foursome&lt;/em&gt; don't break them both first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tensions grow and the abuse worsens as the final days of senior year march toward an explosive conclusion in this dark new tale from the author of &lt;em&gt;Cracked Up To Be&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Celia Reynolds is the youngest in a set of triplets and the one with the least valuable power. Anne can see the future, and Jane can see the present, but all Celia can see is the past. And the past seems so insignificant -- until Celia meets Lo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lo doesn't know who she is. Or who she was. Once a human, she is now almost entirely a creature of the sea -- a nymph, an ocean girl, a mermaid -- all terms too pretty for the soulless monster she knows she's becoming. Lo clings to shreds of her former self, fighting to remember her past, even as she's tempted to embrace her dark immortality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a handsome boy named Jude falls off a pier and into the ocean, Celia and Lo work together to rescue him from the waves. The two form a friendship, but soon they find themselves competing for Jude's affection. Lo wants more than that, though. According to the ocean girls, there's only one way for Lo to earn back her humanity. She must persuade a mortal to love her . . . and steal his soul.</description>

  <description>It's been months since the ghost of Anna Korlov opened a door to Hell in her basement and disappeared into it, but ghost-hunter Cas Lowood can't move on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His friends remind him that Anna sacrificed herself so that Cas could live—not walk around half dead. He knows they're right, but in Cas's eyes, no living girl he meets can compare to the dead girl he fell in love with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now he's seeing Anna everywhere: sometimes when he's asleep and sometimes in waking nightmares. But something is very wrong...these aren't just daydreams. Anna seems tortured, torn apart in new and ever more gruesome ways every time she appears.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cas doesn't know what happened to Anna when she disappeared into Hell, but he knows she doesn't deserve whatever is happening to her now. Anna saved Cas more than once, and it's time for him to return the favor.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s the end of the world. Six students have taken cover in Cortege High but shelter is little comfort when the dead outside won’t stop pounding on the doors. One bite is all it takes to kill a person and bring them back as a monstrous version of their former self. To Sloane Price, that doesn’t sound so bad. Six months ago, &lt;em&gt;her &lt;/em&gt;world collapsed and since then, she’s failed to find a reason to keep going. Now seems like the perfect time to give up. As Sloane eagerly waits for the barricades to fall, she’s forced to witness the apocalypse through the eyes of five people who actually &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to live. But as the days crawl by, the motivations for survival change in startling ways and soon the group’s fate is determined less and less by what’s happening outside and more and more by the unpredictable and violent bids for life—&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;death—inside. When everything is gone, what do &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;hold on to?</description>

  <description>Ben Davenant is a merchant mariner, rebel, drifter, a man who takes love and life as it comes and wants no part of the world.  During the war, the world returns the favor.  When his ship is blown up in the South Pacific, Ben is stripped of every shred of his personal identity--his face, his name, his fingerprints--and cast into the sea like a piece of wreckage.  Rescued almost against his will, Ben must at last choose who and what he wants to be.  But it is a choice he refuses to make until a dark-haired woman walks into his hospital room and says that he is her husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MacDonald Harris has written a provocative novel, a wry narrative that moves with the exciting power of an adventure story.  In scenes that range from waterfront bars and brothels to the rarefied atmosphere of the California gold coast, he creates men and women who vibrate with a life uniquely their own.  His compelling story of a man's triumphant search for something or someone to care about evokes the humor, the sadness and the absurdity of a world that we all must somehow survive.</description>

  <description>An ordinary family man, geologist, and Mormon, Soren Johansson has always believed he’ll be reunited with his loved ones after death in an eternal hereafter. Then, he dies. Soren wakes to find himself cast by a God he has never heard of into a Hell whose dimensions he can barely grasp: a vast library he can only escape from by finding the book that contains the story of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this haunting existential novella, author, philosopher, and ecologist Steven L. Peck explores a subversive vision of eternity, taking the reader on a journey through the afterlife of a world where everything everyone believed in turns out to be wrong.</description>

  <description>THE SECRETS OF the past meet the shocks of the present.&lt;br&gt;Aslaug is an unusual young woman. Her mother has brought her up in near isolation, teaching her about plants and nature and language—but not about life. Especially not how she came to have her own life, and who her father might be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Aslaug’s mother dies unexpectedly, everything changes. For Aslaug is a suspect in her mother’s death. And the more her story unravels, the more questions unfold. About the nature of Aslaug’s birth. About what she should do next. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About whether divine miracles have truly happened. And whether, when all other explanations are impossible, they might still happen this very day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addictive, thought-provoking, and shocking, &lt;em&gt;Madapple &lt;/em&gt;is a page-turning exploration of human nature and divine intervention—and of the darkest corners of the human soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Do you know what it took for Socrates’ enemies to make him stop pursuing the truth?”&lt;br&gt;“Hemlock.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Storied, fiercely competitive Mariana Academy was founded with a serious honor code; its reputation has been unsullied for decades. Now a long-dormant secret society, Prisom's Party, threatens its placid halls with vigilante justice, exposing students and teachers alike for even the most minor infraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iris Dupont, a budding journalist whose only confidant is the chain-smoking specter of Edward R. Murrow, feels sure she can break into the ranks of &lt;em&gt;The Devil’s Advocate&lt;/em&gt;, the Party’s underground newspaper, and there uncover the source of its blackmail schemes and vilifying rumors. Some involve the school’s new science teacher, who also seems to be investigating the Party. Others point to an albino student who left school abruptly ten years before, never to return. And everything connects to a rare book called &lt;em&gt;Marvelous Species&lt;/em&gt;. But the truth comes with its own dangers, and Iris is torn between her allegiances, her reporter's instinct, and her own troubled past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Year of the Gadfly&lt;/em&gt; is an exhilarating journey of double-crosses, deeply buried secrets, and the lifelong reverberations of losing someone you love. Following in the tradition of classic school novels such as &lt;em&gt;A Separate Peace&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prep&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Secret History&lt;/em&gt;, it reminds us how these years haunt our lives forever.</description>

  <description>When skateboarding, fifteen-year-old Max Mayhem learns that his neighbor, Peter, is a vampire whose girlfriend has gone missing, Max’s dreams for a normal life are turned upside down. Before he knows it, he and his best friend, Lydia, are sucked into a daring hunt for Peter’s missing girlfriend—a hunt that leads them to a suspiciously empty town in northern Canada, where Max guesses things are not what they seem. As the sun sets over the ice-blue mountains and the town falls into shadow, cries echo through the woods and Max realizes it’s too late. Now the missing girl is the last thing on his and Lydia’s minds, and it will take all their cunning to survive until sunrise.</description>

  <description>For fans of Tina Fey and David Sedaris—Internet star Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess, makes her literary debut.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Jenny Lawson realized that the most mortifying moments of our lives—the ones we’d like to pretend never happened—are in fact the ones that define us. In the #1 N&lt;em&gt;ew York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller, &lt;em&gt;Let’s Pretend This Never Happened&lt;/em&gt;, Lawson takes readers on a hilarious journey recalling her bizarre upbringing in rural Texas, her devastatingly awkward high school years, and her relationship with her long-suffering husband, Victor. Chapters include: “Stanley the Magical, Talking Squirrel”; “A Series of Angry Post-It Notes to My Husband”; “My Vagina Is Fine. Thanks for Asking”; “And Then I Snuck a Dead Cuban Alligator on an Airplane.” Pictures with captions (no one would believe these things without proof) accompany the text.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;There are stories where the girl gets her prince, and they live happily ever after. (This is not one of those stories.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenna Lord’s first sixteen years were not exactly a fairytale. Her father is a controlling psycho and her mother is a drunk. She used to count on her older brother—until he shipped off to Afghanistan. And then, of course, there was the time she almost died in a fire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are stories where the monster gets the girl, and we all shed tears for his innocent victim. (This is not one of those stories either.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Anderson is many things: A dedicated teacher and coach. A caring husband. A man with a certain... magnetism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And there are stories where it’s hard to be sure who’s a prince and who’s a monster, who is a victim and who should live happily ever after. (These are the most interesting stories of all.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drowning Instinct&lt;/em&gt; is a novel of pain, deception, desperation, and love against the odds—and the rules.</description>

  <description>"The living haunt the dead..." These fifteen genre-bending stories are set against a backdrop of sudden violence and profound regret, populated by characters whose circumstances and longings drive them to the point of no return... and sometimes even further. A young girl takes a journey to see what is really hidden within the belly of an ancient water tower. A high school senior learns about defiance on a school bus and witnesses a tragedy that he won''t soon forget. Six survivors in an underground bunker discuss the possibility of Armageddon being an elaborate hoax. Two brothers take a walk on the dark side of the wheat field and discover that some bonds are stronger than death. And in the title story, a former train conductor must confront the ghosts of his past while learning that it''s not the dead who haunt the living, but the other way around. Traversing the back roads of the south and beyond, these stories probe the boundaries of imagination, taking the reader to the fringes of a society where the world looks different, and once you visit, you won''t ever be the same.</description>

  <description>One choice can transform you—or it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves—and herself—while grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable—and even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</description>

  <description>In a remote and dangerous corner of the ocean, the renowned gourmet and food journalist Louis De Gustibus is held captive by an elite chef-and vegan cannibal-named Andre. But Andre would never eat his dear friend Louis. Andre only eats millionaires! Over a five star French meal of fine wine, organic vegetables and human flesh, a lunatic delivers a witty, chilling, disturbingly sane argument in favor of eating the rich. It's a darkly hilarious dessert to Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma and Foer's Eating Animals-a tale of good and evil, of rich and poor, of manners, madness and meat.</description>

  <description>Addy Hanlon has always been Beth Cassidy's best friend and trusted lieutenant. Beth calls the shots and Addy carries them out, a long-established order of things that has brought them to the pinnacle of their high-school careers. Now they're seniors who rule the intensely competitive cheer squad, feared and followed by the other girls -- until the young new coach arrives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cool and commanding, an emissary from the adult world just beyond their reach, Coach Colette French draws Addy and the other cheerleaders into her life. Only Beth, unsettled by the new regime, remains outside Coach's golden circle, waging a subtle but vicious campaign to regain her position as "top girl" -- both with the team and with Addy herself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a suicide focuses a police investigation on Coach and her squad. After the first wave of shock and grief, Addy tries to uncover the truth behind the death -- and learns that the boundary between loyalty and love can be dangerous terrain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The raw passions of girlhood are brought to life in this taut, unflinching exploration of friendship, ambition, and power. Award-winning novelist Megan Abbott, writing with what Tom Perrotta has hailed as "total authority and an almost desperate intensity," provides a harrowing glimpse into the dark heart of the all-American girl.</description>

  <description>When you open your eyes things already seem to be happening without you. You don't know who you are and you don't remember where you've been. You know the world has changed, that a catastrophe has destroyed what used to exist before, but you can't remember exactly what did exist before. And you're paralyzed from the waist down apparently, but you don't remember that either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man claiming to be your friend tells you your services are required. Something crucial has been stolen, but what he tells you about it doesn't quite add up. You've got to get it back or something bad is going to happen. And you've got to get it back fast, so they can freeze you again before your own time runs out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before you know it, you're being carried through a ruined landscape on the backs of two men in hazard suits who don't seem anything like you at all, heading toward something you don't understand that may well end up being the death of you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the life of Josef Horkai….</description>

  <description>Originally published in 1974, this gripping novel tells the tale of the Easter family of Ontarion, Iowa. Ansel Easter was a favored minister until he rescued a grotesque creature from a carnival sideshow. His sons, C and Sam, suffer in the shadow of their outcast father until his violent death. C and Sam leave the home their father built for a new beginning, and find fortune building a lucrative business called the Associates — but when a rash of deaths has the townspeople looking at C and Sam as suspects, they find their father's legacy reaches further than they expect. Taut, dark, and engrossing, &lt;em&gt;The Easter House&lt;/em&gt; holds up as a brilliant work of fiction some 30 years after its initial publication.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Shortlisted for the 2011 Costa First Novel Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty years in the future. The once-great city of Bohane on the west coast of Ireland is on its knees, infested by vice and split along tribal lines. There are the posh parts of town, but it is in the slums and backstreets of Smoketown, the tower blocks of the Northside Rises and the eerie bogs of Big Nothin' that the city really lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, the city has been in the cool grip of Logan Hartnett, the dapper godfather of the Hartnett Fancy gang. But there's trouble in the air. They say his old nemesis is back in town; his trusted henchmen are getting ambitious; and his missus wants him to give it all up and go straight... And then there's his mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;City of Bohane &lt;/em&gt;is a visionary novel that blends influences from film and the graphic novel, from Trojan beats and calypso rhythms, from Celtic myth and legend, from fado and the sagas, and from all the great inheritance of Irish literature. A work of mesmerising imagination and vaulting linguistic invention, it is a taste of the glorious and new.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An electrifying psychological thriller about a mother and daughter pushed to their limits. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Shelley and her mom have been menaced long enough. Excused from high school where a trio of bullies nearly killed her, and still reeling from her parents' humiliating divorce, Shelley has retreated with her mother to the quiet of Honeysuckle Cottage in the countryside. Thinking their troubles are over, they revel in their cozy, secure life of gardening and books, hot chocolate and Brahms by the fire. But on the eve of Shelley's sixteenth birthday, an unwelcome guest disturbs their peace and something inside Shelley snaps. What happens next will shatter all their certainties-about their safety, their moral convictions, the limits of what they are willing to accept, and what they're capable of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Debut novelist Gordon Reece has written a taut tale of gripping suspense, packed with action both comic and terrifying. Shelley is a spellbinding narrator, and her delectable mix of wit, irony, and innocence transforms the major current issue of bullying into an edge- of-your-seat story of fear, violence, family loyalty, and the outer reaches of right and wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The apocalypse was yesterday. These stories are today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following up on her first collection, Story Prize finalist Maureen F. McHugh explores the catastrophes, small and large, of twenty-first century life—and what follows after. What happens after the bird flu pandemic? Are our computers smarter than we are? What does the global economy mean for two young girls in China? Are we really who we say we are? And how will we survive the coming zombie apocalypse?</description>

  <description>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2011 Random House Audio</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;We are such volatile creatures that we finally feel the sentiments we feign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;First published in 1816, &lt;em&gt;Adolphe&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a young man with all the privileges and advantages of a noble birth, bt who's still haunted by the meaninglessness of life. He seeks distraction in the pursuit of the beautiful, but older and married Ellenore, a fictionalized version of Madame de Stael. The young Adolphe, inexperienced in love, falls for her unexpectedly and falters under the burden of the illicit love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of The Novella Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.</description>

  <description>Adam Levin’s debut novel &lt;em&gt;The Instructions&lt;/em&gt; was one of the most buzzed-about books of 2010, a sprawling universe of �death-defying sentences, manic wit, exciting provocations and simple human warmth” (&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, in the stories of &lt;em&gt;Hot Pink&lt;/em&gt;, Levin delivers ten smaller worlds, shaken snow-globes of overweight romantics, legless prodigies, quixotic dollmakers, Chicagoland thugs, dirty old men, protective fathers, balloon-laden dumptrucks, and walls that ooze gels. Told with lust and affection, karate and tenderness, slapstickery, ferocity, and heart, &lt;em&gt;Hot Pink&lt;/em&gt; is the work of a major talent in his sharpest form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Hot Pink&lt;/em&gt; comes in three resplendent colors (pink, gray and blue).</description>

  <description>Whether at a zoo, on a camping trip, or under our bedsheets, we are surrounded by animals. While most are perfectly harmless, it's the magnificent exceptions that populate &lt;em&gt;The Book of Deadly Animals&lt;/em&gt;. Award-winning writer Gordon Grice takes readers on a tour of the animal kingdom—from grizzly bears to great white sharks, big cats to crocodiles. Every page overflows with astonishing facts about Earth's great predators and unforgettable stories of their encounters with humans, all delivered in Grice's signature dark comic style. Illustrated with awe-inspiring photographs of beasts and bugs, this wondrous work will horrify, delight, and amaze.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Jocelyn follows clues apparently from her dead twin, Jack, in and around Seale House, the terrifying foster home where they once lived. With help from childhood friend Noah she begins to uncover the truth about Jack's death and the company that employed him and Noah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jocelyn's twin brother Jack was the only family she had growing up in a world of foster homes-and now he's dead, and she has nothing. Then she gets a cryptic letter from "Jason December"-the code name her brother used to use when they were children at Seale House, a terrifying foster home that they believed had dark powers. Only one other person knows about Jason December: Noah, Jocelyn's childhood crush and their only real friend among the troubled children at Seale House.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Jocelyn returns to Seale House and the city where she last saw Noah, she gets more than she bargained for. Turns out the house's powers weren't just a figment of a childish imagination. And someone is following Jocelyn. Is Jack still alive? And if he is, what kind of trouble is he in? The answer is revealed in a shocking twist that turns this story on its head and will send readers straight back to page 1 to read the book in a whole new light.</description>

  <description>Every dish in this very unique cookbook has one thing in common: the main ingredient is children! Many famous culinary witches have contributed—from Barfa Stew-Wart to India's favorite Kideeta Skingh and Janie Groviller from Britain—and each of their recipes is introduced by the general editor Esmelia Sniff. Recipes range from such tangy delights as Seared Tina in Boy Sauce on a Bed of Fragrant Lice to the more filling Bratwurst and Upset Cabbage to sweet Flat Jacks. Featuring a dark subject matter but laugh-out-loud jokes, absurd characters, and beautiful illustrations, this is the perfect cookbook for parents and children alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A master of striped-down, powerful storytelling reworks the David-and-Goliath myth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goliath of Gath isn’t much of a fighter. Given half a choice, he would pick admin work over patrolling in a heartbeat, to say nothing of his distaste for engaging in combat. Nonetheless, at the behest of the king, he finds himself issuing a twice-daily challenge to the Israelites: “Choose a man. Let him come to me that we may fight. If he be able to kill me then we shall be your servants. But if I kill him, then you shall be our servants.” Day after day he reluctantly repeats his speech, and the isolation of this duty gives him the chance to banter with his shield-bearer and reflect on the beauty of his surroundings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of David and Goliath as seen from Goliath’s side of the Valley of Elah. Quiet moments in Goliath’s life as a soldier are accentuated by Tom Gauld’s drawing style, which contrasts minimalist scenery and near-geometric humans with densely crosshatched detail reminiscent of Edward Gorey. Goliath’s battle is simultaneously tragic and bleakly funny, as bureaucracy pervades even this most mythic of figures. &lt;em&gt;Goliath &lt;/em&gt;displays a sensitive wit, a bold line, and a traditional narrative reworked, remade, and revolutionized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <description>An alien race of religious extremists plan to honor their deity&lt;br&gt;through the ritualistic annihilation of our planet. The only man who&lt;br&gt;knows this is Milan Marlowe, an unstoppable media baron who sees&lt;br&gt;opportunity everywhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earth’s only move is to engage the invaders according to their&lt;br&gt;holy law and issue The Challenge of the Heretic—a winner-take-all&lt;br&gt;gladiator battle for our right to exist. Marlowe launches &lt;em&gt;Beast Wars&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br&gt;a televised interspecies tournament designed to select Earth’s&lt;br&gt;mightiest champion. On a decadent private island, sharks, lions,&lt;br&gt;gorillas, and polar bears square off to the delight of screaming&lt;br&gt;fans oblivious to the sky-high stakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Bruno Bolo—single father, blues belter, and alligator wrestler&lt;br&gt;from the swamps of Florida. Beset by personal demons, corporatized&lt;br&gt;killer sharks, Yeats-quoting pit fighters, and looming alien eradicators,&lt;br&gt;Bruno will emerge as our desperate planet’s final hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A ferocious debut that puts Frank Bill’s southern Indiana on the literary map next to Cormac McCarthy’s eastern Tennessee and Daniel Woodrell’s Missouri Ozarks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C&lt;em&gt;rimes in Southern Indiana &lt;/em&gt;is the most blistering, vivid, flat-out fearless debut to plow into American literature in recent years. Frank Bill delivers what is both a wake-up call and a gut punch. Welcome to heartland America circa right about now, when the union jobs and family farms that kept the white on the picket fences have given way to meth labs, backwoods gunrunners, and bare-knuckle brawling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill’s people are pressed to the brink—and beyond. There is Scoot McCutchen, whose beloved wife falls terminally ill, leaving him with nothing to live for—which doesn’t quite explain why he brutally murders her and her doctor and flees, or why, after years of running, he decides to turn himself in. In the title story, a man who has devolved from breeding hounds for hunting to training them for dog-fighting crosses paths with a Salvadoran gangbanger tasked with taking over the rural drug trade, but who mostly wants to grow old in peace. As &lt;em&gt;Crimes in Sourthern Indiana &lt;/em&gt;unfolds, we witness the unspeakable, yet are compelled to find sympathy for the depraved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bill’s southern Indiana is haunted with the deep, authentic sense of place that recalls the best of Southern fiction, but the interconnected stories bristle with the urban energy of a Chuck Palahniuk or a latter-day Nelson Algren and rush with the slam-bang plotting of pulp-noir crime writing à la Jim Thompson. Bill’s prose is gritty yet literary, shocking, and impossible to put down. A dark evocation of the survivalist spirit of the working class, this is a brilliant debut by an important new voice.</description>

  <description>The story of Antonia Shimerda is told by one of her friends from childhood, Jim Burden, an orphaned boy from Virginia. Though he leaves the prairie, Jim never forgets the Bohemian girl who so profoundly influenced his life. An immigrant child of immigrant parents, Antonia's girlhood is spent working to help her parents wrest a living from the untamed land. Though in later years she suffers betrayal and desertion, through all the hardships of her life she preserves a valor of spirit that no hardship can daunt or break. When Jim Burden sees her again after many years, he finds her "a rich mine of life", a figure who has turned adversity into a particular kind of triumph in the true spirit of the pioneer.</description>

  <description>Grace Winter, 22, is both a newlywed and a widow. She is also on trial for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer of 1914, the elegant ocean liner carrying her and her husband Henry across the Atlantic suffers a mysterious explosion. Setting aside his own safety, Henry secures Grace a place in a lifeboat, which the survivors quickly realize is over capacity. For any to live, some must die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the castaways battle the elements, and each other, Grace recollects the unorthodox way she and Henry met, and the new life of privilege she thought she'd found. Will she pay any price to keep it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lifeboat&lt;/em&gt; is a page-turning novel of hard choices and survival, narrated by a woman as unforgettable and complex as the events she describes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

I &lt;em&gt;made &lt;/em&gt;you a girl. But that ain’t what you was supposed to be. So, from now on, you gon’ be a boy. It’ll be a little strange at first, but you’ll get used to it, and this’ll be over after while.” &lt;br&gt;     From this point forward, his life becomes a bizarre kaleidoscope of events.

  <description>We know you are here, our brothers and sisters . . . &lt;br&gt;Pressia barely remembers the Detonations or much about life during the Before. In her sleeping cabinet behind the rubble of an old barbershop where she lives with her grandfather, she thinks about what is lost-how the world went from amusement parks, movie theaters, birthday parties, fathers and mothers . . . to ash and dust, scars, permanent burns, and fused, damaged bodies. And now, at an age when everyone is required to turn themselves over to the militia to either be trained as a soldier or, if they are too damaged and weak, to be used as live targets, Pressia can no longer pretend to be small. Pressia is on the run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burn a Pure and Breathe the Ash . . . &lt;br&gt;There are those who escaped the apocalypse unmarked. Pures. They are tucked safely inside the Dome that protects their healthy, superior bodies. Yet Partridge, whose father is one of the most influential men in the Dome, feels isolated and lonely. Different. He thinks about loss-maybe just because his family is broken; his father is emotionally distant; his brother killed himself; and his mother never made it inside their shelter. Or maybe it's his claustrophobia: his feeling that this Dome has become a swaddling of intensely rigid order. So when a slipped phrase suggests his mother might still be alive, Partridge risks his life to leave the Dome to find her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Pressia meets Partridge, their worlds shatter all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Serena&lt;/em&gt; returns to Appalachia, this time at the height of World War I, with the story of a blazing but doomed love affair caught in the turmoil of a nation at war&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deep in the rugged Appalachians of North Carolina lies the cove, a dark, forbidding place where spirits and fetches wander, and even the light fears to travel. Or so the townsfolk of Mars Hill believe–just as they know that Laurel Shelton, the lonely young woman who lives within its shadows, is a witch. Alone except for her brother, Hank, newly returned from the trenches of France, she aches for her life to begin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it happens–a stranger appears, carrying nothing but a beautiful silver flute and a note explaining that his name is Walter, he is mute, and is bound for New York. Laurel finds him in the woods, nearly stung to death by yellow jackets, and nurses him back to health. As the days pass, Walter slips easily into life in the cove and into Laurel's heart, bringing her the only real happiness she has ever known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Walter harbors a secret that could destroy everything–and danger is closer than they know. Though the war in Europe is near its end, patriotic fervor flourishes thanks to the likes of Chauncey Feith, an ambitious young army recruiter who stokes fear and outrage throughout the county. In a time of uncertainty, when fear and ignorance reign, Laurel and Walter will discover that love may not be enough to protect them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This lyrical, heart-rending tale, as mesmerizing as its award-winning predecessor &lt;em&gt;Serena&lt;/em&gt;, shows once again this masterful novelist at the height of his powers.</description>

&lt;/em&gt; is a declaration of love for that ubiquitous meal between two slices of bread: The Sandwich.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  As simple as they are, sandwiches seem to inspire unusual devotion and bitter argument. Debates have lasted decades over the best way to prepare a club, what a true Philly cheesesteak really is, or who deserves credit for inventing the hamburger. But why shouldn’t people be passionate about sandwiches? They’re a food that’s threaded its way into the lives and cuisine of virtually every nation and culture where bread enters the daily diet. From Europe to South America, India to Vietnam, the hamburger and BLT to the wada pav and banh mi, sandwiches are often representative of regional and national identity—the food of the everyman. They reflect the history of the modern age, the story of the working class, and the evolution of mass-produced eats. From the invention of sliced bread to the hamburger assembly lines of modern fast food, sandwiches have unceremoniously taken us into the 21st century in the shadows of more brilliant symbols.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Scanwiches&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; takes the sandwich and spreads it out for all to see. There’s nothing quaint or humble about its presentation. From full-frontal, cross sections of monsters like the Dagwood and club, to minute, geometric tea sandwiches whose construction looks more like minimalist art than culinary creation, &lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Scanwiches&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; presents unabashed food porn that satiates even the most severe sandwich fetish. A supernova of swirling bread, cheese, meat, and lettuce, suspended in a black, vacuous space, and reproduced at actual size, each sandwich lays imposing, exposed, and tantalizing. Complimented by text revealing the origins and development of each sandwich throughout history, you’ll learn to love and lust after these lowbrow delicacies in a whole new way.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"What has cast such a shadow upon you?"&lt;br&gt;"The Negro."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its intense mix of mystery, adventure, and a surprise ending, &lt;em&gt;Benito Cereno&lt;/em&gt; at first seems merely a provocative example from the genre Herman Melville created with his early best-selling novels of the sea. However, most Melville scholars consider it his most sophisticated work, and many, such as novelist Ralph Ellison, have hailed it as the most piercing look at slavery in all of American literature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Based on a real life incident—the character names remain unchanged—&lt;em&gt;Benito Cereno&lt;/em&gt; tells what happens when an American merchant ship comes upon a mysterious Spanish ship where the nearly all-black crew and their white captain are starving and yet hostile to offers of help. Melville's most focused political work, it is rife with allusions (a ship named after Santo Domingo, site of the slave revolt led by Toussaint L'Ouverture), analogies (does the good-hearted yet obtuse American captain refer to the American character itself?), and mirroring images that deepen our reflections on human oppression and its resultant depravities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is, in short, a multi-layered masterpiece that rewards repeated readings, and deepens our appreciation of Melville's genius.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Art of The Novella Series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.</description>

  <description>Fiction. In a single convulsion of homicide, the population of Ravenna tries to erase the population of Collingwood. The innocent, standing in their living rooms, cooking in their kitchens, and playing in their yards, are simply checked off by hunting rifles or crossed out by farmers' tools. There is one thing missing, however, as the bodies fall from what might have been better stories, better novels, and it's this: everything. ..".out on the edge and experimental to the point of reader-confusion, but surprisingly alluring. When taking a reader to the cliff edge, then the writing must be as enticing as chocolate even if the story smells bad. I don't get it and I didn't enjoy it, but I couldn't look away: This poetic, fast-flying nihilistic narrative of carnage is well done"--The Globe &amp;amp; Mail.</description>

  <description>In 1995, Chris Holbrook burst onto the southern literary scene with Hell and Ohio: Stories of Southern Appalachia, stories that Robert Morgan described as "elegies for land and lives disappearing under mudslides from strip mines and new trailer parks and highways." Now, with the publication of Upheaval, Holbrook more than answers the promise of that auspicious debut. In eight interrelated stories set in Eastern Kentucky, Holbrook again captures a region and its people as they struggle in the face of poverty, isolation, change, and the devastation of land and resources at the hands of the coal and timber industries. In the title story, Haskell sees signs of disaster all around him, from the dangers inherent in the strip-mining machinery he and his coworkers operate to the accident waiting to happen when his son plays with a socket wrench. Holbrook employs a native's ear for dialect and turns of phrase to reveal his characters' complex interior lives. In "The Timber Deal," two brothers -- Russell, a recovering addict recently released from prison, and Dwight, who hasn't worked since being injured in a coal truck accident -- try to convince their upwardly mobile sister, Helen, to agree to lease out timber rights to the family land. Dwight is unable to communicate his feelings, even as he seethes with rage: "Helen can't see past herself, is what it is. If John James had fractured his back in two places, it'd be a different story. If he'd broke his neck, it'd be a different story told." Written with a gritty, unflinching realism reminiscent of the work of Larry Brown and Cormac McCarthy, the stories in Upheaval prove that Holbrook is not only a faithful chronicler and champion of Appalachia's working poor but also one of the most gifted writers of his generation.</description>

  <description>A postmodern visionary who is also a master of styles and genres, David Mitchell combines flat-out adventures, a Nabokovian love of puzzles, a keen eye for character, and a taste for mind-bending philosophical and scientific speculation in the tradition of Umberto Eco and Philip K. Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction that reveals how disparate people connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.</description>

  <description>From the �wickedly talented” (&lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt;) and �darkly funny” (&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;) Ryan Boudinot, &lt;em&gt;Blueprints of the Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; is a tour de force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the Afterlife. The end of the world is a distant, distorted memory called �the Age of F***ed Up Shit.” A sentient glacier has wiped out most of North America. Medical care is supplied by open-source nanotechnology, and human nervous systems can be hacked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Fogg is a film archivist with a niggling feeling that her life is not really her own. She may be right. Al Skinner is a former mercenary for the Boeing Army, who’s been dragging his war baggage behind him for nearly a century. Woo-jin Kan is a virtuoso dishwasher with the Hotel and Restaurant Management Olympics medals to prove it. Over them all hovers a mysterious man named Dirk Bickle, who sends all these characters to a full-scale replica of Manhattan under construction in Puget Sound. An ambitious novel that writes large the hopes and anxieties of our time—climate change, social strife, the depersonalization of the digital age—&lt;em&gt;Blueprints of the Afterlife&lt;/em&gt; will establish Ryan Boudinot as an exceptional novelist of great daring.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>It's 1911 and the secluded southwestern Alabama town of Old Texas has been besieged by a scabrous and malevolent character called E. O. Smonk. Syphilitic, consumptive, gouty and goitered, Smonk is also an expert with explosives and knives. He abhors horses, goats and the Irish. Every Saturday night for a year he's been riding his mule into Old Texas, destroying property, killing livestock, seducing women, cheating and beating men—all from behind the twin barrels of his Winchester 45-70 caliber over and under rifle. At last the desperate citizens of the town, themselves harboring a terrible secret, put Smonk on trial, with disastrous and shocking results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus begins the highly anticipated new novel from Tom Franklin, acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Hell at the Breech and Poachers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smonk&lt;/em&gt; is also the story of Evavangeline, a fifteen-year-old prostitute quick to pull a trigger or cork. A case of mistaken identity plunges her into the wild sugarcane country between the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers, land suffering from the worst drought in a hundred years and plagued by rabies. Pursued by a posse of unlikely vigilantes, Evavangeline boats upriver and then wends through the dust and ruined crops, forced along the way to confront her own clouded past. She eventually stumbles upon Old Texas, where she is fated to E. O. Smonk and the townspeople in a way she could never imagine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In turns hilarious, violent, bawdy and terrifying, &lt;em&gt;Smonk&lt;/em&gt; creates its own category: It's a southern, not a western, peopled with corrupt judges and assassins, a cuckolded blacksmith, Christian deputies, widows, War veterans, whores, witches, madmen and zombies. By the time the smoke has cleared, the mystery of &lt;em&gt;Smonk&lt;/em&gt; will be revealed, the survivors changed forever.</description>

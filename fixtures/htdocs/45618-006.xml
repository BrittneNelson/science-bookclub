  <description>Thirteen-year-old Lizzie Hood and her next-door neighbor, Evie Verver, are inseparable, best friends who swap clothes, bathing suits, and field-hockey sticks and between whom, presumably, there are no secrets. Then one afternoon, Evie disappears, and as a rabid, giddy panic spreads through the balmy suburban community, everyone turns to Lizzie for answers. Was Evie unhappy, troubled, or upset? Had she mentioned being followed? Would she have gotten into the car of a stranger?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compelled by curiosity, Lizzie takes up her own furtive pursuit of the truth. Haunted by dreams of her lost friend and titillated by her own new power as the center of the disappearance, Lizzie uncovers secret after secret and begins to wonder if she knew anything at all about her best friend.</description>

  <description>It's been six weeks since angels of the apocalypse descended to demolish the modern world. Street gangs rule the day while fear and superstition rule the night. When warrior angels fly away with a helpless little girl, her seventeen-year-old sister Penryn will do anything to get her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anything, including making a deal with an enemy angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raffe is a warrior who lies broken and wingless on the street. After eons of fighting his own battles, he finds himself being rescued from a desperate situation by a half-starved teenage girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling through a dark and twisted Northern California, they have only each other to rely on for survival.  Together, they journey toward the angels' stronghold in San Francisco where she'll risk everything to rescue her sister and he'll put himself at the mercy of his greatest enemies for the chance to be made whole again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for ages 16 and up.</description>

  <description>A breakneck tale of kick-ass, wise-ass, sexy-ass lesbians and ZOMBIES, Eat Your Heart Out opens on what promises to be another tediously annoying day at Ashbee’s Furniture Outlet. Then the strip-mall calm of Nowhere, Ohio, is shattered by the sudden, simultaneous appearance of Renni Ramirez—hyper-competent star of the beloved Rising Evil B-movie franchise—and actual ZOMBIES, leaving Ashbee’s hapless staff and Renni trapped behind an automatic door they can’t lock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can failed creative-writing student/apprentice store manager/eagle-eyed markswoman Devin escape the besieged furniture store to rescue her girlfriend? Will Renni’s experience slaughtering motion-captured CGI monsters save the day before the army bombs the town? Once bitten, how many zombies can a person expect to take out before succumbing to infection? Who is the mysterious Deus Ex Machina, and what is he doing with that bone saw?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of these questions and more whisper behind the scream of the single most important thing Devin needs to know in order to survive: is Renni a top or a bottom?</description>

  <description>Do you like tales of Cold War espionage? Taut psychological thrillers? Science fiction as a metaphor for U.S. foreign policy? How about cute angst-filled teenage vampire toyboys? Well, too bad. None of those things are in this book. Instead you'll join a guy in a Viking suit on an absurdly epic quest to figure out the meaning of life. There will be obstacles, of course: rabid gangs of disgruntled grannies, rival cults of pie-enthusiasts, toasters, anti-matter conversion do-hickeys, Shadow Men, bandits, hippies, annoying celestial bodies, the Department of Internationally Sexy Affairs, and probably way too many dick jokes for this book to ever be considered for any serious academic curriculum. You know, the usual. So what are you waiting for? Light a few candles, pour another glass of wine, and grab the lube. You're about to LOVE ME.</description>

  <description>This is the story of the Willoweed family and the English village in which they live. It begins mid-flood, ducks swimming in the drawing-room windows, “quacking their approval” as they sail around the room. “What about my rose beds?” demands Grandmother Willoweed. Her son shouts down her ear-trumpet that the garden is submerged, dead animals everywhere, she will be lucky to get a bunch. Then the miller drowns himself . . . then the butcher slits his throat . . . and a series of gruesome deaths plagues the villagers. The newspaper asks, “Who will be smitten by this fatal madness next?” Through it all, Comyns’ unique voice weaves a text as wonderful as it is horrible, as beautiful as it is cruel. Originally published in England in 1954, this “overlooked small masterpiece” is a twisted, tragicomic gem.</description>

  <description>Scarlett March lives to hunt the Fenris--the werewolves that took her eye when she was defending her sister Rosie from a brutal attack. Armed with a razor-sharp hatchet and blood-red cloak, Scarlett is an expert at luring and slaying the wolves. She's determined to protect other young girls from a grisly death, and her raging heart will not rest until every single wolf is dead. &lt;p&gt;Rosie March once felt her bond with her sister was unbreakable. Owing Scarlett her life, Rosie hunts ferociously alongside her. But even as more girls' bodies pile up in the city and the Fenris seem to be gaining power, Rosie dreams of a life beyond the wolves. She finds herself drawn to Silas, a young woodsman who is deadly with an ax and Scarlett's only friend--but does loving him mean betraying her sister and all that they've worked for?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>By the author of "Dare Me" and "The End of Everything" &lt;br&gt;""A young woman hired to keep the books at a down-at-the-heels nightclub is taken under the wing of the infamous Gloria Denton, a mob luminary who reigned during the Golden Era of Bugsy Siegel and Lucky Luciano. Notoriously cunning and ruthless, Gloria shows her eager young protegee the ropes, ushering her into a glittering demimonde of late-night casinos, racetracks, betting parlors, inside heists, and big, big money. Suddenly, the world is at her feet--as long as she doesn't take any chances, like falling for the wrong guy. As the roulette wheel turns, both mentor and protegee scramble to stay one step ahead of their bosses and each other.</description>

  <description>What Walter reads that day changes him. Not in any way someone would really notice. He still goes to school, hangs out with his friends Jimmy and Mothball, and tries to avoid the Troll, the town recluse. But something in him has changed. It's as if he can feel a part of him growing—the part that can stand by and watch a house burn down or the life flow out of a fox, without doing anything to stop either. He knows he could—should—do something to help. But some part of him keeps him glued in place, watching with fascination and curiosity. Maybe it would have been better if Walter had never found out the things he did. Maybe he didn't really want to know. But then again, maybe he did. Richly atmospheric, &lt;em&gt;The Hanging Woods&lt;/em&gt; is at times disturbing, but it is always riveting. It's a tale of deception, delusion, and the dark places a troubled mind can go.</description>

  <description>The monster showed up after midnight. As they do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it isn't the monster Conor's been expecting. He's been expecting the one from his nightmare, the one he's had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments, the one with the darkness and the wind and the screaming...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This monster is something different, though. Something ancient, something wild. And it wants the most dangerous thing of all from Conor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wants the truth.</description>

  <description>Once there was a girl who lived in a castle. The castle was inside a museum. When children visited, they’d press against the glass globe in which the castle sat, to glimpse the tiny girl. But when they went home, the girl was lonely. Then one day, she had an idea! What if you hung a picture of yourself inside the castle inside the museum, inside this book? Then you’d able to keep the girl company. Reminiscent of “The Lady of Shalot,” here is an original fairy tale that feels like a dream—haunting, beautiful, and completely unforgettable.</description>

  <description>Jill MacSweeney just wishes everything could go back to normal. But ever since her dad died, she’s been isolating herself from her boyfriend, her best friends—everyone who wants to support her. And when her mom decides to adopt a baby, it feels like she’s somehow trying to replace a lost family member with a new one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mandy Kalinowski understands what it’s like to grow up unwanted—to be raised by a mother who never intended to have a child. So when Mandy becomes pregnant, one thing she’s sure of is that she wants a better life for her baby. It’s harder to be sure of herself. Will she ever find someone to care for her, too?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their worlds change around them, Jill and Mandy must learn to both let go and hold on, and that nothing is as easy—or as difficult—as it seems.</description>

  <description>New York City has been decimated by war and plague, and most of civilization has migrated to underground enclaves, where life expectancy is no more than the early 20's. When Deuce turns 15, she takes on her role as a Huntress, and is paired with Fade, a teenage Hunter who lived Topside as a young boy. When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been decimated by the tunnel monsters - or Freaks - who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to warnings. And when Deuce and Fade are exiled from the enclave, the girl born in darkness must survive in daylight - guided by Fade's long-ago memories - in the ruins of a city whose population has dwindled to a few dangerous gangs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ann Aguirre's thrilling young adult novel is the story of two young people in an apocalyptic world- - facing dangers, and feelings, unlike any they've ever known.</description>

  <description>Fiction. Norman Lock's GRIM TALES is a mythological catalog of the peculiar, a string of strange, often murderous urban myths. It comes on fast and dirty, wasting no time in lunging at your throat.... GRIM TALES is populated end to end with the magical and the bizarre: shape-shifting, witchery, underwater cities, indoor rain, beds that contain oceans, murderous objects, all manner of disappearance. Men lose their faces to mirrors, women are smothered by their hair, clouds settle over cities and suck them up...and in the midst of all this looming, Lock has an incredible ability to render compelling imagery and demeanor in minute, super-compressed bursts. Single lines resound in the mind. In the same way that it's hard to stop staring at the internet's seemingly endless array of weird memes and video databases, Lock's words are both engrossing and slightly haunted. One could spend forever worming through these magicked words, their worlds.</description>

  <description>Shaun Mason is a man without a mission. Not even running the news organization he built with his sister has the same urgency as it used to. Playing with dead things just doesn't seem as fun when you've lost as much as he has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a CDC researcher fakes her own death and appears on his doorstep with a ravenous pack of zombies in tow, Shaun has a newfound interest in life. Because she brings news-he may have put down the monster who attacked them, but the conspiracy is far from dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Shaun hits the road to find what truth can be found at the end of a shotgun.</description>

  <description>After a slow climb out of the strip clubs and flesh pots of Europe, Jurgen and Rudolfo have hit the big time in Las Vegas, headlining a slick and well-oiled magic act. Rudolfo, a true misfit, is content orchestrating the spectacle, but Jurgen, stricken since childhood with the irrational desire to make magic, hungers for more. He finds it in a musty, mysterious collection of old manuscripts and magic cabinetry that once belonged to Houdini. And when he turns into the miracle-working saint of Las Vegas, chaos results. In a narrative that is whimsical, comic and melancholy by turns, Quarrington takes dead aim at the place in the human heart that hopes that doves can bloom from top hats and illusions can come true.</description>

  <description>In 1968, after the first zombie outbreak, Wanda Mayhall and her three young daughters discover the body of a teenage mother during a snowstorm. Wrapped in the woman’s arms is a baby, stone-cold, not breathing, and without a pulse. But then his eyes open and look up at Wanda — and he begins to move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The family hides the child — whom they name Stony — rather than turn him over to authorities that would destroy him. Against all scientific reason, the undead boy begins to grow. For years his adoptive mother and sisters manage to keep his existence a secret — until one terrifying night when Stony is forced to run and he learns that he is not the only living dead boy left in the world.</description>

  <description>Michael Hemmingson has been called “Raymond Carver on acid” by literary guru Larry McCaffery and “a disciple of a quick and dirty literature” by the &lt;em&gt;American Book Review&lt;/em&gt;. Hemmingson writes from within the everyday man's murky nightmares, offering hints and then, dazzlingly, reneging on his hints.</description>

  <description>Who knew that owls and hangovers went together as well as rum and coke? The Hungover Owls Tumblr took the Internet by storm as journalist J. Patrick Brown united the two for the first time. Brown’s hilarious, crude, and sometimes not-safe-for-work captions, combined with photos of owls squinting, gawking, snuggling, and sleeping make the perfect partnership. This book includes never-before-seen owl facts, parables, and a field guide for recognizing your very own hungover owl. With captions like “Ugh. The good weather only makes it so much worse” and ”On a scale from zero to hungover, I am dead,” drinkers everywhere will recognize their own forgotten pain and delight in its humor.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A beautifully written and darkly funny journey through the world of the allergic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Like twelve million other Americans, Sandra Beasley suffers from food allergies. Her allergies—severe and lifelong—include dairy, egg, soy, beef, shrimp, pine nuts, cucumbers, cantaloupe, honeydew, mango, macadamias, pistachios, cashews, swordfish, and mustard. Add to that mold, dust, grass and tree pollen, cigarette smoke, dogs, rabbits, horses, and wool, and it’s no wonder Sandra felt she had to live her life as “Allergy Girl.” When butter is deadly and eggs can make your throat swell shut, cupcakes and other treats of childhood are out of the question—and so Sandra’s mother used to warn guests against a toxic, frosting-tinged kiss with “Don’t kill the birthday girl!”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It may seem that such a person is “not really designed to survive,” as one blunt nutritionist declared while visiting Sandra’s fourth-grade class. But Sandra has not only survived, she’s thrived—now an essayist, editor, and award-winning poet, she has learned to navigate a world in which danger can lurk in an unassuming corn chip. &lt;em&gt;Don’t Kill the Birthday Girl&lt;/em&gt; is her story. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;With candor, wit, and a journalist’s curiosity, Sandra draws on her own experiences while covering the scientific, cultural, and sociological terrain of allergies. She explains exactly what an allergy is, describes surviving a family reunion in heart-of-Texas beef country with her vegetarian sister, delves into how being allergic has affected her romantic relationships, exposes the dark side of Benadryl, explains how parents can work with schools to protect their allergic children, and details how people with allergies should advocate for themselves in a restaurant.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A compelling mix of memoir, cultural history, and science, &lt;em&gt;Don’t Kill the Birthday Girl&lt;/em&gt; is mandatory reading for the millions of families navigating the world of allergies—and a not-to-be-missed literary treat for the rest of us.</description>

  <description>The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western is a novel by Richard Brautigan written in 1974.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking place in eastern Oregon in 1902, the story concerns a pair of morally ambivalent gunmen (Cameron &amp;amp; Greer) hired by one Miss Hawkline to hunt down &amp;amp; destroy the supposed monster living in the "ice caves" beneath her house. Miss Hawkline &amp;amp; her servant/sister/other self (also called "Miss Hawkline") believe the monster to have killed their father, a scientist who disappeared while hard at work in his basement laboratory on a project only referred to as "The Chemicals," which would, he claimed, if perfected, be a great boon to humanity.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt; Once upon a time, Hazel and Jack were best friends. They had been best friends since they were six, spending hot Minneapolis summers and cold Minneapolis winters together, dreaming of Hogwarts and Oz, superheroes and baseball. Now that they were eleven, it was weird for a boy and a girl to be best friends. But they couldn't help it - Hazel and Jack fit, in that way you only read about in books. And they didn't fit anywhere else. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then, one day, it was over. Jack just stopped talking to Hazel. And while her mom tried to tell her that this sometimes happens to boys and girls at this age, Hazel had read enough stories to know that it's never that simple. And it turns out, she was right. Jack's heart had been  frozen, and he was taken into the woods by a woman dressed in white to live in a palace made of ice. Now, it's up to Hazel to venture into the woods after him. Hazel finds, however, that these woods are nothing like what she's read about, and the Jack that Hazel went in to save isn't the same Jack that will emerge. Or even the same Hazel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen," &lt;em&gt;Breadcrumbs&lt;/em&gt; is a story of the struggle to hold on, and the things we leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Loory's collection of wry and witty, dark and perilous contemporary fables is populated by people–and monsters and trees and jocular octopi–who are united by twin motivations: fear and desire. In his singular universe, televisions talk (and sometimes sing), animals live in small apartments where their nephews visit from the sea, and men and women and boys and girls fall down wells and fly through space and find love on Ferris wheels.  In a voice full of fable, myth, and dream, &lt;em&gt;Stories for Nighttime and Some for the Day&lt;/em&gt; draws us into a world of delightfully wicked recognitions, and introduces us to a writer of uncommon talent and imagination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains the stories "The Duck" and "The Man and the Moose," as heard on NPR's &lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt;, "The Book," as heard on &lt;em&gt;Selected Shorts&lt;/em&gt;, and "The TV," as found in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A selection of the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble &lt;strong&gt;Discover Great New Writers Program&lt;/strong&gt; and the Starbucks Coffee &lt;strong&gt;Bookish Reading Club&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner of the 2011 Nobbie Award for &lt;strong&gt;Best Book of the Year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This guy can write!" &lt;br&gt;–Ray Bradbury, author of &lt;em&gt;Fahrenheit 451&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Set in the near-future, &lt;em&gt;Into the Forest&lt;/em&gt; is a powerfully imagined novel that focuses on the relationship between two teenage sisters living alone in their Northern California forest home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 30 miles from the nearest town, and several miles away from their nearest neighbor, Nell and Eva struggle to survive as society begins to decay and collapse around them. No single event precedes society's fall. There is talk of a war overseas and upheaval in Congress, but it still comes as a shock when the electricity runs out and gas is nowhere to be found. The sisters consume the resources left in the house, waiting for the power to return. Their arrival into adulthood, however, forces them to reexamine their place in the world and their relationship to the land and each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminiscent of Margaret Atwood's &lt;em&gt;A Handmaid's Tale, Into the Forest&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing and thought-provoking novel of hope and despair set in a frighteningly plausible near-future America.</description>

  <description>The Great Lenore is the tale of a ravishing young Brit whose falsely-reported death provides her with an opportunity to begin a new life. Before she can disappear for good, however, she needs to know how her two-timing husband and his aristocratic family react to having lost her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lenore enlists Richard—an outsider in the money-and-booze sodden landscape of Nantucket high society—to be her eyes and ears. And as the days collapse, Richard discovers that the entanglements of Lenore’s relationships are more intricate than he ever expected…are even more intricate than the small loop of twine that holds together the compartment of Lenore’s mysterious, miniature punt boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tohline’s elegant, captivating debut paints a world where lives collide, secrets thicken, and dreams unravel. In his words, the book is about “affluence, love, grief, and the duplicity that underscores the entire wave of humanity. [It] is about dreams, and about the things we sacrifice to chase them.”</description>

  <description>A&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;group of traders huddles around a pile of dried shark fins on a gleaming white floor in Hong Kong. A Papua New Guinean elder shoves off in his hand-carved canoe, ready to summon a shark with ancient magic. A scientist finds a rare shark in Indonesia and forges a deal with villagers so it and other species can survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this eye-opening adventure that spans the globe, Juliet Eilperin investigates the fascinating ways different individuals and cultures relate to the ocean’s top predator. Along the way, she reminds us why, after millions of years, sharks remain among nature’s most awe-inspiring creatures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Belize to South Africa, from Shanghai to Bimini, we see that sharks are still the object of an obsession that may eventually lead to their extinction. This is why movie stars and professional athletes go shark hunting in Miami and why shark’s fin soup remains a coveted status symbol in China. Yet we also see glimpses of how people and sharks can exist alongside one another: surfers tolerating their presence off Cape Town and ecotourists swimming with sharks that locals in the Yucatán no longer have to hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a reporter’s instinct for a good story and a scientist’s curiosity, Eilperin offers us an up-close understanding of these extraordinary, mysterious creatures in the most entertaining and illuminating shark encounter you’re likely to find outside a steel cage.</description>

  <description>A man murders a grocer over fifteen cents--but in the sharp, icy prose and detached tone that defines this collection, his crime seems neither sensational nor entirely reprehensible. Rosa Liksom populates a world of snow-covered landscapes, antiseptic apartments, fish factories, and lumber camps with the obsessive, the violent, and the unhinged. A woman refuses to leave prison until she has served her entire sentence. A man obsessively cleans his apartment as his life moves on around him. A woman kills her new husband over his neediness and inability to leave their bed. The stark lives and actions of these characters are infused with an emotional intimacy that draws the reader into uncomfortable empathy with the extremity of their deeds.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;"If Stephen King had a true Noir calling and Peter Straub added contemporary horror... and Dean Koontz threw in his fine depiction of ordinary life...then bring the specter of James M. Cain to write the narrative, you'd come close to describing the whole effect of this stunning, slice-of-the-zeitgeist, wondrous novel, And the Writing is pure dark bliss."---Hen Bruen" "A magnificent novel, with truly believable characters and suspense that keeps building to an explosive climax. There it is, plain and simple."---Seymour Shubin" "The Caretaker of Lorne Field is a wonderfully weird, gritty, and pitch-dark legend, perfect for New England. Weaved in the compulsively readable narrative is a heavy dose of our current society's meanness, unease, and ambiguity: kind of a nightmare-noir zeitgiest. The thing of it is, the reader is never safe in Dave Zeltserman's hands. I love that. You should too."---Paul Tremblay Author of the Little Sleep and No Sleep Till Wonderland" "A superb mix of humor and horror...Zeltserman orchestrates events perfecftly...Readers will keep turning pages to see how the ambiguous plot resolves."---Publishers Weekly (Starreo Review)" "Harrowing. Zeltserman colors it black with the best of them."Hirkus" "Dave Zeltserman's last novel was named by NPR as one of the top five crime and mystery novels of 2008 and one of The Washington Post's best books of the year. Publishers Weekly, in a starred review, said his "breakthrough third crime novel deserves comparison with the best of James Ellroy." And Crimetime calls him a name to watch." Now, Zeltserman has written the book his fans have been waiting for-a classic unlike anything you've ever read." Jack Durkin is the ninth generation of Durkins who have weeded Lorne Field for nearly 300 years. Though he and his wife Lydia are miserable and would like nothing more than to leave, Jack must wait until his son has come of age to tend the field on his own. It's an important job, though no one else seems to realize it. For, if the field is left untended, a horrific monster called an Aukowie will grow-a monster capable of taking over the entirety of America in just two weeks. Or so it is said...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note:  this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 1590203038  ISBN 13: 9781590203033&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Since the beginning of mankind, civilizations have fallen: the Romans, the Greeks, the Aztecs...and now us. Huge earthquakes rock the world. Cities are destroyed. But something even more awful is happening: An ancient evil has been unleashed, and it's turning everyday people into hunters, killers, and crazies. This is the world Mason, Aries, Clementine, and Michael are living in--or rather, trying to survive. Each is fleeing unspeakable horror, from murderous chaos to brutal natural disasters, and each is traveling the same road in a world gone mad. Amid the throes of the apocalypse and clinging to love and meaning wherever it can be found, these four teens are on a journey into the heart of darkness--and to find each other and a place of safety.</description>

  <description>Lamb and Mary were alike. Unbalanced. Flat-footed. High-strung. This is their story like you’ve never heard it—the tale of a loopy shepherdess and a depressive farm animal. In this version of the children's nursery rhyme, Lamb and Mary fall in love. They swoon, they are smitten. Then Mary has second thoughts. Lamb is a lamb, after all, not a man. Lamb, heartbroken, turns to drinking. Lamb goes to a madhouse. Mary buries her feelings. And then somehow, Lamb pulls it together. He leaves the madhouse mature—saddened but more dignified, ready for another chance to win Mary's heart. But will Mary let Lamb back into her life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Award-winning poet Matthea Harvey offers a story told in short packets of verse, and artist Amy Jean Porter brings each stanza vividly to life with her eye-popping illustrations. The collaboration yields a beautiful, off-the-wall tale of a lamb who wants only to be human, and a human who wants the love of a lamb.</description>

  <description>In? "God Head," Scott Zwiren boldly and courageously records the terrifying, destructive experience of manic depression. From a promising young college student to mental hospitals to a confined, out-of-control, roller-coaster life on New York City's Upper West Side, Zwiren's narrator traces from the inside the horrors of an existence that swings between numbing depression and exalting highs.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Asta in the Wings&lt;/em&gt; is the moving and often darkly funny story of Asta Hewitt, a resourceful seven-year-old and intrepid narrator growing up in an isolated house in Bond Brook, Maine. Shut off from the outside world and restricted to the company of a delusional mother and a bookish older brother, Asta is content to be part of a "society of three" constructing dramatic and fanciful worlds of their own. When circumstances push her into a strange outside world — with all of its discontents — Asta must find a way to assimilate while remaining true to herself and her fractured family. Jan Elizabeth Watson's debut novel puts her among the most promising new writers in the realm of imaginative literary fiction.</description>

  <description>After his widely celebrated debut, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Peanut, &lt;/em&gt;Adam Ross now presents a darkly compelling collection of stories about brothers, loners, lovers, and lives full of good intentions, misunderstandings, and obscured motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hotshot lawyer, burdened by years of guilt and resentment, comes to the rescue of his irresponsible, irresistible younger brother. An unsettling story resonates between the dysfunctional couple telling it and their listening friends as well. A lonely professor, frequently regaled with unbelievably entertaining tales by the office handyman, suddenly fears he’s being asked to abet a murderous fugitive. An awkward but nervy adolescent uses his brief career as a child actor to further his designs on a WASPy friend’s seemingly untouchable sister. A man down on his luck closes in on a mysterious, much-needed job offer while doing a good turn for his fragile neighbor, with results at once surreal and hilarious. And when two college kids goad each other on in an escalating series of breathtaking dares, the outcome is as tragic as it is ambiguous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laced with glimmers of redemption, youthful energy, and hard-won wisdom, these noirish stories unspool purposefully and fluidly; together they confirm the arrival of—as Michiko Kakutani put it in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times—&lt;/em&gt;“an enormously talented writer.”</description>

  <description>A house on the forested bank of a Brandenburg lake outside Berlin (once belonging to Erpenbeck's grandparents) is the focus of this compact, beautiful novel. Encompassing over one hundred years of German history, from the nineteenth century to the Weimar Republic, from World War II to the Socialist German Democratic Republic, and finally reunification and its aftermath, &lt;em&gt;Visitation&lt;/em&gt; offers the life stories of twelve individuals who seek to make their home in this one magical little house. The novel breaks into the everyday life of the house and shimmers through it, while relating the passions and fates of its inhabitants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elegant and poetic, &lt;em&gt;Visitation&lt;/em&gt; forms a literary mosaic of the last century, tearing open wounds and offering moments of reconciliation, with its drama and its exquisite evocation of a landscape no political upheaval can truly change.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;"Jenn Farrell's smart, observant stories about desire and escape take us to the places we're all afraid to admit we've been. Read The Devil You Know with greed and a hot, pleasurable hint of guilt---Sally Cooper author of Love Object and Tell Everything" "There are points in Jenn Farrell's amazing collection that I felt like I was listening in on the most intimate conversations of strangers---I was rapt with attention, but almost guilty for being privy to such intimacy. The Devil You Know treads familiar territory---small town ennui, adolescent love, grief and self-destruction---but does it with such emotional acuity that it doesn't feel familiar at all, it feels extraordinary---Catherine Hanrahan author of Lost Girls and Love Hotels" "Make no mistake; The Devil You Know belongs on the shelf alongside Nights Below Station Street. In this confident, insightful, often horrifyingly funny collection, Jenn Farrell distinguishes herself as one of Canada's finest contemporary writers of short fiction. Here are working class family dramas boiled down to the bone. Quick and mean as a Virginia Slim and bright and harsh as a Rexall at midnight, Farrell never fails to bring us down to earth to meet those beautiful, flawed, undeniably human devils we know so well. Refreshingly honest, impeccably written. A very, very good book---Elizabeth Bachinsky author of Home of Sudden Service" "The Devil You Know is the follow-up volume to Farrell's critically acclaimed debut collection, Sugar Bush &amp;amp; Other Stories." These stories deal with sex, love, work, birth, and death in alternately moving, shocking, funny, and at times devastating ways. Whether these characters are facing the death of a parent, bad love choices, the possibility of unwanted pregnancy, the rupture of friendships, teen violence, or the exploration of sado-masochistic sex, Farrell exposes their ticking cores and pulls the reader along every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In a city ridden with prostitute furries, cannibal cops and warehouse-sized mob bosses, I've got my work cut out for me. My name is Jimmy Plush. I'm a private detective. I'm also a teddy bear. It all started when the original Jimmy Plush entered my life, offering to take my gambling debts away if I agreed to switch bodies with him. But I didn't know that being a three-foot-high plush toy would be such a living hell, especially now that everyone in town wants a piece of me. All I've gotten out of this deal is a faithful Chinese chauffeur, a custom teddybear .45, and a girlfriend who won't take off the fox suit she turns tricks in. Now I've got to keep this town clean and try to track down the real Jimmy Plush without losing my stuffing for good. Only one thing is for sure: Life is hard when you're soft. Jimmy Plush, Teddy Bear Detective is a high octane pulp satire. In the tradition of Sam Spade, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, Hellboy and Howard the Duck comes a new kind of hero, a hero that reminds us that the measure of a man is in his guts and his gun.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Winner of the PEN West Award for the Novel. A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Notable Book.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reading &lt;em&gt;Tomato Red&lt;/em&gt;—the first Daniel Woodrell novel I came upon—was a transformative experience. It expanded my sense of the possibilities not only of crime fiction, but of fiction itself—of language, of storytelling. Time and again, his work just dazzles and humbles me. God bless Busted Flush for these glorious reissues. It's a service to readers everywhere, and a great gift."—Megan Abbott, award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Bury Me Deep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Woodrell's storytelling is as melodic, jangly, and energetic as a good banjo riff. . . . If one is tempted to hear the echoes of William Faulkner, or Erskine Caldwell . . . no matter. Mr. Woodrell isn't imitating any of them. He's only drawing from the same well they did, but with a different take, a different voice, a sharper sense of irony."—&lt;em&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dark noir novel set in West Table, Missouri, featuring nineteen-year-old Jamalee, her gorgeous gay brother, Jason, and Sammy Barlach, the young man passing through West Table, who just may be their ticket out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Woodrell&lt;/strong&gt; lives in the Missouri Ozarks. His five most recent novels were selected as &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Notable Books of the Year, and &lt;em&gt;Tomato Red&lt;/em&gt; won the PEN West Award for the Novel. His short story "Uncle" (in Busted Flush Press' &lt;em&gt;A Hell of a Woman: An Anthology of Female Noir&lt;/em&gt;) was nominated for the Edgar Award.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a dark and dusty shop, a devil’s supply of human teeth grown dangerously low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious "errands", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful, haunted Akiva fixes fiery eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past. But will Karou live to regret learning the truth about herself?</description>

"Gardner captures like no other the buildup of chemistry between a man and a woman..." 3AM Magazine &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/gr9AF0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://bit.ly/gr9AF0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Enter the book we couldn't put down, one which kept us riveted..." MARIE CLAIRE &lt;br&gt;"Mary is in a very fragile place after the death of her father, distance in her relationship with her mother, and a tenuous sobriety which has long slipped away but for her hiding it from her family. It’s under such inauspicious timing, while living in London, that Mary starts up a correspondence with a dreamy poet, but from the very beginning things are far from how they appear."

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Somewhere in the Midwest, Amy Breis is going nowhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Amy has a job she hates, a creep boyfriend she’s just dumped, and a best friend she can’t reach on the phone. But at least her (often painfully passive-aggressive) mother bought her a pink unicorn sweatshirt for her birthday. Pink. Unicorn. For her twenty-seventh birthday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gliding through the daydreams and realities of a young woman searching for definition, &lt;em&gt;Life with Mr. Dangerous&lt;/em&gt; showcases acclaimed cartoonist Paul Hornschemeier’s gift for deadpan humor and dead-on insight with a droll aftertaste—an unlikely but welcome marriage of the bleak and the hopeful.</description>

  <description>It's the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world. For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune--and remarkable power--to whoever can unlock them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday's riddles are based in the pop culture he loved--that of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday's icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes's oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt--among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life--and love--in the real world he's always been so desperate to escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A world at stake. &lt;br&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize. &lt;br&gt;Are you ready?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From an incredible new voice in psychological suspense, a novel about the secrets that remain after a final bohemian summer of excess turns deadly. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This taut psychological thriller begins when Karen and her nine-year- old daughter, Alice, pick up Rex from a ten-year stint in prison for murder. Flash back to the sultry summer in 1990s London when Karen, a straight-A student on the verge of college graduation, first meets the exotic, flamboyant Biba and joins her louche life in a crumbling mansion in Highgate. She begins a relationship with Biba's enigmatic and protective older brother, Rex, and falls into a blissful rhythm of sex, alcohol, and endless summer nights. Naïvely, Karen assumes her newfound happiness will last forever. But Biba and Rex have a complicated family history-one of abandonment, suicide, and crippling guilt-and Karen's summer of freedom is about to end in blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When old ghosts come back to destroy the life it has taken Karen a decade to build, she has everything to lose. She will do whatever it takes to protect her family and keep her secret. Alternating between the fragile present and the lingering past with a shocker of an ending, &lt;em&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant suspense debut that will appeal to readers of Kate Atkinson, Donna Tartt, and Tana French.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Jackie has a map of the city on the wall of her bedroom, with a green pin for each of her trees. She has a first-kiss tree and a broken-arm tree. She has a car-accident tree. There is a tree at the hospital where Jackie’s mother passed away into the long good night. When one of them gets cut down, Jackie doesn’t know what to do but she doesn’t let that stop her. She picks up the biggest rock she can carry and puts it through the window of a car. Smash. She intends to leave before the police arrive, but they’re early. Ann is Jackie’s best friend, but she’s got problems of her own. Her mother is chained up in the basement. How do you bring that up in casual conversation? �Oh, sorry I’ve been so distant, Jackie. My mother has more teeth than she’s supposed to, and she won’t eat anything that’s already dead.” Ann and her sister Margaret don’t have much of a choice here. Their mother needs to be fed. It isn’t easy but this is family. It’s not supposed to be easy. It’ll be okay as long as Margaret and Ann still have each other. Add in a cantankerous old man, his powerfully stupid dog, a headless ghost, a lesbian crush and a few unsettling visits from Jackie’s own dead mother, and you’ll find that One Bloody Thing After Another is a different sort of horror novel from the ones you’re used to. It’s as sad and funny as it is frightening, and it is as much about the way families rely on each other as it is about blood being drooled on the carpet. Though, to be honest, there is a lot of blood being drooled on the carpet.</description>

  <description>?Idaho Winter begins as the story of a boy with an extraordinarily painful existence. He is, through no fault of his own, loathed by everyone in the town where he lives. His father, Early Winter, feeds him roadkill for breakfast. The crossing guard steers cars toward him as he crosses the road. Parents encourage their children to plot cruelly against him. One morning Idaho finds it too much to bear and hides down by the river where he meets Madison. Madison, astonishingly, is as hurt by how he’s treated as he is. For the first time in his life Idaho experiences someone’s empathy and it opens a terrible world of pain in him. He dotes on Madison, in awe of her, and he cleans her muddy feet in the river, drying them with his shirt. Suddenly, hunting dogs descend on the scene and, trained to attack the smell of Idaho, set their jaws on Madison’s feet. Then Idaho does something that changes everything. He gets up and runs home. Not so strange until the author realizes that this part was never written. Idaho becomes enraged upon learning that his suffering has been cruelly designed by a clumsy writer who confesses that he made his book meaner than all the others so it would stand out. Idaho locks the author in a closet and runs off, armed with the knowledge that the entire world is invented and that he has the power now to imagine it differently. When the author emerges from the closet he finds that his novel is now unrecognizable. Phantoms and monsters, beasts from the boy’s angry thoughts now dominate the streets. Beneath the earth there is a resistance movement of secondary characters, including the poor Madison who is now bedridden and what’s more: anyone who comes within 50 feet of her is paralyzed with sadness and cannot move or be moved. The author sets out with these characters to cure the novel, to find a way to bring its mind and heart together as they embark on a journey as perilous and paradoxical as anything HG Wells or Lewis Carroll ever imagined.</description>

  <description>Francesca is stuck at St. Sebastians, a boys' school that's pretends it's coed by giving the girls their own bathroom.  Her only female companions are an ultra-feminist, a rumored slut, and an an impossibly dorky accordion player.  The boys are no better, from Thomas who specializes in musical burping to Will, the perpetually frowning, smug moron that Francesca can't seem to stop thinking about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there's Francesca's mother, who always thinks she knows what's best for Francesca—until she is suddenly stricken with acute depression, leaving Francesca lost, alone, and without an inkling who she really is.  Simultaneously humorous, poignant, and impossible to put down, this is the story of a girl who must summon the strength to save her family, her social life and—hardest of all—herself.</description>

  <description>For two young girls in the 1960s, the family backyard is both playground and prison. Among the bushes and brambles, it offers places to hide from the rages of their war-scarred father, places that also become secret gardens of the imagination. Told over the course of two hot Virginia summers, Hula presents a child's-eye view of a family drama played out to a chilling climax. The younger sister narrates, introducing us to her older sister's ritual taunts, her mother's dreamy distance, her father's escalating temper. Lisa Shea's haunting first novel probes the dark place where adolescent fantasies and real terrors collide.</description>

  <description>Named for a flower whose blood-red sap possesses the power both to heal and poison, &lt;em&gt;Bloodroot &lt;/em&gt;is a stunning fiction debut about the legacies—of magic and madness, faith and secrets, passion and loss—that haunt one family across the generations, from the Great Depression to today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The novel is told in a kaleidoscope of seamlessly woven voices and centers around an incendiary romance that consumes everyone in its path: Myra Lamb, a wild young girl with mysterious, haint blue eyes who grows up on remote Bloodroot Mountain; her grandmother Byrdie Lamb, who protects Myra fiercely and passes down “the touch” that bewitches people and animals alike; the neighbor boy who longs for Myra yet is destined never to have her; the twin children Myra is forced to abandon but who never forget their mother’s deep love; and John Odom, the man who tries to tame Myra and meets with shocking, violent disaster. Against the backdrop of a beautiful but often unforgiving country, these lives come together—only to be torn apart—as a dark, riveting mystery unfolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With grace and unflinching verisimilitude, Amy Greene brings her native Appalachia—and the faith and fury of its people—to rich and vivid life. Here is a spellbinding tour de force that announces a dazzlingly fresh, natural-born storyteller in our midst.</description>

  <description>The way we absorb information has changed dramatically. Edison’s phonograph has been reincarnated as the iPod. Celluloid went digital. But books, for the most part, have remained the same—until now. And while music and movies have undergone an almost Darwinian evolution, the literary world now faces a revolution, a sudden change in the way we buy, produce, and read books.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scholars, journalists, and publishers have turned their brains inside out in the effort to predict what lies ahead, but who better to comment on the future of the book than those who are driven to write them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Late American Novel&lt;/em&gt;, Jeff Martin and C. Max Magee gather some of today’s finest writers to consider the sea change that is upon them. Lauren Groff imagines an array of fantastical futures for writers, from poets with groupies to novelists as vending machines. Rivka Galchen writes about the figurative and literal death of paper. Joe Meno expounds upon the idea of a book as a place set permanently aside for the imagination, regardless of format. These and other original essays by Reif Larsen, Benjamin Kunkel, Victoria Patterson, and many more provide a timely and much-needed commentary on this compelling cultural crossroad.</description>

  <description>The team behind the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller &lt;em&gt;The Book of General Ignorance &lt;/em&gt;turns conventional biography on its head—and shakes out the good stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following their Herculean—or is it Sisyphean?—efforts to save the living from ignorance, the two wittiest Johns in the English language turn their attention to the dead.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As the authors themselves say, “The first thing that strikes you about the Dead is just how many of them there are.” Helpfully, Lloyd and Mitchinson have employed a simple—but ruthless—criterion for inclusion: the dead person has to be interesting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Here, then, is a dictionary of the dead, an encyclopedia of the embalmed. Ludicrous in scope, whimsical in its arrangement, this wildly entertaining tome presents pithy and provocative biographies of the no-longer-living from the famous to the undeservedly and—until now—permanently obscure. Spades in hand, Lloyd and Mitchinson have dug up everything embarrassing, fascinating, and downright weird about their subjects’ lives and added their own uniquely irreverent observations.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Organized by capricious categories—such as dead people who died virgins, who kept pet monkeys, who lost limbs, whose corpses refused to stay put—the dearly departed, from the inventor of the stove to a cross-dressing, bear-baiting female gangster finally receive the epitaphs they truly deserve.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discover:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Why Freud had a lifelong fear of trains&lt;br&gt;* The one thing that really made Isaac Newton laugh&lt;br&gt;* How Catherine the Great really died (no horse was involved)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Much like the country doctor who cured smallpox (he’s in here), Lloyd and Mitchinson have the perfect antidote for anyone out there dying of boredom. &lt;em&gt;The Book of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;—like life itself—is hilarious, tragic, bizarre, and amazing. You may never pass a graveyard again without chuckling.</description>

  <description>It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of &lt;em&gt;I Am the Messenger,&lt;/em&gt; has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.</description>

  <description>Two couples -- businessman Bobby Rose and his artist wife, Carole Ridingham; his partner, Coleman Snow, and Snow's wife, Ruth Farr -- have gone on a walking tour in Wales, during which a fatal accident occurs. The question of what happened preoccupies not only an ensuing negligence trial but also the narrator, Bobby and Carole's daughter, Susan, who lives alone in her parents' house near the coast of Maine. Assisted by court transcripts, a notebook computer containing Ruth Farr's journal, and a young vagrant who has taken to camping on her doorstep, Susan lays open the moral predicament at the heart of the book: we are culpable beings, even though we live in a world of imperfect knowledge.</description>

  <description>Drinky Crow may be the drunken star of the weekly comic strip &lt;strong&gt;Maakies&lt;/strong&gt;, but more often than not, he plays straight man to the hapless ape, Uncle Gabby. Here is the newest collection of Tony Millionaire’s strip, featuring two years of strips collected for the first time. The suicide jokes may come less frequently than in earlier years, but the comedy and superb drawing style are at their peak, as is the volume of triple-X cartoon booze consumed.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maakies&lt;/strong&gt; features the comical adventures of a drunken crow on the high seas, blending vaudeville-style humor and a breathtaking line that harkens back to the glory days of the American comic strip. Designed by publishing’s foremost graphic designer, Chip Kidd, &lt;strong&gt;Little Maakies on the Prairie&lt;/strong&gt; features a beautiful,&lt;br&gt;deluxe, landscape hardcover format that complements the strip’s elegant and classical style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Walace Weiss, A once-famous fantasy novelist, now troubled by drug addiction, sets himself on a final two-fold quest: to finish his first novel in over a decade, and, like the immortal elves of his stories, to try and remember what, in his long life, he should not have forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the prestigious Open Door Series, originally designed for adult literacy in Ireland, these books confirm the truth that a story doesn't have to be big to change our world. &lt;em&gt;The Sorrow of Elves&lt;/em&gt; is part of the US launch of Open Door books written by North American authors.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Bee Season &lt;/em&gt;comes an astonishingly complex psychological drama with a simple setup: two  eleven-year-old girls, best friends and fierce rivals, go into the woods. Only one comes out . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Leaders of a mercurial clique of girls, Celia and Djuna reigned mercilessly over their three followers. One after­noon, they decided to walk home along a forbidden road. Djuna disappeared, and for twenty years Celia blocked out how it happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The lie Celia told to conceal her misdeed became the accepted truth: everyone assumed Djuna had been abducted, though neither she nor her abductor was ever found. Celia’s unconscious avoidance of this has meant that while she and her longtime boyfriend, Huck, are professionally successful, they’ve been unable to move forward, their relationship falling into a rut that threatens to bury them both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Celia returns to her hometown to confess the truth, but her family and childhood friends don’t believe her. Huck wants to be supportive, but his love can’t blind him to all that contra­dicts Celia’s version of the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Celia’s desperate search to understand what happened to Djuna has powerful consequences. A deeply resonant and emotionally charged story, &lt;em&gt;The False Friend &lt;/em&gt;explores the adults that children become—leading us to question the truths that we accept or reject, as well as the lies to which we succumb.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When the sky grows dark&lt;br&gt;and the moon glows bright,&lt;br&gt;everyone goes to sleep . . .&lt;br&gt;except for the watchful owl!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;With a spare, soothing text and beautifully rich and textured illustrations of a starry night, this is the perfect “book of sleep.” Join the owl on his moonlit journey as he watches all the other animals settle in for the night: some sleep standing up, while some sleep on the move! Some sleep peacefully alone, while others sleep all together, huddled close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Il Sung Na makes his American debut with this gorgeous bedtime offering. While each animal rests in its own special way, little ones will also drift off to a cozy sleep.</description>

His unique talent has brought him many public and personal accomplishments, but also a fair share of ridicule and isolation. His search for a meaningful relationship with someone who understand and accepts his idiosyncrasies hits one...  more » dead end after another until he meets Jane, a woman who defies categorization, and becomes the love of his life.</description>

  <description>Following up &lt;em&gt;Finn, &lt;/em&gt;his much-heralded and prize-winning debut whose voice evoked “the mythic styles of his literary predecessors . . . William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, Cormac McCarthy and Edward P. Jones” (&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;), Jon Clinch returns with &lt;em&gt;Kings of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a powerful and haunting story of life, death, and family in rural America.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The edge of civilization is closer than we think.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It’s as close as a primitive farm on the margins of an upstate New York town, where the three Proctor brothers live together in a kind of crumbling stasis. They linger like creatures from an older, wilder, and far less forgiving world—until one of them dies in his sleep and the other two are suspected of murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in a chorus of voices that span a generation, &lt;em&gt;Kings of the Earth&lt;/em&gt; examines the bonds of family and blood, faith and suspicion, that link not just the brothers but their entire community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vernon, the oldest of the Proctors, is reduced by work and illness to a shambling shadow of himself. Feebleminded Audie lingers by his side, needy and unknowable. And Creed, the youngest of the three and the only one to have seen anything of the world (courtesy of the U.S. Army), struggles with impulses and accusations beyond his understanding. We also meet Del Graham, a state trooper torn between his urge to understand the brothers and his desire for justice; Preston Hatch, a kindhearted and resourceful neighbor who’s spent his life protecting the three men from themselves; the brothers’ only sister, Donna, who managed to cut herself loose from the family but is then drawn back; and a host of other living, breathing characters whose voices emerge to shape this deeply intimate saga of the human condition at its limits.</description>

  <description>All the heroes of this story collectionthe boy who refuses to follow the family tradition of having his ring finger cut off; the man who cannot escape his house, no matter what he tries; Robin Hood stealing so much from the rich that he ruins the rich and makes the poor wealthy; Gregor the cockroach, who wakes one day to discover he has become a human teenager; the prophet who cant remember any of the prophecies that have been revealed to him; Ulysses and his minions trapped in the Trojan horseare faced with a world that is always changing, where time and space move in circles, where language has become meaningless. Their stories are mazes from which they cant escape. The simultaneously dark, grotesque, and funny Guadalajara reveals Quim Monzo at his acerbic and witty best.</description>

  <description>Struggling with the sudden, nagging notion that his mother once assassinated a prominent neo-Nazi leader, Ben—a performance artist, about to turn 40—doesn’t know where to turn. His parents are both dead and his brother, having previously been institutionalized, is a lousy source of information. In a non-chronological montage of memories, this inventive tale blends suburban realism with out-of-body surrealism as Ben travels back and forth through life events, attempting to put the pieces of the puzzle together.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It's all fun and games until somebody loses...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Socioanalysts can read minds and motives at a glance, predict the future, manipulate the smallest actions of their unwitting puppets, and crush careers with a single word...or so the popular rumors say. Their arrival is dreaded everywhere in the European Administration, even the Investigation and Interrogation Division. Para-investigator Val Toreth, accustomed to being feared himself, is about to discover the truth of the rumors at first hand, when he is assigned as personal liaison to Carnac, the socioanalyst seconded to I&amp;amp;I to root out anti-Administration sentiments among its staff. And to make matters worse, it seems that his admin Sara is smitten with Carnac and Warrick has a history with him. With his closest allies straddling the line of Carnac's camp, Toreth must rethink the rules of engagement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third book in the Administration series contains the novella &lt;em&gt;Game, Set&lt;/em&gt;, as well as nine short stories in which virtual-reality corporate genius Warrick and Toreth must face new players in the game, and discover whether their association can survive both the tensions between the unlikely pair and the pressures of life in the near future dystopia of New London.</description>

  <description>(From novella introduction)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dearest Reader,&lt;br&gt;This is a bad zombie apocalypse novella. It was written in a hurry. It is riddled with inconsistencies. And it never quite arrives at whatever point it sought to make. But remember: The $25 you donated to charity in exchange for this steaming mess of prose will help our species shuffle along, and I hope you’ll feel warmed by your good deed as you read. Thank you for decreasing the overall worldwide level of suck, and as they say in my hometown: Don’t forget to be awesome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best wishes!&lt;br&gt;John Green&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The book has been made available under creative commons license, so it can be acquired legally here: &lt;a href="http://effyeahnerdfighters.com/post/2835409604/didnt-get-your-chance-to-get-your-hands-on-john" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://effyeahnerdfighters.com/post/2...&lt;/a&gt; :)</description>

  <description>First published when he was barely twenty-five, these stories introduce us to a young builder in despair as he enters the primeval atmosphere of a public bath; teenaged boys lolling about seaside resorts, boasting about their exploits with women; a young man and an older woman playing out the last movement of their affair; and an adolescent musician who prostitutes his talent. This book, which won raves at its first publication, shows all the hallmarks of the writer who became the award-winning film director so well known today.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Doug is having a strange night. A weird buzzing noise on the other side of the wall has woken him up, and there, across the room, next to a huge hole torn out of the bricks, sits his beloved cat, Inky. Who died years ago. But who’s nonetheless slinking out through the hole, beckoning Doug to follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What’s going on? To say any more would spoil the freaky, Burnsian fun, especially because &lt;em&gt;X’ed Out&lt;/em&gt;, unlike &lt;em&gt;Black Hole&lt;/em&gt;, has not been previously serialized, and every unnervingly meticulous panel will be more tantalizing than the last...</description>

  <description>To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it's where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it's not enough...not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son's bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, ROOM is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.</description>

  <description>The Private Lives of Trees tells the story of a single night: a young professor of literature named Julián is reading to his step-daughter Daniela and nervously waiting for his wife Verónica to return from her art class. Each night, Julián has been improvising a story about trees to tell Daniela before she goes to sleep, and each Sunday he works on a novel about a man tending to his bonsai, but something about this night is different. As Julián becomes increasing concerned that Verónica won’t return, he reflects on their life together in minute detail, and imagines what Daniela—at twenty, at twenty-five, at thirty years old, without a mother—will think of his novel. Perhaps even more daring and dizzying than Zambra’s magical Bonsai, The Private Lives of Trees demands to be read in a single sitting, and it casts a spell that will bring you back to it again and again.</description>

  <description>Beginning with a chance encounter with the beautiful Eliza June Watermark and ending, four days and 900 pages later, with the Events of November 17, this is the story of Gurion Maccabee, age ten: a lover, a fighter, a scholar, and a truly spectacular talker. Expelled from three Jewish day-schools for acts of violence and messianic tendencies, Gurion ends up in the Cage, a special lockdown program for the most hopeless cases of Aptakisic Junior High. Separated from his scholarly followers, Gurion becomes a leader of a very different sort, with righteous aims building to a revolution of troubling intensity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Instructions&lt;/em&gt; is an absolutely singular work of fiction by an important new talent. Combining the crackling voice of Philip Roth with the encyclopedic mind of David Foster Wallace, Adam Levin has shaped a world driven equally by moral fervor and slapstick comedy—a novel that is muscular and exuberant, troubling and empathetic, monumental, breakneck, romantic, and unforgettable.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Oliver Sacks's luminous memoir charts the growth of a mind. Born in 1933 into a family of formidably intelligent London Jews, he discovered the wonders of the physical sciences early from his parents and their flock of brilliant siblings, most notably "Uncle Tungsten" (real name, Dave), who "manufactured lightbulbs with filaments of fine tungsten wire." Metals were the substances that first attracted young Oliver, and his descriptions of their colors, textures, and properties are as sensuous and romantic as an art lover's rhapsodies over an Old Master. Seamlessly interwoven with his personal recollections is a masterful survey of scientific history, with emphasis on the great chemists like Robert Boyle, Antoine Lavoisier, and Humphry Davy (Sacks's personal hero). Yet this is not a dry intellectual autobiography; his parents in particular, both doctors, are vividly sketched. His sociable father loved house calls and "was drawn to medicine because its practice was central in human society," while his shy mother "had an intense feeling for structure ... for her [medicine] was part of natural history and biology." For young Oliver, unhappy at the brutal boarding school he was sent to during the war, and afraid that he would become mentally ill like his older brother, chemistry was a refuge in an uncertain world. He would outgrow his passion for metals and become a neurologist, but as readers of &lt;em&gt;Awakenings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&lt;/em&gt; know, he would never leave behind his conviction that science is a profoundly human endeavor. &lt;em&gt;--Wendy Smith&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>For the townspeople of Union Grove, New York, the future is not what they thought it would be.  Transportation is slow and dangerous, so food is grown locally at great expense of time and energy. And the outside world is largely unknown. There may be a president and he may be in Minneapolis now, but people aren’t sure. As the heat of summer intensifies, the residents struggle with the new way of life in a world of abandoned highways and empty houses, horses working the fields and rivers replenished with fish.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A captivating, utterly realistic novel, &lt;em&gt;World Made by Hand&lt;/em&gt; takes speculative fiction beyond the apocalypse and shows what happens when life gets extremely local.</description>

  <description>Combining rich historical detail and a harrowing, pulse-pounding narrative, &lt;em&gt;Close to Shore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;brilliantly re-creates the summer of 1916, when a rogue Great White shark attacked swimmers along the New Jersey shore, triggering mass hysteria and launching the most extensive shark hunt in history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the summer before the United States entered World War I, when ocean swimming was just becoming popular and luxurious Jersey Shore resorts were thriving as a chic playland for an opulent yet still innocent era's new leisure class, Americans were abruptly introduced to the terror of sharks. In July 1916 a lone Great White left its usual deep-ocean habitat and headed in the direction of the New Jersey shoreline. There, near the towns of Beach Haven and Spring Lake-and, incredibly, a farming community &lt;em&gt;eleven miles inland&lt;/em&gt;-the most ferocious and unpredictable of predators began a deadly rampage: the first shark attacks on swimmers in U.S. history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Americans celebrating an astoundingly prosperous epoch much like our own, fueled by the wizardry of revolutionary inventions, the arrival of this violent predator symbolized the limits of mankind's power against nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interweaving a vivid portrait of the era and meticulously drawn characters with chilling accounts of the shark's five attacks and the frenzied hunt that ensued, Michael Capuzzo has created a nonfiction historical thriller with the texture of &lt;em&gt;Ragtime &lt;/em&gt;and the tension of &lt;em&gt;Jaws&lt;/em&gt;. From the unnerving inevitability of the first attack on the esteemed son of a prosperous Philadelphia physician to the spine-tingling moment when a farm boy swimming in Matawan Creek feels the sandpaper-like skin of the passing shark, &lt;em&gt;Close to Shore &lt;/em&gt;is an undeniably gripping saga.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heightening the drama are stories of the resulting panic in the citizenry, press and politicians, and of colorful personalities such as Herman Oelrichs, a flamboyant millionaire who made a bet that a shark was no match for a man (and set out to prove it); Museum of Natural History ichthyologist John Treadwell Nichols, faced with the challenge of stopping a mythic sea creature about which little was known; and, most memorable, the rogue Great White itself moving through a world that couldn't conceive of either its destructive power or its moral right to destroy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scrupulously researched and superbly written, &lt;em&gt;Close to Shore&lt;/em&gt; brings to life a breathtaking, pivotal moment in American history. Masterfully written and suffused with fascinating period detail and insights into the science and behavior of sharks,&lt;em&gt; Close to Shore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;recounts a breathtaking, pivotal moment in American history with startling immediacy.</description>

  <description>When Young Ju is four years old, she learns that her family is leaving their small fishing village in Korea to live in Mi Gook. Young Ju has heard enough about Mi Gook to be sure the place they are moving to is paradise, that she and her family are going to heaven.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After flying through the sky for a long time, Young Ju finds out that Mi Gook is actually a regular earthly place called America. And it doesn't feel at all like heaven. A STEP FROM HEAVEN follows Young's life from the age of 4 all the way up until she is ready for college, as we watch her change from a hopeful girl into a hardened young adult.</description>

Once you have read about his life as a dateless, broken-toothed, God-fearing dweeb and have contemplated his ascension to the buckskin-upholstered throne of the King of the Mild Frontier, you will say, "I, too, can be an author."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; can.</description>

  <description>On a hot summer day in 2005, Dr. Douglas Owsley of the Smithsonian Institution peered into an excavated grave, carefully examining the fragile skeleton that had been buried there for four hundred years. “He was about fifteen years old when he died. And he was European,” Owsley concluded. But how did he know?&lt;p&gt;Scientists discovered this grave inside the remains of James Fort, in Jamestown, Virginia. They were excavating the site with the goal of better understanding the Europeans and Africans who lived in Jamestown and the Chesapeake Bay area during the 1600s and 1700s. Who were these people? How did they live? And how did they die?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as forensic scientists use their knowledge of human remains to help solve crimes, they use similar skills to solve the mysteries of the long-ago past. From the skeletons, the burial practices, and remnants of objects found nearby, scientists can determine gender and ancestry, along with probable age, what the person ate, what lifestyle he or she lived, and the cause of death. In some cases, further research helps scientists speculate on who the dead were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join author Sally M. Walker as she works alongside the scientists who use state-of-the-art methods to decipher clues from America’s colonial past. As you follow their investigations, Walker will introduce you to what scientists believe are the lives of a teenage boy, a ship’s captain, an indentured servant, a colonial official and his family, and an African slave girl. All are reaching beyond the grave to tell us their stories, which are written in bone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>People Live Still in Cashtown Corners is the vivid record of the inner world of pump jockey and infamous couple killer Cliff Klyder. History is clear on what happened at that lonely intersection over the course of one particularly bitter winter: six couples were brutally murdered and cannibalized. What history doesn't give us is what exactly was missing in Cliff Klyder that inspired him to such complicated acts of evil.</description>

  <description>Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school... again. And that's the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy's Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he's angered a few of them. Zeus' master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus' stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.</description>

  <description>All Jin Wang wants is to fit in. When his family moves to a new neighborhood, he suddenly finds that he's the only Chinese American student at his school. Jocks and bullies pick on him constantly, and he has hardly any friends. Then, to make matters worse, he falls in love with an all-American girl...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born to rule over all the monkeys in the world, the story of the Monkey King is one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables. Adored by his subjects, master of the arts of kung-fu, he is the most powerful monkey on earth. But the Monkey King doesn't want to be a monkey. He wants to be hailed as a god...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, and he's ruining his cousin Danny's life. Danny's a popular kid at school, but every year Chin-Kee comes to visit, and every year Danny has to transfer to a new school to escape the shame. This year, though, things quickly go from bad to worse...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These three apparently unrelated tales come together with an unexpected twist, in a modern fable that is hilarious, poignant and action-packed. &lt;em&gt;American Born Chinese&lt;/em&gt; is an amazing rise, all the way up to the astonishing climax--and confirms what a growing number of readers already know: Gene Yang is a major talent.</description>

  <description>Charles Portis has long been acclaimed as one of America’s foremost writers. &lt;em&gt;True Grit &lt;/em&gt;is the basis for two movies, the 1969 classic starring John Wayne and the Academy Award® winning 2010 version starring Jeff Bridges and written and directed by the Coen brothers.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Grit&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Mattie Ross, who is just fourteen years of age when a coward going by the name of Tom Chaney shoots her father down in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and robs him of his life, his horse, and $150 in cash. Mattie leaves home to avenge her father’s blood. With the one-eyed Rooster Cogburn, the meanest available U.S. Marshal, by her side, Mattie pursues the homicide into Indian Territory&lt;em&gt;. True Grit &lt;/em&gt;is eccentric, cool, straight, and unflinching, like Mattie herself. From a writer of true status, this is an American classic through and through.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; This mass-market edition includes an afterword by award-winning Donna Tartt, author of &lt;em&gt;The Little Friend &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Secret History&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A trip out West to work at a racetrack — and a sojourn with a sophisticated gay uncle — bring unexpected discoveries in this quick-witted coming-of-age novel by the author of STONER &amp;amp; SPAZ and MARGAUX WITH AN X.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in the West. The Old West. The Wild West! A whole summer in a new place: a place away from my parents, a place so hot the girls probably wore bikinis to church, a place where I'd take a giant step toward my dream: becoming a vet. A place where — who knows? — anything might happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment sixteen-year-old Billy steps off the train in Tucson, he knows this will be a summer unlike any he's seen in small-town Bradleyville, Missouri. For starters, he's staying with his cool gay uncle, who has managed to get him a job at the racetrack caring for horses. Still, Billy doesn't expect the horseracing world to be quite as rough and tumble as this — toiling side by side with a macho survivalist and falling hard for the feisty, romance-shy "exercise girl" Cara Mae. With his trademark fast-paced dialogue filled with wit and compassion, Ron Koertge tells the tale of an insecure teen who discovers that gaining stature involves more than Stetsons and boots — and that lessons on love and manhood come from the places you least expect.</description>

  <description>From hot new talent Jordan Sonnenblick, a "Tuesdays with Morrie" for teens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;16-year-old Alex decides to get even. His parents are separated, his father is dating his former third-grade teacher, and being 16 isn't easy, especially when it comes to girls. Instead of revenge though, Alex ends up in trouble with the law and is ordered to do community service at a senior center where he is assigned to Solomon Lewis, a "difficult" senior with a lot of gusto, advice for Alex, and a puzzling (yet colorful) Yiddish vocabulary. Eventually, the pair learn to deal with their past and each other in ways that are humorous, entertaining, and life changing.</description>

  <description>A DOCTOR IN the Dutch East Indies torn between his medical duty to help and his own mixed emotions; a middle-aged maidservant whose devotion to her master leads her to commit a terrible act; a hotel waiter whose love for an unapproachable aristocratic beauty culminates in an almost lyrical death and a prisoner-of-war longing to be home again in Russia. In these four stories, Stefan Zweig shows his gift for the acute analysis of emotional dilemmas. His four tragic and moving cameos of the human condition are played out against cosmopolitan and colonial backgrounds in the first half of the twentieth century.</description>

  <description>The stories in this collection run the gamut from playful to tragic, conservative to experimental, but they all have one thing in common: they are no more than 25 words long. Robert Swartwood was inspired by Ernest Hemingway's possibly apocryphal six-word story&amp;amp;mdash;"For Sale: baby shoes, never worn"&amp;amp;mdash;to foster the writing of these incredibly short-short stories. He termed them "hint fiction" because the few chosen words suggest a larger, more complex chain of events. Spare and evocative, these stories prove that a brilliantly honed narrative can be as startling and powerful as a story of traditional length. The 125 gemlike stories in this collection come from such best-selling and award-winning authors as Joyce Carol Oates, Ha Jin, Peter Straub, and James Frey, as well as emerging writers.</description>

  <description>In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ender's Game is the winner of the 1985 Nebula Award for Best Novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for Best Novel.</description>

  <description>Vivian Gandillon relishes the change, the sweet, fierce ache that carries her from girl to wolf. At sixteen, she is beautiful and strong, and all the young wolves are on her tail. But Vivian still grieves for her dead father; her pack remains leaderless and in disarray, and she feels lost in the suburbs of Maryland. She longs for a normal life. But what is normal for a werewolf?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Vivian falls in love with a human, a meat-boy. Aiden is kind and gentle, a welcome relief from the squabbling pack. He’s fascinated by magic, and Vivian longs to reveal herself to him. Surely he would understand her and delight in the wonder of her dual nature, not fear her as an ordinary human would.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivian’s divided loyalties are strained further when a brutal murder threatens to expose the pack. Moving between two worlds, she does not seem to belong in either. What is she really—human or beast? Which tastes sweeter—blood or chocolate?</description>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Mattie Gokey has big dreams but little hope of seeing them come true. Desperate for money, she takes a job at the Glenmore, where hotel guest Grace Brown entrusts her with the task of burning a secret bundle of letters. But when Grace's drowned body is fished from the lake, Mattie discovers that the letters could reveal the grim truth behind a murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in 1906 against the backdrop of the murder that inspired Theodore Dreiser's &lt;em&gt;An American Tragedy,&lt;/em&gt; Jennifer Donnelly's astonishing debut novel effortlessly weaves romance, history, and a murder mystery into something moving, and real, and wholly original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Includes a reader's guide and an interview with the author.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; If an entire nation could seek its freedom, &lt;em&gt;why not a girl?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As the Revolutionary War begins, thirteen-year-old Isabel wages her own fight...for freedom. Promised freedom upon the death of their owner, she and her sister, Ruth, in a cruel twist of fate become the property of a malicious New York City couple, the Locktons, who have no sympathy for the American Revolution and even less for Ruth and Isabel. When Isabel meets Curzon, a slave with ties to the Patriots, he encourages her to spy on her owners, who know details of British plans for invasion. She is reluctant at first, but when the unthinkable happens to Ruth, Isabel realizes her loyalty is available to the bidder who can provide her with freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From acclaimed author Laurie Halse Anderson comes this compelling, impeccably researched novel that shows the lengths we can go to cast off our chains, both physical and spiritual.</description>

But something is not right about this quiet desert town: All the boys he meets seem to vanish before his eyes, while the imposing shadows of the giant tree outside his house appear to be hiding more than darkness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the branches of the massive sycamore scratching at his window, Teddy's life becomes a waking nightmare that no one else believes. Can Teddy escape the tree's terrifying grasp and solve the mystery of the missing boys before he becomes the next boy to disappear?</description>

  <description>Marcelo Sandoval hears music no one else can hear--part of the autism-like impairment no doctor has been able to identify--and he's always attended a special school where his differences have been protected. But the summer after his junior year, his father demands that Marcelo work in his law firm's mailroom in order to experience "the real world." There Marcelo meets Jasmine, his beautiful and surprising coworker, and  Wendell, the son of another partner in the firm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He learns about competition and jealousy, anger and desire. But it's a picture he finds in a file -- a picture of a girl with half a face -- that truly connects him with the real world:  its suffering, its injustice, and what he can do to fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminiscent of "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" in the intensity and purity of its voice, this extraordinary novel is a love story, a legal drama, and a celebration of the music each of us hears inside.</description>

  <description>If Naomi had picked tails, she would have won the coin toss.&lt;br&gt;She wouldn't have had to go back for the yearbook camera, and she wouldn't have hit her head on the steps.&lt;br&gt;She wouldn't have woken up in an ambulance with amnesia.&lt;br&gt;She certainly would have remembered her boyfriend, Ace. She might even have remembered why she fell in love with him in the first place.&lt;br&gt;She would understand why her best friend, Will, keeps calling her "Chief." She'd get all his inside jokes, and maybe he wouldn't be so frustrated with her for forgetting things she can't possibly remember.&lt;br&gt;She'd know about her mom's new family.&lt;br&gt;She'd know about her dad's fiancee.&lt;br&gt;She wouldn't have to spend her junior year relearning all the French she supposedly knew already.&lt;br&gt;She never would have met James, the boy with the questionable past and the even fuzzier future, who tells her he once wanted to kiss her.&lt;br&gt;She wouldn't have wanted to kiss him back.&lt;br&gt;But Naomi picked heads.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Before.&lt;/strong&gt; Miles "Pudge" Halter's whole existence has been one big nonevent, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave the "Great Perhaps"  (François Rabelais, poet) even more. He heads off to the sometimes crazy, possibly unstable, and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed-up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young, who is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing is ever the same.</description>

  <description>Getting teens to read for fun is the ultimate challenge, yet research shows that it improves skills in grammar and spelling while expanding vocabularies. Accessible and encouraging for beginners and an informative refresher for those more experienced, this hands-on expert guide addresses teens' unique needs with practical tools that help readers' advisors: build winning relationships with teens and connect on their terms; communicate with this hard-to-reach audience to create a positive RA experience; use proven questions and techniques to uncover teens' worldview; get up to speed fast using "sure bets" lists; and deal with challenges of controversial topics, homework reading, and recommending "by proxy." Filled with concrete advice, this ready-to-use resource supports public librarians as well as middle and high school library media specialists and library support staff who want to make an impact with teens at a critical time in their lives.</description>

  <description>The final volume of In Search of Lost Time chronicles the years of World War I, when, as M. de Charlus reflects on a moonlit walk, Paris threatens to become another Pompeii. Years later, after the war's end, Proust's narrator returns to Paris, where Mme. Verdurin has become the Princesse de Guermantes. He reflects on time, reality, jealousy, artistic creation, and the raw material for literature-his past life. This volume also includes the indispensable Guide to Proust, an index to all six volumes of the novel.</description>

  <description>The stories and poems in this issue follow a hybrid theme of Memento mori / Carpe diem. The authors here struggle with the tension of living as part spirit and part flesh, reminding us of death and mortality while also urging us to make the most of human relationships and spiritual contemplation while we have breath. Creative Nonfiction in this issue by MaryAnn Wilimek, Josh Howatt, Amy Frykholm, and Gwen Weerts. Fiction from John Matthew Fox, Kenneth Steven, Thomas Allbaugh, Stacy Barton, Jenn Blair, and Lynn Kilb. Poetry by Jeanne Murray Walker, Eugenia Leigh, Nicholas Samaras, Jill Bergkamp, Don Thompson, Michael Wiley, Christopher McCracken, and Tom Noe. Cover design by Harriet Brewster. Photograpy/cover art by J. Brisbin.</description>

  <description>True stories of totally undeserved suffering. Spectacularly depressing. Nobody gets their just deserts. Crushing defeats. No happy endings. Abject misery. Pointless, endless grief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; No lessons of temperance or moderation. No saving grace. No divine intervention. No salvation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Sin, suffering, redemption. That’s the movie, that’s the front page news, that’s the story of popular culture—of American culture. A ray of hope. A comeuppance. An all-for-the-best. Makes it easier to deal with the world’s misery—to know that there’s a reason behind it, that it’ll always work out in the end, that people get what they deserve. The fact: sometimes people suffer for no reason. No sin, no redemption—just suffering, suffering, suffering. &lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Tales of Woe&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt; compiles today’s most awful narratives of human wretchedness. This is not Hollywood catharsis (someone overcomes something and the viewer is uplifted), this is the katharsis of Ancient Greece: you watch people suffer horribly, and then feel better about your own life. &lt;em&gt;Tales of Woe&lt;/em&gt; tells stories of murder, accident, depravity, cruelty, and senseless unhappiness: and all true.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The Tales: strange, unexpected, morbidly enticing. Told straight—with elegance, restraint, and simplicity. The design: a one-of-kind white text on black paper, fluidly readable, and coupled with fifty pages of full-color art. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>There shouldn’t be a Citrus County. Teenage romance should be difficult, but not this difficult. Boys like Toby should cause trouble but not this much. The moon should glow gently over children safe in their beds. Uncles in their rockers should be kind. Teachers should guide and inspire. Manatees should laze and palm trees sway and snakes keep to their shady spots under the azalea thickets. The air shouldn’t smell like a swamp. The stars should twinkle. Shelby should be her own hero, the first hero of Citrus County. She should rescue her sister from underground, rescue Toby from his life. Her destiny should be a hero’s destiny.</description>

  <description>David Pepin has been in love with his wife, Alice, since the moment they met in a university seminar on Alfred Hitchcock. After thirteen years of marriage, he still can’t imagine a remotely happy life without her—yet he obsessively contemplates her demise. Soon she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; dead, and David is both deeply distraught and the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The detectives investigating Alice’s suspicious death have plenty of personal experience with conjugal enigmas: Ward Hastroll is happily married until his wife inexplicably becomes voluntarily and militantly bedridden; and Sam Sheppard is especially sensitive to the intricacies of marital guilt and innocence, having decades before been convicted and then exonerated of the brutal murder of &lt;em&gt;his &lt;/em&gt;wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, these men are in the business of figuring things out, even as Pepin’s role in Alice’s death grows ever more confounding when they link him to a highly unusual hit man called Mobius. Like the Escher drawings that inspire the computer games David designs for a living, these complex, interlocking dramas are structurally and emotionally intense, subtle, and intriguing; they brilliantly explore the warring impulses of affection and hatred, and pose a host of arresting questions. Is it possible to know anyone fully, &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Are murder and marriage two sides of the same coin, each endlessly recycling into the other? And what, in the end, is the truth about love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mesmerizing, exhilarating, and profoundly moving, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Peanut &lt;/em&gt;is a police procedural of the soul, a poignant investigation of the relentlessly mysterious human heart—and a first novel of the highest order.</description>

  <description>When he agrees to do a favor for his old friend Liz Carey in Corporate Fraud, Para-investigator Val Toreth is hoping for a simple case. After all, kidnapping and dismemberment are all in a day's work for the Investigation and Interrogation Division. But in the European Administration, simplicity is often a dangerous illusion, and anyone who goes looking for trouble in the corporate world is certain to find more than they bargained for. Fraud, sabotage, espionage, blackmail, decades-long vendettas, and murder--the more powerful the corporations, the darker their secrets. Corporate insiders and innocent bystanders alike are all too easily caught up in the conflicts, but when suspects can hide behind money and power, what chance is there of any justice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And on top of everything else, Toreth also has to deal with Keir Warrick. But that's easy. That's just sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sequel to &lt;em&gt;Mind Fuck&lt;/em&gt;, this second book in the Administration series contains the novella &lt;em&gt;Quid Pro Quo&lt;/em&gt;, as well as five short stories set in the near future dystopia of New London and centered around professional investigator and interrogator Val Toreth, and technical genius turned corporate Keir Warrick.</description>

  <description>"I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU CHILDREN WOULD BE THE ONES TO FIND IT.OR WHAT DANGER YOU WOULD BE PUTTING YOURSELVES IN."Throughout time, the forces of good and evil have battled continuously, maintaining the "balance." Whenever evil forces grow too powerful, a champion of good is called to drive them back. Now, with evil's power rising and a champion yet to be found, three siblings find themselves at the center of a mystical war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jane, Simon, and Barney Drew have discovered an ancient text that reads of a legendary grail lost centuries ago. The grail is an object of great power, buried with a vital secret. As the Drews race against the forces of evil, they must piece together the text's clues to find the grail -- and keep its secret safe until a new champion rises.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The True Story of Hansel and Gretel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the last months of the Nazi occupation of Poland, two children are left by their father and stepmother to find safety in a dense forest. Because their real names will reveal their Jewishness, they are renamed "Hansel" and "Gretel." They wander in the woods until they are taken in by Magda, an eccentric and stubborn old woman called "witch" by the nearby villagers. Magda is determined to save them, even as a German officer arrives in the village with his own plans for the children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combining classic themes of fairy tales and war literature, Louise Murphy’s haunting novel of journey and survival, of redemption and memory, powerfully depicts how war is experienced by families and especially by children. &lt;strong&gt;The True Story of Hansel and Gretel&lt;/strong&gt; tells a resonant, riveting story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sodom and Gomorrah&lt;/em&gt; opens a new phase of &lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time&lt;/em&gt;. While watching the pollination of the Duchess de Guer-mantes’s orchid, the narrator secretly observes a sexual encounter between two men. “Flower and plant have no conscious will,” Samuel Beckett wrote of Proust’s representation of sexuality. “They are shameless, exposing their genitals. And so in a sense are Proust’s men and women . . . shameless. There is no question of right and wrong.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin’s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff’s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of &lt;em&gt;Á la recherché du temps perdu&lt;/em&gt; (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade in 1989).</description>

  <description>On an unseasonably warm Easter Sunday, a young girl named&lt;br&gt;Ivy discovers a chilling secret in the basement of the Rumbaugh&lt;br&gt;pharmacy across the street from the hotel where she lives with&lt;br&gt;her mother. The discovery reveals a disturbing side to the&lt;br&gt;eccentric lives of family friends Abner and Adolph Rumbaugh,&lt;br&gt;known throughout their small western Pennsylvania town&lt;br&gt;simply as the Twins. It seems that Ab and Dolph have been&lt;br&gt;compelled by a powerful mutual love for their deceased mother&lt;br&gt;to do something extraordinary, something that in its own&lt;br&gt;twisted way bridges the gap between the living and the dead.&lt;br&gt;Immediately, Ivy's discovery provokes the revelation of a&lt;br&gt;Rumbaugh family curse, a curse that, as Ivy will learn over the&lt;br&gt;coming years, holds a strange power over herself and her own&lt;br&gt;mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his third book for young adults, Jack Gantos has scripted a&lt;br&gt;completely original drama. With gothic flavor and black humor,&lt;br&gt;he depicts a group of people bound together by love,&lt;br&gt;compulsion . . . and a passion for taxidermy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The "Guermantes Way," in this the third volume of &lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time&lt;/em&gt;, refers to the path that leads to the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes's chateau near Combray. It also represents the narrator's passage into the rarefied "social kaleidoscope" of the Guermantes's Paris salon, an important intellectual playground for Parisian society, where he becomes a party to the wit and manners of the Guermantes's drawing room. Here he encounters nobles, officers, socialites, and assorted consorts, including Robert de Saint Loup and his prostitute mistress Rachel, the Baron de Charlus, and the Prince de Borodino.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin's acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff's translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of &lt;em&gt;A la recherche du temps perdu&lt;/em&gt; (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliotheque de la Pleiade in 1989).</description>

  <description>Four stories narrated from four different perspectives crisscross throughout this poignant and playful novel. Young Tomas – who wants above all else to be intelligent – embarks upon a dizzying search for a rare blue dragonfly, of which he believes there are only nine or ten in the world (and therefore probably only two or three in his town). Drawing us into the channels of his mercurial mind, skipping through misadventures and stumbling upon a host of small wonders, we are introduced to three generations of his motley family tree and accompany them on their odd quests. From the moonlit creation of a rugby field on a golf course, to the unearthing of the escapades of his anarchist grandfather, a celebrated carpenter, the medley of tales flips on their heads standard assumptions about age, wisdom, sensibility, and truth, inviting us to open our eyes to the bounty of tiny marvels that make up our world.</description>

  <description>Irene dos Santos disappeared at age 15. Believed to have drowned while on holiday with her best friend, Lily Martinez, her body was never found. Now, years later, she appears ghostlike in Lily's dreams, prompting a quest for the truth behind her disappearance. Mysteriously, Lily, eight-months pregnant with her first child, slips and falls on the same day that the statue of Maria Lionza, Patron Saint of their Venezuelan town, cracks in two. Confined to her bed, Lily is surrounded by her family and closest friends, who agree that a Novena to Maria Lionza will guide the baby's spirit safely into the world. Together, through their nine nights of prayer, each offers a story to entertain Lily and her baby. What emerges is a vivid picture of Venezuela during a time of revolution and uncertainty-and the unraveling of the mystery behind Irene dos Santos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The Disappearance of Irene Dos Santos is an intricately woven tale of love and memory from a deeply talented writer."&lt;br&gt; --- Laila Lalami, author of Hope and Other Dangerous Pursuits and Secret Son &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Mascarenhas uses a 15-year-old girl's disappearance to spin a multilayered history of a Venezuelan family, incorporating folklore, political intrigue and magical realism...This family epic is immersive; no character or event is left unexplored from multiple perspectives. Indeed, the conclusion is like the final piece of an intricate puzzle." --Publishers Weekly</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The genial but troubled New Englander whose single-minded partisan loyalties inflamed the nation's simmering battle over slavery &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charming and handsome, Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire was drafted to break the deadlock of the 1852 Democratic convention. Though he seized the White House in a landslide against the imploding Whig Party, he proved a dismal failure in office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael F. Holt, a leading historian of nineteenth-century partisan politics, argues that in the wake of the Whig collapse, Pierce was consumed by an obsessive drive to unify his splintering party rather than the roiling country. He soon began to overreach. Word leaked that Pierce wanted Spain to sell the slave-owning island of Cuba to the United States, rousing sectional divisions. Then he supported repeal of the Missouri Compromise, which limited the expansion of slavery in the west. Violence broke out, and "Bleeding Kansas" spurred the formation of the Republican Party. By the end of his term, Pierce's beloved party had ruptured, and he lost the nomination to James Buchanan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this incisive account, Holt shows how a flawed leader, so dedicated to his party and ill-suited for the presidency, hastened the approach of the Civil War.</description>

  <description>Quick-there's a monster in your closet! No? Then, MAKE one!&lt;br&gt;Every closet hides a multitude of out-of-style sweaters, pearl-trimmed jackets, ill-fitting jeans…and worse. And all the repurposing in the world won't make them wearable again. Fortunately, the inimitable John Murphy of &lt;em&gt;Stupid Sock Creature&lt;/em&gt; fame has devised a �green” solution: take those ugly pink sport coats and muumuus and turn them into goofy goonies, multi-legged monsters, other awesomely adorable creatures. They're all charmingly illustrated with cartoonish élan by the author himself.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>At the heart of this vibrant saga is a vast ship, the Ibis. Its destiny is a tumultuous voyage across the Indian Ocean; its purpose, to fight China’s vicious nineteenth-century Opium Wars. As for the crew, they are a motley array of sailors and stowaways, coolies and convicts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a time of colonial upheaval, fate has thrown together a diverse cast of Indians and Westerners, from a bankrupt raja to a widowed tribeswoman, from a mulatto American freedman to a freespirited French orphan. As their old family ties are washed away, they, like their historical counterparts, come to view themselves as jahaj-bhais, or ship-brothers. An unlikely dynasty is born, which will span continents, races, and generations. &lt;br&gt;The vast sweep of this historical adventure spans the lush poppy fields of the Ganges, the rolling high seas, the exotic backstreets of China. But it is the panorama of characters, whose diaspora encapsulates the vexed colonial history of the East itself, that makes &lt;em&gt;Sea of Poppies&lt;/em&gt; so breathtakingly alive -- a masterpiece from one of the world’s finest novelists.</description>

  <description>Combine an optimistic realtor selling a home with a sexual playground, a kindergartener convinced he's actually French and something called, "Chicken Soup for the Kidnapper's Soul," and you get Patrick Wensink's hilarious collection of short stories. Sex Dungeon for Sale! Takes these bold characters and a few other outrageous situations to create an unforgettable and quick literary ride.  &lt;p&gt;  While keeping an eye focused on the surreal, but both feet firmly planted in reality, these stories dissect a modern world so strange you have to laugh. Wensink's punchy style is perfect for the brevity-obsessed Twitter generation, but saves room in his utility belt of brief tales for humor, humanity and an extra helping of WTF?.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;About the New Bizarro Author Series:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  With the current state of the publishing industry, it is hard for new voices to be heard. We wanted to do something about this. The New Bizarro Author Series is designed to showcase first books by unknown writers of the weird at a low price. By publishing these books on a smaller budget, we're able to take more risks and publish more writers who might not otherwise be given a chance. Created by authors Kevin L. Donihe and Carlton Mellick III, and published by Eraserhead Press. Try out one of these new talents to take a glimpse at the bizarro writers of the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The men on board HMS Terror have every expectation of triumph. As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape. The Terror swells with the heart-stopping suspense and heroic adventure that have won Dan Simmons praise as "a writer who not only makes big promises but keeps them" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). With a haunting and constantly surprising story based on actual historical events, The Terror is a novel that will chill you to your core.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling and award-winning author Ron Rash is "a storyteller of the highest rank" (Jeffrey Lent) and has won comparisons to John Steinbeck, Cormac McCarthy, and Gabriel García Márquez. It is rare that an author can capture the complexities of a place as though it were a person, and rarer still that one can reveal a land as dichotomous and fractious as Appalachia—a muse; a siren; a rugged, brutal landscape of exceptional beauty, promise, and suffering—with the honesty and precision of a photograph. "If you haven't heard of the Southern writer Ron Rash, it is time you should" (&lt;em&gt;The Plain Dealer&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Burning Bright&lt;/em&gt;, the stories span the years from the Civil War to the present day, and Rash's historical and modern settings are sewn together in a hauntingly beautiful patchwork of suspense and myth, populated by raw and unforgettable characters mined from the landscape of Appalachia. In "Back of Beyond," a pawnshop owner who profits from the stolen goods of local meth addicts—including his own nephew—comes to the aid of his brother and sister-in-law when they are threatened by their son. The pregnant wife of a Lincoln sympathizer alone in Confederate territory takes revenge to protect her family in "Lincolnites." And in the title story, a woman from a small town marries an outsider; when an unknown arsonist starts fires in the Smoky Mountains, her husband becomes the key suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these stories, Rash brings to light a previously unexplored territory, hidden in plain sight—first a landscape, and then the dark yet lyrical heart and the alluringly melancholy soul of his characters and their home.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The eagerly anticipated follow-up to the New York Times bestselling psychological thriller In the Woods &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Six months after the events of &lt;em&gt;In the Woods&lt;/em&gt;, Detective Cassie Maddox is still trying to recover. She's transferred out of the murder squad and started a relationship with Detective Sam O'Neill, but she's too badly shaken to make a commitment to him or to her career. Then Sam calls her to the scene of his new case: a young woman found stabbed to death in a small town outside Dublin. The dead girl's ID says her name is Lexie Madison (the identity Cassie used years ago as an undercover detective, and she looks exactly like Cassie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With no leads, no suspects, and no clue to Lexie's real identity, Cassie's old undercover boss, Frank Mackey, spots the opportunity of a lifetime. They can say that the stab wound wasn't fatal and send Cassie undercover in her place to find out information that the police never would and to tempt the killer out of hiding. At first Cassie thinks the idea is crazy, but she is seduced by the prospect of working on a murder investigation again and by the idea of assuming the victim's identity as a graduate student with a cozy group of friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As she is drawn into Lexie's world, Cassie realizes that the girl's secrets run deeper than anyone imagined. Her friends are becoming suspicious, Sam has discovered a generations-old feud involving the old house the students live in, and Frank is starting to suspect that Cassie's growing emotional involvement could put the whole investigation at risk. Another gripping psychological thriller featuring the headstrong protagonist we've come to love, from an author who has proven that she can deliver.</description>

  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A collection of stories from one of the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s “twenty young fiction writers of the new millennium,” a series of unforgettable glimpses into contemporary family life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Set in the American Southwest, and featuring one previously unpublished story, &lt;em&gt;Nothing Right &lt;/em&gt;shows one of our best writers working at the top of her game. Antonya Nelson’s stories are masterpieces: poignant, hilarious, truthful explorations of domesticity. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The artfully rendered characters in &lt;em&gt;Nothing Right &lt;/em&gt;try to keep themselves intact as their personal lives explode around them. A mother and her teenage son finally find common ground when his girlfriend becomes pregnant. A woman leaves her husband and finds herself living with a stranger who is getting extensive plastic surgery while her best friend is dying of cancer. In “Or Else,” one of three short stories nominated for a National Magazine Award for the &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, a man brings his girlfriend to a house he claims belongs to his family, only to have his lie exposed when one of the real owners comes home to scatter her father’s ashes. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;These stories are sure to delight longtime fans and readers lucky enough to be just discovering Antonya Nelson.&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Jonas Wergeland is on trial, accused of murdering his wife. The most beloved and celebrated television personality in Norway, Wergeland's programs on the history of Norway held the country in his thrall. Now the spectacle of his trial has done the same. A professor is hired to write the definitive biography of Wergeland, but finds himself unable to process the astonishing volume of contradictory information he unearths--until a mysterious woman appears on his doorstep. Possessing innumerable intimate stories about Jonas, the woman details the dark side of his rise to prominence, and through her stories tries to explain what made him a murderer. Told in a series of short, interconnected, self-referential, and constantly evolving passages--each shooting off from the last like light from a prism and moving indifferently from the past to the present--Jan Kjaerstad has constructed a wonder of a novel whose form and subject explore what, in the apparent absence of simple cause and effect, makes life coherent.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT COOLIO'S BEEN DOING LONGER THAN RAPPING: COOKING &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Coolio started making thirty-minute meals when he was ten years old and has since developed a whole new cuisine: Ghetto Gourmet. His recipes are built around solid comfort foods with a &lt;em&gt;healthy twist&lt;/em&gt; that don't break the bank. Start your Ghetto Gourmet adventure with some "Soul Rolls," follow-up with "Finger-Lickin', Rib-Stickin', Fall-Off-the-Bone-and-into-Your-Mouth Chicken," and fi nish off with "Banana Ba-ba-ba-bread" sweetened with golden honey. Chapters such as "How to Become a Kitchen Pimp," "Chillin' and Grillin'," and "Pasta Like a Rasta" will guide you through creating 5 star meals at a 1 star price. You can't fi nd fusions like Blasian (black Asian) or Ghettalian (ghetto Italian) in restaurants, but you can have them cooking away in your kitchen faster and easier than ordering takeout. As Coolio says, "All you need is a little bit of food, and a little bit of know-how."</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;This one-volume edition contains the complete collection of Coward's twenty short stories, spanning fifty years of his working life. Written with Coward's inimitable poise and wit, the stories variously describe back-stage intrigues, Hollywood champagne breakfasts, suburban romances and gossip round the captain's table. He reveals himself as a consummate prose stylist demonstrating why, for all his success in virtually every other field of entertainment, he returned again and again to the short story.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>The revised 2nd edition of this practical how-to for all types of librarians will teach you to understand the needs of public, academic, and special library users across any virtual setting--email, text messaging, and social networking Web sites--as welll as in traditional and face-to-face models of communication. Based on the latest research in communication theory, the book includes new exercises and examples to help you practice effective reference transactions and avoid common pitfalls. Guidance for helping users with special language-related needs (such as speech and hearing disabilities and English language learners) and social difficulties is also included, as are updated chapters on readers' advisory interviewing and policy and training procedures. An extensively revised chapter on virtual reference features new sections on live chat and instant messaging services as well as a discussion of Web 2.0 initiatives and updated information on email reference.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Here I was, doing ninety on the Santa Monica Freeway with a quart of whiskey shoved into my crotch and my dead neighbor in the trunk. It had come time to leave Los Angeles.&lt;/em&gt; Thus begins the pre-apocalyptic, cross-country race with death to bury the murdered past in Joseph Mattson's EMPTY THE SUN, an urgent, beautifully reckless novel of transgressive loss and hunted redemption culminating in a shotgun fight with God. Includes an open-road, open-whiskey soundtrack by enigmatic and stunning Drag City recording artist Six Organs of Admittance.</description>

  <description>Ayun Halliday's fourth book, &lt;em&gt;Dirty Sugar Cookies,&lt;/em&gt; takes readers into the unpredictable mind and comical experiences of a true anti-foodie, giving even the most hopeless cooks a moment of relief from self-criticism, and the least discriminating eaters a reality check. Halliday started out a repressed picky eater without so much as a single fast-food-loving sibling to save her from the gourmet ambitions of a mother whose recipe for Far East Celery once received favorable mention in the &lt;em&gt;Indianapolis Star.&lt;/em&gt; Her palate has since expanded to the degree that she'll fork down anything from chili-smothered insects that pass for an exotic destination's local delicacies to a peanut found wedged between the cushions of a theater seat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From summer camp's unlimited Pop-Tarts to the post-coital breakfasts of a well-traveled actress-waitress and the frustrating payback of cooking for some finicky offspring of the author's own, &lt;em&gt;Dirty Sugar Cookies&lt;/em&gt; is an omnivorous, hilarious chronicle of culinary awakening.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In the hopeful 1950s, Frank and April Wheeler appear to be a model couple: bright, beautiful, talented, with two young children and a starter home in the suburbs. Perhaps they married too young and started a family too early. Maybe Frank's job is dull. And April never saw herself as a housewife. Yet they have always lived on the assumption that greatness is only just around the corner. But now that certainty is about to crumble.With heartbreaking compassion and remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their spiritual birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves.</description>

  <description>In the waning summer days, a lake appears almost overnight in the middle of Los Angeles. Out of fear and love, a young single mother commits a desperate act: convinced that the lake means to take her small son from her, she determines to stop it and becomes the lake's Dominatrix-Oracle, "the Queen of the Zed Night." Acclaimed by many critics as Steve Erickson's greatest novel, &lt;em&gt;Our Ecstatic Days&lt;/em&gt; takes place on the forbidden landscape of a defiant heart.</description>

  <description>Smart, socially gifted, and chronically impatient, Adam and Cynthia Morey are so perfect for each other that united they become a kind of fortress against the world. In their hurry to start a new life, they marry young and have two children before Cynthia reaches the age of twenty-five. Adam is a rising star in the world of private equity and becomes his boss's protégé. With a beautiful home in the upper-class precincts of Manhattan, gorgeous children, and plenty of money, they are, by any reasonable standard, successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Moreys' standards are not the same as other people's. The future in which they have always believed for themselves and their children—a life of almost boundless privilege, in which any desire can be acted upon and any ambition made real—is still out there, but it is not arriving fast enough to suit them. As Cynthia, at home with the kids day after identical day, begins to drift, Adam is confronted with a choice that will test how much he is willing to risk to ensure his family's happiness and to recapture the sense that the only acceptable life is one of infinite possibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Privileges&lt;/strong&gt; is an odyssey of a couple touched by fortune, changed by time, and guided above all else by their epic love for each other. Lyrical, provocative, and brilliantly imagined, this is a timely meditation on wealth, family, and what it means to leave the world richer than you found it.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From one of our greatest novelists comes  this luminous portrait of the world’s first  literary rock star.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acclaimed biographer of James Joyce Edna O’Brien  has written an intimate biography that suits her fiery and charismatic subject. She follows Byron  from the dissipations of Regency London to the  wilds of Albania and the Socratic pleasures of  Greece and Turkey, culminating in his meteoric  rise to fame at the age of twenty-four on the  publication of &lt;em&gt;Childe Harold&lt;/em&gt;. With her  prismatic eye and novelistic style, O’Brien  eerily captures the spirit of the man and  creates an indelible portrait of Byron that  explodes the Romantic myth. From his escapades  with John Edleston, the fourteen-year-old  Cambridge choir boy, to those with a galaxy of  women that included his half-sister, his wife of one year, and the Italian countess who forsook  her satyr-like husband for “the peer of England  and its greatest poet,” Byron scandalized the  world and inspires “Byronmania” to this day.  Byron, as brilliantly rendered by O’Brien, is  the poet as rebel, imaginative and lawless, and  defiantly immortal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>These slyly simple stories of the unforgiving South African Transvaal reveal a little-described (and rarely romanticized) world of Afrikaner life in the late 19th Century. Like our own Mark Twain, Herman Charles Bosman wields a laughing intolerance of foolishness and prejudice, a dazzling use of wit and clear- sighted judgment. Spun by the plainclothes local visionary and storyteller Oom Shalk Lourens, these moving and satirical glimpses of lethargic herdsmen, ambitious concertina players, legendary leopards and mambas, and love-struck dreamers lay bare immense emotions, contradictions, and mysteries within the smallest movements and unadorned talk of the Groot Marico District. Leading oral tradition by the hand into a territory all his own, Bosman maps a world at once lucid and layered, distant yet powerfully familiar.</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt; Pumpkins are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be scary!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Based on his popular and addictive website ExtremePumpkins.com, Tom Nardone has created a full-color guide to pumpkin carving that's truly frightening. Featuring the website's signature Puking Pumpkin, and spanning everything from Drowning Pumpkin, Crime Scene Pumpkin, and Cannibal Pumpkin to Electrocuted Pumpkin and other never-before-seen designs, this gleefully gory guide is nothing short of a manifesto to take back Halloween from the cheerful, the cutesy, and the parent-sanctioned. For the egg-throwing, toilet tissue- streaming, window-soaping teenager in all of us, finally- a whole new way to celebrate October 31.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;About the 'neon fuzz': a note on the book jacket from designer Jason Booher...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"When you read Harkaway's novel, a gigantic sense of weirdness and cool and doom surround the characters. To capture all that plus the absurd humor that pervades this amazing book, the jacket obviously had to be something special. So the otherworldliness that perhaps only neon fuzz can bring hopes to evoke these feelings and add to the strength of and interplay between the words in the title and author's name."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A wildly entertaining debut novel, introducing a bold new voice that combines antic humor with a stunning futuristic vision to give us an electrifyingly original tale of love, friendship and the apocalypse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&lt;em&gt; couldn’t&lt;/em&gt; be a fire along the Jorgmund Pipe. It was the last thing the world needed. But there it was, burning bright on national television. The Pipe was what kept the Livable Zone safe from the bandits, monsters and nightmares the Go Away War had left in its wake. The fire was a very big problem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Gonzo Lubitsch and his friends, the Haulage &amp;amp; HazMat Emergency Civil Freebooting Company, a team of master troubleshooters who roll into action when things get particularly hot. They helped build the Pipe. Now they have to preserve it—and save humanity yet again. But this job is not all it seems. It will touch more closely on Gonzo’s life, and that of his best friend, than either of them can imagine. And it will decide the fate of the Gone-Away World.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equal parts raucous adventure, comic odyssey, geek nirvana and ultracool epic,&lt;em&gt; The Gone-Away World&lt;/em&gt; is a story of—among other things—pirates, war, mimes, greed and ninjas. But it is also the story of a world, not unlike our own, in desperate need of heroes—however unlikely they may seem.</description>

  <description>Born the child of a homo and a hypochondriac (Okay, okay. Her dad’s not really a homosexual. He just acts like it. Her mom, however, really is a hypochondriac), Sara Barron never stood a chance of being normal. At age eleven, she starts writing porn (“He humped me wildly with his wiener”). At twelve, she gets mistaken for a trannie. The pre-op sort, no less. By seventeen, she's featured on the Jerry Springer Show. And that’s all before she hits New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;People Are Unappealing&lt;/em&gt; tells the strange, funny, and sometimes filthy stories of Sara Barron’s twisted suburban upbringing and deranged attempt at taking the Big Apple by storm–first as an actor (then a waiter), then a dancer (then a waiter), then a comic (then a waiter). It’s there that she meets the ex-boyfriend turned street clown. The silk pajama-clad poet. The OCD Xanax addict who refuses to have sex wearing any fewer than three condoms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barron has a knack for attracting the unattractive. &lt;em&gt;People Are Unappealing&lt;/em&gt; is her wickedly funny look at the dark side of humanity.</description>

  <description>Toasted golden in a pan or browned to melty perfection under the broiler, grilled cheese is the ultimate comfort food -- and a meal in itself. And believe it or not, it just got better. Author Marlena Spieler has created 50 mouthwatering new takes on this fromagophile's favorite. Her tantalizing pairings range from hearty Sage Sausage and Jack Cheese with Preserved Lemon to Melted Alpenzell, Emmentaler, Pear, and Cumin. There are also plenty of new twists on the tried and true, such as Smoky Bacon and Cheddar with Chipotle Relish or Fresh Mozzarella, Prosciutto, and Fig Jam. Oozing with cheese suggestions, an array of quick-to-make mustards, and tips on choosing the perfect bread for each sandwich, this cookbook will make anyone stand up and say "cheese!"</description>

  <description>On a manic ride from the mixing boards of hip-hop recording studios to mansions in the Hamptons and the projects of the urban ghetto, Detective Black Sallie Blue Eyes ventures behind-the-scenes of the record business in search of a street-side assassin. Casting a widely satirical net on all spectra and species of the Manhattan social scene—from tweaking downtown hipsters, wrestling fetishists, and rapper wannabes to real estate moguls and hip-hop impresarios—this satirical urban noir novel offers intrigue, insight, and an innovative brand of humor.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Fiction. An astounding debut novel, written with courage, innovation, wisdom, style. Oisin Curran leads us onto a topology of narrative surfaces that appear and disappear seamlessly: subway terrorists in an urban density, a bucolic meadow and stream, postapocalyptic devastation, a ninth century abbey, forty-fifth century conspiracies. The narrative here allows one to enter the creative guts of storytelling, to experience it as a living force. Curran is like Beckett, Woolf, Joyce, Barnes, Bernhard, Celine, Faulkner, in whose work powerful prose excavates the ground of narrative itself, and exposes the sources and necessity of storytelling.</description>

  <description>Photographer Julian Hibbard offers an abecedary unlike any other. Drawing on his professional work shooting black &amp;amp; white and color photographs for everything from CD and book covers to high-end fashion, Hibbard has paired a word with one of his photographs for all twenty-six letters in the alphabet. The resulting board book contains images that evoke the shadowy, sexy and voyeuristic noir aesthetic. Hibbard's ability to infuse his frames with palpable emotion draws viewers back to his work, over and over again, as they consider his photographs in relation to words like "forbidden," "lascivious" and "quiescent." If The Noir A-Z is visible, people will not be able to resist it. This is not your child's board book!</description>

  <description>Set adrift by his wife’s suicide and struggling to keep a grip on reality, Bunny Munro does the only thing he can think of: with his young son in tow, he hits the road. To his son, waiting patiently in the car while his father peddles beauty wares and quickies to lonely housewives in the south of England, Bunny is a hero, larger than life. But Bunny himself, haunted by what might be his wife’s ghost, seems only dimly aware of his son’s existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his bizarre trip shades into a final reckoning, when he can no longer be sure what is real and what is not, Bunny finally begins to recognize the love he feels for his son. And he sees that the revenants of his world—decrepit fathers, vengeful ghosts, jealous husbands and horned psychokillers—are lurking in the shadows, waiting to exact their toll.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At turns dark and humane, &lt;em&gt;The Death of Bunny Munro&lt;/em&gt; is a tender portrait of the relationship between a boy and his father, with all the wit and enigma that fans will recognize as Nick Cave’s singular vision.</description>

  <description>On an icy winter weekend, seven friends celebrate New Year's Eve at Stoneborough, a grand manor in the English countryside. They've been brought together by Lucas Heathfield, a young man who recently inherited the property after the tragic death of his uncle Patrick. Though still raw from the loss of his last family member, Lucas welcomes this tight-knit group of friends to the estate he hopes will become their home away from home-an escape from London where they can all relax and rekindle the revelry of their college days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucas's best friend, Joanna, finds herself oddly affected by the cavernous manse, with its lavish mythological ceiling mural and sprawling grounds, and awakened to a growing bond with Lucas. Much to her surprise, he reveals that he's loved her for years. But as they begin to find their way from friendship to romance, Joanna can't shake the feeling that the house is having its own effect on them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in London, Joanna is stunned when Lucas announces that he and their impetuous friend Danny are moving into Stoneborough full-time. Her concern seems justified as Lucas, once ensconced, becomes completely ensnared in the turbulent past that seems to haunt the house - a past that is captured in old movie reels featuring Lucas's now-dead family: his charismatic uncle Patrick, his lovely mother, Claire, and his golden-boy father, Justin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over one decadent, dramatic year, as the friends frequently gather at the shadowed residence, secrets slide out and sexual tensions escalate, shattering friendships and forever changing lives. And all the while, the house cradles a devastating secret. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By turns taut and sensual, mesmerizing and disturbing, The House at Midnight is a gripping psychological novel that pulls the reader into the thrall of its ominous atmosphere. Newcomer Lucie Whitehouse has written a tense and captivating story that will linger long after the final, shocking pages.</description>

  <description>Two new series of small picture books introduce concepts and sports, respectively. The paper-over-board, hand-size Thingy Things series by Chris Raschka uses alliteration and word repetition to build reading skills; his swift brushstrokes and calligraphic lines match the text's minimalism. The main character of Moosey Moose is mad because he wants his long pants; that of Wormy Worm gleefully wiggles; Whaley Whale describes a game of hide-and-seek; and the hero of Sluggy Slug is downright sluggish -- he simply won't go.</description>

  <description>Rupert has been accused of a terrible crime, and his imagined defense begins the night he met the love of his life, Mira. By turns shockingly honest, incredibly funny, and clearly unhinged, Rupert's defense includes rants about the properly formed insult and men who wear comfortable sweaters. It also visits the memory-sites of Rupert and Mira's short-lived affair: her apartment, their favorite cafés and restaurants, and the city's public squares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With each story Rupert attaches to these places his defense becomes a little more outlandish, while he becomes increasingly convinced that his innocence is beyond doubt. When he reaches the end of his defense, delivering the decisive blow against his accusers and describing the scene of the crime, the full depth of Rupert's depravity is finally revealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rupert: A Confession is a brilliantly composed monologue that fully exposes—despite the misdirection and bizarre revelations of its teller—the innermost workings of a confused mind. Recalling Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men, Rupert: A Confession is simultaneously offensive, funny, and compelling, and it serves as a perfect introduction to one of the most talented and controversial writers at work in the Netherlands today.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A strange and salacious memoir of life at the ultimate hippie college during the height of Reaganomics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Opening its doors in 1970, Hampshire College was once known as a land of eternal partying, where countercultures thrived and jocks were nowhere to be found. Self- proclaimed nerd Richard Rushfield knew this progressive Massachusetts campus was the place for him, offering a chance to shed his squeaky-clean California upbringing. He was part of the freshman class of 1986, hiding out from Reagan-era excess in a liberal haven where overachievement and preppy clothes were banned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By turns hilarious, ironic, and steeped in history, &lt;em&gt;Don't Follow Me, I'm Lost&lt;/em&gt; takes readers to a campus populated by Deadheads, club kids, poets, and insomniac filmmakers, at a time when America saw the rise of punk and grunge alongside neo-conservatism, earnest calls for political correctness, and Take Back the Night vigils. Shunned by all of the school's reigning subcultures, Rushfield joins the most hated clique on campus, the Supreme Dicks, navigates a dating scene where to express interest in anything is social suicide, and mostly avoids class where hippie professors blather on about post-structuralism. Culminating in a mad clash of slackers and yuppies, &lt;em&gt;Don't Follow Me, I'm Lost&lt;/em&gt; captures a watershed moment for American youth in one hilarious and unforgettable trip.</description>

When a nuclear holocaust ravages the United States, a thousand years of civilization are stripped away overnight, and tens of millions of people are killed instantly.

  <description>Jessica Treat’s stories invite readers in, only to make them complicit in transgressive acts, real or imagined: adultery, trespassing , sexual jealousy. Her dark humor and portrayal of consciousness recall authors as diverse as Amy Hempel, Mary Caponegro, and Lydia Davis. Comic, skillful, and menacing, the stories in &lt;em&gt;Meat Eaters &amp;amp; Plant Eaters&lt;/em&gt; haunt us long after we’ve fallen under their spell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica Treat&lt;/strong&gt; is author of two story collections: &lt;em&gt;A Robber in the House&lt;/em&gt; (Coffee House Press) and &lt;em&gt;Not a Chance&lt;/em&gt; (FC2). Her stories appear in anthologies and journals, including &lt;em&gt;Ms. Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Black Warrior Review&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;American Literary Review&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>First published in 1919, &lt;em&gt;Within a Budding Grove&lt;/em&gt; was awarded the Prix Goncourt, bringing the author immediate fame. In this second volume of &lt;em&gt;In Search of Lost Time&lt;/em&gt;, the narrator turns from the childhood reminiscences of &lt;em&gt;Swann’s Way&lt;/em&gt; to memories of his adolescence. Having gradually become indifferent to Swann’s daughter Gilberte, the narrator visits the seaside resort of Balbec with his grandmother and meets a new object of attention—Albertine, “a girl with brilliant, laughing eyes and plump, matt cheeks.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this authoritative English-language edition, D. J. Enright has revised the late Terence Kilmartin’s acclaimed reworking of C. K. Scott Moncrieff’s translation to take into account the new definitive French editions of &lt;em&gt;Á la recherché du temps perdu&lt;/em&gt; (the final volume of these new editions was published by the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade in 1989).</description>

  <description>A Depression era portrait of people living in an area near a sardine fishery in Monterey, CA known as Cannery Row. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the opening of the novel: "Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and flophouses. Its inhabitants are, as the man once said, 'whores, pimps, gamblers and sons of bitches,' by which he meant Everybody. Had the man looked through another peephole he might have said, 'Saints and angels and martyrs and holy men,' and he would have meant the same thing."</description>

  <description>After the grisly murder of his entire family, a toddler wanders into a graveyard where the ghosts and other supernatural residents agree to raise him as one of their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody Owens, known to his friends as Bod, is a normal boy. He would be completely normal if he didn't live in a sprawling graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor of the dead. There are dangers and adventures in the graveyard for a boy. But if Bod leaves the graveyard, then he will come under attack from the man Jack—who has already killed Bod's family . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beloved master storyteller Neil Gaiman returns with a luminous new novel for the audience that embraced his New York Times bestselling modern classic Coraline. Magical, terrifying, and filled with breathtaking adventures, The Graveyard Book is sure to enthrall readers of all ages.</description>

  <description>WHICH CAME FIRST?  The chicken or the egg?  Simple die-cuts magically present transformation-- from seed to flower, tadpole to frog, caterpillar to butterfly. The acclaimed author of  &lt;em&gt;Black? White! Day? Night! &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Lemons Are Not Red&lt;/em&gt; gives an entirely fresh and  memorable presentation to the concepts of transformation and creatiity.  Seed becomes flower, paint becomes picture, word becomes story--and the commonplace becomes extraordinary as children look through and turn the pages of this novel and winning book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;First the Egg&lt;/em&gt; is a 2008 Caldecott Honor Book and a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year.</description>

  <description>Emil Sinclair is a young boy who was raised in a bourgeois home described as a Scheinwelt - a German wordplay meaning 'world of light' as well as 'world of illusion'. Through the novel, accompanied and prompted by his mysterious classmate Max Demian, Emil descends from and revolts against the superficial ideals of this world, eventually awakening into a realization of self.&lt;br&gt;Though this is an earlier work, the style of Demian is pure Hesse. He quickly dramatizes moral and theological points, directly through the thoughts of the main character and his intense interaction with life teachers. Hesse's legacy is to economize by forming a drama which focuses entirely on direct, chthonic discovery that was shocking to early 20th century readers.</description>

  <description>Un matin, j'eus une curieuse révélation sur moi-même : Moktir, le seul des protégés de ma femme qui ne m'irritât point, était seul avec moi dans ma chambre.&lt;br&gt;Je me tenais debout auprès du feu, les deux coudes sur la cheminée, devant un livre, et je paraissais absorbé, mais pouvais voir se refléter dans la glace les mouvements de l'enfant à qui je tournais le dos. Une curiosité que je ne m'expliquais pas bien me faisait surveiller ses gestes. Moktir ne se savait pas observé et me croyait plongé dans la lecture. Je le vis s'approcher sans bruit d'une table où Marceline avait posé, près d'un ouvrage, une paire de petits ciseaux, s'en emparer furtivement, et d'un coup les engouffrer dans son burnous</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A masterful blend of artistic skill, scientific prowess, and impassioned theatrics lay at the core of Waterhouse Hawkins. A man of pure determination, he created the first life-size models of dinosaurs! This brilliant book is a fantastic nod to the genius of one man, and a glimpse into the beginning of an important era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a boy in England, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins always wanted to be an artist. His passion led him to animals, and soon he was drawing and painting them with fervor. This eventually led to his true calling -- creating models of dinosaurs as they actually must have looked when they roamed the earth! With the help of scientist Richard Owen, he checked the fossil remains of dinosaurs against living animals and constructed a gigantic model.  Among the first to witness his creation were Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who reacted with pure amazement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to impress England's leading scientists with his work, Waterhouse Hawkins staged a lavish New Year's Eve dinner party and hosted the gala inside the body of his model! He also wanted the public to learn about the dinosaurs and their history, so he built smaller models, illustrated books, and lectured on the subject. His fame spread to the United States, and he was invited to New York, where he began to create model dinosaurs for a proposed Paleozoic Museum in Central Park. However, a corrupt politician put an end to the project, and vandals later broke into Waterhouse Hawkins's workshop and destroyed his models. Though distraught, he moved on to Princeton, where he built skeletons and created paintings about life on earth in the age of the dinosaurs. Eventually, Waterhouse Hawkins returned to England and continued his work, some of which can still be seen in Crystal Palace Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writer Barbara Kerley and illustrator Brian Selznick have weaved a spirited account of this largely forgotten man. Plenty of textual detail, research, and a good dose of wonderment make Kerley's narrative a delightful experience. And the awesome illustrations, which combine Waterhouse Hawkins's own grandeur with Selznick's talent for the bold and the beautiful, made the pages come to life. The fusion of scientific allure and sensational images is a stroke of brilliance. This phenomenal book stands as true testament to the devotion and power of an individual -- it would have made Waterhouse Hawkins proud. &lt;em&gt;(Amy Barkat)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Why is the land so important to Cassie's family? It takes the events of one turbulent year—the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliates Cassie in public simply because she's black—to show Cassie that having a place of their own is the Logan family's lifeblood. It is the land that gives the Logans their courage and pride—no matter how others may degrade them, the Logans possess something no one can take away.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The House Behind the Cedars&lt;/strong&gt;, which many consider Charles Chesnutt’s ﬁnest novel, tells of John and Lena Walden, mulatto siblings who pass for white in the postbellum American South. The drama that unfolds as they travel between black and white worlds constitutes a riveting portrait of the shifting and intractable nature of race in American life. This edition revitalizes a much-neglected masterpiece by one of our most important African-American writers. As Werner Sollors writes, “William Dean Howells did not overstate his case when he compared Chesnutt’s works with those by Turgenev, Maupassant, and James . . . and [Chesnutt] has become one of the most important ‘crossover’ authors from the African-American tradition.”</description>

  <description>Lakshmi is a thirteen-year-old girl who lives with her family in a small hut on a mountain in Nepal. Though she is desperately poor, her life is full of simple pleasures, like playing hopscotch with her best friend from school, and having her mother brush her hair by the light of an oil lamp. But when the harsh Himalayan monsoons wash away all that remains of the family’s crops, Lakshmi’s stepfather says she must leave home and take a job to support her family. &lt;p&gt;He introduces her to a glamorous stranger who tells her she will find her a job as a maid in the city. Glad to be able to help, Lakshmi journeys to India and arrives at “Happiness House” full of hope. But she soon learns the unthinkable truth: she has been sold into prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old woman named Mumtaz rules the brothel with cruelty and cunning. She tells Lakshmi that she is trapped there until she can pay off her family’s debt—then cheats Lakshmi of her meager earnings so that she can never leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lakshmi’s life becomes a nightmare from which she cannot escape. Still, she lives by her mother’s words— Simply to endure is to triumph—and gradually, she forms friendships with the other girls that enable her to survive in this terrifying new world. Then the day comes when she must make a decision—will she risk everything for a chance to reclaim her life? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in spare and evocative vignettes, this powerful novel renders a world that is as unimaginable as it is real, and a girl who not only survives but triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Here are the real events that inspired Gary Paulsen to write Brian Robesons story in Hatchet, The river, Brians winter and Brians Return: a stint as a volunteer emergency worker; the death that became the pilots death in Hatchet; plane crashes hes seen; and his own near misses. He takes readers on his first hunting trips, showing the wonder and solace of nature along with his hilarious mishaps and mistakes. He shares special memories, such as the night he attracted every mosquito in the county, and how he met the moose who made it personal. Theres a handy chapter titled Eating Eyeballs and Guts or Starving: The Fine Art of Wilderness Nutrition recipes included.</description>

  <description>A &lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/em&gt; BEST SELLER&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“I was born at the beginning of it all, on the Red side—the Communist side—of the Iron Curtain.” Through annotated illustrations, journals, maps, and dreamscapes, Peter Sís shows what life was like for a child who loved to draw, proudly wore the red scarf of a Young Pioneer, stood guard at the giant statue of Stalin, and believed whatever he was told to believe. But adolescence brought questions. Cracks began to appear in the Iron Curtain, and news from the West slowly filtered into the country. Sís learned about beat poetry, rock ’n’ roll, blue jeans, and Coca-Cola. He let his hair grow long, secretly read banned books, and joined a rock band. Then came the Prague Spring of 1968, and for a teenager who wanted to see the world and meet the Beatles, this was a magical time. It was short-lived, however, brought to a sudden and brutal end by the Soviet-led invasion. But this brief flowering had provided a glimpse of new possibilities—creativity could be discouraged but not easily killed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;By joining memory and history, Sís takes us on his extraordinary journey: from infant with paintbrush in hand to young man borne aloft by the wings of his art.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall&lt;/em&gt; is a 2007 New York Times Book Review Best Illustrated Book of the Year, a 2008 Caldecott Honor Book, a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year, the winner of the 2008 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Nonfiction, and a nominee for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Publication for Kids.</description>

  <description>This incandescent book subscribes to the adage that "Good poems should rage like a fire, burning all things." Blue is black, profane, surly, damning - and unrelenting in its brilliance. Clarke writes: "I craved to draft lyrics that would pour out like Pentecostal fire - pell mell, scorching, bright, loud: a poetics of arson." Blue is divided into five parts that skillfully turn rage into a violet bruise of love and mourning. From the "Nasty Nofaskoshan Negro" of the Black section to the shocking satires of the red section, from the fierce tenderness of Gold Sapphics to the haunting lament of Blue Elegies, Clarke has written urgent and necessary poems - poems that burn and illuminate with their fury, truth, and beauty.</description>

  <description>Coraline lives with her preoccupied parents in part of a huge old  house--a house so huge that other people live in it, too... round, old former  actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and their aging Highland terriers ("We  trod the boards, luvvy") and the mustachioed old man under the roof ("'The  reason you cannot see the mouse circus,' said the man upstairs, 'is that the  mice are not yet ready and rehearsed.'") Coraline contents herself for weeks  with exploring the vast garden and grounds. But with a little rain she becomes  bored--so bored that she begins to count everything blue (153), the windows  (21), and the doors (14). And it is the 14th door that--sometimes blocked with a  wall of bricks--opens up for Coraline into an entirely alternate universe. Now,  if you're thinking fondly of &lt;em&gt;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&lt;/em&gt; or  &lt;em&gt;Alice's Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;, you're on the wrong track. Neil  Gaiman's &lt;em&gt;Coraline&lt;/em&gt; is far darker, far stranger, playing on our deepest  fears. And, like Roald Dahl's work, it is delicious. &lt;p&gt;  What's on the other side of the door? A distorted-mirror world, containing  presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her  name correctly (not "Caroline"), delicious meals (not like her father's  overblown "recipes"), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull  one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of  live rats. The creepiest part, however, is her mirrored parents, her "other  mother" and her "other father"--people who look just like her own parents, but  with big, shiny, black button eyes, paper-white skin... and a keen desire to  keep her on &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; side of the door. To make creepy creepier,  &lt;em&gt;Coraline&lt;/em&gt; has been illustrated masterfully in scritchy, terrifying ink  drawings by British mixed-media artist and Sandman cover illustrator Dave  McKean. This delightful, funny, haunting, scary as heck, fairy-tale novel is  about as fine as they come. Highly recommended. (Ages 11 and older) &lt;em&gt;--Karin  Snelson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

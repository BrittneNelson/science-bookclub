  <description>In his late thirties, Max Fischer is a successful cartoonist living in Los Angeles. Scarred by recent love affairs, he is cautious yet intrigued when he meets Lily Aaron and her nine-year-old son Lincoln. Lily, the manager of an offbeat restaurant, devotes her life to raising her son alone. As Max spends time with the Aarons, he falls irresistibly in love with them. The perfect mate, the perfect child - the perfect situation, since they seem to love him, too, with equal intensity. But as soon as Max moves in with the Aarons, he starts to uncover disturbing secrets about Lily. He can find no trace of her ex-husband. Worse, he discovers she has committed a crime so heinous that she has been running from the truth for years. It has been said that the heart does not know from logic. Should Max right Lily's wrong - sacrificing his adoptive family? Or should he look away from the truth? Either choice is devastating.</description>

  <description>A captivating and constantly surprising tale of life, death, and the realm between. Vincent Ettrich, an engaging philanderer, discovers that he has died and come back to life -- but he has no idea why, or any memory of the experience. Beset by peculiar omens and strange characters, including a talking rat and an inexplicable tattoo on the neck of his most recent lover, he gradually discovers that he was deliberately brought back by his one true love, Isabelle, because she is pregnant with their son--a child who, if correctly raised, will play a crucial role in saving the cosmic mosaic that is the universe. But to be brought up right, he must be educated by his own father. Specifically, he must be taught what Ettrich learned on the other side--if only Ettrich himself can remember it.</description>

  <description>Cullen James is a young woman whose life dictates her dreams-and whose dreams control her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her first dream, she found the perfect man-and the same thing promptly happened in life. Now, she has begun to dream dreams set in Rondua, a fantasy world of high adventure, full of tests of her courage and strength. Slowly and quietly, her dream world is spilling over into her New York City reality and beginning to threaten everything she loves in life. Her friends are gathered to help her-but even her newfound courage may not be enough.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>For connoisseurs of imaginative fiction, the novels of Jonathan Carroll are a special treat that occupy a space all their own. His surreal fictions, which deftly mix the everyday with the extraordinary, have won him a devoted following. Now, in &lt;em&gt;Glass Soup&lt;/em&gt;, Carroll continues to astound . . . .&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;The realm of the dead is built from the dreams--and nightmares--of the living. Octopuses drive buses. God is a polar bear. And a crowded highway literally leads to hell.&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;Once before, Vincent Ettrich and his lover, Isabelle Neukor, crossed over from life to death and back again. Now Isabelle bears a very special child, who may someday restore the ever-changing mosaic that is reality. Unless the agents of Chaos can lure her back to the land of the dead--and trap her there forever.&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glass Soup&lt;/em&gt; is another exquisite and singular creation from the author &lt;em&gt;January&lt;/em&gt; magazine described as "incapable of writing a bad book much less an uninteresting one."</description>

  <description>Miranda Romanac is a successful thirtysomething woman in today's modern world, yet she feels alone and adrift on the sea of her life. At her high school reunion she makes a shattering discovery that further undermines her already shaky sense of who she is and where she is going. When she meets the remarkable Hugh Oakley, her life takes a 180-degree turn for the better--but at what price?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When they move to a house in the country to start a new life together, the reality Miranda had once known begins to slip away. Miranda is haunted by alarming, impossible visions and strangers whom she feels certain she has known, although they are all from other times and places. As these phantom lives consume her own and begin to affect all that she knows and loves, Miranda must learn the truth to reclaim it. But sometimes the hardest truth to accept is the knowledge of who we really are.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Robert Coover's many acclaimed works of fiction have established him as a powerhouse among America's postmodernist writers. With Briar Rose, he casts his own unmistakable style on an ageless tale. A brilliant recreation of the timeless Sleeping Beauty story, Briar Rose tells of a prince trapped in the briars; a sleeping beauty who cannot awaken, dreaming of a succession of kissing princes; and the old spell-casting fairy who inhabits the princess's dreams, regaling her with legends of other sleeping beauties and trying to imagine the nature of human desire.</description>

  <description>Â  &lt;br&gt; With its vibrant new translation, perceptive introduction, and witty packaging, this new edition of Voltaireâs masterpiece belongs in the hands of every reader pondering our assumptions about human behavior and our place in the world. Candide tells of the hilarious adventures of the naÃ¯ve Candide, who doggedly believes that ï¿½all is for the bestâ even when faced with injustice, suffering, and despair. Controversial and entertaining, Candide is a book that is vitally relevant today in our world pervaded byâas Candide would sayâï¿½the mania for insisting that all is well when all is by no means well.â&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition with French flaps and rough front Completely new translation and introduction Amazing cover art from one of the most beloved modern comic artists &lt;br&gt; Â </description>

  <description>On her twelfth birthday, Sierva Maria, the only child of a decaying noble family in an eighteenth-century South American seaport, is bitten by a rabid dog. Believed to be possessed, she is brought to a convent for observation. And into her cell stumbles Father Cayetano Delaura, who has already dreamed about a girl with hair trailing after her like a bridal train. As he tends to her with holy water and sacramental oils, Delaura feels something shocking begin to occur. He has fallen in love, and it is not long until Sierva Maria joins him in his fevered misery. Unsettling and indelible, Of Love and Other Demons is an evocative, majestic tale of the most universal experiences known to woman and man.</description>

  <description>A brilliant satire of mass culture and the numbing effects of technology, &lt;strong&gt;White Noise&lt;/strong&gt; tells the story of Jack Gladney, a teacher of Hitler studies at a liberal arts college in Middle America. Jack and his fourth wife, Babette, bound by their love, fear of death, and four ultramodern offspring, navigate the rocky passages of family life to the background babble of brand-name consumerism. Then a lethal black chemical cloud, unleashed by an industrial accident, floats over there lives, an "airborne toxic event" that is a more urgent and visible version of the white noise engulfing the Gladneysâthe radio transmissions, sirens, microwaves, and TV murmurings that constitute the music of American magic and dread.</description>

  <description>In late 1999, in the midst of a brutal hurricane on the Baltic coast, a concrete prison barge rips free of its moorings. Of thousands of Europe's most dangerous criminals, only the twelve depraved souls in cell block 306 survive. One of the twelve is their Savior. As word spreads of the Second Coming, some think the "Messiah" is a fraud, some think he is deluded, and many, with a deep need to believe, do so. The new messiah must meet the press, the lawyers, the cops, and the swindlers, all of them vying for a piece of the action en route to the only place a modern Second Coming would occur--a theme park ruled by a rodent--as the celestial clock ticks down to '00. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rife on the surface with Bukiet's trademark black humor and rage toward a malevolent God, &lt;em&gt;Signs and Wonders&lt;/em&gt; seethes with incisive and courageous commentary on history, religious faith, and mankind at the end of this century.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;From the bestselling author of&lt;em&gt; Running with Scissors&lt;/em&gt; comes &lt;em&gt;Dry&lt;/em&gt; the hilarious, moving, and no less bizarre account of what happened next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs. You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls, and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten landed in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey, Jr., are immediately dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, something actually starts to click, and that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken Manhattan life and live it sober. What follows is a memoir that's as moving as it is funny, as heartbreaking as it is real. &lt;em&gt;Dry&lt;/em&gt; is the story of love, loss, and Starbucks as a higher power. &lt;br&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/em&gt; is the true story of a boy whose mother (a poet with delusions of Anne Sexton) gave him away to be raised by her psychiatrist, a dead-ringer for Santa and a lunatic in the bargain. Suddenly, at age twelve, Augusten Burroughs found himself living in a dilapidated Victorian in perfect squalor. The doctorâs bizarre family, a few patients, and a pedophile living in the backyard shed completed the tableau. Here, there were no rules, there was no school. The Christmas tree stayed up until summer, and Valium was eaten like Pez. And when things got dull, there was always the vintage electroshock therapy machine under the stairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running with Scissors&lt;/em&gt; is at turns foul and harrowing, compelling and maniacally funny. But above all, it chronicles an ordinary boyâs survival under the most extraordinary circumstances.</description>

  <description>To decipher the late 1960s through the story of Swede Levov, whose life is cast into the fires of those years, Roth calls again upon the saturnine side of his disposition. It answers to the purpose as never before. Good-looking, prosperous Swede, who has inherited his fatherâs glove factory in Newark, N.J., and married a former beauty queen, is not stupid, merely fulfilled. Is it this that gives him insufficient means to comprehend the Newark riots of 1967 or the transformation of his beloved daughter into a venomous teenage radical, a child capable of cold-blooded terrorism? Rothâs own means are more than sufficient. A writer who is unafraid to linger in the minds of furious men, he leads us fearlessly through this manâs grief, bewilderment and rage.</description>

  <description>Cartoons that draw their creator into another world; demonic paintings that exert a sinister influence on our own. Fairy tales that express the secret losses and anxieties of their tellers. These are the elements that Steven Millhauser employs to such marvelousâand often disquietingâeffect in Little Kingdoms, a collection whose three novellas suggest magical companion pieces to his acclaimed longer fictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "The Little Kingdom of J. Franklin Payne," a gentle eccentric constructs an elaborate alternate universe that is all the more appealing for being transparently unreal. "The Princess, the Dwarf, and the Dungeon" is at once a gothic tale of nightmarish jealousy and a meditation on the human need for exaltation and horror. And "Catalogue of the Exhibition" introduces us to the oeuvre of Edmund Moorash, a Romantic painter who might have been imagined by Nabokov or Poe. Exuberantly inventive, as mysterious as dreams, these novellas will delight, mesmerize, and transport anyone who reads them.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Lottery&lt;/em&gt;, one of the most terrifying stories written in this century, created a sensation when it was first published in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;. "Power and haunting," and "nights of unrest" were typical reader responses. This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites "The Lottery:" with twenty-four equally unusual stories. Together they demonstrate Jack son's remarkable range--from the hilarious to the truly horrible--and power as a storyteller.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In the frozen wilderness of northern Manitoba, fourteen-year-old Noah Krainik lives with his mother and cousin. With his quirky, cheerful best friend, Pelly Bay, he explores this exotic, lonely land&lt;strong&gt;â&lt;/strong&gt;the domain of Cree Indians, trappers, missionaries, and fugitives from the modern world. When tragedy strikes, Noah must go on alone, discovering a new life in the south and the bustling of Toronto. It is there in the Northern Lights movie theatre&lt;strong&gt;â&lt;/strong&gt;with a Cree family taking up residence in the projection booth, and the reappearance of his elusive father&lt;strong&gt;â&lt;/strong&gt;that Noah becomes an adult. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>So Rhoda Brook, the abandoned mistress of Farmer Lodge, is jealous to discover details of his new bride in 'The Withered Arm', the title story in this selection of Hardy's finest short stories. Hardy's first story, 'Destiny and a Blue Cloak' was written fresh from the success of &lt;strong&gt;Far From the Madding Crowd&lt;/strong&gt;. Beautiful in their own right, these stories are also testing-grounds for the novels in their controversial sexual politics, their refusal of romance structures, and their elegiac pursuit of past, lost loves. Several of the stories in &lt;strong&gt;The Withered Arm&lt;/strong&gt; were collected to form the famous volume, &lt;strong&gt;Wessex Tales&lt;/strong&gt; (1888), the first time Hardy denoted 'Wessex' to describe his fictional world. &lt;strong&gt;The Withered Arm&lt;/strong&gt; is the first of a new two-volume selection of Hardy's short stories, edited with an introduction and notes by Kristin Brady.</description>

  <description>A rape and a wrongful condemnation--a novel based on a true story. In Arkansas, 1914, a 13-year-old girl is raped in the backwoods of the Ozarks. On her testimony, a young mountaineer is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. With his celebrated storyteller's art, Donald Harington has created a work rich in drama, passion, and texture, unforgettably bringing to life his characters, place, and era.</description>

  <description>This is an ambitious attempt to separate what is actually known (and can be known) about Mozart from the many myths and legends that have grown up about his life and character, notably the circumstances of his death and his alleged immaturity, drinking, extravagance, womanizing, unreliability, and professional failure.</description>

  <description>In her extraordinary bestseller, Adrian Nicole LeBlanc immerses readers in the intricacies of the ghetto, revealing the true sagas lurking behind the headlines of gangsta glamour, gold-drenched drug dealers, and street-corner society. Focusing on two romances&amp;amp;#8212;Jessica&amp;amp;#8217;s dizzying infatuation with a hugely successful young heroin dealer, Boy George, and Coco&amp;amp;#8217;s first love with Jessica's little brother, Cesar&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Random Family&lt;/em&gt; is the story of young people trying to outrun their destinies. Jessica and Boy George ride the wild adventure between riches and ruin, while Coco and Cesar stick closer to the street, all four caught in a precarious dance between survival and death. Friends get murdered; the DEA and FBI investigate Boy George; Cesar becomes a fugitive; Jessica and Coco endure homelessness, betrayal, the heartbreaking separation of prison, and, throughout it all, the insidious damage of poverty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charting the tumultuous cycle of the generations&amp;amp;#8212;as girls become mothers, boys become criminals, and hope struggles against deprivation&amp;amp;#8212;LeBlanc slips behind the cold statistics and sensationalism and comes back with a riveting, haunting, and true story.</description>

  <description>Mr. Kapasi, the protagonist of Jhumpa Lahiri's title story, would  certainly have his work cut out for him if he were forced to interpret the maladies of all the characters in this eloquent debut collection. Take, for example, Shoba and Shukumar, the young couple in "A Temporary Matter" whose marriage is crumbling in the wake of a stillborn child. Or Miranda in "Sexy," who is involved in a hopeless affair with a married man. But Mr. Kapasi has problems enough of his own; in addition to his regular job working as an interpreter for a doctor who does not speak his patients' language, he also drives tourists to local sites of interest. His fare on this particular day is Mr. and Mrs. Das--first-generation Americans of Indian descent--and their children. During the course of the afternoon, Mr. Kapasi becomes enamored of Mrs. Das and then becomes her unwilling confidant when she reads too much into his profession. "I told you because of your talents," she informs him after divulging a startling secret.  &lt;blockquote&gt; I'm tired of feeling so terrible all the time. Eight years, Mr. Kapasi, I've been in pain eight years. I was hoping you could help me feel better; say the right thing. Suggest some kind of remedy. &lt;/blockquote&gt; Of course, Mr. Kapasi has no cure for what ails Mrs. Das--or himself. Lahiri's subtle, bittersweet ending is characteristic of the collection as a whole. Some of these nine tales are set in India, others in the United States, and most concern characters of Indian heritage. Yet the situations Lahiri's people face, from unhappy marriages to civil war, transcend ethnicity. As the narrator of the last story, "The Third and Final Continent," comments: "There are times I am bewildered by each mile I have traveled, each meal I have eaten, each person I have known, each room in which I have slept."  In that single line Jhumpa Lahiri sums up a universal experience, one that applies to all who have grown up, left home, fallen in or out of love, and, above all, experienced what it means to be a foreigner, even within one's own family.</description>

  <description>At the start of this fiendishly comic and suspenseful novel, a mild-mannered English academic chuckles as he watches his wife commit adultery. The action takes place before she met him. But lines between film and reality, past and present become terrifyingly blurred in this sad and funny tour de force from the author of &lt;strong&gt;Flaubert's Parrot&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

  <description>The epitome of the chivalric novel, Ivanhoe sweeps readers into Medieval England and the lives of a memorable cast of characters. Ivanhoe, a trusted ally of Richard-the-Lion-Hearted, returns from the Crusades to reclaim the inheritance his father denied him. Rebecca, a vibrant, beautiful Jewish woman is defended by Ivanhoe against a charge of witchcraft -- but it is Lady Rowena who is Ivanhoe's true love. The wicked Prince John plots to usurp England's throne, but two of the most popular heroes in all of English literature, Richard-the-Lion-Hearted and the well-loved famous outlaw, Robin Hood, team up to defeat the Normans and reagain the castle. The success of this novel lies with Scott's skillful blend of historic reality, chivalric romance, and high adventure.</description>

  <description>Guinevere is widely acknowledged as the most extraordinary woman in legend. From golden child to Queen of Camelot to passionate adulterer, her life is a vivid an fascinating saga. In this spellbinding climax to the tale of Guinevere--which began with &lt;em&gt;Guinevere&lt;/em&gt; and continued in &lt;em&gt;The Chessboard Queen&lt;/em&gt;--Sharan Newman, author of the highly acclaimed Catherine LeVendeur medieval mystery series, blends magic and history to create and unforgettable tale of passion and tragedy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here we see the discover of Guinevere's affair with Lancelot and her subsequent fall from grace; the near-futile quest for the Holy rail; and the triumph of Galahad in a final battle with the villainous Mordred. Guinevere Evermore is a heartrending portrayal of a failed romance, a fallen woman, and the end of an era. Sharan Newman's reinterpretation of the Arthurian saga is as ambitious and persuasive as &lt;em&gt;The Mists of Avalon &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Hills&lt;/em&gt;--just as memorable.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;Guinevere&lt;/em&gt;, Sharan Newman told us the story of that lovely and legendary woman's childhood up until her wedding night. Guinevere is now the beautiful young wife and queen of King Arthur, a position much-coveted by all women of Camelot. But nothing in life is ever certain, and soon Guinevere discovers--most alarmingly--her deep and passionate love for another man: Lancelot, the most beloved Knight of the Round Table in all of Camelot. Here Sharan Newman brings the legend of Lancelot and Guinevere to life with the same blend of magic and history that has made her Catherine LeVendeur medieval mystery series such a success. As ambitious and striking as &lt;em&gt;The Mists of Avalon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hollow Hills&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Chessboard Queen &lt;/em&gt;is a beautiful rendering of the world's most timeless romance, a tale of earthly passion and spiritual love like no other before or since.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Shaman New man tells the story of the golden child whose dearest friend is a saint who hears spirits singing; of the gentle-hearted woman who begins to dream of love, glory, and the fierce, proud king who will become her husband; of the passionate beauty whose name will be remembered and hated for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharan Newman portrays Guinevere with all the charm, skill, and erudition that have won her the hearts of readers and the admiration of critics for her Catherine LeVendeur medieval mystery series.

  <description>According to his obituary, Wesley Sultan died at the age of 63, leaving behind three children, a wife, an ex-wife, a brother, a sister, and a life-long business career. According to his obituary, Wesley Sultan led a quiet, respectable, and unremarkable life. Our narrator, however, is about to discover that nothing could be further from the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using Sultanâs obituary as a road map to the unknown terrain of the man himself, our narrator discovers dead-ends, wrong turns, and unexpected destinations in every line. As he travels from the bleak Michigan winter to the steamy streets of Miami to the idyllic French countryside, in search of those who knew Wesley best, he gradually reconstructs the life of an exceptionally handsome, ambitious, and deceptive man to whom women were everything. And as the margins of the obituary fill with handwritten corrections, as details emerge and facts are revised, our mysterious narratorâwhose interest in his quarry is far from randomâhas no choice but to confront the truth of his own life as well.</description>

  <description>From an author named by The New Yorker as one of the "20 Best American Fiction Writers Under 40," a hilarious, inventive, unforgettable collection of stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His remarkable first collection of stories was hailed by The New York Times as "the debut of an exciting new voice in fiction." Garrison Keillor called him wildly funny, pure, generous--all that a great humorist should be." With this new collection, George Saunders takes us even further into the shocking, uproarious and oddly familiar landscape of his imagination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stories in Pastoralia are set in a slightly skewed version of America, where elements of contemporary life have been merged, twisted, and amplified, casting their absurdity-and our humanity-in a startling new light. Whether he writes a gothic morality tale in which a male exotic dancer is haunted by his maiden aunt from beyond the grave, or about a self-help guru who tells his followers his mission is to discover who's been "crapping in your oatmeal," Saunders's stories are both indelibly strange and vividly real. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;George Saunders has been identified as a writer in the tradition of Mark Twain, Thomas Pynchon, and Kurt Vonnegut--"a savage satirist with a sentimental streak," said The New York Times. In this new collection, Saunders brings greater wisdom and maturity to the worldview he established with CivilWarLand in Bad Decline, leaving no doubt about his place as the brilliant successor to these writers.</description>

  <description>From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Tenth of December&lt;/em&gt;, a 2013 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Notable Book&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "This book is a rare event: a brilliant new satirist bursting out of the gate in full stride, wildly funny, pure, generousâall that a great humorist should be."âGarrison Keillor "An astoundingly tuned voiceâgraceful, dark, authentic, and funnyâtelling just the kinds of stories we need to get us through these times."âThomas Pynchon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Scary, hilarious, and unforgettable . . . George Saunders is a writer of arresting brilliance and originality."âTobias Wolff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A cool satirist and a wicked stylist. The quirkiest and most accomplished short-story debut since Barry Hannah's &lt;em&gt;Airships&lt;/em&gt;."âJay McInerney, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Ingenious . . . full of savage humor and originality [and] scorching brilliance . . . the author creates a nightmarish post-apocalyptic world that might have been envisioned by Walt Disney on acid."&lt;strong&gt;â&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The debut of an exciting new voice in fiction. Mr. Saunders writes like the illegitimate offspring of [Nathaniel] West and Kurt Vonnegut, perhaps a distant relative of Mark Leyner and Steven Wright. He's a savage satirist with a sentimental streak who delineates, in these pages, the dark underbelly of the American dream: the losses, delusions, and terrors suffered by the lonely, the disenfranchised, the downtrodden and the plain unlucky. . . . Bizarre events pop up regularly in &lt;em&gt;CivilWarLand&lt;/em&gt; like road signs on a highway, directing the reader toward the dark heart of Mr. Saunders's America. What powers the stories along is Mr. Saunders's wonderfully demented language, his ear for absurdity and slang, his own patented blend of psychobabble, techno-talk and existential angst. Mr. Saunders's satiric vision of America is dark and demented; it is also ferocious and very funny."â&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Â </description>

  <description>This stunning first novel, set in colonial Rhodesia during the 1960s, centers on the coming of age of a teenage girl, Tambu, and her relationship with her British-educated cousin Nyasha. Tambu, who yearns to be free of the constraints of her rural village, especially the circumscribed lives of the women, thinks her dreams have come true when her wealthy uncle offers to sponsor her education. But she soon learns that the education she receives at his mission school comes with a price. At the school she meets the worldly and rebellious Nyasha, who is chafing under her father's authority. Raised in England, Nyasha is so much a stranger among her own people that she can no longer speak her native language. Tambu can only watch as her cousin, caught between two cultures, pays the full cost of alienation.</description>

  <description>It was a dark and stormy night; Meg Murry, her small brother Charles Wallace, and her mother had come down to the kitchen for a midnight snack when they were upset by the arrival of a most disturbing stranger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Wild nights are my glory," the unearthly stranger told them. "I just got caught in a downdraft and blown off course. Let me sit down for a moment, and then I'll be on my way. Speaking of way, by the way, there is a such thing as a tesseract."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A tesseract (in case the reader doesn't know) is a wrinkle in time. To tell more would rob the reader of the enjoyment of Miss L'Engle's unusual book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alternate Cover Edition for ISBN #0440998050&lt;/em&gt;</description>

To tell more would rob the reader of the enjoyment of Miss L'Engle's unusual book. &lt;em&gt;A Wrinkle in Time&lt;/em&gt;, winner of the Newbery Medal in 1963, is the story of the adventures in space and time of Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin O'Keefe (athlete, student, and one of the most popular boys in high school). They are in search of Meg's father, a scientist who disappeared while engaged in secret work for the government on the tesseract problem.&lt;br&gt;

  <description>The story of the last member of the aristocratic Azcoitia family, a monstrous mutation protected from the knowledge of his deformity by being surrounded with other freaks as his companions, The Obscene Bird of Night is a triumph of imaginative, visionary writing. Among its luxuriance, fecundity, horror, and energy will not soon fade from the reader's mind.</description>

  <description>The novel opens with Barbara, who, after remembering incidents of torture at the hands of her father, has quite literally broken down. Found inside a disabled elevator, she is no longer able to function with her new consciousness of these memoriesâthose which are so resistant to understanding. Confronted with this knowledge of evil, she must begin the painful process of remembering and reconstructing a new whole self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helping Barbara to navigate her grief and her memories are her therapist, the Psalms, and most of all, the words of Paul Celan. Paul Celan: 1920-1970, Poet. An eastern European holocaust survivor who wrote haunting poems about the darker spiritual trials of life and relationships that exhibit a compact style that fuses broken words and chopped syntax to produce a stark musicality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a novel about a woman who goes to hell and back. Itâs a story which affirms the resilience of the human spirit and the healing power of love and faith.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>A literary sensation and runaway bestseller, this brilliant debut novel presents with seamless authenticity and exquisite lyricism the true confessions of one of Japan's most celebrated geisha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Memoirs of a Geisha&lt;/em&gt;, we enter a world where appearances are paramount; where a girl's virginity is auctioned to the highest bidder; where women are trained to beguile the most powerful men; and where love is scorned as illusion. It is a unique and triumphant work of fiction - at once romantic, erotic, suspenseful - and completely unforgettable.</description>

  <description>Since its first appearance in 1962, M. L. Rosenthal's classic selection of Yeats's poems and plays has attracted hundreds of thousands of readers. This newly revised edition includes 211 poems and 4 plays. It adds &lt;em&gt;The Words Upon the Window-Pane,&lt;/em&gt; one of Yeats's most startling dramatic works in its realistic use of a seance as the setting for an eerily powerful reenactment of Jonathan Swift's rigorous idealism, baffling love relationships, and tragic madness. The collection profits from recent scholarship that has helped to establish Yeats's most reliable texts, in the order set by the poet himself. And his powerful lyrical sequences are amply represented, culminating in the selection from &lt;em&gt;Last Poems and Two Plays,&lt;/em&gt; which reaches its climax in the brilliant poetic plays &lt;em&gt;The Death of Cuchulain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Purgatory.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt; Scholars, students, and all who delight in Yeats's varied music and sheer quality will rejoice in this expanded edition. As the introduction observes, "Early and late he has the simple, indispensable gift of enchanting the ear....He was also the poet who, while very much of his own day in Ireland, spoke best to the people of all countries. And though he plunged deep into arcane studies, his themes are most clearly the general ones of life and death, love and hate, man's condition, and history's meanings. He began as a sometimes effete post-Romantic, heir to the pre-Raphaelites, and then, quite naturally, became a leading British Symbolist; but he grew at last into the boldest, most vigorous voice of this century." &lt;em&gt;Selected Poems and Four Plays&lt;/em&gt; represents the essential achievement of the greatest twentieth-century poet to write in English.</description>

  <description>Kingsley Amis has written a marvelously funny novel describing the attempts of England's postwar generation to break from that country's traditional class structure. When it appeared in England, &lt;em&gt;Lucky Jim&lt;/em&gt; provoked a heated controversy in which everyone took sides.  Even W. Somerset Maugham reviewed the book, happily with great favor:  "Mr. Kingsley Amis is so talented, his observations so keen, that you cannot fail to be convinced that the young men he so brilliantly describes truly represent the classes with which his novel is concerned."</description>

  <description>In this extraordinary collection of short stories, Duncan McLean shows us real life â and real death â in all its many guises. Equally adept at black farce, brutal rants, or tender epiphanies, McLean plunges us headlong into the lives of his characters: partying, and all it entails, with soccer enthusiasts; shivering inside the butcher's man-sized fridge; stumbling bloody-footed along the cliff-top path at midnight, lost in a liver'n'onions-fueled fantasy of sex and violence. The men and women in these stories are mostly unemployed or in dead-end jobs, often on the edge of madness or destruction; but just as often they are on the brink of simply leaving: walking away from relationships, responsibilities, and the reassurance of alcohol and aggression. Told with enormous skill, fierce humor, and a dark emotional drive, these stories are as various as the characters themselves. Their commonality derives from a merciless realism, and an almost fanatical adherence to the rhythms and cadences of spoken language. "McLean wants to capture the unremarkable, but it is his remarkable stories which transport. Expressed here at last is a psychic disorder, so contemporary, so unsafe; here is swaggering, sneering, frustrated, self-scepticism on the pavement." â &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; (London)Â  Winner of the Somerset Maugham Award</description>

  <description>Edward Miller is a reactionary, alpha male, tabloid newspaper editor. He wears his temper like a badge of honor, would rather step over a homeless beggar than walk around him, and engages in petty warfare with his staff over expense receipts. He's also never been much bothered with monogamy, but when one morning he spontaneously seduces his temp in an office storeroom, he's definitely crossed a line in blatancy. Miller has made few friends and many enemiesânot to mention the fact that the storeroom is a notorious trysting place and he and the temp both emerge covered in dust and airmail stickersâso the news doesnât take long to reach his cold, beautiful wife. Conveniently, it just happens to be their anniversary. Imagine the celebratory dinner, capped by her returning her house keys and consummating her desire to sleep with the neighbor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not a man to suffer rejection well, Miller heads for a London media hangout, where two employees introduce him to cocaine. By morning, his exploits are public (a photographer captured him snorting the cocaine in public), his career is over (thanks to a damning interview he gave a journalist from a rival paper), he's not only painted the word 'WANKER' on the cuckolding neighbor's car, but misspelled it, and his house is on fire (never leave a goodbye bonfire of wedding photos unattended). . . . Clearly, itâs time to leave town. Miller has an engagement to speak to the boys at his old prep school, but he can't seem to stop pouring gasoline on the fire that his life has become, showing up hungover after a night partying with an old school friend and a gaggle of Spanish flight attendants, and calling the headmaster by his behind-the-back nickname of "Stiffo" to the students, for a start. After the speech, he speaks with his doctor and learns that his father-in-law plans to kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leigh, the old school friend, works for an English language school in Barcelona, and Miller wrangles its address out of him, for he clearly can't go home. He gets the job and adapts surprisingly well to a life of an underpaid teacher, despite the fact that some of his students will clearly never learn the language (there are hilarious scenes of their attempts in this section) and even starts up a romance with a tough-talking English girl who's one of his fellow teachersâbut he doesn't tell her who he really is when he has the opportunity, and when she figures it out on her own she is livid and that bridge is burnt. To make matters worse, his father-in-law's goons have tracked him down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miller flees again, winding up in Florida, in a town populated by ex-circus freaks and presided over by the Half Man, a criminal and sadist with no legs who welcomes Miller to town by shoving a gun barrel in his mouth and breaking his teeth. But ironically, it seems that despite the fleas in his trailer, the one-eyed albino hit man who seems to overhear every compromising conversation between Miller and the Half Manâs beautiful wife the Lizard Woman, and the fact that the Half Manâs stranglehold on the local police mean that Miller isnât actually free to leave, it seems that Miller somehow belongs among the freaks. These misfitsâamong them a black dwarf, a gay clown with a penchant for altar boys, a heroin addict who is their unlicensed doctor, a biker hit man named Hollis after Groveâs erstwhile publicist, and the Lizard Womanâs wonderful eight-year-old daughterâunwittingly teach Miller what normal life never couldâhow to love, and how to stand up for something he truly believes in. When Miller's wife tracks him down and has him sign over the spoils of his old life to her, he gets enough money out of her to hire the albino to hit the Half Man. And though all certainly does not go smoothly with the hitâsomeone as vicious as the Half Man is unlikely to go quietlyâMiller and the Lizard Woman are able to close that chapter and start a new life together.</description>

  <description>Life is an unclassified masterpiece, a sprawling compendium as encyclopedic as Dante's Commedia and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and, in its break with tradition, as inspiring as Joyce's Ulysses.  Perec's spellbinding puzzle begins in an apartment block in the XVIIth arrondissement of Paris where, chapter by chapter, room by room, like an onion being peeled, and extraordinary rich cast of characters is revealed in a series of tales that are bizarre, unlikely, moving, funny, or (sometimes) quite ordinary. From the confessions of a racing cyclist to the plans of an avenging murderer, from a young ethnographer obsessed with a Sumatran tribe to the death of a trapeze artist, from the fears of an ex-croupier to the dreams of a sex-change pop star to an eccentric English millionaire who has devised the ultimate pastime, Life is a manual of human irony, portraying the mixed marriages of fortunes, passions and despairs, betrayals and bereavements, of hundreds of lives in Paris and around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the novel in more than an extraordinary range of fictions; it is a closely observed account of life and experience. The apartment block's one hundred rooms are arranged in a magic square, and the book as a whole is peppered with a staggering range of literary puzzles and allusions, acrostics, problems of chess and logic, crosswords, and mathematical formulae. All are there for the reader to solve in the best tradition of the detective novel.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From dust jacket:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Roy Strang's real life makes his worst nightmares look like vacations.  In a hospital room in Edinburgh Roy Strang lies in a coma--which doesn't save him from reliving the sordid developments that brought him to this state.  He seems at times to be engaged in a strange quest in a surrealist Africa to eradicate the evil predator-scavenger bird the marabou stork before it drives away the peace-loving flamingos from Lake Torto.&lt;br&gt;    But Roy's hallucinatory adventures keep being interrupted by troubling memories of his bizarre family, the housing project in which he grew up, a disastrous emigration to South Africa, and his youthful life of casual brutality as a club-hopping soccer thug.  Meanwhile his parents and his nurse bombard his inert form with inane conversation, even more inane pop music, and intimate massage...&lt;br&gt;    As these worlds collide, &lt;em&gt;Marabou Stork Nightmares&lt;/em&gt; mutates into the sort of combination of violence, pathos, and outrageous hilarity that only Irvine Welsh can pull off.</description>

  <description>No book in modern times has matched the uproar sparked by Salman Rushdie's &lt;em&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/em&gt;, which earned its author a death sentence. Furor aside, it is a marvelously erudite study of good and evil, a feast of language served up by a writer at the height of his powers, and a rollicking comic fable. The book begins with two Indians, Gibreel Farishta ("for fifteen years the biggest star in the history of the Indian movies") and Saladin Chamcha, a Bombay expatriate returning from his first visit to his homeland in 15 years, plummeting from the sky after the explosion of their jetliner, and proceeds through a series of metamorphoses, dreams and revelations. Rushdie's powers of invention are astonishing in this Whitbread Prize winner.</description>

  <description>This work of art reflects life in Ireland at the turn of the last century, and by rejecting euphemism, reveals to the Irish their unromantic reality. Each of the 15 stories offers glimpses into the lives of ordinary Dubliners, and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation.</description>

  <description>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man represents the transitional stage between the realism of Joyce's Dubliners and the symbolism of Ulysses, and is essential to the understanding of the later work.&lt;br&gt;The novel is a highly autobiographical account of the adolescence and youth of Stephen Dedalus, who reappears in Ulysses, and who comes to realize that before he can become a true artist, he must rid himself of the stultifying effects of the religion, politics and essential bigotry of his background in late 19th century Ireland.&lt;br&gt;Written with a light touch, this is perhaps the most accessible of Joyce's works.</description>

She loves her dog. And she has been married to Jacob for far too long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob has not been seen for a few days. That's because Lizzie snapped last Monday and killed him.

When she finds unexpected kinship with an isolated misfit, she will be tested: Will Lizzie confess or will her new friend be an unwitting accessory to her crime?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny and disturbing, SEASON TO TASTE is a novel about the definitive end of a marriage, and its very strange aftermath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Four interlocking narratives set in four American cities form a richly comic feast about love, academia, an elusive Tibetan novelist â and SOFA, a protest group so mysterious its very initials are open to interpretation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Teeth&lt;/em&gt; follows a cast of young literary men and women, each in a period of formation, in four very American cities â Brooklyn, Bloomington, Berkeley, and Bakersfield. A Pynchonesque treat, itâs four (or more) books in one: a bohemian satire, a campus comedy, a stonerâs reverie, and a quadruple love story. The plots coalesce around the search for a mysterious author, Jigme Drolma (âthe Tibetan David Foster Wallaceâ), who might in fact be a plagiarist. But how does the self-styled arch-magician Nicholas Bendix figure into this? What will happen when SOFA unleashes the âApocalypseâ? And whatâs to become of Lump, the cat?</description>

  <description>"This epic tale spanning past and present will have you on the edge of your seat.  Set in a world of Voodoo, spirits, and the historic locale of New Orleans, Villere House is deliciously spooky and romantic." ~ Tracey Garvis Graves, author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller, On The Island and Covet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;College senior, Lottie Boyd, expects to drink too much while on spring break in New Orleans. What she doesn't expect is to be haunted. Or fall in love. But that's exactly what happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It starts with strange, vivid dreams about a 19th century widow so desperate to save her sick little girl, she's willing to do anything--even if it involves the black magic of Voodoo. It doesn't end there. Voices, ghost sightings, familiarity with things and places she couldn't possibly know. All leading her to the Villere House of Voodoo and the young Creole owner, Xavier Villere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xavier is compelled to help and is drawn to Lottie in a way he's never known, but skepticism of his family's century-old link to Voodoo and the occult keep her at arms length. If he can only come to terms with his heritage, he might be able to help solve the mystery of the widow plaguing Lottie's dreams. And maybe even find love in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Villere House is an adult romance and not suitable for readers under 18.</description>

  <description>The back must slave to feed the belly. . . . In this urgent and unique book, chef Michael Gibney uses twenty-four hours to animate the intricate camaraderie and culinary choreography in an upscale New York restaurant kitchen. Here readers will find all the details, in rapid-fire succession, of what it takes to deliver an exceptional plate of foodâthe journey to excellence by way of exhaustion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in second-person narrative, Sous Chef is an immersive, adrenaline-fueled run that offers a fly-on-the-wall perspective on the food service industry, allowing readers to briefly inhabit the hidden world behind the kitchen doors, in real time. This exhilarating account provides regular diners and food enthusiasts alike a detailed insiderâs perspective, while offering fledgling professional cooks an honest picture of what the future holds, ultimately giving voice to the hard work and dedication around which chefs have built their careers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a kitchen where the highest standards are upheld and one misstep can result in disaster, Sous Chef conjures a greater appreciation for the thought, care, and focus that go into creating memorable and delicious fare. With grit, wit, and remarkable prose, Michael Gibney renders a beautiful and raw account of this demanding and sometimes overlooked profession, offering a nuanced perspective on the craft and art of food and service.</description>

  <description>Michael Chabon once said, âI scan the tables of contents of magazines, looking for Antonya Nelson's name, hoping that she has decided to bless us again.â And now she has blessed us again, with a bounty of the stories for which she is so beloved. Her stories are clear-eyed, hard-edged, beautifully formed. In the title story, âFunny Once,â a couple held together by bad behavior fall into a lie with their more responsible friends. In âThe Village,â a woman visits her father at a nursing home, recalling his equanimity at her teenage misdeeds and gaining a new understanding of his own past indiscretions. In another, when a troubled girl in the neighborhood goes missing, a mother worries increasingly about her teenage sonâs relationship with a bad-news girlfriend. In the novella âThree Wishes,â siblings muddle through in the aftermath of their elder brotherâs too-early departure from the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The landscape of this book is the wide open spaces of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. Throughout, there is the pervasive desire to drink to forget, to have sex with the wrong people, to hit the road and figure out later where to stop for the night. These characters are aging, regretting actions both taken and not, inhabiting their extended adolescences as best they can. And in &lt;em&gt;Funny Once&lt;/em&gt;, their flawed humanity is made beautiful, perfectly observed by one of Americaâs best short story writers.</description>

  <description>"There are haunted places in the world, all existing in reality and every bit as tangible and accessible as the house next door. Sometimes it is the house next door."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this brilliant debut collection, Ian Rogers explores the border-places between our world and the dark reaches of the supernatural. The landscape of death becomes the new frontier for scientific exploration. A honeymoon cabin with an unspeakable appetite finally meets its match. A suburban home is transformed into the hunting ground for a new breed of spider. A nightmarish jazz club at the crossroads of reality plays host to those who can break a deal with the devil...for a price. With remarkable deftness, Rogers draws together the disturbing and the diverting in twenty-two showcase stories that will guide you through terrain at once familiar and startlingly fresh.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A moving, warm, very funny graphic memoir of Simone Lia's search for inner peace and a husband, traveling from London to a Welsh convent to the Australian outback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Simone Lia's book opens we find her in Leicester Square. She's just been dumped by her boyfriend and she's talking to God, telling Him that she's nearlyÂ 34 and if He wants her to get married, He'd better get a move on. Amazingly, God sends a reply, prompting Simone to plan an "Adventure with God" that starts with aÂ stay in a nunnery, then takes her to Australia in search of a hermit. The one she finds proves a disappointment, unlike Brett, the handsome horseman who takes her riding. She thinks he looks just like Crocodile Dundee; he thinks she looks just like Penelope Cruz. Is this the man she's been searching for, or is God making fun of her? Funny, touching, and even occasionally profound,Â this bookÂ will be essential reading for singletons, seekersÂ of enlightenment, and lovers of the very best graphic novels.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;One game. Six students. Five survivors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was only ever meant to be a game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A game of consequences, of silly forfeits, childish dares. A game to be played by six best friends in their first year at Oxford University. But then the game changed: the stakes grew higher and the dares more personal, more humiliating, finally evolving into a vicious struggle with unpredictable and tragic results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, fourteen years later, the remaining players must meet again for the final round.</description>

  <description>Set in rural New York state at the turn of the twentieth century, superb new talent James Scott makes his literary debut with The Keptâa propulsive novel reminiscent of the works of Michael Ondaatje, Cormac McCarthy, and Bonnie Jo Campbell, in which a mother and her young son embark on a quest to avenge a terrible and violent tragedy that has shattered their secluded family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the winter of 1897, a trio of killers descends upon an isolated farm in upstate New York. Midwife Elspeth Howell returns home to the carnage: her husband, and four of her children, murdered. Before she can discover her remaining son Caleb, alive and hiding in the kitchen pantry, another shot rings out over the snow-covered valley. Twelve-year-old Caleb must tend to his mother until she recovers enough for them to take to the frozen wilderness in search of the men responsible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A scorching portrait of a merciless world â of guilt and lost innocence, atonement and retribution, resilience and sacrifice, pregnant obsession and primal adolescence â The Kept introduces an old-beyond-his-years protagonist as indelible and heartbreaking as Mattie Ross of True Grit or Jimmy Blevins of All the Pretty Horses, as well as a shape-shifting mother as enigmatic and mysterious as a character drawn by Russell Banks or Marilynne Robinson.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;âMichael DeForge is that rare sort of cartoonist, a genuine artist with a unique vision and a teeming imagination. Heâs not trying to create sentimental pap for a mass audience. I love his work, but IÂ do wonder why any sensible, profit-minded publisher would release this crazy book.â âChester Brown&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;âDeForge is one of those rare comics naturals and &lt;em&gt;Ant Colony&lt;/em&gt; proves it.â âJaime Hernandez&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The debut graphic novel from a dazzling newcomer with a singular, idiosyncratic style&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the few short years since he began his pamphlet-size comic book series &lt;em&gt;Lose&lt;/em&gt;, Michael DeForge has announced himself as an important new voice in alternative comics. His brash, confident, undulating artwork sent a shock wave through the comics world for its unique, fully formed aesthetic.&lt;br&gt;Â Â Â Â  From its opening pages, &lt;em&gt;Ant Colony&lt;/em&gt; immerses the reader in a world that is darkly existential, with false prophets, unjust wars, and corrupt police officers, as itÂ follows the denizens of a black ant colony under attack from the nearby red ants. On the surface, itâs the story of this war, the destruction of a civilization, and the antsâ all too familiar desire to rebuild. Underneath, though, &lt;em&gt;Ant Colony &lt;/em&gt;plumbs the deepest human concernsâloneliness, faith, love, apathy, and more. All of this is done with humor and sensitivity, exposing a world where spiders can wreak unimaginable amounts of havoc with a single gnash of their jaws.&lt;br&gt;Â Â Â Â  DeForgeâs striking visual sensibilityâstark lines, dramatic color choices, and brilliant use of page and panel spaceâstands out in this volume.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A riveting work of immersive nonfiction by a young, award-winning writer that begins with the story of a charismatic manâa Special Ops soldier who believes his PTSD is caused by demonsâbut becomes about the authorâs obsession with the strange and mesmerizing world she encounters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jennifer Percy spent three years with a group of Christians in rural Georgia who performs exorcisms on the traumatized. Percy was brought to them by a special Ops soldier just back from Afghanistan, the lone survivor of his unit, which was lost during Operation Red Wings. He returned to Georgia and, struggling with PTSD and unable to integrate back into civilian life, considered suicide, until -- as a last resort -- he underwent an exorcism. After experiencing relief, he set out on a mission to bring soldiers from across America to Georgia for a similar deliverance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the tradition of Dennis Covingtonâs &lt;em&gt;Salvation on Sand Mountain&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demon Camp&lt;/em&gt; is the strange and riveting tale of Percyâs journey into a world she is fascinated by, suspicious of, sympathetic to, and a world she becomes a part of. As she struggles to understand this soldierâs homecoming she crosses the line between journalist and participant, becoming exorcised herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book about being haunted -- about the demons in and outside of us. It is about a soldier looking for atonement in a world that is offering none -- an agnostic who is obsessed with an exorcist. It is a mesmerizing account of how people reconcile faith and trauma and a brilliant and passionate work that heralds the arrival of a brave, new talent.</description>

  <description>In this mesmerizing debut, a young American discovers he may be heir to the unclaimed estate of an English World War I officer, which launches him on a quest across Europe to uncover the elusive truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just after graduating college, Tristan Campbell receives a letter delivered by special courier to his apartment in San Francisco. It contains the phone number of a Mr. J.F. Prichard of Twyning Hooper, Solicitors, in London and news that could change Tristan's life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1924, Prichard explains, an English alpinist named Ashley Walsingham died attempting to summit Mt. Everest, leaving his fortune to his former lover, Imogen Soames-Andersson. But the estate was never claimed. Information has recently surfaced suggesting Tristan may be the rightful heir, but unless he can find documented evidence, the fortune will be divided among charitable beneficiaries in less than two months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a breathless race from London archives to Somme battlefields to the Eastfjords of Iceland, Tristan pieces together the story of a forbidden affair set against the tumult of the First World War and the pioneer British expeditions to Mt. Everest. Following his instincts through a maze of frenzied research, Tristan soon becomes obsessed with the tragic lovers, and he crosses paths with a mysterious French girl named Mireille who suggests there is more to his quest than he realizes. Tristan must prove that he is related to Imogen to inherit Ashley's fortune but the more he learns about the couple, the stranger his journey becomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steady Running of the Hour&lt;/em&gt; announces the arrival of a stunningly talented author. Part love story, part historical tour de force, Justin Go's novel is utterly compelling, unpredictable, and heartrending.</description>

  <description>When Lucy, Elena, and Michael receive their summer reading list, they are excited to see &lt;em&gt; To Kill A Mockingbird &lt;/em&gt; included.Â But not everyone in their class shares the same enthusiasm. So they hatch a plot to get the entire town talking about the well-known Harper Lee classic. They plan controversial ways to get people to read the book, including re-shelvingÂ copies of the bookÂ in bookstores so that people think they are missing and starting a website committed to âdestroying the mockingbird.â Their efforts are successful when all of the hullabaloo starts to direct more people to the book. But soon, their exploits start to spin out of control and they unwittingly start a mini revolution in the name of books.</description>

  <description>Elegant and brutal, the stories in Kate Bernheimer's latest collection occupy a heightened landscape, where the familiar cedes to the grotesque and nonsense just as often devolves into terror. These are fairy tales out of time, renewing classic stories we think we know, like one of Bernheimer's girls, whose hands of steel turn to flowers, leaving her beautiful but alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kate Bernheimer&lt;/strong&gt; is the author of the short story collection &lt;em&gt;Horse, Flower, Bird&lt;/em&gt; and the editor of &lt;em&gt;My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me: Forty New Fairy Tales&lt;/em&gt; and the journal &lt;em&gt;Fairy Tale Review&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>A lush, sexy, evocative debut novel of family secrets and girlsâ-school rituals, set in the 1930s South.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It is 1930, the midstÂ of the Great Depression. After her mysterious role in a family tragedy, passionate, strong-willed Thea Atwell, age fifteen, has been cast out of her Florida home, exiled to an equestrienne boarding school for Southern debutantes. High in the Blue Ridge Mountains, with its complex social strata ordered by money, beauty, and girlsâ friendships, the Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls is a far remove from the free-roaming, dreamlike childhood Thea shared with her twin brother on their familyâs citrus farmâa world now partially shattered. As Thea grapples with her responsibility for the events of the past year that led her here, she finds herself enmeshed in a new order, one that will change her sense of what is possible for herself, her family, her country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Weaving provocatively between home and school, the narrative powerfully unfurls the true story behind Theaâs expulsion from her family, but it isnât long before the mystery of her past is rivaled by the question of how it will shape her future. Part scandalous love story, part heartbreaking family drama, &lt;em&gt;The Yonahlossee Riding Camp for Girls &lt;/em&gt;is an immersive, transporting page-turnerâa vivid, propulsive novel about sex, love, family, money, class, home, and horses, all set against the ominous threat of the Depressionâand the major debut of an important new writer.</description>

  <description>* A &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/em&gt;Notable Book of the Year * AÂ &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle,&lt;/em&gt;Â &lt;em&gt;Kansas City Star, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, &lt;/em&gt;New Hampshire Public Radio, &lt;em&gt;Flavorwire, Vol.Â 1Â Brooklyn, Largehearted Boy,Â &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse 90210Â &lt;/em&gt;Best Book of the YearÂ *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* A &lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review &lt;/em&gt;Editors' Choice * One of &lt;em&gt;The Millions's &lt;/em&gt;Most Anticipated Books of 2013 *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary and Eddie are meant for each otherâbut love is no guarantee, not in these suburbs. Like all children, they exist in an eternal present; time is imminent, and the adults of the street live in their assorted houses like numbers on a clock. Meanwhile, ominous rumors circulate, and the increasing agitation of the neighbors points to a future in which all will be lost. Soon a sorcererâs car will speed down Maryâs street, and as past and future fold into each other, the resonant parenthesis of her girlhood will close forever. Beyond is adulthood, a world of robots and sorcerers, slaves and masters, bodies without souls. In &lt;em&gt;Duplex, &lt;/em&gt;Kathryn Davis,Â whom the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/em&gt; has called âone of the most inventive novelists at work today,â has created a coming-of-age story like no other. Once you enter the duplexâthat magical hinge between past and future, human and robot, space and timeâthereâs no telling where you might come out.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For fans of Gillian Flynn and Daniel Woodrell, a dark, gripping debut novel of literary suspense about two mysterious disappearances, a generation apart, and the meaning of family-the sacrifices we make, the secrets we keep, and the lengths we will go to protect the ones we love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dane family's roots tangle deep in the Ozark Mountain town of Henbane, but that doesn't keep sixteen-year-old Lucy Dane from being treated like an outsider. Folks still whisper about her mother, a bewitching young stranger who inspired local myths when she vanished years ago. When one of Lucy's few friends, slow-minded Cheri, is found murdered, Lucy feels haunted by the two lost girls-the mother she never knew and the friend she couldn't protect. Everything changes when Lucy stumbles across Cheri's necklace in an abandoned trailer and finds herself drawn into a search for answers. What Lucy discovers makes it impossible to ignore the suspicion cast on her own kin. More alarming, she suspects Cheri's death could be linked to her mother's disappearance, and the connection between the two puts Lucy at risk of losing everything. In a place where the bonds of blood weigh heavy, Lucy must decide where her allegiances lie.</description>

  <description>With haunting prose and deft psychological insight, Averil Dean spins a chilling story that explores the dark corners of obsessionâlove, pain and revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, someone ruined Alice Croft's life. Now she has a chance to right that wrongâand she thinks she's found the perfect man to carry out her plan. After watching him for weeks, she breaks into Jack Calabrese's house to collect the evidence that will confirm her hopes. When Jack comes home unexpectedly, Alice hides in the closet, fearing for her life. But upon finding her, Jack is strangely calm, solicitous . . . and intrigued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That night is the start of a dark and intense attraction, and soon Alice finds herself drawn into a labyrinth of terrifying surrender to a man who is more dangerous than she could have ever imagined. As their relationship spirals toward a breaking point, Alice begins to see just how deep Jack's secrets runâand how deadly they could be.</description>

  <description>Learning to survive in theÂ  harsh interior of Southern Africa, a former slave seeks shelter in the hollow of a baobab tree. For the first time since she was a young girl her time is her own, her body is her own, her thoughts are her own. In solitude, she is finally able to reflect on her own existence and its meaning,Â  bringing her a semblance of inner peace. Scenes from her former life shuttle through her mind: how owner after owner assaulted her, and how each of her babies were taken away as soon as they were weaned, their futures left to her imagination. We are the sole witnesses to her history: her capture as a child, her tortured days in a harbor city on the eastern coast as a servant, her journey with her last owner and protector, her flight, and the kaleidoscopic world of her baobab tree. Wilma StockenstrÃ¶m's profound work of narrative fiction, translated by Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee, is a rare, haunting exploration of enslavement and freedom.&lt;br&gt;Â </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A family is hunted by a centuries-old monster: a man with a relentless obsession who can take on any identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The String Diaries&lt;/em&gt; opens with Hannah frantically driving through the night--her daughter asleep in the back, her husband bleeding out in the seat beside her. In the trunk of the car rests a cache of diaries dating back 200 years, tied and retied with strings through generations. The diaries carry the rules for survival that have been handed down from mother to daughter since the 19th century. But how can Hannah escape an enemy with the ability to look and sound like the people she loves?&lt;br&gt;Stephen Lloyd Jones's debut novel is a sweeping thriller that extends from the present day, to Oxford in the 1970s, to Hungary at the turn of the 19th century, all tracing back to a man from an ancient royal family with a consuming passion--a boy who can change his shape, insert himself into the intimate lives of his victims, and destroy them.&lt;br&gt;If Hannah fails to end the chase now, her daughter is next in line. Only Hannah can decide how much she is willing to sacrifice to finally put a centuries-old curse to rest.</description>

  <description>Inspired by The Hunger Games series, Nathan Alexanderâs Hunger Gays follows the story of young Aspen Summers who has grown up in a world where young men are rounded up by the government and forced to participate in the deadly MvM match, an annual tournament where there can only be one championâor one survivor. The feared event not only forces young men into public expressions of sexual domination and submission, but also serves as a reminder that nothing, not even the will of one man, is stronger than the will of the government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Aspen finds himself participating in this kinky tournament after a lifetime of repression and poverty, he begins to unlock inner desires that could quite possibly expose and put to shame the governmentâs own actions. Can Aspen rise above his own need for gratification and find true love? Or will he succumb to his now-insatiable desires and become someone capable of bringing the government to its knees?</description>

  <description>In the tiny town of Titan Falls, New Hampshire, the paper mill dictates a quiet, steady rhythm of life. But one day a tragic bus accident sets two families on a course toward destruction, irrevocably altering the lives of everyone in their wake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;June McAllister is the wife of the local mill owner and undisputed first lady in town. But the Snow family, a group of itinerant ne'er-do-wells who live on a decrepit and cursed property, have brought her -- and the town -- nothing but grief. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;June will do anything to cover up a dark secret she discovers after the crash, one that threatens to upend her picture-perfect life, even if it means driving the Snow family out of town. But she has never gone up against a force as fierce as the young Mercy Snow. Mercy is determined to protect her rebellious brother, whom the town blames for the accident, despite his innocence. And she has a secret of her own. When an old skeleton is discovered not far from the crash, it beckons Mercy to solve a mystery buried deep within the town's past.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A lyrical novel about family and friendship from critically acclaimed author Benjamin Alire SÃ¡enz.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aristotle is an angry teen with a brother in prison. Dante is a know-it-all who has an unusual way of looking at the world. When the two meet at the swimming pool, they seem to have nothing in common. But as the loners start spending time together, they discover that they share a special friendshipâthe kind that changes lives and lasts a lifetime. And it is through this friendship that Ari and Dante will learn the most important truths about themselves and the kind of people they want to be.</description>

  <description>A new novella  by acclaimed author Bradford Morrow about a man who tracks an inexplicable plague of bird deaths, and the mysteryâs profound effect on his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds of red-winged blackbirds are discovered scattered, lifeless, around a greenhouse in Warwick, New York. Heaps of common grackles litter the fields of a farm upstate near Stone Ridge. And in Manhattan, a Washington Square restaurant is forced to close its doors when a flock of pigeons inexplicably dies on the sidewalks out front. From Pennsylvania to Maine, birds are falling from the sky en masseâand nobody can figure out why. An insurance claims adjuster and avid birder is one of the first to recognize that something is wrong. His stepdaughter, Caitlin, has also noticedâtheir common interest in birds is one of the few things they share these days, since her mother died of cancer just six months ago. As they travel the Northeast together to investigate the ominous deaths, a bond forms that might prove strong enough to mend their broken family. Fall of the Birds is a moving story of a haunting near-future and a tribute to the power of love that can survive even the most harrowing of circumstances.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Stripped down and stylizedâ&lt;em&gt;Winterâs Bone&lt;/em&gt; plus &lt;em&gt;Less Than Zero&lt;/em&gt;âthe sharpest, boldest, brashest debut of the year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Nikki, the most determined young woman in the Carolina hills. Sheâs determined not to let the expectations of society set her future; determined to use all the limited tools at her disposal to shape the world to her will; determined to preserve her familyâs domination of the local drug trade despite the fact that her parents are gone. Nikki is thirteen years old.&lt;br&gt;Â Â Â Â  Opening with a death-defying plunge off a high cliff into a tiny swimming hole, &lt;em&gt;Young God &lt;/em&gt;refuses to slow down for a moment as it charts Nikkiâs battles against the powers that be. Katherine Faw Morris has stripped her prose down to its bare essenceâcertain chapters are just a few words longâresulting in an electric, electrifying reading experience that wonât soon be forgotten. She quickly gets to the core of Nikki, her young heroine, whoâs only just beginning to learn about her power over the people around herâlearning too early, perhaps, but also just soon enough, if not too late.&lt;br&gt;Â Â Â Â  Evoking the staccato, telegraphic storytelling style of James Ellroy but with the literary affect of a young Denis Johnson and aÂ fierce sense of place worthy of Flannery OâConnor or Donna Tartt, Morris is a debut novelist who demands your attentionâand Nikki is a character who will cut you if you let your attention waver.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From master storyteller David Almond comes a gripping, exquisitely written novel about a hidden-away child who emerges into a broken world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billy Dean is a secret child. He has a beautiful young mother and a father who arrives at night carrying the scents of candles and incense and cigarettes. Birds fly to his window. Mice run out from his walls. His world is a carpet, a bed, pictures of the holy island, and a single locked door. His father fills his mind and his dreams with mysterious tales and memories and dreadful warnings. But then his father disappears, and Billyâs mother brings him out into the world at last. He learns the horrifying story of what was saved and what was destroyed on the day he was born, the day the bombers came to Blinkbonny. The kind butcher, Mr. McCaufrey, and the medium, Missus Malone, are waiting for him. He becomes The Angel Child, one who can heal the living, contact the dead, bring comfort to a troubled world. But there is one figure who is beyond healing, who comes looking for Billy himself â and is determined on a kind of reckoning.</description>

  <description>Recently widowed and rendered penniless by her Ponzi-scheming husband, Julia Bishop is eager to start anew. So when a stranger appears on her doorstep with a job offer, she finds herself accepting the mysterious yet unique position: caretaker to his mother, Amaris Sinclair, the famous and rather eccentric horror novelist whom Julia has always admiredâ¦and who the world believes is dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she arrives at the Sinclairs' enormous estate on Lake Superior, Julia begins to suspect that there may be sinister undercurrents to her "too-good-to-be-true" position. As Julia delves into the reasons of why Amaris chose to abandon her successful writing career and withdraw from the public eye, her search leads to unsettling connections to her own family tree, making her wonder why she really was invited to Havenwood in the first place, and what monstrous secrets are still held prisoner within its walls.</description>

  <description>âRight from the start I picked her for a thief, although that day she didnât take anything. . . . I knew sheâd be back,â the narrator/bookseller of &lt;em&gt;Severina&lt;/em&gt; recalls in this novelâs opening pages. Imagine a dark-haired book thief as alluring as she is dangerous. Imagine the mesmerized bookseller secretly tracking the volumes she steals, hoping for insight into her character, her motives, her love life. In Rodrigo Rey Rosaâs hands, this tale of obsessive love is told with almost breathless precision and economy. The bookstore owner is soon entangled in Severinaâs mystery: seductive and peripatetic, of uncertain nationality, she steals books to actually read them and to share with her purported grandfather, SeÃ±or Blanco.&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;In this unsettling exploration of the alienating and simultaneously liberating power of love, the booksellerâs monotonous existence is rocked by the enigmatic Severina. As in a dream, the disoriented man finds that the thin border between rational and irrational is no longer reliable. &lt;em&gt;Severina&lt;/em&gt; confirms Rey Rosaâs privileged place in contemporary world literature.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;Â actor Nick Offerman shares his humorous fulminations on life, manliness, meat, and much more in his first book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Growing a perfect moustache, grilling red meat, wooing a womanâwho better to deliver this tutelage than the always charming, always manly Nick Offerman, best known asÂ &lt;em&gt;Parks and Recreation&lt;/em&gt;âs Ron Swanson? Â Combining his trademark comic voice and very real expertise in woodworkingâhe runs his own woodshopâ&lt;em&gt;Paddle Your Own Canoe&lt;/em&gt;Â featuresÂ talesÂ from Offermanâs childhoodÂ in small-town Minooka, Illinoisâï¿½I grew up literally in the middle of a cornfieldââto his theater days in Chicago, beginnings as a carpenter/actor and the hilarious and magnificent seduction of his now-wife Megan Mullally.Â Â Â It also offersÂ hard-bitten battle strategies in the arenas of manliness, love, style, religion, woodworking, and outdoor recreation, among many other savory entrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A mix of amusing anecdotes, opinionated lessons and rants, sprinkled with offbeat gaiety,Â &lt;em&gt;Paddle Your Own Canoe&lt;/em&gt;Â will not only tickle readers pink but may also rouse them to put down their smart phones, study a few sycamore leaves, and maybe even hand craft (and paddle) their own canoes.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Science and Religion. Love and Hatred. Life and Death. It's all the same without poetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the mid 1800s, at the encouragement of a dear friend, Emily Dickinson began writing poetry. Fewer than twelve of her poems were published while she was alive. The hundreds of poems for which Emily is known for and celebrated today were almost lost at the hands of her sister, who was only fulfilling her dying sibling's wish.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily feared death. Throughout life, as she witnessed the numerous deaths of her close friends and loved ones, she became a recluse, locking herself in her room and refusing visitors. Did Emily spend all that time in her room writing poetry? No! She was giving life back to the dead!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years earlier, after observing a galvanism experiment in biology class, young Emily decides to try building a "Second Life" apparatus that will give life back to small dead creatures she finds in her garden. Terrified that her discovery could be used for more dreadful purposes, she cherishes her success and keeps it a secret. But upon discovering that her dearest friend has passed quite suddenly, Emily's battle between science and spirituality begins, threatening to change her life forever!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the spirit of other great mash-ups such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Shannon Yarbrough blends the story of Emily Dickinson with the classic Frankenstein creating this chilling tale of Gothic horror: Dickinstein: Emily Dickinson - Mad Scientist!</description>

  <description>From Robin Sloan, author of Mr. Penumbraâs 24-Hour Bookstore, the story of Mr. Penumbraâs first trip to San Franciscoâand of how he got entangled with the cityâs most unusual always-open enterpriseâ¦&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is August 1969. The Summer of Love is a fading memory. The streets of San Francisco pulse to the sounds of Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. And of jackhammers: A futuristic pyramid of a skyscraper is rising a few blocks from City Lights bookstore and an unprecedented subway tunnel is being built under the bay. Meanwhile, south of the city, orchards are quickly giving way to a brand-new industry built on silicon.&lt;br&gt;But young Ajax Penumbra has not arrived in San Francisco looking for free love or a glimpse of the technological future. He is seeking a bookâthe single surviving copy of the Techne Tycheon, a mysterious volume that has brought and lost great fortune for anyone who has owned it. The last record of the book locates it in the San Francisco of more than a century earlier, and on that scant bit of evidence, Penumbraâs university has dispatched him west to acquire it for their library. After a few weeks of rigorous hunting, Penumbra feels no closer to his goal than when he started. But late one night, after another day of dispiriting dead ends, he stumbles across a 24-hour bookstore, and the possibilities before him expand exponentially . . .</description>

  <description>Death stalks the musty corridors of Scotswood Manor, a residential home for the elderly. Its relatively tranquil peace is shattered with a brutal murder. &lt;br&gt;The deceased had, it appeared, no enemies. The discovery of her battered body and the ear splitting scream that accompanies the find causes consternation amongst the residents.&lt;br&gt;Enter DI Giles Fricker; a misunderstood man with many problems who constantly seeks the approval of his Germanic psychologist and is haunted by long subdued feelings of inadequacy along with painful memories of his fatherâs infidelity. Fricker is also obsessed with his shapely subordinate WPC Cole; she is in turn obsessed with the Oxford English dictionary. &lt;br&gt;Confusion, misunderstandings and inept investigation are the order of the day for DI Fricker and his dysfunctional team, as murder follows murder. &lt;br&gt;Distracted by his fumbling attempts to find romance our deficient detective stumbles helplessly towards solving the crime; however the identity of the killer remains hidden in a complex maze of sub plots. Fricker is led of the beaten track and close to the edge of disaster as inadvertently he gets closer to solving the mystery; the murderer tries to get him off the scent and Fricker himself becomes a target.</description>

  <description>How do you live with a secret so dark and so deeply woven into your being that it threatens to smother your very existence, with no known way out? Use it to your advantage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kailey Rooke, karmelean, and now a possibly unethical karma-for-hire, has spent the past year jumping from project to project without any real hope for salvation. With repercussions from her actions at every turn, she discovers that as time goes on, she loses a bit more of herself to that which feeds on her anguish--that which is thriving inside her own body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a new contract to find a missing girl arises, Kailey attempts to put her past and its associated problems on the back burner, but she soon finds out that treachery and deceit lie shortly ahead in Golden Dunes, only giving face to new problems, with one leading right back to her childhood past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She struggles to complete her contract as her own life teeters on a fulcrum, constantly tipping according to karmaâs whim. How long will she keep her balance? Which way will she fall?</description>

  <description>Hannah, independent, headstrong, and determined not to follow in the footsteps of her bitterly divorced mother, has always avoided commitment. But one hot New York summer she meets Mark Reilly, a fellow Brit, and is swept up in a love affair that changes all her ideas about what marriage might mean.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, living in their elegant, expensive London townhouse and adored by her fantastically successful husband, she knows she was right to let down her guard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Mark does not return from a business trip to the U.S. and when the hours of waiting for him stretch into days, the foundations of Hannahâs certainty begin to crack. Why do Markâs colleagues believe he has gone to Paris not America? Why is there no record of him at his hotel? And who is the mysterious woman who has been telephoning him over the last few weeks? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hannah begins to dig into her husbandâs life, uncovering revelations that throw into doubt everything she has ever believed about him. As her investigation leads her away from their fairytale romance into a place of violence and fear she must decide whether the secrets Mark has been keeping are designed to protect him or protect her . . .</description>

  <description>I am a secret no one is able to tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blythe Hallowell is sixteen when she is abducted by a survivalist and locked away in an abanÂ­doned missile silo in Eudora, Kansas. At first, she focuses frantically on finding a way out, until the harrowing truth of her new existence settles inâthe crushing loneliness, the terrifying madness of a captor who believes he is saving her from the end of the world, and the persistent temptation to give up. But nothing prepares Blythe for the burden of raising a child in confinement. DeterÂ­mined to give the boy everything she has lost, she pushes aside the truth about a world he may never see for a myth that just might give meanÂ­ing to their lives below ground. Years later, their lives are ambushed by an event at once promisÂ­ing and devastating. As Blytheâs dream of going home hangs in the balance, she faces the ultimate choiceâbetween survival and freedom.</description>

  <description>A thrilling tale of supernatural adventure, set on the snowy peaks of Mount Everest from the bestselling author of 'The Terror'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's 1926, and the desire to summit the world's highest mountain has reached a fever-pitch among adventurers. Three young friends, eager to take their shot at the top, accept funding from a grieving mother whose son fell to his death on Mt. Everest two years earlier. But she refuses to believe he's dead, and wants them to bring him back alive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they set off toward Everest, the men encounter other hikers who are seeking the boy's body for their own mysterious reasons. What valuable item could he have been carrying? What is the truth behind the many disapperances on the mountain? As they journey to the top of the world, the three friends face abominable choices, actions - and possibly creatures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bone-chilling, pulse-pounding story of supernatural suspense, 'The Abominable' is Dan Simmons at his best.</description>

  <description>Jessica Speight, a young anthropology student in 1960s London, is at the beginning of a promising academic career when an affair with her married professor turns her into a single mother. Anna is a pure gold baby with a delightful sunny nature. But as it becomes clear that Anna will not be a normal child, the book circles questions of responsibility, potential, even age, with Margaret Drabbleâs characteristic intelligence, sympathy, and wit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drabble once wrote, âFamily life itself, that safest, most traditional, most approved of female choices, is not a sanctuary; it is, perpetually, a dangerous place.â Told from the point of view of the group of mothers who surround Jess, &lt;em&gt;The Pure Gold Baby&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant, prismatic novel that takes us into that place with satiric verve, trenchant commentary, and a movingly intimate story of the unexpected transformations at the heart of motherhood.</description>

  <description>USA TODAY bestselling author Jeff Hirsch once again creates a futuristic world with stunning, dramatic realism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A civil war rages between the Glorious Path--a militant religion based on the teachings of a former US soldier--and what's left of the US government. Fifteen-year-old Callum Roe and his younger brother, James, were captured and forced to convert six years ago. Cal has been working in the Path's dog kennels, and is very close to becoming one of the Path's deadliest secret agents. Then Cal befriends a stray dog named Bear and kills a commander who wants to train him to be a vicious attack dog. This sends Cal and Bear on the run, and sets in motion a series of incredible events that will test Cal's loyalties and end in a fierce battle that the fate of the entire country rests on.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast Club meets The Walking Dead as a group of unlikely allies tries to survive a deadly outbreak.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brian and his friends are not part of the cool crowd. Theyâre the misfits and the troublemakersâthe ones who jump their high schoolâs fence to skip class regularly. So when a deadly virus breaks out, theyâre the only ones with a chance of surviving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus turns Brianâs classmates and teachers into bloodthirsty attackers who donât die easily. The whole school goes on lockdown, but Brian and his best friend, Chad, are safe (and stuck) in the theater departmentâfar from Brianâs sister, Kenzie, and his ex-girlfriend with a panic attack problem, Laura. Brian and Chad, along with some of the theater kids Brian had never given the time of day before, decide to find the girls and bring them to the safety of the theater. But it wonât be easy, and it will test everything they thought they knew about themselves and their classmates.</description>

  <description>A gypsy orphan, Heath Galloway adores Cathy Earnshaw, his childhood sweetheart. He would do anything to protect her from her drunken, abusive father--even push the man down a flight of stairs to stop him hitting her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with her father dead, Cathy's older brother Matt runs the Earnshaw farm and both of their lives. And Matt despises Heath. Forced to drop out of school and work the fields, Heath is separated from Cathy and the two begin to drift apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Cathy meets the rich, blond, and suave Eli Linton, she finds herself torn between Eli's charm and Heath's brute potency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiercely proud and stubborn, Heath doesn't take well to being brushed aside. He'll get what he wants, or he'll get revenge. No matter how long it takes.</description>

  <description>Why is it that we're always afraid of our ankles getting grabbed by a hand coming out of the gutter? And why will our lives be completely fulfilled when we look down one day and notice we're wearing underwear made out of a brown paper bag?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully, you don't have to think about any of that because in his second collection of poetry, Sam Pink has done the work for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will see a crowd of people in your head and the crowd will point at you and say, "E&lt;a href="http://www" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www&lt;/a&gt;." You will hang yourself from the ceiling with a hook though your bottom jaw. You will feel at home eating your own heart off a commemorative plate featuring a picture of your corpse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You won't learn anything except that, "No one can do anything to you that's worse than what you're already thought to yourself. No one can do anything worse to you than the things you've already done. No one can do anything worse to you than you can."</description>

  <description>In the New York City subway system, advertisements emblazon everything from station walls to the roofs of train cars. The surreptitious scrawls of clever--and not-so-clever--culture jammers that deface the polished images of starlets and media darlings are nearly as ubiquitous as these advertisements. In &lt;em&gt;New York Dick,&lt;/em&gt; Galen Smith displays the result of his years spent spelunking in the subway system. What he has observed and documented is one very specific trope, the addition of a penis to posters advertising everything from the latest Hollywood blockbuster to a public service announcement. This sleek book details the original ads and how they have been embellished. Crassly humorous, &lt;em&gt;New York Dick&lt;/em&gt; provides a glimpse of the work of those who re-appropriate corporate communications in a very specific manner.</description>

  <description>1867. Eliza Caine arrives in Norfolk to take up her position as governess at Gaudlin Hall on a dark and chilling night. As she makes her way across the station platform, a pair of invisible hands push her from behind into the path of an approaching train. She is only saved by the vigilance of a passing doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she finally arrives, shaken, at the hall she is greeted by the two children in her care, Isabella and Eustace. There are no parents, no adults at all, and no one to represent her mysterious employer. The children offer no explanation. Later that night in her room, a second terrifying experience further reinforces the sense that something is very wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment she rises the following morning, her every step seems dogged by a malign presence which lives within Gaudlin's walls. Eliza realises that if she and the children are to survive its violent attentions, she must first uncover the hall's long-buried secrets and confront the demons of its past.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From getting kicked out of Bible study to metaphysics with strippersâa misanthrope's wickedly witty observations about the ridiculous, raunchy, and frequently disturbing impulses that propel human existence. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With the wit of David Sedaris and the analytical sharpshooting of Sloane Crosley, Ashley Cardiff spares no oneâleast of all herselfâin an absurd and relentlessly funny journey of sexual development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Cardiff reflects on her introverted, awkward and too-smart teenage years to her slightly bolder (but still uncomfortable) adult relationships, all while exploring the rich anthropological terrain of sex and love. Expounding on dating Mormons, the inherent weirdness of adolescent development, sexual nightmare-fantasies about Prince, family members' sex tapes, and narrowly avoiding a teenage orgy, Cardiff recognizes sexuality for the anxiety-making force it is. Weaving adept analysis with hilarious anecdotes, she goes for something much deeper than a rant, crafting satire that's as smart as it is ruthless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Delivering fresh, unapologetic views from the perspective of a precise and ferociously irreverent young female writer, &lt;em&gt;Night Terrors&lt;/em&gt; is a rollicking manifesto on the agonies of modern life and love.</description>

  <description>On the one hand, nobody wants to be a dick. On the other hand, dicks are everywhere! They cut in line, talk behind our backs, recline into our seats, and even have the power to morph into trolls online. Their powers are impressive, but with a little foresight and thoughtfulness, we can take a stand against dickishness today. "How Not to Be a Dick" is packed with honest and straightforward advice, but it also includes playful illustrations showing two well-meaning (but not always well behaved) young people as they confront moments of potential dickishness in their everyday lives. Sometimes they falter, sometimes they triumph, but they always seek to find a better way. And with their help, you can too.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; (UK)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt; "An exuberant pageant of literary fiction and a celebration of the possibilities of the novel."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A novel is a story transmitted from the novelist to the reader. It offers distraction, entertainment, and an opportunity to unwind or focus. But it can also be something more powerfulâa way to learn about how to live. Read at the right moment in your life, a novel canâquite literallyâchange it.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Novel Cure &lt;/em&gt;is a reminder of that power. To create this apothecary, the authors have trawled two thousand years of literature for novels that effectively promote happiness, health, and sanity, written by brilliant minds who knew what it meant to be human and wrote their life lessons into their fiction. Structured like a reference book, readers simply look up their ailment, be it agoraphobia, boredom, or a midlife crisis, and are given a novel to read as the antidote. Bibliotherapy does not discriminate between pains of the body and pains of the head (or heart). Aware that youâve been cowardly? Pick up &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird &lt;/em&gt;for an injection of courage. Experiencing a sudden, acute fear of death? Read &lt;em&gt;One Hundred Years of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Solitude &lt;/em&gt;for some perspective on the larger cycle of life. Nervous about throwing a dinner party? Ali Smithâs &lt;em&gt;There but for The &lt;/em&gt;will convince you that yours could never go &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;wrong. Whatever your condition, the prescription is simple: a novel (or two), to be read at regular intervals and in nice long chunks until you finish. Some treatments will lead to a complete cure. Others will offer solace, showing that youâre not the first to experience these emotions. &lt;em&gt;The Novel Cure &lt;/em&gt;is also peppered with useful lists and sidebars recommending the best novels to read when youâre stuck in traffic or canât fall asleep, the most important novels to read during every decade of life, and many more.&lt;br&gt; Â &lt;br&gt; Brilliant in concept and deeply satisfying in execution, &lt;em&gt;The Novel Cure &lt;/em&gt;belongs on everyoneâs bookshelf and in every medicine cabinet. It will make even the most well-read fiction aficionado pick up a novel heâs never heard of, and see familiar ones with new eyes. Mostly, it will reaffirm literatureâs ability to distract and transport, to resonate and reassure, to change the way we see the world and our place in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Astute and often amusing . . . a charming addition to any library. Time spent leafing through its pages is inspiring - even therapeutic."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Â </description>

They say he can change his face. He could be anyone, at any time. And they say he can bring the dead back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A KILLING MACHINE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the brink of life and death, a monster, self-aware, dangles at the end of a puppeteerâs strings, forced to help the very man he seeks to destroy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AN EPIC JOURNEY SOUTH&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twisting and turning through hordes of zombies, cartel territory, Mayan ruins, and the things that now inhabit them, a group of survivors must travel to save one manâs family from a nightmarish third world gone to hell. But this time, even best friends have deadly secrets, and even allies canât be trustedâas a fatherâs only hope of getting his kids out alive is the very thing thatâs hunting him down.</description>

  <description>After the acclaimed indie film Save the Date and the bestselling all-ages humor book Darth Vader and Son, graphic novelist Jeffrey Brown (Clumsy, Unlikely) returns to the autobiographical work that first made his reputation. In A Matter of Life, Jeffrey Brown draws upon memories of three generations of Brown men: himself, his minister father, and his preschooler son Oscar. Weaving through time, passing through the quiet suburbs and colorful cities of the midwest, their stories slowly assemble into a kaleidoscopic answer to the big questions: matters of life and death, family and faith, and the search for something beyond oneself.</description>

  <description>Absurdist writer Jon Konrath returns with another collection of hilarious and demented flash fiction. Descend into a manic world of Kafkaesque insanity and paranoia including FDA drone strikes against weight-loss clinics, amputee porn, a celebrity kickboxing match between Yo Yo Ma and Manuel Noriega, and hobby shop exorcisms. The author of the cult classic Rumored to Exist continues his surreal nonlinear journey through a nightmarish terrain of Jeff Spicoli-themed restaurants, indian casino abortion clinics, and an apocalyptic landscape laced with insane humor and nonstop non sequitur references to pop culture, medical technology, military machinery, and extreme heavy metal. This collection of 26 short stories and flash fiction pieces explores the human element through deranged comedy in what demonstrates Konrath's bizarre style of experimental writing. Bonus: The paperback edition of Thunderbird also includes the short story "The Zombies of Kilimanjaro," an undead parody of the Hemingway classic.</description>

It's the new trend in running races; run through miles and miles of zombie infested trails, but instead of biting you, they grab a flag off of your belt, flag-football style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See what happens when Big Pharm meets Big Horror, as three Pharmaceutical Representatives take part in a Zombie Run, and get much more horror than they planned for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short story of 5,000 words, by the author of On the Lips of Children, STRAY and The Jade Rabbit.</description>

  <description>The Black Death. Yellow Fever. Smallpox. History is full of gruesome pandemics, and surviving those pandemics has shaped our society and way of life. Every person today is alive because of an ancestor who survived--and surviving our current and future pandemics, like SARS, AIDS, bird flu or a new and unknown disease, will determine our future. &lt;em&gt;Pandemic Survival&lt;/em&gt; presents in-depth information about past and current illnesses; the evolution of medicine and its pioneers; cures and treatments; strange rituals and superstitions; and what we're doing to prevent future pandemics. Full of delightfully gross details about symptoms and fascinating facts about bizarre superstitious behaviors, &lt;em&gt;Pandemic Survival&lt;/em&gt; is sure to interest even the most squeamish of readers.</description>

  <description>Romeo and Juliet. Heathcliff and Catherine. Ricky and . . . a zombie he's keeping chained in his backyard? Okay, so their romance won't be one for the ages. But it sure is doomed.</description>

  <description>Part &lt;strong&gt;Secret History&lt;/strong&gt;, part &lt;strong&gt;Brideshead Revisited&lt;/strong&gt; for the 21st century, The Bellwether Revivals is a page-turning, romantic, eerie tale of genius and, possibly, madness; a stunning debut for fans of Sarah Waters, Donna Tartt, and Lauren Goff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bellwether Revivals &lt;/strong&gt;opens and closes with bodies. The story of whose bodies and how they come to be spread about an elegant house on the river near Cambridge is told by Oscar, a young, bright working class man who has fallen in love with an upper-class Cambridge student, Iris, and thereby become entangled with a group of close friends, led by Iris's charismatic, brilliant, possibly dangerous brother. For Eden Bellwether believes he can heal -- and perhaps more -- through the power of music.&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;In this masterful debut, we too are seduced by this gilded group of young people, entranced by Eden's powerful personality and his obvious talent as a musician, and caught off guard by the strangeness of Iris and Eden's parents. And we find ourselves utterly unsure as to whether Eden Bellweather is a saviour or a villain, and whether Oscar will be able to solve this mystery in time to save himself, if not everyone else.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of an Edgar Award for Best First Novel for &lt;em&gt;Bent Road&lt;/em&gt;, Lori Roy returns with &lt;em&gt;Until She Comes Home&lt;/em&gt;, a tale of spellbinding suspense in which a pair of seemingly unrelated murders crumbles the facade of a changing Detroit neighborhood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In 1958 Detroit, on Alder Avenue, neighbors struggle to care for neighbors amid a city ripe with conflicts that threaten their peaceful street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Grace, Alderâs only expectant mother, eagerly awaits her first born. Best friend Julia prepares to welcome twin nieces. And Malina sets the tone with her stylish dresses, tasteful home, and ironfisted stewardship of St. Albanâs bake sale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Life erupts when childlike Elizabeth disappears while in the care of Grace and Julia. All the ladies fear the recent murder of a black woman at the factory on Willingham Avenue where their husbands work may warn of what has become of Elizabeth, and they worry what is yet to become of Juliaâthe last to see Elizabeth alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The men mount an around-the-clock search, leaving their families vulnerable to sinister elements hidden in plain sight. Only Grace knows what happened, but her mother warns her not to tell. âNo man wants to know this about his wife.â Ashamed that her silence puts loved ones in harmâs way, Grace gravitates toward the women of Willingham Avenue, who recognize her suffering as their own. Through their acceptance, Grace conquers her fear and dares to act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On Alder Avenue, vicious secrets bind friends, neighbors, and spouses. For the wicked among them, the walk home will be long.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Michael Irwinâs The Skull and the Nightingale is a chilling and deliciously dark, literary novel of manipulation and sex, intrigue and seduction, set in 18th-century England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Richard Fenwick returns to London, his wealthy godfather, James Gilbert, has an unexpected proposition. Gilbert has led a sedate life in Worcestershire, but feels the urge to experience, even vicariously, the extremes of human feeling: love, passion, and something much more sinister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It becomes apparent that Gilbert desires news filled with tales of carousing, flirtation, excess, and Londonâs more salacious side. But Gilbertâs elaborate and manipulative âexperimentsâ into the workings of human behavior soon drag Richard into a Faustian vortex of betrayal and danger where lives are ruined and tragedy is only a step away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With echoes of Dangerous Liaisons, Michael Irwinâs The Skull and the Nightingale is an urgent period drama that seduces the senses.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From one of Americaâs most accomplished and acclaimed fiction writers, a chilling, spectacularly riveting novel based on a real life multiple murder by a con man who preyed on widowsâa story that has haunted Jayne Anne Phillips for more than four decades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jayne Anne Phillipsâs debut collection, &lt;em&gt;Black Tickets&lt;/em&gt;, galvanized critics and readers when it was published in 1979 and announced her as one of the great new voices of her generation. Her four novels, prizewinners and reader favorites, have secured her place as one of Americaâs most celebrated storytellers. In &lt;em&gt;Quiet Dell&lt;/em&gt;, Phillips re-imagines a gruesome crime in a tiny West Virginia community not far from where she grew up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Chicago in 1931, Asta Eicher, mother of three, is lonely and despairing, pressed for money after the sudden death of her husband. She begins to receive seductive letters from a chivalrous, elegant man named Harry Powers, who promises to cherish and protect her, ultimately to marry her and to care for her and her children. Weeks later, the family are dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily Thornhill, one of the few women in the Chicago press, covers the case and becomes deeply invested in understanding what happened to this beautiful family, particularly to the youngest child, Annabel, an enchanting girl with a precocious imagination and sense of magic. Bold and intrepid, Emily allies herself with the Chicago banker who funds the investigation and who is wracked by guilt for not saving Asta. Driven by secrets of their own, the heroic characters in this magnificent tale will stop at nothing to ensure that Powers is convicted. A mesmerizing retelling of a harrowing crime, &lt;em&gt;Quiet Dell&lt;/em&gt; is a tour de force of obsession and imagination.</description>

  <description>Holly is not herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was once a pretty young woman, healthy and strong, completely devoted to her husband Richard. When she became pregnant, he was ecstatic. They would finally have a child to complete their love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Holly began to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She began reading strange, old books and consorting with a mysterious midwife named Mrs. Crouch. Day by day, she becomes less like the woman Richard married, slowly degenerating into something evil and monstrous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The child she carries is not his. In fact, it's not even human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holly is about to unleash hell into the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A brilliant dark comedy about life, death and growing old in America told with Segal's characteristic humor, crystalline style and deadpan delivery-and her hilarious sense of the absurd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half the Kingdom is a brilliant dark comedy about life, death and growing old in post-9/11 America-a place where terrorist paranoia and end-of-the-world hysteria masks deeper fears about mortality; a place where the broken medical system leads one character to quip, "Kafka wrote slice-of-life fiction."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Characters from Segal's earlier novels are part of the cast whose lives intersect at Manhattan's Cedars of Lebanon emergency room-where doctors have noticed a marked up-tick in Alzheimer victims. People who seemed perfectly lucid just a day earlier exhibit signs of advanced dementia. Is it just normal aging or a coincidence? Is it an epidemic, or a secret terrorist plot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As profoundly moving as Joan Didion's latest non-fiction, and as thoughtful and charming as Diana Athill, Segal's crystalline writing and deep appreciation of the absurd make this most tragic and hilarious novel a joy for all to read.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For fans of Tana French and &lt;em&gt;The Silent Wife&lt;/em&gt;, THE LAST WINTER OF DANI LANCING is a chilling debut thriller hailed by Sophie Hannah as âbrilliantâ about one murderâs devastating ripple effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Â &lt;br&gt;Twenty years ago, college student Dani Lancing was kidnapped and brutally murdered. The killer was never found. Daniâs family never found peace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrust into an intense devastation that nearly destroys their marriage, Patty and Jim Lancing struggle to deal with their harrowing loss. Patty is fanatically obsessed with the cold case; consumed by every possible clue or suspect no matter how far-fetched, she goes to horrifying lengths to help clarify the past.Â  Meanwhile, Jim has become a shell of his former self, broken down and hauntedâsometimes literallyâby his young daughterâs death. Daniâs childhood sweetheart, Tom, handles his own grief every day on the jobâheâs become a detective intent on solving murders of other young women, and hopes to one day close Daniâs case himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then everything changes when Tom finds a promising new lead. As lies and secrets are unearthed, the heartbreaking truth behind Daniâs murder is finally revealed.&lt;br&gt;THE LAST WINTER OF DANI LANCING is a shockingly disturbing and deeply powerful debut, and P.D. Viner immediately joins the ranks of Tana French, A. S. A. Harrison, and Gillian Flynn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Belka, Why Donât You Bark&lt;/em&gt;? begins in 1943, when Japanese troops retreat from the Aleutian island of Kiska, leaving four military dogs behind. One of them dies in isolation, and the others are taken under the protection of U.S. troops. Meanwhile, in the USSR, a KGB military dog handler kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese yakuza. Named after the Russian astronaut dog Strelka, the girl develops a psychic connection with canines. A multi-generational epic as seen through the eyes of manâs best friend, the dogs who are used as mere tools for the benefit of humankind gradually discover their true selves, and learn something about us.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A star-studded urban fantasy anthology featuring bestselling authors Rachel Caine, Rob Thurman, Seanan McGuire, Jennifer Estep, and Kevin Hearne, whose stories explore the creepy, mysterious, and, yes, sometimes magical world of traveling carnivals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The traveling carnival is a leftover of a bygone era, a curiosity lurking on the outskirts of town. It is a place of contradictionsâthe bright lights mask the peeling paint; a carnie in greasy overalls slinks away from the direction of the Barkerâs seductive call. It is a place of illusionâis that womanâs beard real? How can she live locked in that watery box?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And while many are tricked by sleight of hand, there are hints of something truly magical going on. One must remain alert and learn quickly the unwritten rules of this dark show. To beat the carnival, one had better have either a whole lot of luck or a whole lot of gunsâor maybe some magic of oneâs own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring stories grotesque and comical, outrageous and action-packed, &lt;em&gt;Carniepunk&lt;/em&gt; is the first anthology to channel the energy and attitude of urban fantasy into the bizarre world of creaking machinery, twisted myths, and vivid new magic.</description>

  <description>In upstate New York, Virgil Cain is drawing hay behind his team of massive Percherons when two movie scouts show up and offer $500 a day to use the horses in a film to be shot in the area. Virgil, in need of cash, reluctantly pockets the money, but he soon finds the chaotic set of Frontier Woman to be more trouble than it&amp;amp;#8217;s worth. Savvy producer Sam Sawchuk is in over her head; when she&amp;amp;#8217;s not propping up her talent-challenged husband-cum-director, she&amp;amp;#8217;s trying to keep tabs on a new inves&amp;amp;#173;tor, the Native American casino owner Ronnie Red Hawk, a rambling egomaniac with designs on an infamous starlet. When the film&amp;amp;#8217;s leading lady turns up dead, Virgil discovers that more is at stake than the carnal interests of a casino magnate and the production of a major motion picture. And although he&amp;amp;#8217;d rather leave the whole bunch to stew in their own juices, he realizes he needs to step in before a charming ten-year-old actress named Georgia becomes the next victim.</description>

  <description>In 1957, Jane Weld was eleven years old when her father, Luce, disappeared. His skiff was found drifting near a marsh, empty except for his hunting coat and a box of shotgun shells. No one in their small New England town knew for sure what happened until, three years later, Luceâs skull rolled out of a gravel pit, a bullet hole in the temple. Rumors sprang up that he had been murdered by the jealous husband of his mistress, Ada Varick. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, half a century later, Jane is still searching for the truth of her fatherâs death, a mystery made more urgent by the unexpected romance that her willful daughter, Marne, has struck up with one of Adaâs sons. As the love affair intensifies, Jane and Ada meet for their weekly Friday game of Scrabble, a pastime that soon transforms into a cat-and-mouse game of words long left unspoken, and dark secrets best left untold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Enderâs Game&lt;/em&gt; in an epic new series from award-winning author Rick Yancey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, itâs the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earthâs last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassieâs only hope for rescuing her brotherâor even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.</description>

  <description>For James Barilla and his family, the dream of transforming their Columbia, South Carolina, backyard into a haven for wildlife evoked images of kids catching grasshoppers by day and fireflies at night, of digging up potatoes and picking strawberries. When they signed up with the National Wildlife Federation to certify their yard as a wildlife habitat, it felt like pushing back, in however small a way, against the tide of bad news about vanishing species, changing climate, dying coral reefs. Then the animals started to arrive, and Barilla soon discovered the complexities (and possible mayhem) of merging human with animal habitats. What are the limits of coexistence, he wondered?Â To find out, Barilla set out across continents to explore cities where populations of bears, monkeys, marmosets, and honeybees live alongside human residents. &lt;em&gt;My Backyard Jungle&lt;/em&gt; brings these unique stories together, making Barillaâs yard the centerpiece of a meditation on possibilities for coexistence with animals in an increasingly urban world. Not since Gerald Durrell penned &lt;em&gt;My Family and Other Animals&lt;/em&gt; have readers encountered a naturalist with such a gift for storytelling and such an open heart toward all things wild.</description>

  <description>In this brilliantly entertaining send-up of zombie lit, Edgar Award winner and National Book Award finalist Jess Walter offers a twist on Americaâs favorite monster: You donât have to be dead to be a zombie. Walter creates a postapocalyptic nightmare that is as sidesplitting as it is movingâand all the more damning because itâs so recognizable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the year 2040, amid rolling epidemics, economic collapses, ozone tumors, genetic piracy, and an Arizona border war, âDonât Eat Catâ is the story of Owen, a guy who just wants to forget the results of his recent full-body scan with a grande soy latte before going to work in Seattleâs food/finance district. The world has gone straight to hell, and the most horrifying part of it is that not a damn thing has changed: You still have to go to work, you still donât have a girlfriend, and, unbelievably, the line at the Starbucks Financial still stretches on forever. Why? Because thereâs a zombie working behind the counter, an addict of a club drug that causes its users to become aggressive, milk-pale, dead-eyed dimwits with an appetite for rodents and house petsâcats in particular (and, in very, very rare cases, humans).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Owen finally makes it to the head of the line, the afflicted baristaâs people skills falter under pressure and he mauls the store manager. Itâs the first documented zombie attack in months, and it sets the sim-tweets buzzing, ultimately ending in a vigilante killing. As for Owen, he gets more than a free latte out of the incident: Heâs forced to confront the brokenness of his present life by venturing into the past. With the help of a private investigator, he heads into Seattleâs Zombie Town to search for the only woman he has ever loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In âDonât Eat Cat,â some highs are better than a lifetime of being human.</description>

  <description>What can I say to Bangley?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has saved my bacon more times. Saving my bacon is his job. I have the plane, I am the eyes, he has the guns, he is the muscle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows I know he knows: he can't fly, I don't have the stomach for killing. Any other way probably just be one of us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or none.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old "Hank" has found himself at Penn Station in New York City with no memory of anything --who he is, where he came from, why he's running away. His only possession is a worn copy of Walden, by Henry David Thoreau. And so he becomes Henry David-or "Hank" and takes first to the streets, and then to the only destination he can think of--Walden Pond in Concord, Massachusetts. Cal Armistead's remarkable debut novel is about a teen in search of himself. Hank begins to piece together recollections from his past. The only way Hank can discover his present is to face up to the realities of his grievous memories. He must come to terms with the tragedy of his past, to stop running, and to find his way home.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the author of the highly acclaimed &lt;em&gt;A Child&amp;amp;#8217;s Book of True Crime&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;amp;#8220;a brilliant, seductive, and unnerving first novel of sexual betrayal&amp;amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;O, The Oprah Magazine&lt;/em&gt;), comes a dazzling, intense, and erotic second novel set in an isolated mansion in the country.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liese Campbell has an engagement for the weekend: to stay with Alexander Colquhoun, the handsome, well-mannered heir of an Australian pastoral dynasty, at his country seat some hours from Melbourne. Liese is English. She&amp;amp;#8217;s come to Australia to work at her uncle&amp;amp;#8217;s real-estate business and pay off her debts. Alexander has been looking for a place in the city. The luxury apartments Liese shows him have become sets for a relationship that satisfies their fantasies&amp;amp;#8212;and her financial problems. Both players understand the rules. Or so she thinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Across the ancient landscape they drive at dusk to his grand decaying mansion. Here Liese senses a change in Alexander and realizes that a different game has begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chloe Hooper&amp;amp;#8217;s riveting and provocative new novel is a psychological thriller for the modern age, an exploration of the snares of money and love and the dark side of erotic imagination. A trap has been set, but how and why? And for whom?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Read a Sneak Peek below!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;First, the virus took Kaelynâs friends. Then, her family. Now itâs taken away her home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she can't look backâthe life she once had is gone forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A deadly virus has destroyed Kaelynâs small island community and spread beyond the quarantine. No one is safe. But when Kaelyn finds samples of a vaccine in her father's abandoned lab, she knows there must be someone, somewhere, who can replicate it. As Kaelyn and her friends head to the mainland, they encounter a world beyond recognition. Itâs not only the âfriendly fluâ thatâs a killerâthere are people who will stop at nothing to get their hands on the vaccine.  How much will Kaelyn risk for an unproven cure, when the search could either destroy those she loves or save the human race?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Megan Crewe's second volume in the Fallen World trilogy is an action-packed journey that explores the resilience of friendship, the ache of lost love, and Kaelynâs enduring hope in the face of the sacrifices she must make to stay alive.</description>

  <description>Sidney Klein is a professor of poetry, a single father with a poor marital record, when he encounters the young, enigmatic Constance Schuyler at a literary party in 1960s Manhattan. A few weeks later, he proposes marriage, and Constance accepts, moving into his dark, book-filled apartment. But the bride is unhappy, tormented by a bitter past. She has a troubled relationship with her father, a retired doctor upstate, and is desperate for the emotional security Sidney can't fully provide. Perhaps she's made a mistake in marrying him. And then comes a devastating revelation, further jeopardizing the relationship. Sidney can only watch and wait, doubting his own moral strength, as Constance becomes reckless and self-destructive, unhelped by the arrival of her dissolute younger sister. But Constance has formed an unlikely alliance with her small stepson, and he may be the only one who can help them now. &lt;em&gt;Constance&lt;/em&gt; is the story of one family, haunted by a trauma kept secret for decades. It is also the portrait of a marriage under threat, and the allegiance and the courage that can lead us to the light.</description>

  <description>A young boy puts a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. The police don't care - not about his death or the death of his best friend two months earlier. The dead boy's mom seeks help from an old flame that's employed as a detective. What she doesn't know is that he suffers from a physical deformity that manifests at midlife. Will the detective's freakish appearance get in the way of uncovering the terrible secrets of these two teenagers? This collection features additional art by Frank Miller, Mike Mignola, Ryan Sook, and Tonci Zonjic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collects issues #0-#4.</description>

  <description>What do you do when a mission trip suddenly leaves you caught in the middle of a revolution?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Peterson is part of a mission team that has traveled to Costa Verde to rebuild the wall of a school. It's been a great trip-until a revolution breaks out just before they board their plane to go home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then it becomes a desperate race to escape: from a firing squad, from savage animals in the depths of the jungle, from prison cells and revolutionaries with machine guns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the girls is showing Will amazing things about what it means to be truly fearless. And one of the guys has the makings of a real hero. None of them will go home the same. If they only survive.</description>

  <description>A summer's evening in Amsterdam and two couples meet at a fashionable restaurant. Between mouthfuls of food and over the delicate scraping of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of politeness - the banality of work, the triviality of holidays. But the empty words hide a terrible conflict and, with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened... Each couple has a fifteen-year-old son. Together, the boys have committed a horrifying act, caught on camera, and their grainy images have been beamed into living rooms across the nation; despite a police manhunt, the boys remain unidentified - by everyone except their parents. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children and, as civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple shows just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love.</description>

  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THE MISADVENTURES OF FIVE CHARMING TROUBLEMAKERS&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â Â  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anouk Ricardâs &lt;em&gt;Anna and Froga &lt;/em&gt;features the adventures of a little girl named Anna and her gang of animal friends. Annaâs best friend is the titular Froga, and they often hang out with Bubu the dog (an aspiring artist), Christopher the gourmand earthworm, and Ron (a practical joker of a cat). With a sly humor, Ricard spins yarns that will delight and entertain the whole family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether the conflict is driven by eating too many French fries, bossing around Johnny the Tuna, or trying to beat a difficult video game, you know that Anna, Froga, Bubu, Ron, and Christopher will come out all right in the end, which makes the layers of confusion they pile on one another all the funnier. Ricardâs characters are sweet without ever veering into preciousness, as they constantly find opportunities for a laugh at one anotherâs expense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ricard works in a fanciful and childlike style, with vibrant colors and simple story lines. The illustrations in &lt;em&gt;Anna and Froga &lt;/em&gt;are inviting and the stories well told, employing short, snappy dialogue. Without sacrificing quality, intelligence, or humor, AngoulÃªme Festivalânominated author Ricard is able to write from childhood effectively and charmingly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  <description>Over the course of two award-winning collections and a critically acclaimed novel, &lt;em&gt;The Croning&lt;/em&gt;, Laird Barron has arisen as one of the strongest and most original literary voices in modern horror and the dark fantastic. Melding supernatural horror with hardboiled noir, espionage, and a scientific backbone, Barronâs stories have garnered critical acclaim and have been reprinted in numerous yearâs best anthologies and nominated for multiple awards, including the Crawford, International Horror Guild, Shirley Jackson, Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy awards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Barron returns with his third collection, &lt;em&gt;The Beautiful Thing That Awaits Us All.&lt;/em&gt; Collecting interlinking tales of sublime cosmic horror, including âBlackwoodâs Babyâ, âThe Carrion Gods in Their Heavenâ, and âThe Men from Porlockâ, &lt;em&gt;The Beautiful Thing That Awaits Us All&lt;/em&gt; delivers enough spine-chilling horror to satisfy even the most jaded reader.</description>

  <description>A psychedelic fairytale for the modern age, &lt;em&gt;A Greater Monster&lt;/em&gt; is the mind-bending second novel by the author of the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Death by Zamboni&lt;/em&gt;. This darkly poetic tale takes you on a trip into a radically twisted alternate reality that reflects civilization like a funhouse mirror. Along the way, you'll encounter sphinxes, gods, living skeletons, witches, and quite possibly the strangest circus ever imagined. Innovative and astonishing, &lt;em&gt;A Greater Monster&lt;/em&gt; breathes new life into the possibilities of fiction.</description>

  <description>The moon has confounded scientists for many years. It does not obey the known rules of astrophysics and there is no theory of its origin that explains the known facts - in fact it should not really be there. When researching the ancient system of geometry and measurement used in the Stone Age that they discovered in their previous book, "Civilization One", the authors discovered to their great surprise that the system also works perfectly on the Moon! On further investigation, they found a consistent sequence of beautiful integer numbers when looking at every major aspect of the Moon - no pattern emerges for any other planet or moon in the solar system. For example, the Moon revolves at exactly one hundredth of the speed that the Earth turns on its axis; the Moon is exactly 400 times smaller than the Sun and is precisely 400 times closer to the Earth. They also discovered that the Moon possesses little or no heavy metals and has no core, in fact many specialists suspect that the Moon is hollow. If our Moon did not exist - nor would we. Experts are now agreed that higher life only developed on Earth because the Moon is exactly what it is and where it is!&lt;br&gt;When all of the facts are dispassionately reviewed, it becomes unreasonable to cling to the idea that the Moon is a natural object. The only question that remains is who built it? "Thought-provoking" - "Daily Mail".</description>

  <description>Rory Miller had one chance to fight back and she took it. Rory survived and the serial killer who attacked her escaped. Now that the infamous Steven Nell is on the loose, Rory must enter the witness protection program. Entering the program alongside her, is her father and sister Darcy. The trio starts a new life and a new beginning leaving their friends and family behind without a goodbye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting over in a new town with only each other is unimaginable for Rory and Darcy. They were inseparable as children but now they can barely stand each other. As the sisters settle in to Juniper Landing, a picturesque vacation island, it seems like their new home may be just the fresh start they need. They fall in with a group of beautiful, carefree teens and spend their days surfing, partying on the beach, and hiking into endless sunsets. Just as theyâre starting to feel safe again, one of their new friends goes missing. Is it a coincidence? Or is the nightmare beginning all over again?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Dora: A Headcase&lt;/em&gt; is a contemporary coming-of-age story based on Freudâs famous case studyâretold and revamped through Dora's point of view, with shotgun blasts of dark humor and sexual play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ida needs a shrink . . . or so her philandering father thinks, and he sends her to a Seattle psychiatrist. Immediately wise to the head games of her new shrink, whom she nicknames Siggy, Ida begins a coming-of-age journey. At the beginning of her therapy, Ida, whose alter ego is Dora, and her small posse of pals engage in "art attacks." Idaâs in love with her friend Obsidian, but when she gets close to intimacy, she faints or loses her voice. Ida and her friends hatch a plan to secretly film Siggy and make an experimental art film. But something goes wrong at a crucial momentâat a nearby hospital Ida finds her father suffering a heart attack. While Ida loses her voice, a rough cut of her experimental film has gone viral, and unethical media agents are hunting her down. A chase ensues in which everyone wants what Ida has.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Daringly imagined, atmospheric, and original, &lt;em&gt;Wild Girls &lt;/em&gt;is an exhilarating debut&amp;amp;#8212;part coming-of-age story and part supernatural tale about girls learning their own strength. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate Riordan fears two things as she grows up in the small Appalachian town of Swan River: that she&amp;amp;#8217;ll be a frustrated townie forever or that she&amp;amp;#8217;ll turn into one of the mysterious and terrifying wild girls, killers who start fires and menace the community. Struggling to better her chances of escaping, Kate attends the posh Swan River Academy and finds herself divided between her hometown&amp;amp;#8212;and its dark history&amp;amp;#8212;and the realm of privilege and achievement at the Academy. Explosive friendships with Mason, a boy from the wrong side of town, and Willow, a wealthy and popular queen bee from school, are slowly pulling her apart. Kate must decide who she is and where she belongs before she wakes up with cinders at her fingertips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary Stewart Atwell has written a novel that is at once funny and wise and stunningly inventive. Her wild girls are strange and fascinating creatures&amp;amp;#8212;a brilliant twist on the anger teenage girls can feel at their powerlessness&amp;amp;#8212;and a promise of the great things to come from this young writer.</description>

  <description>Back in her hometown, Tori Beaugrand had everything a teenaged girl could wantâpopularity, money, beauty. But she also had a secret. A secret that could change her life in an instant, or destroy it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now sheâs left everything from her old life behind, including her real name and Alison, the one friend who truly understood her. She canât escape who and what she is. But if she wants to have anything like a normal life, she has to blend in and hide her unusual... talents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plans change when the enigmatic Sebastian Faraday reappears and gives Tori some bad news: she hasnât escaped her past. In fact, sheâs attracted new interest in the form of an obsessed ex-cop turned investigator for a genetics lab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has one last shot at getting her enemies off her trail and winning the security and independence sheâs always longed for. But saving herself will take every ounce of Toriâs incredible electronics and engineering skillsâand even then, she may need to sacrifice more than she could possibly imagine if she wants to be free.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"There is very little peace for a man with a body buried in his backyard.â&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it could always be worse. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than a year ago, mild-mannered Jason Getty killed a man he wished heâd never met. Then he planted the problem a little too close to home. But just as heâs learning to live with the undeniable reality of what heâs done, police unearth two bodies on his propertyâneither of which is the one Jason buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason races to stay ahead of the consequences of his crime and while chaos reigns on his lawn, his sanity unravels, snagged on the agendas of a colorful cast of strangers. A jilted woman searches for her lost fiancÃ©, a fringe-dweller runs from a past thatâs quickly gaining on him, and a couple of earnest local detectives piece it together with the help of a volunteer police dog â all of them in the wake and shadow of a dead man who had it coming. As the action unfolds, each discovers that knowing more than one side of the story doesn't necessarily rule out a deadly margin of error.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jamie Mason's irrepressible debut is a macabre, darkly humorous tale with the thoughtful beauty of a literary novel, the tense pacing of a thriller, and a clever twist of suspense.</description>

  <description>Â A series of gruesome attacks have been sweeping New York City. A teacher in Harlem and two sanitation workers on Wall Street are found dead, their swollen bodies nearly dissolved from the inside out. The predator is a deadly supercolony of ants--an army of one trillion soldiers with razor-sharp claws that pierce skin like paper and stinging venom that liquefies its prey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The desperate mayor turns to the greatest ant expert in the world, Paul OâKeefe, a Pulitzer Prizeâwinning scientist in an Armani suit. But Paul is baffled by the ants.Â They are twice the size of any normal ant and have no recognizable DNA. Theyâre vicious in the field yet docile in the hand. Paul calls on the one person he knows can help destroy the colony, his ex-wife Kendra Hart, a spirited entomologist studying fire ants in the New Mexico desert. Kendra is taken to a secret underground bunker in New York City, where she finds herself working side by side with her brilliant but arrogant ex-husband and a high-ranking military officer hell-bent on stopping the insects with a nuclear bomb.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the ants launch an all-out attack, Paul and Kendra hit the dangerous, panic-stricken streets of New York, searching for a coveted queen. Itâs a race to unlock the secrets of an indestructible new species, before the president nukes Manhattan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A.J. Colucci's debut novelÂ is a terrifying mix of classic Michael Crichton and Stephen King.Â A thriller with the highest stakes and the most fascinating science, &lt;em&gt;The Colony&lt;/em&gt; does for ants whatÂ &lt;em&gt;JawsÂ &lt;/em&gt;did for sharks.</description>

  <description>When rebellion destroys the underground world in which Thimble and Stone have grown up, they take Stoneâs son and try to escape the chaos. Along the way, they must evade the Freaks, beings who feed on human flesh. Leaving behind the roles of Builder and Breeder which they were assigned at birth, they wander the underground tunnels, looking for safety yet afraid to go âtopsideâ where legend has it that the light and water will burn their skin from their bones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their journey takes them upward to an unimagined world of tinned food, comfortable furniture, and books. Away from their regimented society for the first time, and still facing imminent danger, Thimble and Stone acknowledge the forbidden attraction which both have denied for years.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Julia Cape: A dedicated classical piano student just trying to get through her last semester of high school while waiting to hear from music conservatories.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reed MacAllister: A slacker more likely to be found by the stonersâ tree than in class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia and Reed might have graduated high school without ever speaking to each otherâ¦until, during a class discussion of Romeo and Juliet, Julia scoffs at the playâs theme of love at first sight, and Reed responds by arguing that feelings donât always have to make sense.  Julia tries to shake off Reedâs comment and forget about this boy who hangs with the stoner crowdâand who happens to have breathtaking blue eyesâbut fate seems to bring the two together again and again.  After they share an impulsive, passionate kiss, neither one can deny the chemistry between them.  Yet as Julia gets closer to Reed, she also finds herself drawn into his dark world of drugs and violence.  Then a horrific tragedy forces Juliaâs and Reedâs families even farther apartâ¦and Julia must decide whether sheâs willing to give up everything for love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Defy the Stars is written in an edgy free-verse style that will appeal to fans of Ellen Hopkins and Lisa Schroeder; however, the writing is accessible enough to speak to non-verse fans as well.  The novelâs combination of steamy romance and raw emotion will appeal to fans of Gayle Forman, Simone Elkeles, Jennifer Echols, and Tammara Webber.  With a story, language and form that both pay homage to and subvert Shakespeareâs play, Defy the Stars is much more than just another Romeo and Juliet story.</description>

  <description>A dark house.&lt;br&gt;An isolated island.&lt;br&gt;Strange dreams &lt;br&gt;and even stranger &lt;br&gt;visions . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack is spending the summer on a private island far from modern conveniences. No Wi-Fi, no cell service, no one else on the island but a housekeeper and the two very peculiar children in his care. The first time Jack sees the huge black mansion atop a windswept hill, he senses something cold, something more sinister than even the dark house itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, he feels terribly isolated and alone. Yet he is not alone. The house has visitorsâpeering in the windows, staring from across the shore. But why doesn't anyone else see them . . . and what do they want? As secrets are revealed and darker truths surface, Jack desperately struggles to maintain a grip on reality. He knows what he sees, and he isn't crazy. . . . Or is he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From nationally acclaimed author Francine Prose comes a mind-bending story that will leave you realizing how subtle the lines that separate reality, imagination, and insanity really are.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Deuceâs whole world has changed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Down below, she was considered an adult. Now, topside in a town called Salvation, sheâs a brat in need of training in the eyes of the townsfolk. She doesn't fit in with the other girls: Deuce only knows how to fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make matters worse, her Hunter partner, Fade, keeps Deuce at a distance. Her feelings for Fade havenât changed, but he seems not to want her around anymore. Confused and lonely, she starts looking for a way out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deuce signs up to serve in the summer patrolsâthose who make sure the planters can work the fields without danger. It should be routine, but things have been changing on the surface, just as they did below ground. The Freaks have grown smarter. Theyâre watching. Waiting. Planning. The monsters donât intend to let Salvation survive, and it may take a girl like Deuce to turn back the tide.</description>

  <description>Reese canât remember anything from the time between the accident and the day she woke up almost a month later. She only knows one thing: Sheâs different now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Across North America, flocks of birds hurl themselves into airplanes, causing at least a dozen to crash. Thousands of people die. Fearing terrorism, the United States government grounds all flights, and millions of travelers are stranded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reese and her debate team partner and longtime crush David are in Arizona when it happens. Everyone knows the world will never be the same. On their drive home to San Francisco, along a stretch of empty highway at night in the middle of Nevada, a bird flies into their headlights. The car flips over. When they wake up in a military hospital, the doctor wonât tell them what happened, where they areâor how theyâve been miraculously healed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things become even stranger when Reese returns home. San Francisco feels like a different place with police enforcing curfew, hazmat teams collecting dead birds, and a strange presence that seems to be following her. When Reese unexpectedly collides with the beautiful Amber Gray, her search for the truth is forced in an entirely new directionâand threatens to expose a vast global conspiracy that the government has worked for decades to keep secret.</description>

  <description>Since prehistory, humans have braved sharp knives, fire, and grindstones to transform raw ingredients into something deliciousâor at least edible. Tools shape what we eat, but they have also transformed how we consume, and how we think about, our food. Technology in the kitchen does not just mean the Pacojets and sous-vide of the modernist kitchen. It can also mean the humbler tools of everyday cooking and eating: a wooden spoon and a skillet, chopsticks and forks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Consider the Fork, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson provides a wonderful and witty tour of the evolution of cooking around the world, revealing the hidden history of everyday objects we often take for granted. Knivesâperhaps our most important gastronomic toolâpredate the discovery of fire, whereas the fork endured centuries of ridicule before gaining widespread acceptance; pots and pans have been around for millennia, while plates are a relatively recent invention. Many once-new technologies have become essential elements of any well-stocked kitchenâmortars and pestles, serrated knives, stainless steel pots, refrigerators. Others have proved only passing fancies, or were supplanted by better technologies; one would be hard pressed now to find a water-powered egg whisk, a magnet-operated spit roaster, a cider owl, or a turnspit dog. Although many tools have disappeared from the modern kitchen, they have left us with traditions, tastes, and even physical characteristics that we would never have possessed otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending history, science, and anthropology, Wilson reveals how our culinary tools and tricks came to be, and how their influence has shaped modern food culture. The story of how we have tamed fire and ice and wielded whisks, spoons, and graters, all for the sake of putting food in our mouths, Consider the Fork is truly a book to savor.</description>

  <description>The Woman is the last of her kind, the lone survivor of a tribe of feral cannibals who have terrorized the Maine coast for years. She is wounded and weak, but she's found refuge in a cave overlooking the sea. Christopher Cleek is an amoralâand unstableâlawyer who sees her bathing in a stream one day while he's out hunting. Cleek has dark, cruel secrets and he will now add one more. He will capture the Woman, lock her in his cellar, and attempt to &lt;em&gt;tame &lt;/em&gt;her, with the help of his wife and children. But very soon the question will become:Â Who is more savage, the hunter or the prey?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; The brilliant new thriller from the author of the critically acclaimed debut, &lt;em&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul was led into a life of crime by his boyhood protector, a bully named Daniel; but one night, what started as a petty theft turned into a grisly murder. Now, at nineteen, Paul must bear witness against his friend to avoid prison. Louisa's own dark secrets led her to flee a desperate infatuation gone wrong many years before. Now she spends her days steeped in history, renovating the grounds of a crumbling Elizabethan garden. But her fragile peace is shattered when she meets Paul; he's the spitting image of the one person she never thought she'd see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These two, scarred and solitary, begin a secret affair. Louisa starts to believe she can again find the happiness she had given up on. But neither of them can outrun his violent past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story of secrets and guilt set among the ruins of a sixteenth- century English garden, &lt;em&gt;The Dark Rose&lt;/em&gt; explores the extremes of obsessive love and loyalty, devotion and desperation. Like Kelly's critically acclaimed debut novel, &lt;em&gt;The Poison Tree&lt;/em&gt;, this fantastically creepy, atmospheric novel thrills until the final shocking moments.</description>

  <description>If the melt-down, flood, plague, the third World War, new Ice Age, Rapture, alien invasion, clamp-down, meteor, or something else entirely hit today, what would tomorrow look like? Some of the biggest names in YA and adult literature answer that very question in this short story anthology, each story exploring the lives of teen protagonists raised in catastropheâs wakeâwhether set in the days after the change, or decades far in the future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling authors Gregory Maguire, Garth Nix, Susan Beth Pfeffer, Carrie Ryan, Beth Revis, and Jane Yolen are among the many popular and award-winning storytellers lending their talents to this original and spellbinding anthology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction&lt;br&gt;The Segment by Genevieve Valentine&lt;br&gt;After the Cure by Carrie Ryan&lt;br&gt;Valedictorian by N.K.

  <description>Is Epstein a despicable man?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's certainly trying desperately at something. When his wife disappears he's frantic to talk to his daughter. But what can he tell her? There must be a reason and he's all but sure about the gruesome answer. Can he protect Sylvia from the truth, from her terrible lineage and, ultimately, from himself?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Off-beat and sordid, The Blood Poetry is a twisted, yet honest look at our desire to connect with others and the ways in which we are often stymied by our own efforts to get closer. Epstein is a curious mix of monster and romantic struggling to maintain a shred of dignity in his dingy, beat down world.</description>

  <description>Named on Booklist's 2013 Top 10 Horror Fiction&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Named by NPR Boston as one of the ten best books of 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is juicy material for Franken-fans, and Zeltserman is just faithful enough to the original that his many fresh contributions feel entirely normal. Well, abnormal, to be accurate, but deliciously so." Daniel Kraus, Booklist, starred review&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This reworking of Frankenstein is chilling and captivating! ...A tale of justice, true love, and ultimate forgiveness, this gruesome novel is perfect for fans of Stephen King and similar horror stories." ForeWord Magazine, pick of the week&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"a rich and fun response to Shelley's classic" Publisher's Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"More impressively, Zeltserman's plot maps almost perfectly onto the plot of Shelley's novel â the key word being "almost." In its departures, the novel provides more than its cover price in entertainment. Vampyres abound, as do Satanic cults and the Marquis de Sade, preparing to enact the 120 Days of Sodom in a remote mountain castle. You don't get much more gothic bang for your buck." Los Angeles Times&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The supernatural, unmissable new novel by the ALA Best Horror award nominee. In nineteenth-century Germany, one young man counts down the days until he can marry his beloved . . . until she is found brutally murdered, and the young man is accused of the crime. Broken on the wheel and left for dead, he awakens on a lab table, transformed into an abomination. Friedrich must go far to take his revenge --only to find his tormentor, Victor Frankenstein, in league with the Marquis de Sade, creating something much more sinister deep in the mountains. Paranormal and gripping in the tradition of the best work of Stephen King and Justin Cronin, &lt;em&gt;Monster&lt;/em&gt; is a gruesome parable of control and vengeance, and an ingenious tribute to one of literature's greatest</description>

  <description>Life for Kansas was perfect until the day the world changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has been hiding out for four years in solitude. It's the only way to survive. The only way not to draw the living dead. Helping a small group of people, she learns the new world might not be what she assumes. Venturing out of her refuge and comfort zone, she meets Rudy, who helps her find a greater purpose. She realizes that the world has moved on without her. Only it's not what she expects. Her knowledge of the living dead grows and only makes her more curious as humanity continues to hang on by a thread. While on her search for answers she finds comfort in new friendships and love, but her past seems as if it will haunt her forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kansas takes it upon herself to help other survivors, which would be easy if the famished were the only obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a trilogy plot thick with twists and turns, this adult dark fantasy is emotional as much as it is horrifyingly gripping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Not intended for a young audience. Mature content.*</description>

  <description>âThe Morrow Secretsâ is a high-fantasy gothic adventure story written for children in the 10 to 14 year age group but also enjoyed by adults who love delving into the world of mystery, suspense, imagination and make-believe. It is the first book in a series about Tallitha Mouldson, a headstrong girl caught up in the sinister web of her eccentric family, the powerful Morrow dynasty. This fantasy saga is set in an alternative world and begins in a strange, rambling house called Winderling Spires in the land of Wycham Elva. The Morrow Secrets is an epic tale of dark forces, with a beguiling mystery to be solved, an exciting yarn of deception with frightening twists and wicked turns. The story has weird, whimsical characters, some motivated by wicked intent. They lurk round corners... watching Tallitha and luring her further into the dreadful secret....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a story of the heroineâs fight against the evil forces that have shaped the past and still surround her present. Tallitha is determined to unearth the family secret and so begins her breath-taking adventure, exploring the forbidden floors of the bizarre old house and discovering a number of intriguing clues which lead her ever further into the heart of the mystery. During her quest, Tallitha discovers she has inherited strange paranormal powers, passed down the female line of the Morrow clan. With the help of her eccentric cousin Esmerelda, Tallitha escapes the clutches of her suffocating family and makes her way across the dangerous terrain of Wycham Elva into the wilderness and the dark world of Breedoor. Accompanied by her brother and cousins she learns more about the mysterious past of the Morrow family, she forges new allegiances, endures terrifying challenges and encounters the strange creatures of the underground kingdom.

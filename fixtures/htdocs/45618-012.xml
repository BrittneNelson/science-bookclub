  <description>The year is 1856, and orphan Abigail Tamper lives below stairs in Greave Hall, a crumbling manor house in London. Lord Greave is plagued by madness, and with his son Samuel away fighting in the Crimea, the running of Greave Hall is left to Mrs Cotton, the tyrannical housekeeper. The only solace for the beleaguered staff is to frighten Mrs Cotton by pretending the house is haunted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when a real ghost makes an appearance - that of her beloved mother - no one is more surprised than Abi. But the spirit has a revelation that threatens to destroy Abi’s already fragile existence: she was murdered, and by someone under their very own roof. With Samuel returned to England badly wounded, it’s up to Abi to nurse him back to health, while trying to discover the identity of the killer in their midst. As the chilling truth dawns, Abi’s world is turned upside down.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mark Twain meets classic Stephen King--a bold new direction for widely acclaimed Edgar Award winner Joe R. Lansdale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May Lynn was once a pretty girl who dreamed of becoming a Hollywood star. Now she's dead, her body dredged up from the Sabine River.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sue Ellen, May Lynn's strong-willed teenage friend, sets out to dig up May Lynn's body, burn it to ash, and take those ashes to Hollywood to spread around. If May Lynn can't become a star, then at least her ashes will end up in the land of her dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with her friends Terry and Jinx and her alcoholic mother, Sue Ellen steals a raft and heads downriver to carry May Lynn's remains to Hollywood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only problem is, Sue Ellen has some stolen money that her enemies will do anything to get back. And what looks like a prime opportunity to escape from a worthless life will instead lead to disastrous consequences. In the end, Sue Ellen will learn a harsh lesson on just how hard growing up can really be.</description>

  <description>The White House Games is the story of what happens when a group of ex-Navy SEALs take matters into their own hands in order to change the direction of American politics. Taking a leaf from the Arab Spring movement of 2011, these Special Operators decide on a once-in-a-lifetime mission to create a brand new America, one that would be a 'more perfect union' which the Founding Fathers had hoped a future generation would build.   Using Special-Ops cyberwarfare technology and social-media power, they launch a battle against the powers-that-be in a high-stakes game to create America 2.0.   For centuries, the citizens of various empires have cried, "Let the games begin!" Finally, in this novel, the people's cry is answered. We, the people, at last are going to be players in the ultimate reality-game for the ultimate power. Harnessing the power of new technology, all of us are invited to be the new Founding Fathers and Mothers. We are going to play The White House Games.</description>

  <description>A fashion model named Charlotte Swenson emerges from a car accident in her Illinois hometown with her face so badly shattered that it takes eighty titanium screws to reassemble it. She returns to New York still beautiful but oddly unrecognizable, a virtual stranger in the world she once effortlessly occupied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlotte’s narrative is interwoven with those of other casualties of society's infatuation with the image. There’s a deceptively plain teenaged girl embarking on a dangerous secret life, an alcoholic private eye, and an enigmatic stranger who changes names and accents as he prepares an apocalyptic blow against American society. These narratives converge in this  intellectual thriller of identity and imposture.</description>

  <description>Set mainly in Ireland, Jennifer Lash's dark, exhilarating novel is about the redemptive power of love. It tells of Violet Farr and her loveless marriage, her wild, unfathomable son and his illegitimate son, all of them bound together in a repeating pattern of exile and homecoming, rejection and, finally, acknowledgement and love. As Elizabeth Buchan wrote in the London &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, "Jennifer Lash is a Lawrentian in so far as she mines her material for the blood and thunder roaring between spouses, and between parents and children."&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>FOR RENT: Top two floors of beautifully renovated brownstone, 1300 sq. ft., 2BR 2BA, eat-in kitchen, one block to parks and playgrounds. No broker’s fee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Susan and Alex Wendt have found their dream apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, the landlady is a little eccentric. And the elderly handyman drops some cryptic remarks about the basement. But the rent is so low, it’s too good to pass up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big mistake. Susan soon discovers that her new home is crawling with bedbugs . . . or is it? She awakens every morning with fresh bites, but neither Alex nor their daughter Emma has a single welt. An exterminator searches the property and turns up nothing. The landlady insists her building is clean. Susan fears she’s going mad—until a more sinister explanation presents itself: she may literally be confronting the bedbug problem from Hell.</description>

  <description>The world of Theorrey runs like a well-oiled machine. The elements are in balance, passion is tamed, and the young queen is the heartbeat of it all. But in these two all-new stories of elemental steam, nothing is ever as it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earthly Desires&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demeter “Dare” Senedal is the Queen’s Chalice-her protector and closest companion. So when the queen goes missing, Dare rushes to locate her, even though the search leads her straight into trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gentleman who trades in secrets and sin, Bodhan revels in carnal delights, but when a naked and bound woman appears on his shore, he finds his hunger to possess at odds with his need to protect. As Bodhan shares his knowledge of pleasure, Dare must decide if she can trust him, both with her mission and her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiery Temptations&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seraphina always lands on her feet. After all, she is a Felidae-more feline than human-and an excellent thief. There has never been a job Phina wouldn’t take or a man who could tame her…until she meets Cyrus Arendal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Queen’s Sword, Cyrus should have known better than to fall victim to a beautiful bandit. Now, to find and retrieve the moonfire dagger, he’ll need to convince Phina not to judge a man by his station, but rather by how completely he can satisfy her desires.</description>

  <description>I'm sitting on my couch, watching the local news. There's Chloe's parents, the mayor, the hangers on, all grouped round the pond for the ceremony. It's ten years since Chloe and Carl drowned, and they've finally chosen a memorial-a stupid summerhouse. The mayor has a spade decked out in pink and white ribbon, and he's started to dig.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can tell from their faces that something has gone wrong. But I'm the one who knows straightaway that the mayor has found a body. And I know who it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the tale of two fourteen-year-old girls, best friends, and one terrible summer when lies, secrets, jealousy, and perversion ended in tragedy more tangled and evil than a tight-knit community can possibly believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dark tale with a surreal edge, Jenn Ashworth's gripping novel captures the intensity of girls' friendships and the dangers of a predatory adult world they are just grown up enough to think they can handle. And it shows just how far that world will go, sacrificing truth in the name of innocence.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Life As We Knew It&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; in a mall that looks just like yours&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A biological bomb has just been discovered in the air ducts of a busy suburban mall. At first nobody knows if it's even life threatening, but then the entire complex is quarantined, people start getting sick, supplies start running low, and there's no way out. Among the hundreds of trapped shoppers are four teens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These four different narrators, each with their own stories, must cope in unique, surprising styles, changing in ways they wouldn't have predicted, trying to find solace, safety, and escape at a time when the adults are behaving badly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a gripping look at people and how they can--and must--change under the most dire of circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And not always for the better.</description>

  <description>Beware of Long Lankin, that lives in the moss. . . .When Cora and her younger sister, Mimi, are sent to stay with their elderly aunt in the isolated village of Byers Guerdon, they receive a less than warm welcome. Auntie Ida is eccentric and rigid, and the girls are desperate to go back to London. But what they don't know is that their aunt's life was devastated the last time two young sisters were at Guerdon Hall, and she is determined to protect her nieces from an evil that has lain hidden for years. Along with Roger and Peter, two village boys, Cora must uncover the horrifying truth that has held Bryers Guerdon in its dark grip for centuries -- before it's too late for little Mimi. Riveting and intensely atmospheric, this stunning debut will hold readers in its spell long after the last page is turned.</description>

James' bestselling &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young, arrogant, tycoon Earl Grey seduces the naïve coed Anna Steal with his overpowering good looks and staggering amounts of money, but will she be able to get past his fifty shames, including shopping at Walmart on Saturdays, bondage with handcuffs, and his love of BDSM (Bards, Dragons, Sorcery, and Magick)?

  <description>&lt;em&gt;No parents. No rules. No way home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourteen-year-old Bonnie MacDonald couldn't be more excited for a camping trip on an island off the coast of Thailand. But when a strong current sweeps Bonnie and her friends past their appointed campsite, depositing them instead on what the boatman calls a "forbidden island," they're just happy to have reached dry land.&lt;br&gt;Overnight, things take a turn for the worse. Three torturous days pass, but the boatman doesn't return, and what once seemed like a vacation in paradise becomes a battle against the elements.&lt;br&gt;Peppered with short, frantic entries from Bonnie's journal as she struggles to survive, &lt;em&gt;Lost Girls&lt;/em&gt; tells the page-turning, heart-pounding story of a group of teen girls fighting for their lives.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Author's Note: As of 09/11/2012 the novella has been edited. Grammatical errors only exist in older versions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if all you knew about fairy tales was wrong?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book description of Snow White Blood Red: A Grimm Diaries Prequel as told by the Snow White Queen:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have always wondered why you never asked about my name. Was I so superficial to you? So stereotypical and mundane? Why did you treat me as if I were just the monster of the week? You know what I think? You never had the time to really hate me. You wanted to hate me, long before you even met me. You wanted to scrape my existence and avenge your childhood princess by laying all blame on me. What if they didn’t call me the Evil Queen, what if I told you the real story from my point of view instead of hers, would you ever think of me as an angel? Could I ever make you care? I know that deep inside of you, you adore me,but you’re just scared, afraid to admit how much you love the Snow White Queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Grimm Diaries Prequels are a number of short books in the form of epistolary diary entries. The diaries are more of teasers for the upcoming series: The Grimm Diaries, allowing you to get a glimpse of what to expect of the series.</description>

  <description>Don't Sweat. Don't Laugh. Don't draw attention to yourself. And most of all, whatever you do, do not fall in love with one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gene is different from everyone else around him. He can't run with lightning speed, sunlight doesn't hurt him and he doesn't have an unquenchable lust for blood. Gene is a human, and he knows the rules. Keep the truth a secret. It's the only way to stay alive in a world of night--a world where humans are considered a delicacy and hunted for their blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he's chosen for a once in a lifetime opportunity to hunt the last remaining humans, Gene's carefully constructed life begins to crumble around him. He's thrust into the path of a girl who makes him feel things he never thought possible--and into a ruthless pack of hunters whose suspicions about his true nature are growing. Now that Gene has finally found something worth fighting for, his need to survive is stronger than ever--but is it worth the cost of his humanity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""</description>

  <description>Penelope (Lo) Marin has always loved to collect beautiful things. Her dad's consulting job means she's grown up moving from one rundown city to the next, and she's learned to cope by collecting (sometimes even stealing) quirky trinkets and souvenirs in each new place--possessions that allow her to feel at least some semblance of home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the year since her brother Oren's death, Lo's hoarding has blossomed into a full-blown, potentially dangerous obsession. She discovers a beautiful, antique butterfly pendant during a routine scour at a weekend flea market, and recognizes it as having been stolen from the home of a recently murdered girl known only as "Sapphire"--a girl just a few years older than Lo. As usual when Lo begins to obsess over something, she can't get the murder out of her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she attempts to piece together the mysterious "butterfly clues," with the unlikely help of a street artist named Flynt, Lo quickly finds herself caught up in a seedy, violent underworld much closer to home than she ever imagined--a world, she'll ultimately discover, that could hold the key to her brother's tragic death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Fascinating. Ellison has the art of page-turning down flat, and readers will be swept up by both the terror—and the romance.”&lt;br&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;, Starred Review&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“This book casts a spell over its readers.”—&lt;em&gt;SLJ&lt;/em&gt;, Starred Review&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“An engaging mystery starring a teen girl with obsessive-compulsive disorder. A pleasing mix of realism, tension, intrigue and romance.”&lt;br&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;“ . . . a strong, twisty thriller of a debut . . . [with] a complex and memorable heroine.”—&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Lo’s relationship with the mysterious street boy who calls himself Flynt, layered on top of her almost supernatural loneliness and helpless compulsions, gives the novel an otherworldly quality.”—&lt;em&gt;VOYA&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;“A debut worth picking up. Stark and realistic.”—&lt;em&gt;RTBooks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also available in simultaneous e-book edition (ISBN 978-1-60684-268-3)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Dinosaur doesn't need to use the potty. Even when he's making lemonade, running through the sprinkler, having a three-juice-box lunch, and splashing in rain puddles. See? He's doing his victory dance. Wait . . . that's not a victory dance, that looks like a POTTY DANCE! Run, Dinosaur, run! &lt;em&gt;Dinosaur vs. the Potty&lt;/em&gt;, with humor that both toddlers and parents will enjoy, is a great new way to toilet train. Dinosaur's stubborn resistance--and Potty's ultimate victory--will evoke roars of laughter.</description>

  <description>The Apocalypse does not end. The Changed will grow in numbers. The Spared may not survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even before the EMPs brought down the world, Alex was on the run from the demons of her past and the monster living in her head. After the world was gone, she believed Rule could be a sanctuary for her and those she’d come to love.&lt;br&gt;But she was wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Alex is in the fight of her life against the adults, who would use her, the survivors, who don’t trust her, and the Changed, who would eat her alive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, the second book in the haunting apocalyptic Ashes Trilogy: where no one is safe and humans may be the worst of the monsters.</description>

  <description>New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., have been abandoned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bill of Rights has been revoked, and replaced with the Moral Statutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no more police—instead, there are soldiers. There are no more fines for bad behavior—instead, there are arrests, trials, and maybe worse. People who get arrested usually don't come back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ember Miller is old enough to remember that things weren't always this way. Living with her rebellious single mother, it's hard for her to forget that people weren't always arrested for reading the wrong books or staying out after dark. It's hard to forget that life in the United States used to be different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ember has perfected the art of keeping a low profile. She knows how to get the things she needs, like food stamps and hand-me-down clothes, and how to pass the random home inspections by the military. Her life is as close to peaceful as circumstances allow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until her mother is arrested for noncompliance with Article 5 of the Moral Statutes. And one of the arresting officers is none other than Chase Jennings—the only boy Ember has ever loved.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It's been decades since anyone set foot on the moon. Now three ordinary teenagers, the winners of NASA's unprecedented, worldwide lottery, are about to become the first young people in space--and change their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;Mia, from Norway, hopes this will be her punk band's ticket to fame and fortune.&lt;br&gt;Midori believes it's her way out of her restrained life in Japan.&lt;br&gt;Antoine, from France, just wants to get as far away from his ex-girlfriend as possible.&lt;br&gt;It's the opportunity of a lifetime, but little do the teenagers know that something sinister is waiting for them on the desolate surface of the moon. And in the black vacuum of space... no one is coming to save them.&lt;br&gt;In this chilling adventure set in the most brutal landscape known to man, highly acclaimed Norwegian novelist Johan Harstad creates a vivid and frightening world of possibilities we can only hope never come true.</description>

  <description>One of the most acclaimed modern American novelists, Scott Spencer captures the intensity of human passion—and its capacity to both destroy and redeem—with unparalleled precision and insight. Now, in his most stunning novel yet, this wry, witty, and deeply sensitive writer returns to the territory of his &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;A Ship Made of Paper&lt;/em&gt;, in a gripping and provocative psychological thriller of morality and manhood, choice and fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paul has been on his own since he was a teenager, leading a life of freedom and independence, beholden to no one and nothing. Fearless, resolute, and guided by his own private moral code, he has hunted for food in Alaska, fought forest fires, and been deputized in a manhunt for a kidnapper in South Dakota.Once he thought his life would have no particular rhyme or reason, touched only by transient strangers. Then he meets the beautiful, intelligent, loving Kate Ellis and her daughter, Ruby, who offer order and constancy. But Paul is a man of deep convictions, and the compromises we all make to get along in the world elude him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On his way home after rejecting a job remodeling a luxurious Manhattan apartment, Paul stops to gather his thoughts at a state park just off the highway. Instead of peace, he finds a man savagely beating a dog, and in a few fateful moments Paul is plunged into a world of violence and onto a tumultuous journey of self-knowledge, guilt, and redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the psychological acuity and razor-sharp prose for which he has been celebrated, award-winning, bestselling novelist Scott Spencer once again takes us on an unforgettable journey of manhood lost and found.</description>

  <description>On a scorching hot summer day in Elkwood, Alabama, Claire Lambert staggers naked, wounded, and half-blind away from the scene of an atrocity. She is the sole survivor of a nightmare that claimed her friends, and even as she prays for rescue, the killers — a family of cannibalistic lunatics — are closing in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder returns from Iraq to the news that his brother is among the murdered in Elkwood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In snowbound Detroit, a waitress trapped in an abusive relationship gets an unexpected visit that will lead to bloodshed and send her back on the road to a past she has spent years trying to outrun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Claire, the only survivor of the Elkwood Massacre, haunted by her dead friends, dreams of vengeance... a dream which will be realized as grief and rage turn good people into cold-blooded murderers and force alliances among strangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's time to return to Elkwood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the spirit of such iconic horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance, Kin begins at the end and studies the possible aftermath for the survivors of such traumas upon their return to the real world — the guilt, the grief, the thirst for revenge — and sets them on an unthinkable journey... back into the heart of darkness.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Willo was out hunting when the trucks came and took his family away. Left alone in the snow, Willo becomes determined to find and rescue his family, and he knows just who to talk with to learn where they are. He plans to head across the mountains and make Farmer Geraint tell him where his family has gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on the way across the mountain, he finds Mary, a refugee from the city, whose father is lost and who is starving to death. The smart thing to do would be to leave her alone -- he doesn't have enough supplies for two or the time to take care of a girl -- but Willo just can't do it. However, with the world trapped in an ice age, the odds of them surviving on their own are not good. And even if he does manage to keep Mary safe, what about finding his family?.</description>

  <description>Fifteen-year-old Billy Ballard is the kid that everyone picks on, from the school bullies to the teachers. But things change drastically when Death tells Billy he must stand in as Pestilence, the White Rider of the Apocalypse. Now armed with a Bow that allows him to strike with disease from a distance, Billy lashes out at his tormentors...and accidentally causes an outbreak of meningitis. Horrified by his actions, Billy begs Death to take back the Bow. For that to happen, says Death, Billy must track down the real White Rider—who is lost in his memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his search, Billy travels through White Rider’s life: from ancient Phrygia, where the man called King Mita agrees to wear the White Rider’s Crown, to Sherwood Forest, where Pestilence figures out how to cheat Death; from the docks of Alexandria, where cartons of infested grain are being packed onto a ship that will carry the plague, to the Children’s Crusade in France—all the way to what may be the end of the world. When Billy finally finds the White Rider, the teen convinces the man to return to the real world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now the insane White Rider plans to unleash something awful on humanity—something that could make the Black Death look like a summer cold. Billy has a choice: he can live his life and pretend he doesn’t know what’s coming, or he can challenge the White Rider for his Crown. Does one bullied teenager have the strength to stand his ground—and the courage to save the world?</description>

  <description>The prequel to Nina-Marie Gardner's critically acclaimed debut, "Sherry &amp;amp; Narcotics." A cautionary tale of love and loss-beautiful, raw and heart-wrenchingly honest. "I'm Not This Girl" chronicles the hair-raising journey of shy outsider Lulu, who with her faithful mutt Trouble seeks for meaning, identity and redemption in a world turned upside down by her own catastrophic personality. From the hipster enclave of Hollywood's Silver Lake Hills, to Manhattan at the peak of the dot com boom and bust; through the aftermath of 9/11, to a psychiatric hospital in the Arizona desert, only when Lulu finds her way back to London, the city where she was born, does she come to terms with the truth she's been running from.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Winner of FC2’s American Book Review/Ronald Sukenick Innovative Fiction Prize &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A monogrammed cube appears in your town. Your landlord cheats you out of first place in the annual Christmas decorating contest. You need to learn how to love and care for your mate—a paring knife. These situations and more reveal the wondrous play and surreal humor that make up the stories in Amelia Gray’s stunning collection of stories: &lt;em&gt;Museum of the Weird&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acerbic wit and luminous prose mark these shorts, while sickness and death lurk amidst the humor. Characters find their footing in these bizarre scenarios and manage to fall into redemption and rebirth. &lt;em&gt;Museum of the Weird&lt;/em&gt; invites you into its hallways, then beguiles, bewitches, and reveals a writer who has discovered a manner of storytelling all her own.</description>

  <description>Everything is in ruins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A devastating plague has decimated the population, and those who are left live in fear of catching it as the city crumbles around them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So what does Araby Worth have to live for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nights in the Debauchery Club, beautiful dresses, glittery makeup . . . and tantalizing ways to forget it all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the depths of the club--in the depths of her own despair--Araby will find more than oblivion. She will find Will, the terribly handsome proprietor of the club, and Elliott, the wickedly smart aristocrat. Neither is what he seems. Both have secrets. Everyone does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Araby may find not just something to live for, but something to fight for--no matter what it costs her.</description>

  <description>&amp;amp;#8226; Exciting new literary talent: At just twenty-nine years old, Brian DeLeeuw has worked in publishing in both London and New York City, where he is an editor at the literary magazine &lt;em&gt;Tin House&lt;/em&gt; . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp;#8226; Haunting subject: A dark, compelling story that skirts the edges of the supernatural, &lt;em&gt;In This Way I Was Saved &lt;/em&gt; evokes the best in edgy, psychological horror with overtones of eerie, cerebral pyrotechnics. With its dense web of family secrets, its undercurrent of violence, and its brilliant evocation of a troubled young person&amp;amp;#8217;s point of view, it has earned comparisons to Donna Tartt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp;#8226; Compelling story: Set in the wealthy environs of New York City&amp;amp;#8217;s Central Park West, the story &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; begins in 1994, when Luke Nightingale is six and his parents are finalizing their divorce. Luke&amp;amp;#8217;s fragile, volatile mother Claire is the last daughter of a crumbling, blueblood family; her mother died by her own hand. A novel about mothers and sons, the dangers of the imagination, the precariousness of sanity, the terrors of childhood, and the temptations of power&amp;amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;In This Way I Was Saved &lt;/em&gt; is a stunning debut by a writer of limitless promise.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An Emmy Award-winning writer for &lt;em&gt;The Colbert Report&lt;/em&gt; follows in the (big) footsteps of &lt;em&gt;Bigfoot: I Not Dead&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monsters have it tough. Besides being deeply misunderstood, they suffer from very real problems: Mummies have body image issues, Godzilla is going through an existential crisis, and creatures from the black lagoon face discrimination from creatures from the white lagoon. At heart, these monsters are human; after all, you are what you eat. Quirkily illustrated, &lt;em&gt;Sad Monsters&lt;/em&gt; hilariously documents the trials and tribulations of all the undead creatures monster-mad readers have grown to love, from vampires and werewolves, to chupacabras and sphinxes, and even claw-footed bathtubs.</description>

  <description>Thirty-year-old Zoe leads an ordinary life until the end of the world arrives. She is cleaning cages and floors at Pope Pharmaceuticals when the President of the United States announces that human beings are no longer a viable species. When Zoe realizes that everyone she loves is disappearing, she starts running. Scared and alone in a shockingly changed world, she embarks on a remarkable journey of survival and redemption. Along the way, Zoe comes to see that humans are not defined by their genetic code, but rather by their actions and choices. White Horse offers hope for a broken world, where love can lead to the most unexpected places.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Read a Sneak Peek below!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;It starts with an itch you just can't shake.  Then comes a fever and a tickle in your throat.  A few days later, you'll be blabbing your secrets and chatting with strangers like they’re old friends.  Three more, and the paranoid hallucinations kick in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then you're dead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When sixteen-year-old Kaelyn lets her best friend leave for school without saying goodbye, she never dreams that she might not see him again.  But then a strange virus begins to sweep through her small island community, infecting young and old alike.  As the dead pile up, the government quarantines the island: no one can leave, and no one can come back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those still healthy must fight for the island’s dwindling supplies, or lose all chance of survival. As everything familiar comes crashing down, Kaelyn joins forces with a former rival and discovers a new love in the midst of heartbreak. When the virus starts to rob her of friends and family, she clings to the belief that there must be a way to save the people she holds dearest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because how will she go on if there isn't?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poignant and dizzying, The Way We Fall is the heart-wrenching story of one girl's bravery and unbeatable spirit as she challenges not just her fears, but her sense of what makes life worth living.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Both a rip-roaring adventure series set in pre-World War I Paris and a parody of same, Adèle Blanc-Sec has been enchanting, thrilling, and puzzling readers worldwide through four decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With various American attempts to publish Adèle having dribbled into nothing decades ago, Fantagraphics Books, fresh from its triumphs with Tardi’s &lt;strong&gt;West Coast Blues&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;You Are There&lt;/strong&gt;, launches a spectacular, newly re-translated, hardcover series that intends to collect every one of its nine (soon ten) volumes.&lt;br&gt;In this premiere installment, Adèle becomes involved in an interlocking series of mysteries that involve a revived pterodactyl, a frightful on-stage murder, a looming execution by guillotine, and a demon from the depths of hell — plus of course moronic gendarmes, loyal (or perhaps traitorous?) henchmen, and a climax atop the Eiffel Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adèle Blanc-Sec series is currently being adapted into a series of films by the renowned action director Luc Besson (&lt;strong&gt;The Professional, The Fifth Element&lt;/strong&gt;), bringing this quirky, very French series to a new worldwide audience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>At once a sensual and irresistible mystery and a haunting work of psychological insight and emotional depth,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The Whole World marks the beginning of a brilliant literary career for Emily Winslow, a superb, limitlessly gifted author.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Set in the richly evoked pathways and environs of Cambridge, England, The Whole World unearths the desperate secrets kept by its many complex characters—students, professors, detectives, husbands, mothers—secrets that lead to explosive consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two Americans studying at Cambridge University, Polly and Liv, both strangers to their new home, both survivors of past mistakes, become quick friends. They find a common interest in Nick, a handsome, charming, seemingly guileless graduate student. For a time, the three engage in harmless flirtation, growing closer while doing research for professor Gretchen Paul, the blind daughter of a famed novelist. But a betrayal, followed by Nick’s inexplicable disappearance, brings long-buried histories to the surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation raises countless questions, and the newspapers report all the most salacious details—from the crime that scars Polly’s past to the searing truths concealed in photographs Gretchen cannot see. Soon the three young lovers will discover how little they know about one another, and how devastating the ripples of long-ago actions can be.</description>

  <description>Recently laid off, Jack Heart uses his time away from work to fulfill a lifelong dream: hiking the Appalachian Trail. In winter. After fighting off a sickly black bear, Jack decides to take a break from the Trail. However, he quickly realizes his problems are much greater than rogue wildlife. A toxic beef supply has turned millions of people into flesh hungry corpses, and cities are putting themselves under quarantine. Hundreds of miles from home with no food and trapped by vigilantes, Jack Heart descends into a desperate, violent place in order to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Twelve timeless Ozarkian tales of those on the fringes of society, by a "stunningly original" (&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;) American master.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daniel Woodrell is able to lend uncanny logic to harsh, even criminal behavior in this wrenching collection of stories. Desperation-both material and psychological--motivates his characters. A husband cruelly avenges the killing of his wife's pet; an injured rapist is cared for by a young girl, until she reaches her breaking point; a disturbed veteran of Iraq is murdered for his erratic behavior; an outsider's house is set on fire by an angry neighbor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is also the tenderness and loyalty of the vulnerable in these stories--between spouses, parents and children, siblings, and comrades in arms-which brings the troubled, sorely tested cast of characters to vivid, relatable life. And, as ever, "the music coming from Woodrell's banjo cannot be confused with the sounds of any other writer" (Donald Harington, &lt;em&gt;Atlanta Journal Constitution&lt;/em&gt;).</description>

  <description>For as long as Josephine Alibrandi can remember, it’s just been her, her mom, and her grandmother. Now it’s her final year at a wealthy Catholic high school. The nuns couldn’t be any stricter—but that doesn’t seem to stop all kinds of men from coming into her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught between the old-world values of her Italian grandmother, the nononsense wisdom of her mom, and the boys who continue to mystify her, Josephine is on the ride of her life. This will be the year she falls in love, the year she discovers the secrets of her family’s past—and the year she sets herself free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told with unmatched depth and humor, this novel—which swept the pool of Australian literary awards and became a major motion picture—is one to laugh through and cry with, to cherish and remember.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In a mysterious world of isolation and fear, award-winning author Graham Joyce spins a hypnotically dark and emotional story about a young married couple trapped by an avalanche in the remote French Pyrenees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;High in the mountains above a picturesque French ski resort, Jake and Zoe Bennett are alone on the early morning slopes when a nightmare crashes down upon them. With a sudden roar they are buried under a powerful flash avalanche. Miraculously, the young couple are able to dig their way out from under the snow - only to discover the world they've known has been evacuated and is devoid of any living soul. The town is empty. Restaurants stand frozen in time, with uncooked meat and vegetables left on the countertops. Cell phones and land lines are useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake and Zoe are left to face a terrifying situation alone - cut off from the world and trapped by a massive storm, with an even larger, catastrophic avalanche threatening to bury the town itself. They find that complete isolation brings fear...but also beauty. Zoe and Jake have the world to themselves, a vast playground with no rules, and yet the silent land they occupy also begins to deliver unsettling events neither one can ignore. As the days wear on, they are forced to confront frightening possibilities - and harrowing occurrences - as they attempt to survive, to understand the love they share, and to escape the ghostly landscape they now inhabit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The human race is all but extinct after a war with Partials—engineered organic beings identical to humans—has decimated the population. Reduced to only tens of thousands by RM, a weaponized virus to which only a fraction of humanity is immune, the survivors in North America have huddled together on Long Island while the Partials have mysteriously retreated. The threat of the Partials is still imminent, but, worse, no baby has been born immune to RM in more than a decade. Our time is running out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kira, a sixteen-year-old medic-in-training, is on the front lines of this battle, seeing RM ravage the community while mandatory pregnancy laws have pushed what's left of humanity to the brink of civil war, and she's not content to stand by and watch. But as she makes a desperate decision to save the last of her race, she will find that the survival of humans and Partials alike rests in her attempts to uncover the connections between them—connections that humanity has forgotten, or perhaps never even knew were there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dan Wells, acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;I Am Not a Serial Killer&lt;/em&gt;, takes readers on a pulsepounding journey into a world where the very concept of what it means to be human is in question—one where our humanity is both our greatest liability and our only hope for survival.</description>

Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths - until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death.

  <description>For years, J.R.'s stories have been acclaimed throughout the underground horror world. For the first time, these surviving stories have been collected in one anthology.  These are stories that challenge expectations and reject the staid conventions of the genre.  These are stories that don't compromise.&lt;br&gt;Above all, what readers understood and appreciated was that these stories were about something. These are stories that, in the finest tradition of H.P. Lovecraft, Thomas Ligotti, Dennis Etchinson, and T.E.D. Klein, articulate what you'be always suspected: that life is a losing proposition.</description>

  <description>As a child, Gretchen's twin sister was taken by a witch in the woods. Ever since, Gretchen and her brother, Ansel, have felt the long branches of the witch's forest threatening to make them disappear, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later, when their stepmother casts Gretchen and Ansel out, they find themselves in sleepy Live Oak, South Carolina. They're invited to stay with Sophia Kelly, a beautiful candy maker who molds sugary magic: coveted treats that create confidence, bravery, and passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life seems idyllic and Gretchen and Ansel gradually forget their haunted past -- until Gretchen meets handsome local outcast Samuel. He tells her the witch isn't gone -- it's lurking in the forest, preying on girls every year after Live Oak's infamous chocolate festival, and looking to make Gretchen its next victim. Gretchen is determined to stop running and start fighting back. Yet the further she investigates the mystery of what the witch is and how it chooses its victims, the more she wonders who the real monster is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gretchen is certain of only one thing: a monster is coming, and it will never go away hungry.</description>

  <description>Where do you go when nowhere is safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen years after a deadly virus wiped out most of Earth's population, the world is a perilous place. Eighteen-year-old Eve has never been beyond the heavily guarded perimeter of her school, where she and two hundred other orphaned girls have been promised a future as the teachers and artists of the New America. But the night before graduation, Eve learns the shocking truth about her school's real purpose and the horrifying fate that awaits her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing the only home she's ever known, Eve sets off on a long, treacherous journey, searching for a place she can survive. Along the way she encounters Arden, her former rival from school, and Caleb, a rough, rebellious boy living in the wild. Separated from men her whole life, Eve has been taught to fear them, but Caleb slowly wins her trust... and her heart. He promises to protect her, but when soldiers begin hunting them, Eve must choose between true love and her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this epic new series, Anna Carey imagines a future that is both beautiful and terrifying.</description>

  <description>Missy didn’t mean to cut so deep. But after the party where she was humiliated in front of practically everyone in school, who could blame her for wanting some comfort? Sure, most people don’t find comfort in the touch of a razor blade, but Missy always was . . . different. That’s why she was chosen to become one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War. Now Missy wields a new kind of blade—a big, brutal sword that can cut down anyone and anything in her path. But it’s with this weapon in her hand that Missy learns something that could help her triumph over her own pain: control. A unique approach to the topic of self-mutilation, &lt;em&gt;Rage &lt;/em&gt;is the story of a young woman who discovers her own power and refuses to be defeated by the world. &lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A riveting thriller set at a California prep school!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carly:&lt;/strong&gt; She was sweet. Smart. Self-destructive. She knew the secrets of Brighton Day School’s most privileged students. Secrets that got her killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neily:&lt;/strong&gt; Dumped by Carly for a notorious bad boy, Neily didn’t answer the phone call she made before she died. If he had, maybe he could have helped her. Now he can’t get the image of her lifeless body out of his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audrey:&lt;/strong&gt; She’s the reason Carly got tangled up with Brighton’s fast crowd in the first place, and now she regrets it—especially since she’s convinced the police have put the wrong person in jail. Audrey thinks the murderer is someone at Brighton, and she wants Neily to help her find out who it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As reluctant allies Neily and Audrey dig into their shared past with Carly, her involvement with Brighton’s dark goings-on comes to light. But figuring out how Carly and her killer fit into the twisted drama will force Audrey and Neily to face hard truths about themselves and the girl they couldn’t save.</description>

  <description>“Thou art the Black Rider. Go thee out unto the world.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lisabeth Lewis has a black steed, a set of scales, and a new job: she’s been appointed Famine. How will an anorexic seventeen-year-old girl from the suburbs fare as one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling the world on her steed gives Lisa freedom from her troubles at home: her constant battle with hunger, and her struggle to hide it from the people who care about her. But being Famine forces her to go places where hunger is a painful part of everyday life, and to face the horrifying effects of her phenomenal power. Can Lisa find a way to harness that power — and the courage to battle her own inner demons?</description>

Lexie Clarion's first night at college, she falls in with a pack of radical feminist werewolf hunters. The next morning, she falls for a mysterious woman who may be among the hunted. As Lexie's new lover and the Pack battle for Lexie's allegiance, the waxing moon illuminates old hatreds, new enemies, and a secret from Lexie's childhood that will change her life forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Where are all the good guys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No protests, no bombings, no subversion. Is it possible that in one part of the European Administration at least, almost all the citizens are happy with their lot in life? It seems unlikely. When the numbers don't add up at the Athens branch of the Investigation and Interrogation Division, Para-investigator Toreth is sent there from New London to review their procedures. With sunshine, a less-than-urgent assignment, and hosts who seem anxious to ensure that he has a good time, it seems like the perfect chance for a holiday on Administration time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or it would if he didn't have to leave Sara and the rest of his regular team behind. Working alone for once, as the investigation becomes more complex Toreth finds himself surrounded by people he can't trust. Worse than that, he has to leave Warrick on his own in New London, a situation further complicated by the reappearance of an old adversary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fifth book in the Administration series contains the novella &lt;em&gt;Quis Custodiet&lt;/em&gt; and seven short stories, following the careers of para-investigator and inveterate trouble-magnet Val Toreth and ambitious, if occasionally blinkered, corporate Keir Warrick in the near-future dystopia of the European Administration.</description>

  <description>Ever since the accident, Chase feels shattered. He can't remember that night, and everyone's treating him like a broken freak. He just wants things to go back to normal. So when he starts getting flashes of memory, he's relieved. He's sure once he remembers everything, he can put the crash behind him and start over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But when the flashes reveal another memory, Chase starts to panic. He's desperate to leave his ugly past behind. But if he wants to put the pieces together once and for all, he must face the truth about who he is . . . and what he has done.</description>

  <description>The year was 2014. We had cured cancer. We had beaten the common cold. But in doing so we created something new, something terrible that no one could stop. The infection spread, virus blocks taking over bodies and minds with one, unstoppable command: &lt;strong&gt;FEED&lt;/strong&gt;. Now, twenty years after the Rising, bloggers Georgia and Shaun Mason are on the trail of the biggest story of their lives - the dark conspiracy behind the infected. The truth will get out, even if it kills them.</description>

Ex-human. Ex- zombie. Except for Amy, that is. She's the only human survivor from her town-a frail. And if the feral dogs, the flesh-eating exes, and the elements don't get her, she just may discover how this all began. Because in this America, life is what you make it...</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Valchar-pretty, popular, and perfect-wakes up the morning after her eighteenth birthday party on her family's yacht, where she'd been celebrating with her six closest friends. A persistent thumping noise has roused her. When she goes to investigate, what she finds will change everything she thought she knew about her life, her friends, and everything in between. As Liz begins to unravel the circumstances surrounding her birthday night, she will find that no one around her, least of all Liz herself, was perfect-or innocent. Critically acclaimed author Jessica Warman brings readers along on a roller-coaster ride of a mystery, one that is also a heartbreaking character study, a touching romance, and ultimately a hopeful tale of redemption, love, and letting go.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>From the award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;Hotel World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Accidental&lt;/em&gt;, a dazzling, funny, and wonderfully exhilarating new novel.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At a dinner party in the posh London suburb of Greenwich, Miles Garth suddenly leaves the table midway through the meal, locks himself in an upstairs room, and refuses to leave. An eclectic group of neighbors and friends slowly gathers around the house, and Miles’s story is told from the points of view of four of them: Anna, a woman in her forties; Mark, a man in his sixties; May, a woman in her eighties; and a ten-year-old named Brooke. The thing is, none of these people knows Miles more than slightly. How much is it possible for us to know about a stranger? And what are the consequences of even the most casual, fleeting moments we share every day with one another? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brilliantly audacious, disarmingly playful, and full of Smith’s trademark wit and puns, &lt;em&gt;There but for the&lt;/em&gt; is a deft exploration of the human need for separation—from our pasts and from one another—and the redemptive possibilities for connection. It is a tour de force by one of our finest writers.</description>

  <description>At the news of her son BJ's involvement in gang crime, Idora Morrison, a maid at the local university, collapses in her basement apartment. For four days and nights she retreats into a vortex of memory, pain, and disappointment that becomes a riveting exposé of her life as a Caribbean immigrant living abroad. While she struggled to make ends meet, her deadbeat husband, Bertram, abandoned her for a better life in New York. Left alone to raise her son, Idora has done her best to survive against immense odds. But now that BJ has disappeared into a life of crime, she recoils from his loss and is unable to get out of bed, burdened by feelings of invisibility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she summons the strength to investigate her son's troubles—and her own weaknesses—the book quietly builds to its crescendo. Eventually Idora finds her way back into the light with a courage that is both remarkable and unforgettable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; zeroes in, with laserlike intensity, on the interior life of an extraordinary "ordinary woman," showcasing Clarke's skill as a writer of inimitable force.</description>

  <description>In the future, in a world baked dry by the harsh sun, there are those who live inside the walled Enclave and those, like sixteen-year-old Gaia Stone, who live outside. Following in her mother's footsteps Gaia has become a midwife, delivering babies in the world outside the wall and handing a quota over to be "advanced" into the privileged society of the Enclave. Gaia has always believed this is her duty, until the night her mother and father are arrested by the very people they so loyally serve. Now Gaia is forced to question everything she has been taught, but her choice is simple: enter the world of the Enclave to rescue her parents, or die trying.</description>

  <description>She is pretty and talented - sweet sixteen and never been kissed. He is seventeen; gorgeous and on the brink of a bright future. And now they have fallen in love. But... they are brother and sister.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Lochan and sixteen-year-old Maya have always felt more like friends than siblings. Together they have stepped in for their alcoholic, wayward mother to take care of their three younger siblings. As defacto parents to the little ones, Lochan and Maya have had to grow up fast. And the stress of their lives—and the way they understand each other so completely—has also also brought them closer than two siblings would ordinarily be. So close, in fact, that they have fallen in love. Their clandestine romance quickly blooms into deep, desperate love. They know their relationship is wrong and cannot possibly continue. And yet, they cannot stop what feels so incredibly right. As the novel careens toward an explosive and shocking finale, only one thing is certain: a love this devastating has no happy ending.</description>

  <description>Lucy Derrick is a young woman of good breeding and poor finances. After the death of her beloved father, she is forced to maintain a shabby dignity as the unwanted boarder of her tyrannical uncle, fending off marriage to a local mill owner. But just as she is on the cusp of accepting a life of misery, events take a stunning turn when a handsome stranger—the poet and notorious rake Lord Byron—arrives at her house, stricken by what seems to be a curse, and with a cryptic message for Lucy. Suddenly her unfortunate circumstances are transformed in ways at once astonishing and seemingly impossible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the world undergoing an industrial transformation, and with England on the cusp of revolution, Lucy is drawn into a dangerous conspiracy in which her life, and her country’s future, are in the balance. Inexplicably finding herself at the center of cataclysmic events, Lucy is awakened to a world once unknown to her: where magic and mortals collide, and the forces of ancient nature and modern progress are at war for the soul of England . . . and the world. The key to victory may be connected to a cryptic volume whose powers of enchantment are unbounded. Now, challenged by ruthless enemies with ancient powers at their command, Lucy must harness newfound mystical skills to prevent catastrophe and preserve humanity’s future. And enthralled by two exceptional men with designs on her heart, she must master her own desires to claim the destiny she deserves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Twelfth Enchantment&lt;/em&gt; is the most captivating work to date of a master literary conjurer.</description>

  <description>"Death music" is not merely a byword for bookish solemnity, or the glorification of murder, drugs and guns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of the last hundred years it has also been about teenage girls weeping over their high school boyfriend's fatal car wreck; natural disasters sweeping whole communities away; the ever-evolving threat of disease; changing attitudes to old age; exhortations to suicide; the perfect playlist for a funeral; and the thorny question of what happens after the fat lady ceases to sing. Which means that for every "Black Angel's Death Song" there is a "Candle in the Wind," and for every "Cop Killer" there is "The Living Years." Death, like music, is a unifying force. There is something for every taste and inclination, from murderous vengeance to camp sentimentality and everything in between.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ask the gangsta rap devotee. Ask the grizzled blues fanatic and the bearded folk fan. Ask the goth and the indie kid. Ask and they will all tell you the same thing: death and popular music have forever danced hand-in-hand in funereal waltz time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pop charts and the majority of radio stations' playlists may conspire to convince anyone listening that the world spins on its axis to the tune of "I love you, you love me" and traditional matters of the heart. The rest of us know that we live in a world where red roses will one day become lilies and that death is the motor that drives the greatest and most exhilarating music of all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drawing upon original and unique interviews with artists such as Mick Jagger, Richard Thompson, Ice-T, Will Oldham and Neil Finn among many others, &lt;em&gt;I Shot a Man In Reno&lt;/em&gt; explores how popular music deals with death, and how it documents the changing reality of what death means as one grows older. It's as transfixing as a train wreck, and you won't be able to put it down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an epilogue, &lt;em&gt;I Shot A Man In Reno&lt;/em&gt; presents the reader with the 40 greatest death songs of all time, complete with a brief rationale for each, acting as a primer for the morbidly curious listener.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;Fifteen years ago, Susan Morrow left her first husband Edward Sheffield, an unpublished writer. Now, she's enduring middle class suburbia as a doctor's wife, when out of the blue she receives a package containing the manuscript of her ex-husband's first novel. He writes asking her to read the book; she was always his best critic, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Susan reads, she is drawn into the fictional life of Tony Hastings, a math professor driving his family to their summer house in Maine. And as we read with her, we too become lost in Sheffield's thriller. As the Hastings' ordinary, civilized lives are disastrously, violently sent off course, Susan is plunged back into the past, forced to confront the darkness that inhabits her, and driven to name the fear that gnaws at her future and will change her life.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>It is not a peaceful time in the Dells. In King City, the young King Nash is clinging to the throne, while rebel lords in the north and south build armies to unseat him. War is coming. And the mountains and forest are filled with spies and thieves. This is where Fire lives, a girl whose beauty is impossibly irresistible and who can control the minds of everyone around her. Exquisitely romantic, this companion to the highly praised "Graceling" has an entirely new cast of characters, save for one person who plays a pivotal role in both books. You don't need to have read "Graceling" to love "Fire." But if you haven't, you'll be dying to read it next. &lt;br&gt;This edition includes an article by and an interview with Kristin Cashore, as well as a sneak peek at her next book, "Bitterblue"!</description>

  <description>When beautiful but aloof Claire Harkness is found dead in her dorm room one spring morning, prestigious Armitage Academy is shaken to its core. Everyone connected to school, and to Claire, finds their lives upended, from the local police detective who has a personal history with the academy, to the various faculty and staff whose lives are immersed in the daily rituals associated with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone wants to know how Claire died, at whose hands, and more importantly, where the baby that she recently gave birth to is a baby that almost no one, except her small innermost circle, knew she was carrying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the center of the investigation is Madeline Christopher, an intern in the English department who is forced to examine the nature of the relationship between the school's students and the adults meant to guide them. As the case unravels, the dark intricacies of adolescent privilege at a powerful institution are exposed, and both teachers and students emerge as suspects as the novel rushes to its thrilling conclusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With &lt;em&gt;The Twisted Thread&lt;/em&gt;, Charlotte Bacon has crafted a gripping and suspenseful story in the tradition of Donna Tartt's &lt;em&gt;The Secret History&lt;/em&gt;, one that pulls back the curtain on the lives of the young and privileged.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Internet phenomenon that unleashed "adorable emo puppies with bed head, ironic sunglasses, and snobby musical tastes". (&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; They spend their time sniffing around local farmer's markets, pawing through stacks of vinyl at the record store, and making biting remarks at the café. They're hipster puppies-and they're always snarky, impeccably accessorized, and undeniably adorable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From the site hipsterpuppies.tumblr.com comes never-before-seen photos of these pupsters at play, as well as some of the blog's most popular shots. With their oversized egos-and sunglasses-they run the gamut from music festival fauxhemians to ironic trucker-hat-wearing vegans. And they're guaranteed to melt readers' jaded hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate... until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;There was a man. He had a knife. He attacked us down by the river.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was just a harmless little lie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna, Emma and Mariah concoct a story about why they're late getting home one night—a story that will replace their parents' anger with&lt;br&gt;concern. They just have to stand by it. No matter what. Suddenly the police are involved, and the town demands that someone be punished. And then there is the man who is arrested and accused of a crime that never happened.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The innocence of childhood,&lt;br&gt; the unknown of adulthood,&lt;br&gt; and the search for forgiveness . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emily Stewart is the girl who claims to stand between the living and the dead. During the quiet summer of 1925, she and her brother, Michael, are thirteen-year-old twins-privileged, precocious, wandering aimlessly around their family's estate. One day, Emily discovers that she can secretly crack her ankle in such a way that a sound appears to burst through the stillness of midair. Emily and Michael gather the neighborhood children to fool them with these "spirit knockings."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Soon, however, this game of contacting the dead creeps into a world of adults still reeling from World War I. When the twins find themselves dabbling in the uncertain territory of human grief and family secrets- &lt;em&gt;knock, knock&lt;/em&gt;-everything spins wildly out of control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>There are things in Winter, Wisconsin, folks just don't talk about. The murder way back in '45 is one. The near-suicide of a first-grade teacher is another. And then there is 17-year old Christian Cage. Christian's parents disappeared when he was a little boy, and ever since he's drawn and painted obsessively, trying desperately to remember his mother. The problem is Christian doesn't just draw his own memories. He can draw the thoughts of those around him. Confronted with fears and nightmares they'd rather avoid, people have a bad habit of dying. So it's no surprise that Christian isn't exactly popular. What no one expects is for Christian to meet Winter's last surviving Jew and uncover one more thing best forgottenthe day the Nazi's came to town. Based on a little-known fact of the United States' involvement in World War II, Draw the Dark is a dark fantasy about reclaiming the forgotten past and the redeeming power of love.</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;A thrilling tale of adventure, romance, and one girl's unyielding courage through the darkest of nightmares.&lt;p&gt;Epidemics, floods, droughts--for sixteen-year-old Lucy, the end of the world came and went, taking 99% of the population with it. As the weather continues to rage out of control, and Sweepers clean the streets of plague victims, Lucy survives alone in the wilds of Central Park. But when she's rescued from a pack of hunting dogs by a mysterious boy named Aidan, she reluctantly realizes she can't continue on her own. She joins his band of survivors, yet, a new danger awaits her: the Sweepers are looking for her. There's something special about Lucy, and they will stop at nothing to have her.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description>Once upon a time there was a girl who was special.&lt;br&gt;This is not her story.&lt;br&gt;Unless you count the part where I killed her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Alison has been sectioned in a mental institute for teens, having murdered the most perfect and popular girl at school. But the case is a mystery: no body has been found, and Alison's condition is proving difficult to diagnose. Alison herself can't explain what happened: one minute she was fighting with Tori -- the next she disintegrated. Into nothing. But that's impossible. Right?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Power Writes Its Own Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaining it, keeping it, or losing it, control is more than just a game--it's a critical tool for survival. No more so than in the Administration, where the Investigation and Interrogation Division's Val Toreth faces professional and personal hazards every day. And when an attack on one of the most loyal and valued members of his investigative team makes the professional very personal indeed, Toreth finds himself entangled once more in the darker side of corporate life and crime. He'll need help, not just from his colleagues but from his "regular fuck" Keir Warrick, to make it out the other end safely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even away from their offices, Toreth and Warrick find that their jobs create challenges and tensions that threaten their relationship, because finding a balance is all about knowing when to keep control and when to let it go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourth book in the Administration series contains the novellas &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Coming from America&lt;/em&gt; and six other short stories, continuing the lives, loves, and occasionally intricate problems of dedicated and opportunistic para-investigator Val Toreth and up-and-coming corporate Keir Warrick in the near-future dystopia of the European Administration.</description>

  <description>Meet Kate Malone-straight-A science and math geek, minister's daughter, ace long-distance runner, new girlfriend (to Mitchell "Early Decision Harvard" Pangborn III), unwilling family caretaker, and emotional avoidance champion. Kate manages her life by organizing it as logically as the periodic table. She can handle it all-or so she thinks. Then, things change as suddenly as a string of chemical reactions; first, the Malones' neighbors get burned out of their own home and move in. Kate has to share her room with her nemesis, Teri Litch, and Teri's little brother. The days are ticking down and she's still waiting to hear from the only college she applied to: MIT. Kate feels that her life is spinning out of her control-and then, something happens that truly blows it all apart. Set in the same community as the remarkable &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Catalyst&lt;/em&gt; is a novel that will change the way you look at the world.</description>

  <description>Death is no stranger in the city of Erisín-- but some deaths attract more attention than others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a prostitute dies carrying a royal signet, Isyllt Iskaldur, necromancer and agent of the Crown, is called to investigate. Her search leads to desecrated tombs below the palace, and the lightless vaults of the vampiric vrykoloi deep beneath the city. But worse things than vampires are plotting in Erisín...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a sorcerous plague sweeps the city and demons stalk the streets, Isyllt must decide who she's prepared to betray, before the city built on bones falls into blood and fire.</description>

  <description>Based on a holiday boat trip made by the author and his two real-life friends George and Harris. This humorous travelogue includes local history of towns along the Thames, as well as a few serious and sentimental passages, but remains at its core a comic novel. Jerome K Jerome (1859-1927) became an actor and published a couple of volumes of humorous pieces and light essays about the theatre. He achieved lasting fame with THREE MEN IN A BOAT. He later went on to become one of the founders of the humorous magazine, The Idler, and continued to write articles and plays.</description>

  <description>In 1816, following the scandalous collapse of his marriage, Lord Byron left England forever. His first destination was the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva, where he stayed with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Godwin, Claire Clairmont, and John Polidori. Byron in Geneva focuses sharply on the poet’s life in the summer of that year, a famous time for meteorologists—for whom 1816 is the year without a summer—but also that crucial moment in the development of his writing when, urged on by Shelley, Byron tried to transform himself into a Romantic poet of the Wordsworthian variety. s wit, warm-heartedness, and hatred of cant.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I knew we were both in mortal danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in that instant I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella ever could have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...</description>

  <description>Eighteen-year-old Darcy lives on the island of America Pacifica--one of the last places on earth that is still habitable, after North America has succumbed to a second ice age. Education, food, and basic means of survival are the province of a chosen few, while the majority of the island residents must struggle to stay alive. The rich live in "Manhattanville" mansions made from the last pieces of wood and stone, while the poor cower in the shantytown slums of "Hell City" and "Little Los Angeles," places built out of heaped up trash that is slowly crumbling into the sea. The island is ruled by a mysterious dictator named Tyson, whose regime is plagued by charges of corruption and conspiracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to Darcy, America Pacifica is simply home--the only one she's ever known. In spite of their poverty she lives contentedly with her mother, who works as a pearl diver. It's only when her mother doesn't come home one night that Darcy begins to learn about her past as a former "Mainlander," and her mother's role in the flight from frozen California to America Pacifica. Darcy embarks on a quest to find her mother, navigating the dark underbelly of the island, learning along the way the disturbing truth of Pacifica's early history, the far-reaching influence of its egomaniacal leader, and the possible plot to murder some of the island's first inhabitants--including her mother.</description>

  <description>Set in a four-hundred-year-old boys' boarding school in London, a chilling gothic thriller by the author of the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;A Good and Happy Child&lt;/em&gt; . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fierce and jealous ghost . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young man's fight for his life . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Harrow School is home to privileged adolescents known as much for their distinctive dress and traditions as for their arrogance and schoolboy cruelty. Seventeen-year-old American Andrew Taylor is enrolled in the esteemed British institution by his father, who hopes that the school's discipline will put some distance between his son and his troubled past in the States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But trouble—and danger—seem to follow Andrew. When one of his schoolmates and friends dies mysteriously of a severe pulmonary illness, Andrew is blamed and is soon an outcast, spurned by nearly all his peers. And there is the pale, strange boy who begins to visit him at night. Either Andrew is losing his mind, or the house legend about his dormitory being haunted is true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the school's poet-in-residence, Piers Fawkes, is commissioned to write a play about Byron, one of Harrow's most famous alumni, he casts Andrew in the title role. Andrew begins to discover uncanny links between himself and the renowned poet. In his loneliness and isolation, Andrew becomes obsessed with Lord Byron's story and the poet's status not only as a literary genius and infamous seducer but as a student at the very different Harrow of two centuries prior—a place rife with violence, squalor, incurable diseases, and tormented love affairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When frightening and tragic events from that long-ago past start to recur in Harrow's present, and when the dark and deadly specter by whom Andrew's been haunted seems to be all too real, Andrew is forced to solve a two-hundred-year-old literary mystery that threatens the lives of his friends and his teachers—and, most terrifyingly, his own.</description>

  <description>The Moors is the story of a man, Thomas, whose understanding of reality leaves him at the prospect of encountering an attractive colleague while refilling his coffee at work; more so of the contents of his mind over the course of those feet from his desk, and the ensuing minutes. Along the way, shadows loom and bend, backs are turned, walls seem to move, and the passage of time is marked by the sounds of living objects colliding just beyond the sight of those who are listening. A breathtaking and claustrophilic story by Ben Marcus, written at a terrifyingly close point of view.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"My mother had four daughters by four different men."&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There's only one way Shelby and her sisters can describe their mother: She's a sexpot. Helen Kimura collects men (and loans, spending money, and gifts of all kinds) from all over the country. Sure, she's not your typical role model, but she's also not just a pretty face and nail polish. She is confident and brave; she lives life on her own terms, and her four daughters simply adore her. These girls have been raised outside the traditional boundaries. They know how to take the back exit. They know how to dodge crazed lovers in highway car chases. They do not, however, know how to function without one another.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then suddenly they must. A late-night phone call unexpectedly shreds the family apart, catapulting the girls across the country to live with their respective fathers. But these strong-willed sisters are, like their mother, determined to live life on their own terms, and what they do to pull their family back together is nothing short of beautiful.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At turns wickedly funny and insistently thought-provoking, &lt;em&gt;Outside Beauty&lt;/em&gt; showcases Cynthia Kadohata's unerring ability to explore the bonds that bind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the first book of the Poniworld Chronicles, MachoPoni has no choice but to enter the Dark Kingdom, where the undead ponies roam. He must rescue Dust, the poni he loves from the dark princess's castle, using wit, creativity and his magic bouncy blue ball to survive. A twisted parody of My Little Pony, The Care Bears, and other 80's staples. Warning: contains gore and mild sexual content.</description>

  <description>New York City’s spirit has been crushed. People walk the streets with their heads down, withdrawing from one another and into the cold comfort of technology. Teenagers Mal and Laura have grown up in this reality. They’ve never met. Seemingly, they never will. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on the same day Mal learns his brother has disappeared, Laura discovers her parents have forgotten her. Both begin a search for their families that leads them to the same truth: someone or something has wiped the teens from the memories of every person they have ever known. Thrown together, Mal and Laura must find common ground as they attempt to reclaim their pasts.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An electrifying story of science, faith, love, and self-destruction in a world on the brink. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a June unlike any other before, with temperatures soaring to asphyxiating heights. All across the world, freak weather patterns—and the life-shattering catastrophes they entail—have become the norm. The twenty-first century has entered a new phase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Gabrielle Fox’s main concern is a personal one: to rebuild her life after a devastating car accident that has left her disconnected from the world, a prisoner of her own guilt and grief. Determined to make a fresh start, and shake off memories of her wrecked past, she leaves London for a temporary posting as an art therapist at Oxsmith Adolescent Secure Psychiatric Hospital, home to one hundred of the most dangerous children in the country. Among them: the teenage killer Bethany Krall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite two years of therapy, Bethany is in no way rehabilitated and remains militantly nonchalant about the bloody, brutal death she inflicted on her mother. Raised in evangelistic hellfire, the teenager is violent, caustic, unruly, and cruelly intuitive. She is also insistent that her electroshock treatments enable her to foresee natural disasters—a claim which Gabrielle interprets as a symptom of doomsday delusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as Gabrielle delves further into Bethany’s psyche, she begins to note alarming parallels between her patient’s paranoid disaster fantasies and actual incidents of geological and meteorological upheaval—coincidences her professionalism tells her to ignore but that her heart cannot. When a brilliant physicist enters the equation, the disruptive tension mounts—and the stakes multiply. Is the self-proclaimed Nostradamus of the psych ward the ultimate manipulator or a harbinger of global disaster on a scale never seen before? Where does science end and faith begin? And what can love mean in “interesting times”?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With gothic intensity, Liz Jensen conjures the increasingly unnerving relationship between the traumatized therapist and her fascinating, deeply calculating patient. As Bethany’s warnings continue to prove accurate beyond fluke and she begins to offer scientifically precise hints of a final, world-altering cataclysm, Gabrielle is confronted with a series of devastating choices in a world in which belief has become as precious - and as murderous—as life itself.</description>

  <description>The stories, poems, and essays in Forgotten Borough offer twenty-four takes on New York City s biggest underdog: Queens. From the immigrant communities of Forest Hills to the unsung heroes of Maspeth and the bustling crowds of Flushing, Queens is the most diverse county in the United States, but unlike the iconic boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx, it s neither as well known in other parts of the country nor as well traveled by New Yorkers (at least those who don t need to take the 7 Train to get home). Featuring writers who hail from the borough as well as those who have moved there and come to call it home, Forgotten Borough uncovers the New York stories that most of us don t get to hear, tales that reflect not only upon contemporary life in Queens but also its humble history and its evolution to the multicultural community the community of communities it is today. Taken together, they offer a vivid, layered portrait of Queens as a microcosm of America, where race, ethnicity, class, and industrial growth all influence our collective past, as well as our present and future.</description>

  <description>Within Cole Matthews lie anger, rage and hate. Cole has been stealing and fighting for years. This time he caught Alex Driscal in the, parking lot and smashed his head against the sidewalk. Now, Alex may have permanent brain damage'and Cole is in the Biggest trouble of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole is offered Circle Justice: a system based on Native American traditions that attempts to provide healing for the criminal offender, the victim and the, community. With prison as his only alternative, Cole plays along. He says he wants to repent, but in his heart Cole blames his alcoholic mom his, abusive dad, wimpy Alex -- everyone but himself -- for his situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole receives a one-year banishment to a remote Alaskan island. There, he is mauled by Mysterious white bear of Native American legend. Hideously injured, Cole waits for his death His thoughts shift from from Anger to humility. To survive, he must stop blaming others and take responsibility for his life. Rescuers arrive to save Cole's but it is the attack of the Spirit Bear that may save his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Mikaelsen paints a vivid picture of a juvenile offender, examining the roots without absolving solving him of responsibility for his actions, and questioning a society in which angry people make victims of their peers and communities.

  <description>A boy and a girl are stripped and marooned on a small island for the night. They are the “goats.” The kids at camp think it’s a great joke, just a harmless old tradition. But the goats don’t see it that way. Instead of trying to get back to camp, they decide to call home. But no one can come and get them. So they’re on their own, wandering through a small town trying to find clothing, food, and shelter, all while avoiding suspicious adults—especially the police. The boy and the girl find they rather like life on their own. If their parents ever do show up to rescue them, the boy and the girl might be long gone. . . .&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goats&lt;/em&gt; is a 1987 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Tender Morsels &lt;/em&gt;is a dark and vivid story, set in two worlds and worrying at the border between them. Liga lives modestly in her own personal heaven, a world given to her in exchange for her earthly life. Her two daughters grow up in this soft place, protected from the violence that once harmed their mother. But the real world cannot be denied forever—magicked men and wild bears break down the borders of Liga’s refuge. Now, having known Heaven, how will these three women survive in a world where beauty and brutality lie side by side?</description>

  <description>Welcome to Anorev, a world in between time, where children have played so long it’s almost become work, machines have worked so long they have begun to play and all the clocks have stopped at the same time. This is how this land has remained, until 314 dapper-looking gentlemen rain down from the sky and set off in different directions to start the world again. Now Ayden, the only boy to still ask questions; Zoe, the robot girl all other machines hold dear; and the Dapper Man known only as �41” must discover what happened that made time stop, understand what their true places are in this world, and learn what �tomorrow” really means. The sun is setting for the first time in memory, and once that happens, everything changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Return of the Dapper Men&lt;/em&gt; is a visually stunning fairy tale that combines steampunk with fantasy and science fiction with Renaissance style, brought to life from the minds of award-winning playwright and comic book writer Jim McCann (&lt;em&gt;New Avengers: The Reunion&lt;/em&gt;) and critically acclaimed visual artist Janet Lee. Together these two have created a world where J.M. Barrie, Lewis Carroll and Maurice Sendak meet Jim Henson and Tim Burton. All sharply dressed in a pin-stripe suit and a dapper bowler hat. Tick tock, time is about to start.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A poignant and fantastical first novel by a timeless new literary voice. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With all the elements of a classic fable, vivid descriptions, and a wholly unique style, this idiosyncratic debut introduces a new and exciting voice to readers of such authors as George Saunders, Kurt Vonnegut, and Yann Martel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In &lt;em&gt;Light Boxes&lt;/em&gt;, the inhabitants of one closely-knit town are experiencing perpetual February. It turns out that a god-like spirit who lives in the sky, named February, is punishing the town for flying, and bans flight of all kind, including hot air balloons and even children's kites. It's February who makes the sun nothing but a faint memory, who blankets the ground with snow, who freezes the rivers and the lakes. As endless February continues, children go missing and more and more adults become nearly catatonic with depression. But others find the strength to fight back, waging war on February.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Her feet are already bleeding - if you like feet..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are places in the world where darkness rules, where it's unwise to walk. Sunshine knew that. But there hadn't been any trouble out at the lake for years, and she needed a place to be alone for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, she wasn't alone. She never heard them coming. Of course you don't, when they're vampires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They took her clothes and sneakers. They dressed her in a long red gown. And they shackled her to the wall of an abandoned mansion - within easy reach of a figure stirring in the moonlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows that he is a vampire. She knows that she's to be his dinner, and that when he is finished with her, she will be dead. Yet, as dawn breaks, she finds that he has not attempted to harm her. And now it is he who needs her to help him survive the day...</description>

  <description>Yoshifuji is a man fascinated by foxes, a man discontented and troubled by the meaning of life. A misstep at court forces him to retire to his long-deserted country estate, to rethink his plans and contemplate the next move that might return him to favor and guarantee his family's prosperity.&lt;p&gt;Kitsune is a young fox who is fascinated by the large creatures that have suddenly invaded her world. She is drawn to them and to Yoshifuji. She comes to love him and will do anything to become a human woman to be with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shikujo is Yoshifuji's wife, ashamed of her husband, yet in love with him and uncertain of her role in his world. She is confused by his fascination with the creatures of the wood, and especially the foxes that she knows in her heart are harbingers of danger. She sees him slipping away and is determined to win him back from the wild ... for all that she has her own fox-related secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magic binds them all. And in the making (and breaking) of oaths and honors, the patterns of their lives will be changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Forget everything you ever knew about unicorns...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Real unicorns are venomous, man-eating monsters with huge fangs and razor-sharp horns. Fortunately, they've been extinct for a hundred and fifty years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Astrid had always scoffed at her eccentric mother's stories about killer unicorns. But when one of the monsters attacks her boyfriend—thereby ruining any chance of him taking her to the prom—Astrid finds herself headed to Rome to train as a unicorn hunter at the ancient cloisters the hunters have used for centuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, at the cloisters all is not what it seems. Outside, the unicorns wait to attack. And within, Astrid faces other, unexpected threats: from the crumbling, bone-covered walls that vibrate with a terrible power to the hidden agendas of her fellow hunters to—perhaps most dangerously of all—her growing attraction to a handsome art student ... an attraction that could jeopardize everything.</description>

  <description>The day the blizzard started, no one knew that it was going to keep snowing for a week. That for those in its path, it would become not just a matter of keeping warm, but of staying alive. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scotty and his friends Pete and Jason are among the last seven kids at their high school waiting to get picked up that day, and they soon realize that no one is coming for them. Still, it doesn't seem so bad to spend the night at school, especially when distractingly hot Krista and Julie are sleeping just down the hall. But then the power goes out, then the heat. The pipes freeze, and the roof shudders. As the days add up, the snow piles higher, and the empty halls grow colder and darker, the mounting pressure forces a devastating decision. . . .</description>

  <description>A Room of One's Own is an extended essay by Virginia Woolf. First published on 24 October 1929, the essay was based on a series of lectures she delivered at Newnham College and Girton College, two women's colleges at Cambridge University in October 1928. While this extended essay in fact employs a fictional narrator and narrative to explore women both as writers of and characters in fiction, the manuscript for the delivery of the series of lectures, titled "Women and Fiction", and hence the essay, are considered non-fiction. The essay is generally seen as a feminist text, and is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.</description>

  <description>Edith Grossman's definitive English translation of the Spanish masterpiece. Widely regarded as the world's first modern novel, and one of the funniest and most tragic books ever written, &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote of La Mancha and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. Unless you read Spanish, you've never read &lt;em&gt;Don Quixote.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>""Death was, after all, the way Henry made his living."&lt;br&gt;"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bookhound, Henry Sullivan buys and sells books he finds at estate auctions and library sales around Boston and often from the relatives of the recently deceased. He's in his late thirties, single, and comfortably set in his ways. But when a woman from his past, Morgan Johnson, calls to ask him to look at her late husband's books, he is drawn into the dark machinations of a family whose mixed loyalties and secret history will have fatal results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Hound," the first novel featuring Henry Sullivan, is the debut work of a longtime Boston bookseller. It is a paean to books, bookselling, and the transformative power of the printed word. Even as it evolves into a gripping murder mystery, it is also a reminder that there are still quiet corners of the world where the rhythms of life are calmer, where there's still time for reading, time for getting out for a beer with friends, time to investigate the odd details of lives lived on the edges of the book world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the true story unfolds, its mysteries are also of the everyday sort: love found and love lost, life given and life taken away. At the center is Henry himself, with his troubled relationships and his love of old books. There's his landlady Mrs. Prowder whose death unsettles Henry's life and begins the sequence of events that overturns it. There's the secret room his friend Albert discovers while doing "refuse removal," a room that reveals the story of a woman who lived and loved a century ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And throughout the novel are those of us whose lives revolve around books: the readers, writers, bookstore people, and agents--as well as Henry, the bookhound, always searching for the great find, but usually just getting by, happy enough to be in the pursuit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"McCaffrey, the owner of Boston's legendary Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop, succeeds in conveying his love of books in his intriguing debut."&lt;br&gt;--"Publishers Weekly"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""""Hound" is billed as a mystery, and it's a good one, but its fuse is long and its pace befitting an old bookshop. That's a good thing. There's something charismatic and timeless about the way the story builds and McCaffrey opens Henry's life to the reader. It wasn't until the action started to heat up about 100 or so pages in that we remembered we were reading a mystery at all. And while we're a little tired of books about books and the people who love them--which often come off more as marketing initiatives-- McCaffrey is never cloying or playing to demographic. He's just telling a compelling, old-school yarn, the kind of story a man who knows his literature tells."&lt;br&gt;--"Time Out Chicago"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Vincent McCaffrey's debut mystery is crammed with stories, with likable, eccentric characters, much like his marvelous Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop--of all the bookstores in the world, the one I still miss most of all. Like all good mysteries, "Hound" concerns more than murder: it's rich in detail and knowledgeable asides about bookselling, the world of publishing, and life lived in the pubs, shabby apartments, penthouses, and strange corners of the city of Boston."&lt;br&gt;--Kelly Link, author of "Pretty Monsters"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"McCaffrey's bookseller, Henry Sullivan, is as endearing, frustrating, and compelling a character I've come across in some time. "Hound" is more than Henry's show, however. It's a slow burn murder mystery, a sharp character study, a detailed exploration of Boston, and a mediation on the secrets of history--both personal and universal. But I'm wasting our precious time trying to pigeonhole his wonderful first novel. "Hound" is, quite simply, a great book."&lt;br&gt;--Paul Tremblay, author of "The Little Sleep."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vincent McCaffrey has owned and operated the Avenue Victor Hugo Bookshop for more than thirty years, first in Boston, and now online from Abington, Massachusetts. He has been paid by others to do lawn work, shovel snow, paint houses, and to be an office-boy, warehouse grunt, dishwasher, waiter, and hotel night clerk. He has since chosen at various times to be a writer, editor, publisher, and bookseller. He can still remember the first time he sold books for money in 1963--and what most of those books were. "Hound" is his first novel.</description>

  <description>If it's true that the average worker will hold an average of seven jobs over the course of a lifetime, Ayun Halliday is anything but average. In her brief thirty-something years, Halliday has managed to rack up an impressive array of short lived stints in the paid job market, including life guard, library attendant, costume designer, actress, waitress, artist's model, professional temp, rental stylist, substitute teacher, party counselor, massage therapist, costumed mascot, and mime, to name a few. In this uproarious collection of essays, Halliday displays a work ethic all employers can admire: wearing a leg brace to work after calling in "sick," quitting the same day she starts by claiming her step-brother had been in a bike accident, and faking "vocal nodes" to avoid telemarketing calls. Along the way, she befriends colleagues and bosses who ignore her falling asleep, stealing food and clothing, and feigning skills she does not possess, and gains the respect of her customers for sheer honesty, which includes detailing her feminine hygiene problems and setting male clients straight on her brand of massage: "I'm sorry, I cannot facilitate a sexual release for you!"</description>

  <description>It's the age-old tale: &lt;br&gt; Boy meets girl. &lt;br&gt; Boy stalks girl. &lt;br&gt; Girl already has a stalker.&lt;br&gt; Boy becomes her stalker-stalker. &lt;br&gt; We've seen it all before, many times, but this time it's different. If only slightly. When Gomez Porter becomes a test subject in an experimental drug trial, he is asked to keep track of any strange experiences through a blog. What Gomez isn't ready for, is so many of his experiences suddenly seeming strange; the antiques dealer trying to buy his old tax papers, his neighbor boiling salamanders on his balcony at midnight, the super sexy lab assistant who falls for him but is unable to express herself in terms outside the realm of science. But when one of the trial participants turns up dead and another goes missing, Gomez begins to fear for his life. No longer sure who he can trust and which of his experiences are real and which merely drug induced illusions, he decides it's time to go underground and work out a devious plan. &lt;br&gt;Now, years later, his blogs have been recovered from a defunct server. For the first time we can find out firsthand what happened to Gomez as he takes us on a wild ride of discovery.</description>

  <description>Reborn as an oozing humanoid composed of vitreous humor after a sudden death via a disembodied hand and a wood chipper, Gary Olstrom found no difficulty in saying goodbye to the life he once knew. After all, he had become quite adept at saying goodbye, to his right arm in a hardware store accident at eight, to his parents in a fiery car crash, to his right leg in a factory mishap, and to the only person who ever tried to help him in an untimely bus collision. What he never prepared for was saying goodbye to misfortune, until he found Uncle Sam's Carnival of Copulating Inanimals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therein, Gary finds refuge training furniture to copulate before spectators who vomit in applause. But while Gary's luck shifts for the better, cities left in the wake of the carnival's visits disappear; many are murdered. With his pet desk Akimbo and his empty-socketed girlfriend-turned-futon, Liberty, Gary attempts to unravel this mystery, culminating in a re-imagining of America to rival that of Benedict Anderson's! Well, not quite...but there is furniture porn.</description>

  <description>The author of such reliably offbeat sf thrillers as Strange Attractors (1990) radically changes pace for ten hilarious, semi- autobiographical stories. With affection and a splendid sense of comic timing, Sleator drags forth incidents from his family closet's darkest recesses--the time young Tycho was hypnotized and then made to drink from the toilet; an indignant skit that laid bare the failings of certain parents, to their vast amusement; rough-and-tumble car games; and deliciously horrifying pranks played on unsuspecting passersby. Vivid characterizations (sister Vicky had always enjoyed making dolls fight with each other; when the dolls wore out, she ripped off their arms and legs. Now she is a nurse') always balance foibles with saving graces; embarrassment is eased by laughter, while painful circumstances always come right in the end. Sleator shows how, in a loosely run household presided over by indulgent working parents, he and his three siblings developed confident, independent spirits. Though he admits to making up a few things, his dedication is telling – To my family: Please forgive me!'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;– Kirkus Reviews&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>"Into Thin Air" is the definitive, personal account of the deadliest season in the history of Mount Everest -- told by acclaimed journalist, and bestselling author of "Into the Wild" and "Eiger Dreams, " Jon Krakauer. On assignment for "Outside" magazine, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas to report on the growing commercialization of the planet's highest mountain. When he reached the summit in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in over 57 hours and was reeling from oxygen depletion. Twenty other climbers were pushing for the summit, and no one had noticed the clouds filling the sky. Six hours later, and 3,000 feet lower, Krakauer collapsed in his tent. The next morning he learned that six of the climbers hadn't made it back. Even though one climber in four dies attempting to reach the summit, business is booming as guides take the rich and the adventurous up the mountain for a fee of $65,000. Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind and willingly subject themselves to so much danger, hardship, and expense.Written with emotional clarity, Krakauer's account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.</description>

  <description>No adults, no permit, no river map. Just some "borrowed" gear from Discovery Unlimited, the outdoor education program Jessie and her new companions have just ditched. Jessie and the others are having the time of their lives floating beneath sheer red walls, exploring unknown caves and dangerous waterfalls, and plunging through the Grand Canyon's roaring rapids. No one, including Troy, who emerges as the group's magnetic and ultimately frightening leader, can forsee the challenges and conflicts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What will be the consequences of their reckless adventure?</description>

  <description>Readers of Jeremy C. Shipp’s fiction will be familiar with his minimalist, breakneck pacing, his surreal forays into political satire, and his seamless blending of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Now, in his fourth book, the Bram Stoker Award finalist expands on what many critics and fans alike have long considered the most compelling aspect of his work—relationships. This story collection explores how a person’s desire can infect their every action and interaction with others. The desire to protect. The desire to hurt. The desire to be desired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fungus of the Heart explores what happens between people when society breaks down and the rules go out the window. Haunting and heartbreaking, pithy and potent, the quirky inhabitants of Shipp’s bizarro world will carve an indelible line from your funnybone to your spleen to your emotional core..+-</description>

But now they're on the verge of divorce and going to couples' counseling. On a routine trip to their counselor, they notice a few odd things - the lack of cars on the highway, the missing security guard, and the fact that their counselor, Dr. Kelly, is ripping out her previous client's throat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet the Zombies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Sarah and David are fighting for survival in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. But, just because there are zombies, doesn't mean your other problems go away. If the zombies don't eat their brains, they might just kill each other.</description>

  <description>John Galardi is a loner, unable to express his feelings except in the pages of his zine, "Bananafish." He finds inspiration in another zine, "Escape Velocity," created by Marisol Guzman, a self-proclaimed "rich spoiled lesbian private-school gifted-and-talented writer virgin." Her sharp observations make John laugh out loud and he decides he must meet this witty author. By planting himself in Tower Records the day she drops off the latest issue, John manages to arrange a coffee date that extends over several Saturday mornings. They discuss everything from John's inability to feel and his parent's divorce to Marisol's problems with her suffocating adoptive parents. When Marisol casually tells John that she likes him, he is flabbergasted: "Honest to God a shiver ran through my body... Nobody ever said that they liked me. Ever. Not even [my friend] Brian, who probably actually doesn't." After a disastrous "just friends" junior prom date and a weekend zine conference spent together, John realizes that his feelings for Marisol are more than platonic. And Marisol, who is exploring her identity as a young lesbian, has no idea how to let John down gently without losing her new best friend.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Cinderella retold&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the wake of her father's death, Ash is left at the mercy of her cruel stepmother. Consumed with grief, her only joy comes by the light of the dying hearth fire, rereading the fairy tales her mother once told her. In her dreams, someday the fairies will steal her away, as they are said to do. When she meets the dark and dangerous fairy Sidhean, she believes that her wish may be granted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day that Ash meets Kaisa, the King's Huntress, her heart begins to change. Instead of chasing fairies, Ash learns to hunt with Kaisa. Though their friendship is as delicate as a new bloom, it reawakens Ash's capacity for love-and her desire to live. But Sidhean has already claimed Ash for his own, and she must make a choice between fairy tale dreams and true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entrancing, empowering, and romantic, &lt;em&gt;Ash&lt;/em&gt; is about the connection between life and love, and solitude and death, where transformation can come from even the deepest grief.</description>

  <description>With a steady boyfriend, the position of Student Council President, and a chance to go to an Ivy League college, high school life is just fine for Holland Jaeger. At least it seems to be. But when Cece Goddard comes to school, everything changes. Cece and Holland have undeniable feelings for each other, but how will others react to their developing relationship? This moving love story between two girls is a worthy successor to Nancy Garden's classic young adult coming out novel, Annie on My Mind. With her characteristic humor and breezy style, Peters has captured the compelling emotions of young love.</description>

  <description>This is the story of Paul, a sophomore at a high school like no other: The cheerleaders ride Harleys, the homecoming queen used to be a guy named Daryl (she now prefers Infinite Darlene and is also the star quarterback), and the gay-straight alliance was formed to help the straight kids learn how to dance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Paul meets Noah, he thinks he’s found the one his heart is made for. Until he blows it. The school bookie says the odds are 12-to-1 against him getting Noah back, but Paul’s not giving up without playing his love really loud. His best friend Joni might be drifting away, his other best friend Tony might be dealing with ultra-religious parents, and his ex-boyfriend Kyle might not be going away anytime soon, but sometimes everything needs to fall apart before it can really fit together right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a happy-meaningful romantic comedy about finding love, losing love, and doing what it takes to get love back in a crazy-wonderful world.</description>

  <description>Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local "powhitetrash." At eight years old and back at her mother's side in St. Louis, Mayais attacked by a man any times her age-and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns about love for herself, and the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors ("I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare") will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;These are the secrets I have kept. This is the trust I never betrayed. But he is dead now and has been for more than forty years, the one who gave me his trust, the one for whom I kept these secrets. The one who saved me . . . and the one who cursed me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So starts the diary of Will Henry, orphaned assistant to Dr. Pellinore Warthorpe, a man with a most unusual specialty: monstrumology, the study of monsters. In his time with the doctor, Will has met many a mysterious late-night visitor, and seen things he never imagined were real. But when a grave robber comes calling in the middle of the night with a gruesome find, he brings with him their most deadly case yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gothic tour de force that explores the darkest heart of man and monster and asks the question: When does man become the very thing he hunts?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>It’s a hot, hot summer, and in the depths of the Toronto Transit Authority’s Lost and Found, 17-year-old Duncan is cataloging lost things and sifting through accumulated junk. And between Jacob, the cranky old man who runs the place, and the endless dusty boxes overflowing with stuff no one will ever claim, Duncan’s just about had enough. Then he finds a little leather book. It’s a diary filled with the dark and dirty secrets of a twisted mind, a serial killer stalking his prey in the subway. And Duncan can’t make himself stop reading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would you do with a book like that? How far would you go to catch a madman?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what if time was running out. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Hardcover edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A startling, seductive literary novel that entwines suspense, science fiction, adventure, romance and history into an intoxicating new genre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1908: New Venice--"the pearl of the Arctic"--a place of ice palaces and pneumatic tubes, of beautifully ornate carriage-sleds and elegant victorian garb, of long nights and vistas of ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as the city prepares for spring, it feels more like &lt;em&gt;qaartsiluni&lt;/em&gt;, "the time when something is about to explode in the dark." Local "poletics" are wracked by tensions with the Eskimos circling the city, with suffragette riots led by an underground music star, with drug round-ups by the secret police force known as the Gentlemen of the Night. An ominous black airship hovers over the city, and the Gentlemen are hunting for the author of a radical pamphlet calling for revolt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their lead suspect is Brentford Orsini, one of the city's most prominent figures. But as the Gentlemen of the Night tighten the net around him, Orsini receives a mysterious message from a long-lost love that compels him to act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What transpires is a literary adventure novel unlike anything you've ever read before. Brilliant in its conception, masterful in its prose, thrilling in its plot twists, and laced with humor, suspense, and intelligence, it marks the beginning of a great new series of books set in New Venice-and the launch of an astonishing new writer.</description>

  <description>Chris Creed grew up as the class freak--the bullies' punching bag. After he vanished, the weirdness that had once surrounded him began spreading. And it tore the town apart. Sixteen-year-old Torey Adams's search for answers opens his eyes to the lies, the pain, and the need to blame someone when tragedy strikes, and his once-safe world comes crashing down around him. " Includes an interview with the author and a reader's guide." This e-book includes a sample chapter of FOLLOWING CHRISTOPHER CREED. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Dead girl walking,” the boys say in the halls.&lt;br&gt;“Tell us your secret,” the girls whisper, one toilet to another.&lt;br&gt;I am that girl.&lt;br&gt;I am the space between my thighs, daylight shining through.&lt;br&gt;I am the bones they want, wired on a porcelain frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lia and Cassie are best friends, wintergirls frozen in matchstick bodies, competitors in a deadly contest to see who can be the skinniest. But what comes after size zero and size double-zero? When Cassie succumbs to the demons within, Lia feels she is being haunted by her friend’s restless spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her most emotionally wrenching, lyrically written book since the multiple-award-winning &lt;em&gt;Speak&lt;/em&gt;, Laurie Halse Anderson explores Lia’s descent into the powerful vortex of anorexia, and her painful path toward recovery.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks at age 14:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Debate Club.&lt;br&gt;Her father's "bunny rabbit." &lt;br&gt;A mildly geeky girl attending a highly competitive boarding school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks at age 15:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A knockout figure. &lt;br&gt;A sharp tongue.&lt;br&gt;A chip on her shoulder.&lt;br&gt;And a gorgeous new senior boyfriend: the supremely goofy, word-obsessed Matthew Livingston.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;No longer the kind of girl to take "no" for an answer. &lt;br&gt;Especially when "no" means she's excluded from her boyfriend's all-male secret society.&lt;br&gt;Not when her ex-boyfriend shows up in the strangest of places.&lt;br&gt;Not when she knows she's smarter than any of them.&lt;br&gt;When she knows Matthew's lying to her. &lt;br&gt;And when there are so many, many pranks to be done. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankie Landau-Banks, at age 16:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Possibly a criminal mastermind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of how she got that way.</description>

When movie-star handsome Peter Coleridge, a young ex-GI who served in Joe's company in postwar Austria, shows up, Evie is suddenly caught in a complicated web of lies that she only slowly recognizes. She finds herself falling for Peter, ignoring the secrets that surround him . . . until a tragedy occurs that shatters her family and breaks her life in two.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Ponyboy can count on his brothers and his friends, but not on much else besides trouble with the Socs, a vicious gang of rich kids who get away with everything, including beating up greasers like Ponyboy. At least he knows what to expect--until the night someone takes things too far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Written forty-five years ago, S. E. Hinton's classic story of a boy who finds himself on the outskirts of regular society remains as powerful today as it was the day it was written.</description>

  <description>When sophomores John and Lorraine played a practical joke a few months ago on a stranger named Angelo Pignati, they had no idea what they were starting. Virtually overnight, almost against their will, the two befriended the lonely old man; it wasn't long before they were more comfortable in his house than their own. But now Mr. Pignati is dead. And for John and Lorraine, the only way to find peace is to write down their friend's story - the story of the Pigman.</description>

  <description>When it first appeared in 1898, this fourth novel by celebrated Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun captured instant acclaim for its poetic, psychologically intense portrayal of love’s predicament in a class-bound society. Set in a coastal village of late nineteenth-century Norway, Victoria follows two doomed lovers through their thwarted lifelong romance. Johannes, the son of a miller, finds inspiration for his writing in his passionate devotion to Victoria, an impoverished aristocrat constrained by family loyalty. Separated by class barriers and social pressure, the fated pair parts ways, only to realize—too late—the grave misfortune of their lost opportunity. Elegantly rendered in this brand-new translation by Sverre Lyngstad, &lt;strong&gt;Victoria&lt;/strong&gt;’s haunting lyricism and emotional depth remain as timeless as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First time in Penguin Classics  </description>

  <description>By age sixteen, Rhine Ellery has four years left to live. She can thank modern science for this genetic time bomb. A botched effort to create a perfect race has left all males with a lifespan of 25 years, and females with a lifespan of 20 years. Geneticists are seeking a miracle antidote to restore the human race, desperate orphans crowd the population, crime and poverty have skyrocketed, and young girls are being kidnapped and sold as polygamous brides to bear more children. When Rhine is kidnapped and sold as a bride, she vows to do all she can to escape. Her husband, Linden, is hopelessly in love with her, and Rhine can't bring herself to hate him as much as she'd like to. He opens her to a magical world of wealth and illusion she never thought existed, and it almost makes it possible to ignore the clock ticking away her short life. But Rhine quickly learns that not everything in her new husband's strange world is what it seems. Her father-in-law, an eccentric doctor bent on finding the antidote, is hoarding corpses in the basement. Her fellow sister wives are to be trusted one day and feared the next, and Rhine is desperate to communicate to her twin brother that she is safe and alive. Will Rhine be able to escape--before her time runs out? Together with one of Linden's servants-Gabriel-Rhine attempts to escape just before her seventeenth birthday. But in a world that continues to spiral into anarchy, is there any hope for freedom?</description>

  <description>Set against an atmospheric backdrop of New York City in the months just before America’ s entry into World War II, &lt;em&gt;A Time To Be Born&lt;/em&gt; is a scathing and hilarious study of cynical New Yorkers stalking each other for various selfish ends. At the center of the story are a wealthy, self-involved newspaper publisher and his scheming, novelist wife, Amanda Keeler. Powell always denied that Amanda Keeler was based upon the real-life Clare Boothe Luce, until years later when she discovered a memo she’d written to herself in 1939 that said, “Why not do a novel on Clare Luce?” Which prompted Powell to write in her diary “Who can I believe? Me or myself?”</description>

  <description>The New York Times bestselling author of the acclaimed Island of Lost Girls and Promise Not to Tell returns with a chilling novel in which the secrets of the past come back to haunt a group of friends in terrifying ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dismantlement = Freedom&lt;br&gt;Henry, Tess, Winnie, and Suz banded together in college to form a group they called the Compassionate Dismantlers. Following the first rule of their manifesto—"To understand the nature of a thing, it must be taken apart"—these daring misfits spend the summer after graduation in a remote cabin in the Vermont woods committing acts of meaningful vandalism and plotting elaborate, often dangerous, pranks. But everything changes when one particularly twisted experiment ends in Suz's death and the others decide to cover it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly a decade later, Henry and Tess are living just an hour's drive from the old cabin. Each is desperate to move on from the summer of the Dismantlers, but their guilt isn't ready to let them go. When a victim of their past pranks commits suicide—apparently triggered by a mysterious Dismantler-style postcard—it sets off a chain of eerie events that threatens to engulf Henry, Tess, and their inquisitive nine-year-old daughter, Emma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there someone who wants to reveal their secrets? Is it possible that Suz did not really die—or has she somehow found a way back to seek revenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of white-knuckle tension with deeply human characters caught in circumstances beyond their control, Jennifer McMahon's gripping story and spine-tingling plot prove that she is a master at weaving the fear of the supernatural with the stark realities of life.</description>

  <description>Laura Bennett is not a soccer mom or a PTA mom or a helicopter mom—and she’s certainly not mother of the year. Another breed of mother entirely, Laura is surely more Auntie Mame than June Cleaver. As a busy mother of six, Laura is on an impossible mission: raising a brood of fast-moving, messy, wild sons in the jungles of Manhattan. So what other choice does she have than to sit back, grab a martini, and let the boys be, er, boys?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Didn’t I Feed You Yesterday?,&lt;/strong&gt; Laura gives her irreverent take on modern motherhood and proves that a strong sense of humor and an even stronger sense of self are the mother’s milk of sanity. In a series of refreshingly candid and hilarious anecdotes, she unapologetically breaks every rule in the Brady Bunch playbook: She gives her kids junk food, plays favorites, and openly admits to having “a genetic predisposition to laissez-faire parenting.” Children, she observes, don’t need constant supervision from neurotic, perfectionist parents. Allow kids to make mistakes and entertain themselves and they’ll turn out just fine—even if you do sometimes forget to pick them up from school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond the mayhem of a life among males, Laura celebrates the glories of womanhood with a generous helping of wit and style. She gives thanks to the fashion gods for the essentials—red lipstick, Manolo Blahniks, and Lycra shapewear—but reminds us that true style comes from an inner compass that points directly at oneself. In every aspect of life, Laura gives one simple, powerful piece of advice: “Dress like you want it or stay home.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brutally honest, outrageous, and sure to raise a few eyebrows, &lt;strong&gt;Didn’t I Feed You Yesterday?&lt;/strong&gt; is a riotously funny read—and it’ll go fabulously well with your new handbag.&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"One day you're that guy who's happy he managed to survive high school and get that almighty piece of paper, and you're thinking you might try to get a job at Redi-Mix concrete where your dad's worked since the beginning of time. And at least you've got a family you can stand even if they are all sisters.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;One day you're that guy, and the next day you're assigned to a social worker and a therapist and given the choice of either being a LEGAL ADULT with three DEPENDENTS or an ORPHAN with NOBODY." --From Back Roads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harley Altmyer should be in college drinking Rolling Rock and chasing girls. He should be freed from his closed-minded, stricken coal town, with its lack of jobs and no sense of humor. Instead, he's constantly reminded of just how messed up his life is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his mother in jail for killing his abusive father, Harley is an orphan with the responsibilities of an adult and the fiery, aggressive libido of a teenager. Just nineteen years old, he's marooned in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters, whose feelings about him range from stifling dependence to loathing. And once he develops an obsession with the sexy, melancholic mother of two living down the road, those Victoria's Secret catalogs just won't do the trick anymore. He wants Callie Mercer so badly he fears he will explode. But it's the family secrets, the lies, and the unspoken truths that light the fuse and erupt into a series of staggering surprises, leaving what's left of his family in tatters. Through every ordeal, the unforgettable Harley could never know that his endearing humor, his love for his sisters, and his bumbling heroics would redeem them all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny and heartbreaking, &lt;strong&gt;Tawni O'Dell&lt;/strong&gt;'s pitch-perfect characters capture the maddening confusion of adolescence and the prickly nature of family with irony and unerring honesty. &lt;strong&gt;Back Roads&lt;/strong&gt; is a riveting novel by a formidable new talent.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Albertine disparue&lt;/em&gt; est le dernier volume revu et remanié par Proust avant sa mort. Prévu d'abord sous le titre &lt;em&gt;La Fugitive&lt;/em&gt;, comme le pendant de &lt;em&gt;La Prisonnière&lt;/em&gt;, il présente la fin de l'épisode d'Albertine : sa fuite, sa mort, le chagrin, puis l'oubli. Le huis-clos de &lt;em&gt;La Prisonnière&lt;/em&gt; s'achève, non sur l'apaisement, mais sur une multiplication des regrets et des enquêtes posthumes. Un long passage conduit Marcel à Venise, depuis toujours cité de ses désirs, maintenant univers thématique dense où nous retrouvons sa mère, Mme de Villeparisis et M. de Norpois. Il s'y livre à la fois à l'éblouissement esthétique et à de nouvelles poursuites amoureuses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;À la fin de sa vie, Proust songeait à développer ses recherches sur l'homosexualité dans un &lt;em&gt;Sodome et Gomorrhe IV&lt;/em&gt;, un &lt;em&gt;Sodome et Gomorrhe V&lt;/em&gt; et au-delà, avant d'en arriver au &lt;em&gt;Temps retrouvé&lt;/em&gt;. D'où les remaniements profonds - allant jusqu'à l'étonnante suppression des deux-tiers du volume - qu'il fit subir à &lt;em&gt;Albertine disparue&lt;/em&gt;, sans pouvoir les conduire à leur terme. Nous donnons de cette partie l'édition qui nous paraît la plus plausible, comprenant le texte initialement prévu et faisant apparaître clairement les modifications apportées dans les derniers jours.</description>

  <description>Christian Lang, a famous novelist and television show host, wants to keep secret his affair with the enchanting Sarita, but she has her own reasons for keeping quiet too. Lang finds himself caught up in a sinister love-triangle with Sarita and her psychotic ex-husband. He knows that his life is in danger, but so great is Lang's passion for Sarita that he is unable to stay away. As he is drawn further into a web of lust, lies, and violence, his judgment becomes increasingly wayward. Lang—from one of Scandinavia's most acclaimed new noir writers—is a compelling story of obsession both physical and emotional; a tale about the power of passion to override every emotion, even fear.</description>

  <description>With more than four million copies sold, &lt;strong&gt;Wifey&lt;/strong&gt; is Judy Blume's hilarious, moving tale of a woman who trades in her conventional wifely duties for her wildest fantasies-and learns a lot about life along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sandy Pressman is a nice suburban wife whose boredom is getting the best of her. She could be making friends at the club, like her husband keeps encouraging her to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or working on her golf game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or getting her hair done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for some reason, these things don't interest her as much as the naked man on the motorcycle...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the heels of &lt;/em&gt;Patient Zero &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Pride and Prejudice with Zombies— &lt;em&gt;the electrifying sequel to &lt;/em&gt;Hater &lt;em&gt;where humanity fights itself to the death against a backdrop of ultimate apocalyptic destruction &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Earth has been torn into two parts by an irreversible division. Whether due to nature, or the unknown depths of the mind itself, everyone is now either Human or Hater. Victim or killer. Governments have fallen, command structures have collapsed, and relationships have crumbled. Major cities have become refugee camps where human survivors cower together in fear. Amidst this indiscriminate carnage, Danny McCoyne is on a mission to find his daughter Ellis, convinced that her shared Hater condition means her allegiance is to people like him. Free of inhibitions, unrestricted by memories of peace, and driven by instinct, children are pure Haters, and may well define the future of the Hater race. But, as McCoyne makes his way into the heart of human territory, an incident on the battlefield sets in place an unexpected chain of events, forcing him to question everything he believes he knows about the new order that has arisen, and the dynamic of the Hate itself.</description>

  <description>In this compelling tale, the �little general” heads an army called the Realists. Every day he and his troops practice battle formations on a field while the Dreamers use it to play strange, peaceful games. The little general's soldiers include Sergeant Samantha, who is very tall and wishes the general would pay attention to her, and Lieutenant Lyle, an imaginative fellow who always seems to get into trouble. One day the little general sees a giant snowflake hovering in his garden and realizes he is suffering from a disease of the imagination. He is very ashamed and pretends not to see it, but eventually he discovers that everyone in his army has a similar problem. What magical message is the snowflake trying to bring to the general, and to the world? In a time of violent military solutions to global problems, this illustrated allegory by a leading poet has a particular, powerful resonance.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The only thing that keeps two elderly brothers alive is their passionate hatred for each other.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two brothers, who no longer meet or speak to each other, are neighbors in a northern Swedish village. They used to share a wife, each thinking he had sole tenure. Each thought that he was the father of the woman's only son. The boy died in an accident while the two men bickered as to which of them should rescue him. All the petty rancors come to light when a woman arrives in the village to give a lecture and lodges with one of the brothers. She becomes the mutual messenger, the joint repository for their recriminations. A tour de force by one of the true European masters of black humor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>When Gunnar Huttenen turns up in a small village to restore a dilapidated mill, its inhabitants are instinctively wary. He's big. He's a bit odd. And he's a stranger. Everyone loves is brilliant animal impressions but these feelings soon sour when he starts to howl wildly at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And once the mean-spirited, small-minded locals realise Gunnar won't conform, they conclude he must be mad. Hounded from his mill and persecuted for being different, only the love of his life and the local drunk stand by him. Can he survive? And how?</description>

  <description>What is the promise of the wolf? Never consort with humans. Never kill a human unprovoked. Never allow a mixed-blood wolf to live. At least that's what the wolves of the Wide Valley believe. Until a young wolf dares to break the rules--and forever alters the relationship between wolves and the humans who share their world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of such a wolf. Born of a forbidden mixed-blood litter and an outcast after her mother is banished, Kaala is determined to earn a place in the Swift River pack. But her world is turned upside down when she saves a human girl from drowning. Risking expulsion from their pack and exile from the Wide Valley, Kaala and her young packmates begin to hunt with the humans and thus discover the long-hidden bond between the two clans. But when war between wolves and humans threatens, Kaala learns the lies behind the wolf's promise. Lies that force her to choose between safety for herself and her friends and the survival of her pack--and perhaps of all wolf- and humankind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set 14,000 years ago, Promise of the Wolves takes us to a land where time is counted in phases of the moon, distance is measured in wolflengths, and direction by the scent of the nearest trail. Years of research into the world of wolves combines with mythical tale-telling to present a fantastical adventure set in a world filled with lore.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;House of Mist &lt;/em&gt;stands as one of the first South American novels written in the style that was later called magical realism. Of this story of a young bride struggling with her marriage to an aloof landowner—and the mysteries surrounding their life together—in a house deep in the lush Chilean woods, Penelope Mesic wrote in the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Tribune &lt;/em&gt;that Bombal showed “bold disregard for simple realism in favor of a heightened reality in which the external world reflects the internal truth of the characters’ feeling . . . mingling . . . fantasy, memory and event.”</description>

  <description>Anne Enright is a dazzling writer of international stature and one of Ireland’s most singular voices. Now she delivers &lt;em&gt;The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;, a moving, evocative portrait of a large Irish family and a shot of fresh blood into the Irish literary tradition, combining the lyricism of the old with the shock of the new. The nine surviving children of the Hegarty clan are gathering in Dublin for the wake of their wayward brother, Liam, drowned in the sea. His sister, Veronica, collects the body and keeps the dead man company, guarding the secret she shares with him—something that happened in their grandmother’s house in the winter of 1968. As Enright traces the line of betrayal and redemption through three generations her distinctive intelligence twists the world a fraction and gives it back to us in a new and unforgettable light. &lt;em&gt;The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; is a daring, witty, and insightful family epic, clarified through Anne Enright’s unblinking eye. It is a novel about love and disappointment, about how memories warp and secrets fester, and how fate is written in the body, not in the stars.</description>

  <description>One of the most acclaimed novels in recent memory, &lt;em&gt;The Known World&lt;/em&gt; is a daring and ambitious work by Pulitzer Prize winner Edward P. Jones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Known World&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order, and chaos ensues. Jones has woven a footnote of history into an epic that takes an unflinching look at slavery in all its moral complexities.</description>

  <description>In the cattle drives of the Old West, pumpkin rollers were green farmboys, almost more trouble than they were worth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Trey McLean leaves his family's East Texas cotton farm and sets off on his own to learn the cattleman's trade, he's about as green as they come. But Trey learns fast. He learns about deceit when a con man cheats him out of his grubstake and about love when he meets the woman he's destined to marry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when luck finally sets him on a cattle drive to Kansas, Trey learns the trade from veteran drover Ivan Kerbow, but he also learns the code of violence and death from outlaw Jarrett Longacre, a man who will plague his life at every turn.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Tudor England. Henry VIII is on the throne, but has no heir. Cardinal Wolsey is charged with securing his divorce. Into this atmosphere of distrust comes Thomas Cromwell - a man as ruthlessly ambitious in his wider politics as he is for himself. His reforming agenda is carried out in the grip of a self-interested parliament and a king who fluctuates between romantic passions and murderous rages.</description>

  <description>Two murders have occurred on One One One, an artificial ecosystem created by the universe's dominant AIs to house several engineered species, including a violent, sentient race of sloth-like creatures. Under order from the Diplomatic Corps, Counselor Andrea Cort has come to this cylinder world where an indentured human community hangs suspended high above a poisoned, acid atmosphere. Her assignment is to choose a suitable homicide suspect from among those who have sold their futures to escape existences even worse than this one. And no matter where the trail leads her she must do nothing to implicate the hosts, who hold the power to obliterate humankind in an instant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Andrea Cort is not about to hold back in her hunt for a killer. For she has nothing to lose and harbors no love for her masters or fellow indentures. And she herself has felt the terrible exhilaration of taking life . . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Bloom will either fix our broken world in his imagination or destroy his real life trying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sniper is taking down suits and politicians—in Daniel Bloom’s head. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bloom is the kind of guy who ends most social gatherings with an alternately raging and despairing conversation about The State of the World. And recently things have taken a turn for the worse. His marriage is on the rocks, his teenage son is becoming increasingly unknowable, and his sense of hopeless impotence has reached a stage of spiritual crisis that's no longer a matter of vapid dinner-party conversation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So he decamps to his home office to work on his fifteenth screenplay, this time about a federal agent and a nameless assassin. The assassin is a sniper who targets the power elite: corporate chiefs who defraud their employees of billions of dollars in pensions, and political flacks who've rigged the system in their own favor. Only the federal agent isn't sure he wants to capture the sniper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Bloom realizes that his screenplay hits too close to home: He really does want these people dead, so much so that this revenge fantasy takes over his life, sending him in search of salvation in an outrageous mentor, a possibly dangerous foreign country, and, finally, his very own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Once upon a time, I was a little girl who disappeared. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once upon a time, my name was not Alice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Once upon a time, I didn't know how lucky I was.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When Alice was ten, Ray took her away from her family, her friends -- her life. She learned to give up all power, to endure all pain. She waited for the nightmare to be over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now Alice is fifteen and Ray still has her, but he speaks more and more of her death. He does not know it is what she longs for. She does not know he has something more terrifying than death in mind for her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is Alice's story. It is one you have never heard, and one you will never, ever forget.</description>

  <description>As dusk approaches a small Dublin suburb in the summer of 1984, mothers begin to call their children home. But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox—his partner and closest friend—find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richly atmospheric, stunning in its complexity, and utterly convincing and surprising to the end, In the Woods is sure to enthrall fans of Mystic River and The Lovely Bones. And look for French's new mystery, Broken Harbor, for more of the Dublin Murder Squad.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch—and there's always a catch—is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really don't want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester's Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener's hand is severed as "the dome" comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when -- or if -- it will go away.  &lt;p&gt; Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens -- town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician's assistant at the hospital, a select-woman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing -- even murder -- to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn't just short. It's running out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Susan Beth Pfeffer’s &lt;em&gt;Life as We Knew It &lt;/em&gt;enthralled and devastated readers with its brutal but hopeful look at an apocalyptic event--an asteroid hitting the moon, setting off a tailspin of horrific climate changes. Now this harrowing companion novel examines the same events as they unfold in New York City, revealed through the eyes of seventeen-year-old Puerto Rican Alex Morales. When Alex's parents disappear in the aftermath of tidal waves, he must care for his two younger sisters, even as Manhattan becomes a deadly wasteland, and food and aid dwindle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With haunting themes of family, faith, personal change, and courage, this powerful new novel explores how a young man takes on unimaginable responsibilities.</description>

  <description>An international best-seller with more than one million copies in print and a winner of France’s Prix Goncourt, &lt;em&gt;The Lover&lt;/em&gt; has been acclaimed by critics all over the world since its first publication in 1984.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the prewar Indochina of Marguerite Duras’s childhood, this is the haunting tale of a tumultuous affair between an adolescent French girl and her Chinese lover. In spare yet luminous prose, Duras evokes life on the margins of Saigon in the waning days of France’s colonial empire, and its representation in the passionate relationship between two unforgettable outcasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long unavailable in hardcover, this edition of &lt;em&gt;The Lover&lt;/em&gt; includes a new introduction by Maxine Hong Kingston that looks back at Duras's world from an intriguing new perspective—that of a visitor to Vietnam today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Translated from the French by Barbara Bray.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>What do haunted furniture, bear cubs, and a skydiving baby have in common?&lt;br&gt;Answer: Serial craigslist poster and parodist Gary Fingercastle. Picture this: Author and agitator Gary Fingercastle posts hundreds of mock advertisements on the popular website craigslist.org and receives thousands of real-life responses. And because truth is stranger than fiction, he learns that:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People will do anything for love (like jumping into a lion pen and dressing up like a Christmas tree).&lt;br&gt;You can give anything away (like haunted furniture, torture racks, and mummies).&lt;br&gt;You can purchase anything on the Internet (like bear cubs and tattoos for children).&lt;br&gt;People will do anything for money (like driving into walls at high speeds and starving themselves for five weeks straight).&lt;br&gt;This book is the hilarious and oftentimes horrifying collection that really makes you wonder are we all insane?"</description>

  <description>"We want you to do it again."&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These words, spoken to Brian Robeson, will change his life. Two years earlier, Brian was stranded alone in the wilderness for fifty-four days with nothing but a small hatchet. Yet he survived. Now the government wants him to do it again to go back into the wilderness so that astronauts and the military can learn the survival techniques that kept Brian alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time he won't be alone: Derek Holtzer, a government psychologist, will accompany him to observe and take notes. But during a freak storm, Derek is hit by lightning and falls into a coma. Their radio transmitter is dead. Brian is afraid that Derek will die of dehydration unless he can get him to a doctor. His only hope is to build a raft and try to transport Derek a hundred miles down the river to a trading post if the map he has is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>The acclaimed graphic novel anthology continues with &lt;em&gt;Sublife Vol. 2&lt;/em&gt;. Creator John Pham enlarges the scope and expands the style of his series with an all-new collection of stories and strips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Kid” is a self-contained short story set in an eerily familiar post-apocalyptic future. Bloodthirsty marauders roam the blasted desert. A nomad and his dog, scavenging the road for gas and supplies, stumble upon a sealed bomb shelter, the contents of which will test whatever humanity he has left, as the marauders pursue him to a violent, frenetic climax. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Deep Space” continues the atmospheric science fiction serial begun in Volume 1. In this episode, Captain Ho, Commander Wallach, and their newly adopted space-faring companion Deek attempt to harness the power of an alien crystal with the hopes of finding a way back home. But will their best-laid plans survive Captain’s fragile mental state and impulse-prone behavior? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In “221 Sycamore St,” teenage runaway Phineas accompanies his uncles on a training session with their dog Freya, but what they’re training Freya to do illustrates the disturbing lengths to which his uncles will take their racist ideology. This chapter builds and expands upon the characters and themes established in the first volume, showcasing a vision of Los Angeles that is sometimes dark and fractured, inhabited by a quirky cast of characters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if that were not enough, the artist includes various, stand-alone short strips including “Socko Sarkissian,” a single-page gem about baseball’s greatest fictional Armenian slugger, “St. Ambrose,” a fractured memoir about the author’s parochial school alma mater, and “Mort,” a story that answers the burning question, what happens when a jealous blog¬ger encounters his nemesis? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sublife Vol. 2&lt;/em&gt; is filled to the brim with a dizzying variety of stories and styles, all of which surprisingly coalesce into a unified reading experience thanks to their shared themes and motifs, much like Chris Ware’s annual &lt;em&gt;ACME Novelty Library&lt;/em&gt;. Dogs, missed connections, ad hoc family units, desert landscapes are all elements that pop up and recur among the different stories. It makes each volume of sublife eminently readable on its own, and proves why Pham is among the most compelling new voices in comics today.</description>

  <description>Ayun Halliday may not make for the most sensible travel companion, but she is certainly one of the zaniest, with a knack for inserting herself (and her unwitting cohorts) into bizarre situations around the globe. Curator of kitsch and unabashed aficionada of pop culture, Halliday offers bemused, self-deprecating narration of events from guerrilla theater in Romania to drug-induced Apocalypse Now reenactments in Vietnam to a perhaps more surreal collagen-implant demonstration at a Paris fashion show emceed by Lauren Bacall. On layover in Amsterdam, Halliday finds unlikely trouble in the red-light district—eliciting the ire of a tiny, violent madam, and is forced to explain tampons to soldiers in Kashmir—"they’re for ladies. Bleeding ladies"—that, she admits, "might have looked like white cotton bullets lined up in their box." A self-admittedly bumbling vacationer, Halliday shares—with razor-sharp wit and to hilarious effect—the travel stories most are too self-conscious to tell. Includes line drawings by the author.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“On a building site of a new, luxury apartment building, visitors looked up at the strange, irregular form of the water tank that crowned the edifice, and the big parabolic dish that would supply television images to all the floors. On the edge of the dish, a sharp metallic edge on which no bird would have dared to perch, three completely naked men were sitting, with their faces turned up to the midday sun; no one saw them, of course.”&lt;/em&gt;—from &lt;em&gt;Ghosts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghosts&lt;/em&gt; is about a construction worker's family squatting on a building site. They all see large and handsome ghosts around their quarters, but the teenage daughter is the most curious. Her questions about them become more and more heartfelt until the story reaches a critical, chilling moment when the mother realizes that her daughter's life hangs in the balance.</description>

  <description>The tempestuous, bloody, and splendid reign of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547) is one of the most fascinating in all history, not least for his marriage to six extraordinary women. In this accessible work of brilliant scholarship, Alison Weir draws on early biographies, letters, memoirs, account books, and diplomatic reports to bring these women to life. Catherine of Aragon emerges as a staunch though misguided woman of principle; Anne Boleyn, an ambitious adventuress with a penchant for vengeance; Jane Seymour, a strong-minded matriarch in the making; Anne of Cleves, a good-natured and innocent woman naively unaware of the court intrigues that determined her fate; Catherine Howard, an empty-headed wanton; and Catherine Parr, a warm-blooded bluestocking who survived King Henry to marry a fourth time.</description>

  <description>Gregor 11 follows sister Boots 2 through a laundry room grate to the dark Underland below NYC. Transparent-skinned humans dwell beside giant talking spiders, bats, cockroaches, and rats - but the fragile peace is about to fall apart. Six centuries before, the Earl of Sandwich prophesied a quest, Gregor seeking his father, gone for two years.</description>

  <description>Though the Quebecois Anne Hebert is a distinguished contemporary novelist and poet in French, her work is little-known and hard to get hold of in the U.S. Poulin's substantial selection of her writing, translated with facing original, is thus a real boon to American readers. The selection includes work from Hebert's two major collections of poems, The Tomb of Kings (1952) and Miracle of the Word (1960), as well as previously uncollected poems and a curious concluding essay by Poulin about the problems he himself has had as a Quebecois-American. The poetry from The Tomb of Kings , written mostly in short lines, is at once austere, riddling and grand. These are poems of painful solitude aspiring to a condition of ``original silence and poverty,'' and the insistent difficulties they present to a reader demonstrate their commitment to poetry as an ordeal of purification: ``anything easy is a snare.'' By contrast, the work from Miracle of the Word , composed mostly in short prose paragraphs, is expansive--rich in vocabulary, ecstatic and imperative in tone--and reminiscent of Rimbaud and Char. Hebert's writing, like most modern French poetry, is rhetorical in a way that contemporary English and American poetry tend not to be: that can make translation difficult. But we can only be grateful to Poulin for making Hebert available in the original, as well as in his serviceable translation.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;RAISE THE BAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what it's all been building up to...Shin, Izumi and Kagurazuka compete against one another in the high jump! Then, Sekime gets his own moment in the spotlight when his classmates see him with a strange girl. But if we're talking "strange," she doesn't even compare to the woman who comes onto campus and sweeps an embarrassed Nakatsu off his feet...Nakatsu's mother!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A KISS IS JUST A KISS?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unable to forget her near-kiss experience, Mizuki finds herself drawing ever closer to Sano, and not in a "roommates" way, either. The tension builds when Nakatsu asks Sano point-blank: &lt;em&gt;Do you like Mizuki?&lt;/em&gt; Can Nakatsu and Sano's friendship survive the answer? Meanwhile, Sano's old high-jump rival returns, along with a surprising new challenger!</description>

      <![CDATA[Actual rating: 3.5 <br /><br />I don't think I've ever read a story about cheaters. I'm not sure if this was a conscious decision or if it was for fear of it reminding me of that corny reality TV show that's somehow STILL airing. (WHY? TELL ME WHY.) Plus, there's always the issue of actually sympathizing wit...]]>

  <description>"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you . . . "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail. (Everybody in the newsroom knows. It's company policy.) But they can't quite bring themselves to take it seriously. They go on sending each other endless and endlessly hilarious e-mails, discussing every aspect of their personal lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now- reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be "internet security officer," he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers- not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lincoln comes across Beth's and Jennifer's messages, he knows he should turn them in. But he can't help being entertained-and captivated-by their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would he say . . . ?</description>

      <![CDATA[I enjoyed this much more than <em>Eleanor and Park</em>, but still didn't love it. There are so many pop culture references that it's impossible to forget the book is set in the 90s as it's so overloaded with name drops (movies, actors, shows, etc) that it felt unnecessary. If it weren't for the fact that...]]>

  <description>With power comes enemies. Lots of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter Garrity just wants to be left alone. He‚Äôs learned the hard way that his unusual abilities come at a price. And he can‚Äôt seem to afford any allies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He‚Äôs up to his neck in hostiles. His grandfather, spoiling for a fight. The Merrick brothers, who think he ratted them out. Calla, the scheming psycho who wants to use him as bait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there‚Äôs Kate Sullivan, the new girl at school. She‚Äôs not hostile. She‚Äôs bold. Funny. Hot. But she‚Äôs got an agenda, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With supposedly secret powers rippling to the surface everywhere around him, Hunter knows something ugly is about to go down.

  <description>&lt;em&gt; Bad boy, meet bad girl.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante has a shiny new cuff wrapped around his ankle, and he doesn't like that mess one bit. His new accessory comes straight from Big Guy himself and marks the former demon as a liberator. Despite his gritty past and bad boy ways, Dante Walker has been granted a second chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dante is given his first mission as a liberator to save the soul of seventeen-year-old Aspen, he knows he‚Äôs got this. But Aspen reminds him of the rebellious life he used to live and is making it difficult to resist sinful temptations. Though Dante is committed to living clean for his girlfriend Charlie, this dude‚Äôs been a playboy for far too long‚Ä¶and old demons die hard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Charlie becoming the girl she was never able to be pre-makeover and Aspen showing him how delicious it feels to embrace his inner beast, Dante will have to go somewhere he never thought he‚Äôd return to in order to accomplish the impossible: save the girl he‚Äôs been assigned to, and keep the girl he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have more questions about the romance in THE LIBERATOR?

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passage&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Ender‚Äôs Game&lt;/em&gt; in an epic new series from award-winning author Rick Yancey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the 1st wave, only darkness remains. After the 2nd, only the lucky escape. And after the 3rd, only the unlucky survive. After the 4th wave, only one rule applies: trust no one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, it‚Äôs the dawn of the 5th wave, and on a lonely stretch of highway, Cassie runs from Them. The beings who only look human, who roam the countryside killing anyone they see. Who have scattered Earth‚Äôs last survivors. To stay alone is to stay alive, Cassie believes, until she meets Evan Walker. Beguiling and mysterious, Evan Walker may be Cassie‚Äôs only hope for rescuing her brother‚Äîor even saving herself. But Cassie must choose: between trust and despair, between defiance and surrender, between life and death. To give up or to get up.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />There's no doubt in my mind that most people are going to be captivated with <em>The 5th Wave</em>. It's engaging, features a witty protagonist, mystery, the right amount of anticipation and a romantic story line. Not to mention, it happens to be one of Penguin's big titles and had a lot of marketing mone...]]>

  <description>When having two powers makes you a Super and having none makes you a Normal, having only one makes you a sad half-superpowered freak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It makes you a One.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Merrin Grey would love to be able to fly ‚Äì too bad all she can do is hover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she could just land an internship at the Biotech Hub, she might finally figure out how to fix herself. She busts her butt in AP Chem and salivates over the Hub‚Äôs research on the manifestation of superpowers, all in hopes of boosting her chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Elias VanDyne, another One, and all her carefully crafted plans fly out the window. Literally. When the two of them touch, their Ones combine to make them fly, and when they‚Äôre not soaring over the Nebraska cornfields, they‚Äôre busy falling for each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merrin's mad chemistry skills land her a spot on the Hub's internship short list, but as she gets closer to the life she always wanted, she discovers that the Hub‚Äôs purpose is more sinister than it has always seemed.  Now it‚Äôs up to her to decide if it's more important to fly solo, or to save everything - and everyone - she loves.</description>

      <![CDATA[Actual rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />One is one of those self-published gems that I seem to always be hunting for. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs just really fun to read. It reminds me a lot of x-men, but with teens. The writing is decent, though, I do feel it was better in the second half, and the plot is pretty...]]>

  <description>When the imminent collapse of the world‚Äôs food system threatens to all but eradicate the human race, it‚Äôs up to nineteen-year-old Liang Zhang to determine which of his company‚Äôs employees will live and which will die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liang and the other Job Creators have only weeks to choose which of their staff and families to move into the domes, the last refuges on the barren planet. Despite their best efforts, the Job Creators are unable to keep their selection project under wraps, spurring violent protests against the privileged few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Liang must race: against starvation, against insurrection, and against his own conscience.</description>

  <description>"I'm lucky just to be alive."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva was never supposed to have survived this long. As the recessive soul, she should have faded away years ago. Instead, she lingers in the body she shares with her sister soul, Addie. When the government discovered the truth, they tried to ‚Äúcure‚Äù the girls, but Eva and Addie escaped before the doctors could strip Eva‚Äôs soul away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now fugitives, Eva and Addie find shelter with a group of hybrids who run an underground resistance. Surrounded by others like them, the girls learn how to temporarily disappear to give each soul some much-needed privacy. Eva is thrilled at the chance to be alone with Ryan, the boy she‚Äôs falling for, but troubled by the growing chasm between her and Addie. Despite clashes over their shared body, both girls are eager to join the rebellion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet as they are drawn deeper into the escalating violence, they start to wonder: How far are they willing to go to fight for hybrid freedom? Faced with uncertainty and incredible danger, their answers may tear them apart forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He is a Legend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is a Prodigy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who will be Champion?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic‚Äîand each other‚Äîand now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government‚Äôs elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic‚Äôs border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than ever, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country‚Äôs defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With heart-pounding action and suspense, Marie Lu‚Äôs bestselling trilogy draws to a stunning conclusion.</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring.... until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>The last thing Dawson Black expected was Bethany Williams. As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are‚Ä¶well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bethany can‚Äôt deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren‚Äôt a complication she wants, she can‚Äôt stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she‚Äôs drawn in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captivated. Lured. Loved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can‚Äôt stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.</description>

  <description>Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written early in the career of playwright William Shakespeare about two young "star-cross'd lovers" whose deaths ultimately unite their feuding families. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet and Macbeth, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.</description>

  <description>Darcy Jones doesn‚Äôt remember anything before the day she was abandoned as a child outside a Chicago firehouse. She has never really belonged anywhere‚Äîbut she couldn‚Äôt have guessed that she comes from an alternate world where the Great Chicago Fire didn‚Äôt happen and deadly creatures called Shades terrorize the human population.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Memories begin to haunt Darcy when a new boy arrives at her high school, and he makes her feel both desire and desired in a way she hadn‚Äôt thought possible. But Conn‚Äôs interest in her is confusing. It doesn‚Äôt line up with the way he first looked at her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As if she were his enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Conn betrays Darcy, she realizes that she can‚Äôt rely on anything‚Äînot herself, not the laws of nature, and certainly not him. Darcy decides to infiltrate the Shadow Society and uncover the Shades‚Äô latest terrorist plot. What she finds out will change her world forever . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this smart, compulsively readable novel, master storyteller Marie Rutkoski has crafted an utterly original world, characters you won‚Äôt soon forget, and a tale full of intrigue and suspense.¬† &lt;br&gt;¬†</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mila 2.0&lt;/em&gt; is the first book in an electrifying sci-fi thriller series about a teenage girl who discovers that she is an experiment in artificial intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mila was never meant to learn the truth about her identity. She was a girl living with her mother in a small Minnesota town. She was supposed to forget her past‚Äîthat she was built in a secret computer science lab and programmed to do things real people would never do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she has no choice but to run‚Äîfrom the dangerous operatives who want her terminated because she knows too much and from a mysterious group that wants to capture her alive and unlock her advanced technology. However, what Mila‚Äôs becoming is beyond anyone‚Äôs imagination, including her own, and it just might save her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mila 2.0&lt;/em&gt; is Debra Driza‚Äôs bold debut and the first book in a Bourne Identity-style trilogy that combines heart-pounding action with a riveting exploration of what it really means to be human. Fans of &lt;em&gt;I Am Number Four&lt;/em&gt; will love Mila for who she is and what she longs to be‚Äîand a cliffhanger ending will leave them breathlessly awaiting the sequel.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />I had a very difficult time rating this book. One one hand, I did relatively enjoy it. But on the other hand, it had a few issues that stuck out like an angry throne for the entire duration of the novel. So what does that exactly equate to? A big ol' pot of "meh" for the most part, but not to the...]]>

  <description>It's a night like any other on board the Icarus. Then, catastrophe strikes: the massive luxury spaceliner is yanked out of hyperspace and plummets into the nearest planet. Lilac LaRoux and Tarver Merendsen survive. And they seem to be alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilac is the daughter of the richest man in the universe. Tarver comes from nothing, a young war hero who learned long ago that girls like Lilac are more trouble than they're worth. But with only each other to rely on, Lilac and Tarver must work together, making a tortuous journey across the eerie, deserted terrain to seek help.</description>

      <![CDATA[More of a 3.5, I think. <br /><br />These Broken Stars is going to be a hit or miss for a lot of people because it‚Äôs a survival book that has the characters walking through the wilderness almost the entire book.

  <description>It is the year 2059. Several major world cities are under the control of a security force called Scion. Paige Mahoney works in the criminal underworld of Scion London, part of a secret cell known as the Seven Seals. The work she does is unusual: scouting for information by breaking into others‚Äô minds. Paige is a dreamwalker, a rare kind of clairvoyant, and in this world, the voyants commit treason simply by breathing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Paige is captured and arrested, she encounters a power more sinister even than Scion. The voyant prison is a separate city‚ÄîOxford, erased from the map two centuries ago and now controlled by a powerful, otherworldly race. These creatures, the Rephaim, value the voyants highly‚Äîas soldiers in their army.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paige is assigned to a Rephaite keeper, Warden, who will be in charge of her care and training. He is her master. Her natural enemy. But if she wants to regain her freedom, Paige will have to learn something of his mind and his own mysterious motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bone Season introduces a compelling heroine‚Äîa young woman learning to harness her powers in a world where everything has been taken from her. It also introduces an extraordinary young writer, with huge ambition and a teeming imagination. Samantha Shannon has created a bold new reality in this riveting debut.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Why be the sheep, when you can be the wolf?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ismae escapes from the brutality of an arranged marriage into the sanctuary of the convent of St. Mortain, where the sisters still serve the gods of old. Here she learns that the god of Death Himself has blessed her with dangerous gifts‚Äîand a violent destiny. If she chooses to stay at the convent, she will be trained as an assassin and serve as a handmaiden to Death. To claim her new life, she must destroy the lives of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ismae‚Äôs most important assignment takes her straight into the high court of Brittany‚Äîwhere she finds herself woefully under prepared‚Äînot only for the deadly games of intrigue and treason, but for the impossible choices she must make. For how can she deliver Death‚Äôs vengeance upon a target who, against her will, has stolen her heart?</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Actual rating 2.5 stars</strong><br /><br /><em>Grave Mercy</em> started out very strong for me with its historical roots. I instantly loved Ismae and could empathize with her bleak outlook on life.  The novel had strong characters, a good plot, and political intrigue. I mean, c'mon! An assassin nun?!

  <description>This stunning debut captures the grotesque madness of a mystical under-land, as well as a girl‚Äôs pangs of first love and independence. Alyssa Gardner hears the whispers of bugs and flowers‚Äîprecisely the affliction that landed her mother in a mental hospital years before. This family curse stretches back to her ancestor Alice Liddell, the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;. Alyssa might be crazy, but she manages to keep it together. For now.&lt;br&gt; When her mother‚Äôs mental health takes a turn for the worse, Alyssa learns that what she thought was fiction is based in terrifying reality. The real Wonderland is a place far darker and more twisted than Lewis Carroll ever let on. There, Alyssa must pass a series of tests, including draining an ocean of Alice‚Äôs tears, waking the slumbering tea party, and subduing a vicious bandersnatch, to fix Alice‚Äôs mistakes and save her family. She must also decide whom to trust: Jeb, her gorgeous best friend and secret crush, or the sexy but suspicious Morpheus, her guide through Wonderland, who may have dark motives of his own.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A powerful tale of magic, love, and revenge set in fairy-tale Japan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trained in the magical art of shadow-weaving, sixteen-year-old Suzume is able to re-create herself in any form - a fabulous gift for a girl desperate to escape her past. But who is she really? Is she a girl of noble birth living under the tyranny of her mother's new husband, Lord Terayama? Or a lowly drudge scraping a living in the ashes of Terayama's kitchens? Or is she Yue, the most beautiful courtesan in the Moonlit Lands? Whatever her true identity, Suzume is destined to use her skills to steal the heart of a prince in a revenge plot to destroy Terayama. And nothing will stop her, not even the one true aspect of her life- her love for a fellow shadow-weaver.</description>

  <description>In his characteristic heartwarming style, Patrick McDonnell tells the story of the young Jane Goodall and her special childhood toy chimpanzee named Jubilee. As the young Jane observes the natural world around her with wonder, she dreams of "a life living with and helping all animals," until one day she finds that her dream has come true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the world's most inspiring women, Dr. Jane Goodall is a renowned humanitarian, conservationist, animal activist, environmentalist, and United Nations Messenger of Peace. In 1977 she founded the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI), a global nonprofit organization that empowers people to make a difference for all living things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With anecdotes taken directly from Jane Goodall's autobiography, McDonnell makes this very true story accessible for the very young--and young at heart.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>All Miki Koishikawa wanted was an ordinary family and that's exactly what she had until her parents decided to move in with another couple (as in switching spouses!) and turned Miki's world upside down. Now she lives in a house with four parents and her totally cute stepbrother, Yuu. It's bad enough being brought into her parents' strange soap opera, but Miki will star in a soap of her own as she deals with friends having affairs, trying to survive in school and ending up torn between her long-time crush, Ginta, and her new stepbrother!</description>

  <description>In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she is released from prison to serve as the king's champion. Her name is Celaena Sardothien. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. But something evil dwells in the castle of glass--and it's there to kill. When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena's fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.</description>

For &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can any hope be salvaged from the ashes of their broken dream?</description>

  <description>"I did not choose to become this way. This corrupted, innocent body. Who in their right mind would willingly choose this life?

But when she uncovers a conspiracy bigger than the war that enslaved her in the first place, she is in for the fight of not only her life, but those around her she has grown to love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A dystopian novel exploring the themes of love, class, race, gender, and power.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />When I was a young girl in middle school I had a friend who loved to write. I'd always see her hunched over her many composition notebooks, fervently scribbling away. One day I asked her what she was writing and with a bemused look she simply replied, "Stories." This, of course, piqued my curiosi...]]>

  <description>Sex. After. Baby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These three words are whispered by mothers everywhere who find themselves stumped and shocked by the state of their sex lives. Naughty Mommy Heidi Raykeil has been down that road and chronicles her experiences in her online column Sex in the Suburbs. Raykeil knows firsthand that there are still plenty of things our mothers (and friends, and doctors) don‚Äôt tell us about motherhood, but that every mother should know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the media continues to bombard us with images of sex everywhere we turn, the reality for married couples with children today is much different. Do-it-all-moms seem to be doing everything except IT. Raykeil is out to change that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confessions of a Naughty Mommy&lt;/em&gt; is a funny, honest, and sexy account of Raykeil‚Äôs search for her missing libido‚Äîlost in action after she gave birth to her daughter. She takes readers along on her journey from mystified and frustrated new mom through the bumpy awkwardness of reigniting the home fires during naptime and date night to a newfound discovery and appreciation of sex after baby. With humor, grit, and style, she shares what has worked for her and her husband, as they balance their dual roles of parents and lovers.</description>

  <description>The faction-based society that Tris Prior once believed in is shattered‚Äîfractured by violence and power struggles and scarred by loss and betrayal. So when offered a chance to explore the world past the limits she‚Äôs known, Tris is ready. Perhaps beyond the fence, she and Tobias will find a simple new life together, free from complicated lies, tangled loyalties, and painful memories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tris‚Äôs new reality is even more alarming than the one she left behind. Old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless. Explosive new truths change the hearts of those she loves. And once again, Tris must battle to comprehend the complexities of human nature‚Äîand of herself‚Äîwhile facing impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice, and love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told from a riveting dual perspective, Allegiant, by #1 New York Times best-selling author Veronica Roth, brings the Divergent series to a powerful conclusion while revealing the secrets of the dystopian world that has captivated millions of readers in Divergent and Insurgent.</description>

      <![CDATA[My favorite of this series is still Divergent, but at least Allegiant wasn‚Äôt as boring and nonsensical as Insurgent. The biggest con for me was the dual point-of-views of Tris and Four because they sounded just alike and it was a chore to have to continually go back to the beginning of a chapter...]]>

  <description>Under the bubbling hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone National Park is a supervolcano. Most people don't know it's there. The caldera is so large that it can only be seen from a plane or satellite. It just could be overdue for an eruption, which would change the landscape and climate of our planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Alex, being left alone for the weekend means having the freedom to play computer games and hang out with his friends without hassle from his mother. Then the Yellowstone supervolcano erupts, plunging his hometown into a nightmare of darkness, ash, and violence. Alex begins a harrowing trek to seach for his family and finds help in Darla, a travel partner he meets along the way. Together they must find the strength and skills to survive and outlast an epic disaster.</description>

  <description>What was once the western United States is now home to the Republic, a nation perpetually at war with its neighbors. Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a prodigy being groomed for success in the Republic's highest military circles. Born into the slums, fifteen-year-old Day is the country's most wanted criminal. But his motives may not be as malicious as they seem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From very different worlds, June and Day have no reason to cross paths - until the day June's brother, Metias, is murdered and Day becomes the prime suspect. Caught in the ultimate game of cat and mouse, Day is in a race for his family's survival, while June seeks to avenge Metias's death. But in a shocking turn of events, the two uncover the truth of what has really brought them together, and the sinister lengths their country will go to keep its secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of nonstop action, suspense, and romance, this novel is sure to move readers as much as it thrills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;¬©2011 Marie Lu (P)2011 Penguin Audio</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Where do you go when nowhere is safe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen years after a deadly virus wiped out most of Earth‚Äôs population, the world is a perilous place. Eighteen-year-old Eve has never been beyond the heavily guarded perimeter of her school, where she and two hundred other orphaned girls have been promised a future as the teachers and artists of the New America. But the night before graduation, Eve learns the shocking truth about her school‚Äôs real purpose‚Äîand the horrifying fate that awaits her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing the only home she‚Äôs ever known, Eve sets off on a long, treacherous journey, searching for a place she can survive. Along the way she encounters Arden, her former rival from school, and Caleb, a rough, rebellious boy living in the wild. Separated from men her whole life, Eve has been taught to fear them, but Caleb slowly wins her trust... and her heart. He promises to protect her, but when soldiers begin hunting them, Eve must choose between true love and her life.</description>

  <description>At a time when society conforms to the strictest rules and most proper etiquette, sixteen-year-old Camille Kennecott and her guardian, Dr. Bennett, live a most unconventional life. They hunt werewolves.When unwitting victim, Nathaniel Strider, wanders into one of their full moon pursuits, Camille and Dr. Bennett believe they have found a specimen for their study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding a scientific key to unlocking the mystery of lycanthropy would end their late night excursions. Yet beneath the irresistible exterior, Nathaniel is transforming into a flesh-tearing monster, and as each experiment fails, Camille loses another inch of her soul to him. In a month‚Äôs time, she must face the prospect of destroying the boy who has stolen her heart.</description>

  <description>New York City has been decimated by war and plague, and most of civilization has migrated to underground enclaves, where life expectancy is no more than the early 20's. When Deuce turns 15, she takes on her role as a Huntress, and is paired with Fade, a teenage Hunter who lived Topside as a young boy. When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been decimated by the tunnel monsters - or Freaks - who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to warnings. And when Deuce and Fade are exiled from the enclave, the girl born in darkness must survive in daylight - guided by Fade's long-ago memories - in the ruins of a city whose population has dwindled to a few dangerous gangs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ann Aguirre's thrilling young adult novel is the story of two young people in an apocalyptic world- - facing dangers, and feelings, unlike any they've ever known.</description>

  <description>Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires. They protect vampire secrets‚Äîand human lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Sydney would love to go to college, but instead, she‚Äôs been sent into hiding at a posh boarding school in Palm Springs, California‚Äìtasked with protecting Moroi princess Jill Dragomir from assassins who want to throw the Moroi court into civil war. Formerly in disgrace, Sydney is now praised for her loyalty and obedience, and held up as the model of an exemplary Alchemist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But the closer she grows to Jill, Eddie, and especially Adrian, the more she finds herself questioning her age‚Äìold Alchemist beliefs, her idea of family, and the sense of what it means to truly belong. Her world becomes even more complicated when magical experiments show Sydney may hold the key to prevent becoming Strigoi‚Äîthe fiercest vampires, the ones who don‚Äôt die. But it‚Äôs her fear of being just that‚Äîspecial, magical, powerful‚Äîthat scares her more than anything. Equally daunting is her new romance with Brayden, a cute, brainy guy who seems to be her match in every way. Yet, as perfect as he seems, Sydney finds herself being drawn to someone else‚Äîsomeone forbidden to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When a shocking secret threatens to tear the vampire world apart, Sydney‚Äôs loyalties are suddenly tested more than ever before. She wonders how she's supposed to strike a balance between the principles and dogmas she's been taught, and what her instincts are now telling her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Should she trust the Alchemists‚Äîor her heart?</description>

  <description>For seventeen-year-old Janie, getting sucked into other people's dreams is getting old. Especially the falling dreams, the naked-but-nobody-notices dreams, and the sex-crazed dreams. Janie's seen enough fantasy booty to last her a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;She can't tell anybody about what she does they'd never believe her, or worse, they'd think she's a freak. So Janie lives on the fringe, cursed with an ability she doesn't want and can‚Äôt control.&lt;br&gt;Then she falls into a gruesome nightmare, one that chills her to the bone. For the first time, Janie is more than a witness to someone else's twisted psyche. She is a participant.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;SOME NIGHTMARES NEVER END.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Janie and Cabel, real life is getting tougher than the dreams. They're just trying to carve out a little (secret) time together, but no such luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disturbing things are happening at Fieldridge High, yet nobody's talking. When Janie taps into a classmate's violent nightmares, the case finally breaks open -- but nothing goes as planned. Not even close. Janie's in way over her head, and Cabe's shocking behavior has grave consequences for them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worse yet, Janie learns the truth about herself and her ability -- and it's bleak. Seriously, brutally bleak. Not only is her fate as a dream catcher sealed, but what's to come is way darker than she'd feared....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the inside of ISBN 1416953582/9781416953586&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Once a century, one person is chosen for greatness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elisa is the chosen one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she is also the younger of two princesses, the one who has never done anything remarkable. She can't see how she ever will. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, on her sixteenth birthday, she has become the secret wife of a handsome and worldly king‚Äîa king whose country is in turmoil. A king who needs the chosen one, not a failure of a princess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he's not the only one who seeks her. Savage enemies seething with dark magic are hunting her. A daring, determined revolutionary thinks she could be his people's savior. And he looks at her in a way that no man has ever looked at her before. Soon it is not just her life, but her very heart that is at stake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elisa could be everything to those who need her most. If the prophecy is fulfilled. If she finds the power deep within herself. If she doesn't die young.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the chosen do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unabridged recording on 10 CDs (12 hours, 9 minutes).&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Ash, former prince of the Winter Court, gave up everything. His title, his home, even his vow of loyalty. All for a girl‚Ä¶ and all for nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless he can earn a soul.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To cold, emotionless faery prince Ash, love was a weakness for mortals and fools. His own love had died a horrible death, killing any gentler feelings the Winter prince might have had. Or so he thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Meghan Chase‚Äîa half human, half fey slip of a girl‚Äî smashed through his barricades, binding him to her irrevocably with his oath to be her knight. And when all of Faery nearly fell to the Iron fey, she severed their bond to save his life. Meghan is now the Iron Queen, ruler of a realm where no Winter or Summer fey can survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the (unwelcome) company of his archrival, Summer Court prankster Puck, and the infuriating cait sith Grimalkin, Ash begins a journey he is bound to see through to its end‚Äî a quest to find a way to honor his solemn vow to stand by Meghan‚Äôs side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To survive in the Iron realm, Ash must have a soul and a mortal body. But the tests he must face to earn these things are impossible. At least, no one has ever passed to tell the tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Ash learns something that changes everything. A truth that turns reality upside down, challenges his darkest beliefs and shows him that, sometimes, it takes more than courage to make the ultimate sacrifice.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: Lena Haloway is content in her safe, government-managed society. She feels (mostly) relaxed about the future in which her husband and career will be decided, and looks forward to turning 18, when she‚Äôll be cured of deliria, a.k.a. love. She tries not to think about her mother‚Äôs suicide (her last words to Lena were a forbidden ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù) or the supposed ‚ÄúInvalid‚Äù community made up of the uncured just beyond her Portland, Maine, border. There‚Äôs no real point‚Äîshe believes her government knows how to best protect its people, and should do so at any cost. But 95 days before her cure, Lena meets Alex, a confident and mysterious young man who makes her heart flutter and her skin turn red-hot. As their romance blossoms, Lena begins to doubt the intentions of those in power, and fears that her world will turn gray should she submit to the procedure. In this powerful and beautifully written novel, Lauren Oliver, the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt;, throws readers into a tightly controlled society where options don‚Äôt exist, and shows not only the lengths one will go for a chance at freedom, but also the true meaning of sacrifice. --&lt;em&gt;Jessica Schein&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lauren Oliver‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; Playlist &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117060.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117061.jpg" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, the government requires that all teenagers be cured of love, a.k.a. deliria, to keep society safe. But 95 days before her treatment, Lena Haloway falls for a boy--and must face the truth about her own feelings and the world in which she lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this exclusive playlist, Lauren Oliver shares the songs that capture this haunting novel about the power of love and what one will risk in order to keep it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Gayle Forman and Lauren Oliver: Author One-on-One&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gayle Forman is is a self-described "perpetual teenager" and an award-winning author and journalist whose articles have appeared in numerous publications. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and children.  She is the author of &lt;em&gt;Where She Went&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;.  Recently she sat down with Lauren Oliver to discuss their work. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Lauren interviewed Gayle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Gayle Forman&lt;/em&gt;: Lauren Oliver is kind of mind-blowing. She wrote her intensely moving debut, Before I Fall when she was 26, which seems impossible given the book‚Äôs depth and wisdom. She followed up with the deliciously provocative love story &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, the first of a trilogy, and her first middle-grade book, &lt;em&gt;Liesl &amp;amp; Po&lt;/em&gt; comes out in the fall of 2011. On top of that, she‚Äôs constantly cooking up book ideas for her literary development company. Somehow, she managed to slow down long enough for us to talk shop over lunch in our mutual hometown, Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img alt="Gayle Forman" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117062.gif" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; You have like 100 balls in the air. Are you one of those people who thrives on an insane amount of activity?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôve been busy and overextended my whole life. I wrote half of &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; while I had a full-time job, was a full-time grad student, and worked part-time in a nightclub. I wrote the first half of the book on my phone on the subway. I‚Äôd email the chapters to myself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; You wrote the book on your phone?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs very rare that I write on my computer. A lot of times I‚Äôm writing on subways or in the back of cabs or on airplanes. I know the exact quantity of lines on my BlackBerry and how it relates to word count.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that brings me right to my question about process. How does an idea become a book for you? How did &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; arrive?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôd read an essay by Gabriel Garcia Marquez that said that all great books are either about death or love and I‚Äôd already written about death. And I started thinking that I‚Äôd never written a love story. It was out of my comfort zone. The next day I was at the gym, and the TV was on and the news report was all about the swine flu epidemic. It was the latest in the flu scares. And I thought it was so weird how easily people become panicked. You can convince people that anything is an epidemic. So much is propaganda. And the two ideas just combined in my head. And the character of Lena started narrating immediately.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;img alt="Lauren Oliver" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380736759/3117063.gif" class="escapedImg"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Moral of the story, budding writers: Go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of my breakthrough ideas come at the gym or while showering.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Me too!  And I‚Äôll run out and start writing and be dripping in a towel.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôve actually ruined computers that way. I think what happens is punctuated equilibrium: a period when changes are accumulating but not visibly, the simmering is happening. Then, when your mind is very relaxed, what was unconscious becomes conscious.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; On the surface, there‚Äôs a very big leap between your first two books. &lt;em&gt;Before I Fall&lt;/em&gt; follows Sam, a prototypical mean girl who has to relive the last day of her life while &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; follows Lena who lives in a creepy world in which love has been outlawed. But really, both of these girls start out conformists and challenge the constraints on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Transformation is very important to me. I definitely am very interested in how people become who they are. In change. In characters who are damaged who and who feel initially unlovable‚Äîand in their redemption through feelings of love.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Who are you more like, Lena or Sam?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; Sam is more similar to how I was in high school. I was rebellious. I went out and partied and did all the bad things that she did. Lena is just‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs so obedient and so scared of doing anything wrong. I was so fond of her. I kind of loved her in this way, I felt so protective of her. She‚Äôs so fragile and also brave.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; That was exactly how I felt about Mia in &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt;. I loved the strength of both Sam and Lena, in relation to their love interests. Even in &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;, where Alex is the one who sparks Lena‚Äôs rebellion, she‚Äôs no damsel in distress.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I don‚Äôt believe in damsels. That‚Äôs not a model of femininity or heroism I subscribe to. Everyone has to learn to save themselves. It can be through the mechanisms of loving other people but you have to learn to save yourself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gayle:&lt;/strong&gt; Dystopian fiction is very hot right now. Did you have any idea you‚Äôd be on the cutting edge of this trend?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren:&lt;/strong&gt; I never heard that word when I wrote &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt;. I mean, I knew what it meant but not as a category. &lt;em&gt;Delirium&lt;/em&gt; is supposed to be a meditation on love, what it does, good and bad. Because there have been times when if I could have reached inside to take out my own heart out, I would‚Äôve. Books can‚Äôt come from categories; they come from a desire to say something about the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />I really wanted to love this book. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it just didn't add up to the hype I thought it would. I would say I give it more of 3 1/2 stars. <br /><br />Delirium is about a girl name Lena who lives in a future where love is considered a disease.  At 18 everyone under goes surgery...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Send the messengers for the Faery Courts. This is the end.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Summer King is missing; the Dark Court is bleeding; and a stranger walks the streets of Huntsdale, his presence signifying the deaths of powerful fey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislinn tends to the Summer Court, searching for her absent king and yearning for Seth. Torn between his new queen and his old love, Keenan works from afar to strengthen his court against the coming war. Donia longs for fiery passion even as she coolly readies the Winter Court for battle. And Seth, sworn brother of the Dark King and heir to the High Queen, is about to make a mistake that could cost his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love, despair, and betrayal ignite the Faery Courts, and in the final conflict, some will win...and some will lose &lt;em&gt;everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thrilling conclusion to Melissa Marr's &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Wicked Lovely series will leave readers breathless.</description>

  <description>Hunger for nourishment.Hunger for touch.Hunger to belong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half-human and half-faery, Ani is driven by her hungers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those same appetites also attract powerful enemies and uncertain allies, including Devlin. He was created as an assassin and is brother to the faeries' coolly logical High Queen and to her chaotic twin, the embodiment of War. Devlin wants to keep Ani safe from his sisters, knowing that if he fails, he will be the instrument of Ani's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ani isn't one to be guarded while others fight battles for her, though. She has the courage to protect herself and the ability to alter Devlin's plans--and his life. The two are drawn together, each with reason to fear the other and to fear for one another. But as they grow closer, a larger threat imperils the whole of Faerie. Will saving the faery realm mean losing each other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alluring romance, heart-stopping danger, and sinister intrigue combine in the penultimate volume of Melissa Marr's New York Times bestselling Wicked Lovely series.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Unbeknownst to mortals&lt;/em&gt;, a power struggle is unfolding in a world of shadows and danger. After centuries of stability, the balance among the Faery Courts has altered, and Irial, ruler of the Dark Court, is battling to hold his rebellious and newly vulnerable fey together. If he fails, bloodshed and brutality will follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Leslie knows nothing of faeries or their intrigues. When she is attracted to an eerily beautiful tattoo of eyes and wings, all she knows is that she has to have it, convinced it is a tangible symbol of changes she desperately craves for her own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tattoo &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; bring changes - not the kind Leslie has dreamed of, but sinister, compelling changes that are more than symbolic. Those changes will bind Leslie and Irial together, drawing Leslie deeper and deeper into the faery world, unable to resist its allures, and helpless to withstand its perils....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melissa Marr continues her tales of Faerie in a dark, ravishing story of temptation and consequences, and of heroism when least expected.</description>

  <description>Rule #3: &lt;em&gt;Don't stare at invisible faeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislinn has always seen faeries. Powerful and dangerous, they walk hidden in the mortal world. Aislinn fears their cruelty - especially if they learn of her Sight - and wishes she were as blind to their presence as other teens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #2: &lt;em&gt;Don't speak to invisible faeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now faeries are stalking her. One of them, Keenan, who is equal parts terrifying and alluring, is trying to talk to her, asking questions Aislinn is afraid to answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rule #1: &lt;em&gt;Don't ever attract their attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's too late. Keenan is the Summer King, who has sought his queen for nine centuries. Without her, summer itself will perish. He is determined that Aislinn will become the Summer Queen at any cost ‚Äî regardless of her plans or desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly none of the rules that have kept Aislinn safe are working anymore, and everything is on the line: her freedom; her best friend, Seth; her life; everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faery intrigue, mortal love, and the clash of ancient rules and modern expectations swirl together in Melissa Marr's stunning twenty-first-century faery tale.</description>

  <description>Zara is at the center of an all-out war, and an impending apocalypse. True, she's successfully rescued Nick from Valhalla, but it simply isn't enough. Bedford is being ravaged by evil pixies and they need much more than one great warrior; they need an army. Zara isn't sure what her role is anymore. She's not just fighting for her friends, she's also a pixie queen. And to align her team of pixies with the humans she loves will be one of her greatest battles yet. Especially since she can't even reconcile her growing feelings for her pixie king...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unexpected turns, surprising revelations, and one utterly satisfying romantic finale make "Endure "a thrilling end to this series of bestsellers.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />The <em>Need</em> series has been a guilty pleasure of mine since book one due to the highly entertaining dialogue, the very unique characters and story line Carrie Jones created. After all, pixies aren't a paranormal creature I see a lot in the YA genre. Couple that with the use of Norse god mythology an...]]>

  <description>Zara and Nick are soul mates, meant to be together for ever. But that's not quite how things have worked out. For starters, Nick has gone. He has been taken to the mythical place for warriors known as Valhalla. Zara and her friends might be able to get him back, it's just not going to be easy. Meanwhile a group of evil pixies is devastating Bedford, with more teens going missing every day. An all-out war seems imminent, and the good guys need all the warriors they can find. But even if Zara and her friends do discover the route to Valhalla, there's that other small problem: Zara's been pixie kissed. When she finds Nick, will he even want to go with her? Especially since she hasn't turned into just any pixie... She's Astley's queen.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He smiles. It's a wicked smile. Kind but not kind. Handsome but dangerous. Feral almost. I can see why Nick nearly killed him, Nick...&lt;br&gt;I ask again, "Why were you in the road?"&lt;br&gt;"I was waiting for you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zara and her friends thought they'd solved the pixie problem. And they did - sort of. The pixie's are all locked away, deep in the woods. But the king's needs grow stronger each day that he is in captivity, while his control over his people weakens. And it's enough to draw a new king into town. Astley claims he is different. He claims there are pixies who can live peacefully with humans, that it doesn't have to be all violence and nastiness all the time. Zara wants to believe him...until Astley also claims that she is fated to be his queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no way Zara would ever turn pixie. And she's got good friends who will make sure of that. Besides, she and Nick are so in love they're practically inseparable. But when they very thing Zara wants to protect most is exactly what's at risk, she is forced to make choices she never imagined....</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Pain shoots through my head. Fireworks. Explosions. All inside my brain. The white world goes dark and I know what's about to happen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zara White suspects there's a freaky guy semi-stalking her. She's also obsessed with phobias. And it's true, she hasn't exactly been herself since her stepfather died. But exiling her to shivery Maine to live with her grandmother? That seems a bit extreme. The move is supposed to help her stay sane...but Zara's pretty sure her mom just can't deal with her right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She couldn't be more wrong. Turns out the semi-stalker is not a figment of Zara's overactive imagination. In fact, he's still following her, leaving behind an eerie trail of gold dust. There's something not right - not human - in this sleepy Maine town, and all signs point to Zara.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this creepy, compelling breakout novel, Carrie Jones delivers romance, suspense, and a creature you never thought you'd have to fear.</description>

With a head plagued by hallucinations, a medicine cabinet full of pills, and a closet stuffed with frilly, violet dresses, Hanna‚Äôs tired of being the outcast, the weird girl, the freak. So she runs away to Portero, Texas in search of a new home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Portero is a stranger town than Hanna expects. As she tries to make a place for herself, she discovers dark secrets that would terrify any normal soul. Good thing for Hanna, she‚Äôs far from normal. As this crazy girl meets an even crazier town, only two things are certain: Anything can happen and no one is safe.</description>

  <description>Cassia has always trusted the Society to make the right choices for her: what to read, what to watch, what to believe. So when Xander's face appears on-screen at her Matching ceremony, Cassia knows with complete certainty that he is her ideal mate... until she sees Ky Markham's face flash for an instant before the screen fades to black.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Society tells her it's a glitch, a rare malfunction, and that she should focus on the happy life she's destined to lead with Xander. But Cassia can't stop thinking about Ky, and as they slowly fall in love, Cassia begins to doubt the Society's infallibility and is faced with an impossible choice: between Xander and Ky, between the only life she's known and a path that no one else has dared to follow.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something Edward didn't want me to know. Something Jacob wouldn't have kept from me...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was never going to end, was it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Seattle is ravaged by a string of mysterious killings and a malicious vampire continues her quest for revenge, Bella once again finds herself surrounded by danger. In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob - knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make: life or death. But which is which?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Bianca wants to escape.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's been uprooted from her small hometown and enrolled at Evernight Academy, an eerie Gothic boarding school where the students are somehow too perfect: smart, sleek, and almost predatory. Bianca knows she doesn't fit in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Lucas. He's not the "Evernight type" either, and he likes it that way. Lucas ignores the rules, stands up to the snobs, and warns Bianca to be careful‚Äîeven when it comes to caring about him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I couldn't stand it if they took it out on you,"&lt;/em&gt; he tells Bianca, &lt;em&gt;"and eventually they would." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the connection between Bianca and Lucas can't be denied. Bianca will risk anything to be with Lucas, but dark secrets are fated to tear them apart . . . and to make Bianca question everything she's ever believed.</description>

  <description>To save her mother's life, Clary must travel to the City of Glass, the ancestral home of the Shadowhunters - never mind that entering the city without permission is against the Law, and breaking the Law could mean death. To make things worse, she learns that Jace does not want her there, and Simon has been thrown in prison by the Shadowhunters, who are deeply suspicious of a vampire who can withstand sunlight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Clary uncovers more about her family's past, she finds an ally in mysterious Shadowhunter Sebastian.

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;then.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sam met Grace, he was a wolf and she was a girl. Eventually he found a way to become a boy, and their loved moved from curious distance to the intense closeness of shared lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That should have been the end of their story. But Grace was not meant to stay human. Now she is the wolf. And the wolves of Mercy Falls are about to be killed in one final, spectacular hunt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam would do anything for Grace. But can one boy and one love really change a hostile, predatory world? The past, the present, and the future are about to collide in one pure moment - a moment of death or life, farewell or forever.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />Actual rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />In a recent Q&amp;A discussion, Maggie Stiefvater mentioned that she loves to write books that will make you cry your little eyes out. And I did...for <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6068551.Shiver" title="Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater">Shiver</a>. I'm not sure what it is, but <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6654313.Linger" title="Linger by Maggie Stiefvater">Linger</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409458.Forever" title="Forever by Maggie Stiefvater">Forever</a> just did not string up the same emotions.  Did I enjoy them? Sure....]]>

  <description>Sixteen-year-old Deirdre Monaghan is a painfully shy but prodigiously gifted musician. She's about to find out she's also a cloverhand‚Äîone who can see faeries. Deirdre finds herself infatuated with a mysterious boy who enters her ordinary suburban life, seemingly out of thin air. Trouble is, the enigmatic and gorgeous Luke turns out to be a gallowglass‚Äîa soulless faerie assassin. An equally hunky‚Äîand equally dangerous‚Äîdark faerie soldier named Aodhan is also stalking Deirdre. Sworn enemies, Luke and Aodhan each have a deadly assignment from the Faerie Queen. Namely, kill Deirdre before her music captures the attention of the Fae and threatens the Queen's sovereignty. Caught in the crossfire with Deirdre is James, her wisecracking but loyal best friend. Deirdre had been wishing her life weren't so dull, but getting trapped in the middle of a centuries-old faerie war isn't exactly what she had in mind . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lament is a dark faerie fantasy that features authentic Celtic faerie lore, plus cover art and interior illustrations by acclaimed faerie artist Julia Jeffrey.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;They come first.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My vision was growing dimmer, the blackness and ghosts closing in. I swore it was like I could hear Robert whispering in my ear: &lt;em&gt;The world of the dead won't give you up a second time.&lt;/em&gt; Just before the light completely vanished, I saw Dimitri's face join Lissa's. I wanted to smile. I decided then that if the two people I loved most were safe, I could leave this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dead could finally have me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose Hathaway has always played by her own rules.&lt;/strong&gt; She broke the law when she ran away from St. Vladimir's Academy with her best friend and last surviving Dragomir princess, Lissa. She broke the law when she fell in love with her gorgeous, off-limits instructor, Dimitri. And she dared to defy Queen Tatiana, leader of the Moroi world, risking her life and reputation to protect generations of dhampir guardians to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the law has finally caught up with Rose - for a crime she didn't even commit. She's in prison for the highest offense imaginable: the assassination of a monarch. She'll need help from both Dimitri and Adrian to find the one living person who can stall her execution and force the Moroi elite to acknowledge a shocking new candidate for the royal throne: Vasilisa Dragomir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the clock on Rose's life is running out. Rose knows in her heart the world of the dead wants her back...and this time she is truly out of second chances. The big question is, when your whole life is about saving others, who will save you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Rose, Dimitri, Adrian, and Lissa in &lt;em&gt;Last Sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;, the epic, unforgettable finale to Richelle Mead's international #1 bestselling &lt;em&gt;Vampire Academy&lt;/em&gt; series.</description>

  <description>Rose Hathaway's life will never be the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recent attack on St. Vladimir's Academy devastated the entire Moroi world. Many are dead. And, for the few victims carried off by Strigoi, their fates are even worse. A rare tattoo now adorns Rose's neck, a mark that says she's killed far too many Strigoi to count. But only one victim matters ... Dimitri Belikov. Rose must now choose one of two very different paths: honoring her life's vow to protect Lissa‚Äîher best friend and the last surviving Dragomir princess‚Äîor, dropping out of the Academy to strike out on her own and hunt down the man she loves. She'll have to go to the ends of the earth to find Dimitri and keep the promise he begged her to make. But the question is, when the time comes, will he want to be saved? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, with everything at stake‚Äîand worlds away from St. Vladimir's and her unguarded, vulnerable, and newly rebellious best friend‚Äîcan Rose find the strength to destroy Dimitri? Or, will she sacrifice herself for a chance at eternal love?</description>

  <description>Much has changed since autumn, when Kelley Winslow learned she was a Faerie princess, fell in love with changeling guard Sonny Flannery, and saved the mortal realm from the ravages of the Wild Hunt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Kelley is stuck in New York City, rehearsing Romeo and Juliet and missing Sonny more with every stage kiss, while Sonny has been forced back to the Otherworld and into a deadly game of cat and mouse with the remaining Hunters and Queen Mabh herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a terrifying encounter sends Kelley tumbling into the Otherworld, her reunion with Sonny is joyful but destined to be cut short. An ancient, hidden magick is stirring, and a dangerous new enemy is willing to risk everything to claim that power. &lt;br&gt;Caught in a web of Faerie deception and shifting allegiances, Kelley and Sonny must tread carefully, for each next step could topple a kingdom . . . or tear them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With breathtakingly high stakes, the talented Lesley Livingston delivers soaring romance and vividly magical characters in &lt;em&gt;Darklight&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the trilogy that began with &lt;em&gt;Wondrous Strange&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>17 year-old Kelley Winslow doesn‚Äôt believe in Faeries. Not unless they‚Äôre the kind that you find in a theatre, spouting Shakespeare‚Äîthe kind that Kelley so desperately wishes she could be: onstage, under lights, with a pair of sparkly wings strapped to her shoulders. But as the understudy in a two-bit, hopelessly off-off-Broadway production of A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream, wishing is probably the closest she‚Äôs going to get to becoming a Faerie Queen. At least, that‚Äôs what she thinks... In this fun, urban fantasy, Kelley's off-stage life suddenly becomes as complicated as one of Shakespeare‚Äôs plot twists when a nighttime trip to Central Park holds more than meets the mortal eye.</description>

  <description>Warning: This is a tale of monster sex. This story was written to unlock your darkest fantasies and innermost desires. It is not for the faint of heart and is not your mother's erotica. All of the sexual descriptions found in this book are very explicit in nature. It's not suitable for someone under 18 years of age. Read at your own risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a land before time, Layla hunts for her tribe. The men belittle and threaten her, a woman who hunts like a man, until, desperate, she sets out alone after the most fearsome beast in the world- a T-Rex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she hunts the giant predator, a very special T-Rex is hunting her- this T-Rex has psychic powers and a desire for human flesh. Naked and alone, Layla bargains with the beast: her body for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Layla accept the beast‚Äôs carnal demands? Can her body accommodate its relentless desire? Can she hold to her part of the bargain? Or will she become the T-Rex‚Äôs next meal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words: 5,200</description>

  <description>London, 2218 A.D. Seventeen-year-old Zee is an intern empath. She‚Äôs focused on her job, poised for a great career‚Äîuntil one day an attractive patient undoes her hard-earned calm. As an empath, she cannot afford such distractions, but neither can she stay away from David, even when she discovers he‚Äôs one of a mysterious alien race. As London comes under attack by anarchist bombings, and as Zee struggles to get a handle on her unusually strong psychic abilities, David starts pulling away. Although Zee‚Äôs sure he‚Äôs attracted to her, David has secrets he cannot share. But it‚Äôs too late for Zee. She‚Äôs losing her heart to the gray-eyed alien boy, and she‚Äôs determined to follow him‚Äîno matter how far it may take her.</description>

  <description>A laugh-out-loud, bittersweet debut full of wit, wisdom, heart, and a hilarious, unforgettable heroine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you‚Äôre a hypochondriac, there are a million different things that could be wrong with you, but for Izzy, focusing on what &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be wrong might be keeping her from dealing with what‚Äôs &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I almost raised my hand, but what would I say?&lt;/em&gt; ‚ÄúMr. Bayer, may I please be excused? I‚Äôm not totally positive, but I think I might have cancer.‚Äù &lt;em&gt;No way. Then everyone at school would know, and they would treat me differently, and I would be known as ‚ÄúIzzy, that poor girl who diagnosed herself with breast cancer during biology.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Izzy‚Äôs sense of humor can only get her so far when suddenly her best friend appears to have undergone a personality transplant, her mother‚Äôs health takes a turn for the worse, and her beautiful maybe-boyfriend is going all hot and cold. Izzy thinks she‚Äôs preparing for the worst-case scenario, but when the worst-case scenario actually hits, it‚Äôs a different story altogether‚Äîand there‚Äôs no tidy list of symptoms to help her through the insanity.</description>

  <description>Ellie Watt is used to starting over. The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents' latest scam. Now she's much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for - Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. Ellie's counting on Camden still being in love with her but what she's not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers Ellie's plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesn't dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and it's one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**WARNING** This book contains graphic language, sex and violence. Readers who are sensitive to sexual scenes, violence and a lot of cursing should refrain from reading this book.This is not YA or NA. 18 and above.</description>

  <description>‚ÄòBetter to reign in Hell, than serve in Heav‚Äôn ‚Ä¶‚Äô&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/em&gt;, Milton produced poem of epic scale, conjuring up a vast, awe-inspiring cosmos and ranging across huge tracts of space and time. And yet, in putting a charismatic Satan and naked Adam and Eve at the centre of this story, he also created an intensely human tragedy on the Fall of Man. Written when Milton was in his fifties ‚Äì blind, bitterly disappointed by the Restoration and briefly in danger of execution ‚Äì Paradise Lost‚Äôs apparent ambivalence towards authority has led to intense debate about whether it manages to ‚Äòjustify the ways of God to men‚Äô, or exposes the cruelty of Christianity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Leonard‚Äôs revised edition of Paradise Lost contains full notes, elucidating Milton‚Äôs biblical, classical and historical allusions and discussing his vivid, highly original use of language and blank verse.</description>

  <description>Set in the harsh Puritan community of seventeenth-century Boston, this tale of an adulterous entanglement that results in an illegitimate birth reveals Nathaniel Hawthorne's concerns with the tension between the public and the private selves. Publicly disgraced and ostracized, Hester Prynne draws on her inner strength and certainty of spirit to emerge as the first true heroine of American fiction. Arthur Dimmesdale, trapped by the rules of society, stands as a classic study of a self divided.</description>

  <description>When Freedom Airlines flight 121 went down over the Pacific Ocean, no one ever expected to find survivors. Which is why the sixteen-year-old girl discovered floating among the wreckage‚Äîalive‚Äîis making headlines across the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even more strange is that her body is miraculously unharmed and she has no memories of boarding the plane. She has no memories of her life before the crash. She has no memories &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt;. No one knows how she survived. No one knows why she wasn‚Äôt on the passenger manifest. And no one can explain why her DNA and fingerprints can‚Äôt be found in a single database in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crippled by a world she doesn‚Äôt know, plagued by abilities she doesn‚Äôt understand, and haunted by a looming threat she can‚Äôt remember, Seraphina struggles to piece together her forgotten past and discover who she really is. But with every clue only comes more questions. And she‚Äôs running out of time to answer them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her only hope is a strangely alluring boy who claims to know her from before the crash. Who claims they were in love. But can she really trust him? And will he be able to protect her from the people who have been making her forget?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From popular young adult author Jessica Brody comes a compelling and suspenseful new sci-fi series, set in a world where science knows no boundaries, memories are manipulated, and true love can never be forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The greatest warrior in all of the Seven Kingdoms... is a girl with yellow eyes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kira‚Äôs the only female in the king‚Äôs army, and the prince‚Äôs bodyguard. She‚Äôs a demon slayer and an outcast, hated by nearly everyone in her home city of Hansong. And, she‚Äôs their only hope...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Murdered kings and discovered traitors point to a demon invasion, sending Kira on the run with the young prince. He may be the savior predicted in the Dragon King Prophecy, but the missing treasure of myth may be the true key. With only the guidance of the cryptic prophecy, Kira must battle demon soldiers, evil shaman, and the Demon Lord himself to find what was once lost and raise a prince into a king.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intrigue and mystery, ancient lore and action-packed fantasy come together in this heart-stopping first book in a trilogy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"Downton Abbey" meets The Selection in this dystopian tale of love and betrayal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Madeline Landry is practically Gentry royalty. Her ancestor developed the nuclear energy that has replaced electricity, and her parents exemplify the glamour of the upper class. As for Madeline, she would much rather read a book than attend yet another debutante ball. But when she learns about the devastating impact the Gentry lifestyle‚Äîher lifestyle‚Äîis having on those less fortunate, her whole world is turned upside down. As Madeline begins to question everything she has been told, she finds herself increasingly drawn to handsome, beguiling David Dana, who seems to be hiding secrets of his own. Soon, rumors of war and rebellion start to spread, and Madeline finds herself at the center of it all. Ultimately, she must make a choice between duty‚Äîher family and the estate she loves dearly‚Äîand desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fans of Ally Condie, Kiera Cass, Veronica Roth, and even Jane Austen will be enthralled by this breathtaking read.</description>

  <description>Kami Glass loves someone she‚Äôs never met . . . a boy she‚Äôs talked to in her head ever since she was born. She wasn‚Äôt silent about her imaginary friend during her childhood, and is thus a bit of an outsider in her sleepy English town of Sorry-in-the-Vale. Still, Kami hasn‚Äôt suffered too much from not fitting in. She has a best friend, runs the school newspaper, and is only occasionally caught talking to herself. Her life is in order, just the way she likes it, despite the voice in her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all that changes when the Lynburns return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lynburn family has owned the spectacular and sinister manor that overlooks Sorry-in-the-Vale for centuries. The mysterious twin sisters who abandoned their ancestral home a generation ago are back, along with their teenage sons, Jared and Ash, one of whom is eerily familiar to Kami. Kami is not one to shy away from the unknown‚Äîin fact, she‚Äôs determined to find answers for all the questions Sorry-in-the-Vale is suddenly posing. Who is responsible for the bloody deeds in the depths of the woods? What is her own mother hiding? And now that her imaginary friend has become a real boy, does she still love him? Does she hate him? Can she trust him?</description>

After my co-blogger, Kat, set us up on that blind date, urging me to give you a go, I thought for sure we would hit it off nicely. And for a minute we d...]]>

  <description>Don't Sweat. Don't Laugh. Don't draw attention to yourself. And most of all, whatever you do, do not fall in love with one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gene is different from everyone else around him. He can't run with lightning speed, sunlight doesn't hurt him and he doesn't have an unquenchable lust for blood. Gene is a human, and he knows the rules. Keep the truth a secret. It's the only way to stay alive in a world of night--a world where humans are considered a delicacy and hunted for their blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he's chosen for a once in a lifetime opportunity to hunt the last remaining humans, Gene's carefully constructed life begins to crumble around him. He's thrust into the path of a girl who makes him feel things he never thought possible--and into a ruthless pack of hunters whose suspicions about his true nature are growing. Now that Gene has finally found something worth fighting for, his need to survive is stronger than ever--but is it worth the cost of his humanity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;""</description>

  <description>When you're being hunted, who can you trust?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time since she escaped from her school many months ago, Eve can sleep soundly. She's living in Califia, a haven for women, protected from the terrifying fate that awaits orphaned girls in The New America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her safety came at a price: She was forced to abandon Caleb, the boy she loves, wounded and alone at the city gates. When Eve gets word that Caleb is in trouble, she sets out into the wild again to rescue him, only to be captured and brought to the City of Sand, the capital of The New America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trapped inside the City walls, Eve uncovers a shocking secret about her past--and is forced to confront the harsh reality of her future. When she discovers Caleb is alive, Eve attempts to flee her prison so they can be together--but the consequences could be deadly. She must make a desperate choice to save the ones she loves . . . or risk losing Caleb forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this breathless sequel to "Eve," Anna Carey returns to her tale of romance, adventure, and sacrifice in a world that is both wonderfully strange and chillingly familiar.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>Actual rating: 2.5 stars</strong><br /><br /><br />This is a difficult review to write. Most of the things I want to talk about (good and bad) involve giving away huge spoilers. <em>Once</em> has a pretty big plot twist early in the story - one that I'm almost ashamed to admit I didn't see coming - making it close to impossible for...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Fans of Amanda Hocking's novel, &lt;em&gt;Wake,&lt;/em&gt; will¬†dive¬†into this paranormal¬†romance featuring mermaids--the killer kind--and won't come up for air!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calder White lives in the cold, clear waters of Lake Superior, the only brother in a family of murderous mermaids. To survive, Calder and his sisters prey on humans and absorb their positive energy. Usually, they select their victims at random, but this time around, the underwater clan chooses its target for a reason: revenge. They want to kill Jason¬†Hancock, the man they blame¬†for their mother's death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's going to¬†take a concerted effort to lure the aquaphobic Hancock onto the water. Calder's job is to gain Hancock's trust by getting¬†close to his family. Relying on his irresistible good looks and charm, Calder sets out to seduce Hancock's daughter¬†Lily. Easy enough, but Calder screws everything up by falling in love--just as Lily starts to suspect there's more to the monster-in-the-lake legends than she ever imagined, and just as the mermaids threaten to take matters into their own hands, forcing Calder to choose between them and the girl he loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing's for sure: whatever Calder decides, the outcome won't be pretty.</description>

  <description>New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., have been abandoned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bill of Rights has been revoked, and replaced with the Moral Statutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no more police‚Äîinstead, there are soldiers. There are no more fines for bad behavior‚Äîinstead, there are arrests, trials, and maybe worse. People who get arrested usually don't come back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ember Miller is old enough to remember that things weren't always this way. Living with her rebellious single mother, it's hard for her to forget that people weren't always arrested for reading the wrong books or staying out after dark. It's hard to forget that life in the United States used to be different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ember has perfected the art of keeping a low profile. She knows how to get the things she needs, like food stamps and hand-me-down clothes, and how to pass the random home inspections by the military. Her life is as close to peaceful as circumstances allow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until her mother is arrested for noncompliance with Article 5 of the Moral Statutes. And one of the arresting officers is none other than Chase Jennings‚Äîthe only boy Ember has ever loved.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since she'd been on the outside, she'd survived an Aether storm, she'd had a knife held to her throat, and she'd seen men murdered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exiled from her home, the enclosed city of Reverie, Aria knows her chances of surviving in the outer wasteland--known as The Death Shop--are slim. If the cannibals don't get her, the violent, electrified energy storms will. She's been taught that the very air she breathes can kill her. Then Aria meets an Outsider named Perry. He's wild--a savage--and her only hope of staying alive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hunter for his tribe in a merciless landscape, Perry views Aria as sheltered and fragile--everything he would expect from a Dweller. But he needs Aria's help too; she alone holds the key to his redemption. Opposites in nearly every way, Aria and Perry must accept each other to survive. Their unlikely alliance forges a bond that will determine the fate of all who live under the never sky.</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />This is a difficult book to review. I want to start off by saying this is not a bad book. I think this book will appeal to a lot of people, but at the same time will turn others off. I was, for the most part, turned off. I really don't think it is my kind of book, which is strange considering dys...]]>

  <description>Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So did his father before him, until he was gruesomely murdered by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father's mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. They follow legends and local lore, destroy the murderous dead, and keep pesky things like the future and friends at bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Searching for a ghost the locals call Anna Dressed in Blood, Cas expects the usual: track, hunt, kill. What he finds instead is a girl entangled in curses and rage, a ghost like he's never faced before. She still wears the dress she wore on the day of her brutal murder in 1958: once white, now stained red and dripping with blood. Since her death, Anna has killed any and every person who has dared to step into the deserted Victorian she used to call home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet she spares Cas's life.</description>

  <description>The year is 2009.¬† Nineteen-year-old Jackson Meyer is a normal guy‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs in college, has a girlfriend‚Ä¶ and he can travel back through time. But it‚Äôs not like the movies ‚Äì nothing changes in the present after his jumps, there‚Äôs no space-time continuum issues or broken flux capacitors ‚Äì it‚Äôs just harmless fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is‚Ä¶ until the day strangers burst in on Jackson and his girlfriend, Holly, and during a struggle with Jackson, Holly is fatally shot. In his panic, Jackson jumps back two years to 2007, but this is not like his previous time jumps. Now he‚Äôs stuck in 2007 and can‚Äôt get back to the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to somehow return to 2009 to save Holly but unable to return to his rightful year, Jackson settles into 2007 and learns what he can about his abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it‚Äôs not long before the people who shot Holly in 2009 come looking for Jackson in the past, and these ‚ÄúEnemies of Time‚Äù will stop at nothing to recruit this powerful young time-traveler.¬† Recruit‚Ä¶ or kill him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Piecing together the clues about his father, the Enemies of Time, and himself, Jackson must decide how far he‚Äôs willing to go to save Holly‚Ä¶ and possibly the entire world.</description>

  <description>The Harry Potter prequel is an 800-word story written by J. K. Rowling, and was published online on 11 June 2008. Set about three years before the birth of Harry Potter, the story recounts an adventure experienced by Sirius Black and James Potter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the bottom of the card, JKR wrote: "From the prequel I am NOT working on - but that was fun!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no official 'cover' for this short story, seeing as it was penned (By JKR) on an A5 card for the auction by bookseller Waterstone's, in aid of two reading charities, Dyslexia Action and English Pen. It was auctioned off for ¬£25,000.</description>

  <description>New soul&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ana is new. For thousands of years in Range, a million souls have been reincarnated over and over, keeping their memories and experiences from previous lifetimes. When Ana was born, another soul vanished, and no one knows why.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No soul&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even Ana‚Äôs own mother thinks she‚Äôs a nosoul, an omen of worse things to come, and has kept her away from society. To escape her seclusion and learn whether she‚Äôll be reincarnated, Ana travels to the city of Heart, but its citizens are afraid of what her presence means. When dragons and sylph attack the city, is Ana to blame?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam believes Ana‚Äôs new soul is good and worthwhile. When he stands up for her, their relationship blooms. But can he love someone who may live only once, and will Ana‚Äôs enemies‚Äîhuman and creature alike‚Äîlet them be together? Ana needs to uncover the mistake that gave her someone else‚Äôs life, but will her quest threaten the peace of Heart and destroy the promise of reincarnation for all?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jodi Meadows expertly weaves soul-deep romance, fantasy, and danger into an extraordinary tale of new life.</description>

  <description>After being dumped by his longtime girlfriend, twenty-eight-year-old Justin Halpern found himself living at home with his seventy-three-year-old dad. Sam Halpern, who is "like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair," has never minced words, and when Justin moved back home, he began to record all the ridiculous things his dad said to him:&lt;blockquote&gt;"That woman was sexy. . . . Out of your league? Son, let women figure out why they won't screw you. Don't do it for them."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Do people your age know how to comb their hair? It looks like two squirrels crawled on their heads and started fucking."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The worst thing you can be is a liar. . . . Okay, fine, yes, the worst thing you can be is a Nazi, but then number two is liar. Nazi one, liar two."&lt;/blockquote&gt;More than a million people now follow Mr. Halpern's philosophical musings on Twitter, and in this book, his son weaves a brilliantly funny, touching coming-of-age memoir around the best of his quotes. An all-American story that unfolds on the Little League field, in Denny's, during excruciating family road trips, and, most frequently, in the Halperns' kitchen over bowls of Grape-Nuts, &lt;em&gt;Sh*t My Dad Says&lt;/em&gt; is a chaotic, hilarious, true portrait of a father-son relationship from a major new comic voice.</description>

  <description>One choice can transform you‚Äîor it can destroy you. But every choice has consequences, and as unrest surges in the factions all around her, Tris Prior must continue trying to save those she loves‚Äîand herself‚Äîwhile grappling with haunting questions of grief and forgiveness, identity and loyalty, politics and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable‚Äîand even more powerful. Transformed by her own decisions but also by haunting grief and guilt, radical new discoveries, and shifting relationships, Tris must fully embrace her Divergence, even if she does not know what she may lose by doing so.</description>

  <description>When Dana is invited to Faerie to be officially presented at¬†the¬†Seelie Court, it‚Äôs no easy decision. After all, everyone knows Titania, the Seelie Queen, wants her dead. But Titania claims not to be the one behind the death threats; and her son, Prince Henry, makes the decision a whole lot easier when he suggests Dana might be arrested for (supposedly) conspiring with her aunt Grace to usurp the Seelie throne. So she and her father better do as they're told . . . &lt;p&gt;The journey through Faerie is long‚Äîand treacherous. Dana &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; it would be a good idea to have friends along, but her sort-of-boyfriend, Ethan, and her bodyguard‚Äôs son, Keane, just can‚Äôt seem to get along, and Kimber‚Äôs crush on Keane isn‚Äôt making things any easier. When a violent attack separates Dana from their caravan, the sexy Erlking saves her just in the nick of time . . . and makes it clear that he hasn‚Äôt given up on making her his own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Titania‚Äôs beautiful palace should be a relief. But Dana is soon implicated in an assassination attempt against Titania‚Äôs granddaughter, and is suddenly a fugitive, forced to leave her father behind as she and her friends flee for their lives. Will she be able to prove her innocence before the forces of the Seelie Court‚Äîor, worse, the Erlking‚Äîcatch up with her? And will she save her father before he pays the ultimate price in her stead? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;About three things I was absolutely certain.&lt;br&gt;First, Edwart was most likely my soul mate, maybe.&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a vampire part of him--which I assumed was wildly out of his control--that wanted me dead.&lt;br&gt;And third, I unconditionally, irrevocably, impenetrably, heterogeneously, gynecologically, and disreputably wished he had kissed me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And thus Belle Goose falls in love with the mysterious and sparkly Edwart Mullen in the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Lampoon&lt;/em&gt;‚Äôs hilarious send-up of Twilight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pale and klutzy, Belle arrives in Switchblade, Oregon looking for adventure, or at least an undead classmate. She soon discovers Edwart, a super-hot computer nerd with zero interest in girls. After witnessing a number of strange events‚ÄìEdwart leaves his tater tots untouched at lunch! Edwart saves her from a flying snowball!‚ÄìBelle has a dramatic revelation: Edwart is a vampire. But how can she convince Edwart to bite her and transform her into his eternal bride, especially when he seems to find girls so repulsive?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complete with romance, danger, insufficient parental guardianship, creepy stalker-like behavior, and a vampire prom, &lt;em&gt;Nightlight&lt;/em&gt; is the uproarious tale of a vampire-obsessed girl, looking for love in all the wrong places.</description>

  <description>"I don't do patrols, I don't go hunting, I just stick close to you. You live your life. I'll keep you safe," Tamani said, sweeping a lock of hair from her face. "Or die trying."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laurel hasn't seen Tamani since she begged him to let her go last year. Though her heart still aches, Laurel is confident that David was the right choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just as life is returning to normal, Laurel discovers that a hidden enemy lies in wait. Once again, Laurel must turn to Tamani to protect and guide her, for the danger that now threatens Avalon is one that no faerie thought would ever be possible. And for the first time, Laurel cannot be sure that her side will prevail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the third installment of Aprilynne Pike's Wings Series.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I can't just storm in and proclaim my intentions. I can't 'steal' you away. I just have to wait and hope that, someday, you'll ask," Tamani said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"And if I don't?" Laurel said, her voice barely above a whisper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Then I guess I'll be waiting forever."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Laurel has come to accept her true identity as a faerie, she refuses to turn her back on her human life - and especially her boyfriend, David - to return to the faerie world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she is summoned to Avalon, Laurel's feelings for the charismatic faerie sentry Tamani are undeniable. She is forced to make a choice - a choice that could break her heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;In Georgina Kincaid, succubus and she-demon, #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Richelle Mead has created one of her most enticing characters. But with a shot at love, and maybe even redemption, is the ultimate seductress finally going soft? Like hell she is.  .  .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgina Kincaid has had an eternity to figure out the opposite sex, but sometimes they still surprise her. Take Seth Mortensen. The man has risked his soul to become Georgina's boyfriend. Still, with Lucifer for a boss, Georgina can't just hang up her killer heels and settle down to domestic bliss. In fact, she's being forced to transfer operations.  .  .to Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of Sin is a dream gig for a succubus, but Georgina's allies are suspicious. Why are the powers-that-be so eager to get her away from Seattle and from Seth? Georgina is one of Hell's most valuable assets, but if there's any way out of the succubus business she plans to take it, no matter how much roadkill she leaves behind. She just hopes the casualties won't include the one man she's risking everything for.  .  .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <![CDATA[<br />I finally figured out the issue with the conclusion of Richelle Mead's series: the last book is not necessary. This is the problem I have with Mead. She starts off relatively good with her plot; the third and/or forth book being the strongest. Her stride begins to really diminish at the fifth boo...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Every flame begins with a spark.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashline Wilde is having a rough sophomore year. She's struggling to find her place as the only Polynesian girl in school, her boyfriend just cheated on her, and now her runaway sister, Eve, has decided to barge back into her life. When Eve's violent behavior escalates and she does the unthinkable, Ash transfers to a remote private school nestled in California's redwoods, hoping to put the tragedy behind her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But her fresh start at Blackwood Academy doesn't go as planned. Just as Ash is beginning to enjoy the perks of her new school - being captain of the tennis team, a steamy romance with a hot, local park ranger - Ash discovers that a group of gods and goddesses have mysteriously enrolled at Blackwood, and she's one of them. To make matters worse, Eve has resurfaced to haunt Ash, and she's got some strange abilities of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a war between the gods looming over campus, Ash must master the new fire smoldering within before she clashes with her sister one more time...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when warm and cold fronts collide, there's guaranteed to be a storm.</description>

  <description>In the future, in a world baked dry by the harsh sun, there are those who live inside the walled Enclave and those, like sixteen-year-old Gaia Stone, who live outside. Following in her mother's footsteps Gaia has become a midwife, delivering babies in the world outside the wall and handing a quota over to be "advanced" into the privileged society of the Enclave. Gaia has always believed this is her duty, until the night her mother and father are arrested by the very people they so loyally serve. Now Gaia is forced to question everything she has been taught, but her choice is simple: enter the world of the Enclave to rescue her parents, or die trying.</description>

  <description>On top of spending most of her time in a bunker-like safe house and having her dates hijacked by a formidable Fae bodyguard, Faeriewalker Dana Hathaway is in for some more bad news: the Erlking and his pack of murderous minions known as the Wild Hunt have descended upon Avalon. With his homicidal appetite and immortal powers, the Erlking have long been the nightmare of the Fae realm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fragile treaty with the Faerie Queen, sealed with a mysterious spell, is the one thing that keeps him from hunting unchecked in Avalon, the only place on Earth where humans and Fae live together. Which means Dana‚Äôs in trouble, since it‚Äôs common knowledge that the Faerie Queen wants her ‚Äì and her rare Faeriewalker powers ‚Äì dead. The smoldering, sexy Erlking‚Äôs got his sights set on Dana, but does he only seek to kill her, or does he have something much darker in mind?</description>

      <![CDATA[Ok, so let me start by saying this series to me is a bit strange. And because of that, you often have to just accept what Jenna Black tells you about this world, no matter how weird or odd it is. Kinda like how Stephenie Meyer told us all to accept the fact that Bella did not want to marry Edward...]]>

  <description>It's all she's ever wanted to be, but it couldn't be further from her grasp...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dana Hathaway doesn't know it yet, but she's in big trouble. When her alcoholic mom shows up at her voice recital drunk, &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;, Dana decides she's had enough and runs away to find her mysterious father in Avalon: the only place on Earth where the regular, everyday world and the captivating, magical world of Faerie intersect. But from the moment Dana sets foot in Avalon, everything goes wrong, for it turns out she isn't just an ordinary teenage girl, she's a Faeriewalker, a rare individual who can travel between both worlds, and the only person who can bring magic into the human world and technology into Faerie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dana finds herself tangled up in a cutthroat game of Fae politics. Someone's trying to kill her, and everyone seems to want something from her, from her newfound friends and family to Ethan, the hot Fae guy Dana figures she'll never have a chance with...until she does. Caught between two worlds, Dana isn't sure where she'll ever fit in and who can be trusted, not to mention if her world will ever be normal again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The long-awaited second book in the dystopian &lt;em&gt;Matched&lt;/em&gt; trilogy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In search of a future that may not exist and faced with the decision of who to share it with, Cassia journeys to the Outer Provinces in pursuit of Ky - taken by the Society to his certain death - only to find that he has escaped, leaving a series of clues in his wake. Cassia's quest leads her to question much of what she holds dear, even as she finds glimmers of a different life across the border. But as Cassia nears resolve and certainty about her future with Ky, an invitation for rebellion, an unexpected betrayal, and a surprise visit from Xander - who may hold the key to the uprising and, still, to Cassia's heart - change the game once again. Nothing is as expected on the edge of Society, where crosses and double crosses make the path more twisted than ever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Midnight Sun&lt;/em&gt; is the much anticipated retelling of &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; from Edward Cullen's perspective. An unedited partial draft was illegally leaked onto the internet in 2008; consequently, author Stephenie Meyer put the project on indefinite hold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly afterward, she posted a letter to her fans on her website including a link to the entire partial draft of the book so that those who wanted to read it could do so legally and with her consent; see URL for more information.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;  Do not add a cover.  Do not add translations.  Do not add any other editions.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Don't be afraid," I murmured. "We belong together."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was abruptly overwhelmed by the truth of my own words. This moment was so perfect, so right, there was no way to doubt it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His arms wrapped around me, holding me against him... It felt like every nerve ending in my body was a live wire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Forever," he agreed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you loved the one who was killing you, it left you no options. How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life-first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in New Moon and Eclipse-seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?</description>

  <description>Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go ‚Äî especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil ‚Äî and also her father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings ‚Äî and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this breathtaking sequel to &lt;em&gt;City of Bones&lt;/em&gt;, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.</description>

  <description>When fifteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder -- much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing‚Äïnot even a smear of blood‚Äïto show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know...  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.</description>

  <description>Grace Divine, daughter of the local pastor, always knew something terrible happened the night Daniel Kalbi disappeared--the night she found her brother Jude collapsed on the porch, covered in his own blood--but she has no idea what a truly monstrous secret that night held. &lt;br&gt;The memories her family has tried to bury resurface when Daniel returns, three years later, and enrolls in Grace and Jude's high school. Despite promising Jude she'll stay away, Grace cannot deny her attraction to Daniel's shocking artistic abilities, his way of getting her to look at the world from new angles, and the strange, hungry glint in his eyes. &lt;br&gt;The closer Grace gets to Daniel, the more she jeopardizes her life, as her actions stir resentment in Jude and drive him to embrace the ancient evil Daniel unleashed that horrific night. Grace must discover the truth behind the boy's dark secret...and the cure that can save the ones she loves. But she may have to lay down the ultimate sacrifice to do it--her soul.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;"I don't love Sonny Flannery."&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the lie Kelley Winslow is told to protect the boy she loves from a power he doesn't know he possesses. Devastated, Sonny retreats to a haven for Lost Fae that's hidden deep underneath New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kelley's not about to let things end in heartbreak. To get Sonny back, she's got to find out who's after his magick and how to use her own. She's got to uncover who's recruiting Janus Guards to murderously hunt innocent Faerie. She's got to help rebuild the shattered theater company she called family. And she's got to do it all without getting dangerously distracted by the Fenrys Wolf, whose legendary heart of stone seems to melt whenever he's around Kelley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intrigue and romance that began with &lt;em&gt;Wondrous Strange&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Darklight&lt;/em&gt; come to a stormy head in &lt;em&gt;Tempestuous&lt;/em&gt;, the breathtaking conclusion to Lesley Livingston's ravishing urban Faerie trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One hundred and fifty years ago, Earth was destroyed, and the remaining humans fled to the dusty red planet of Jutaire, where the only oxygen is manufactured, food is scarce, and death strikes often. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lissa's father discovers Earth still exists, she accidentally inhales the toxic air of Jutaire, and in one breath, discovers she isn't quite human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her father hangs for his discovery, and Lissa knows the Chancellors will come for her, for she saw the Earth that night too. With nothing to lose, she sets out to expose the truth. It isn't long before she meets Julian, a beautiful boy who can breathe the toxic air like she can - and shows her that the Jute, the original inhabitants of the planet, are more tangled in their lives than she knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Chancellors are only pawns in a greater game - one where the Jute control everything. Worse, the Jute plan to leave Jutaire for Earth, but to get there, they need her. And they'll stop at nothing until Lissa is in their clutches, even if they kill every human in the process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The race for Earth has begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbreathable is a tale of love, redemption, and sacrifice, and one girl's struggle to find her place in a world where she doesn't belong.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>To Whom Ever This May Concern;&lt;br&gt;I wish I could tell you the contents of this book were purely fictional. That I, Adela Arthur, was just a normal sixteen year old from Portland and that dragons, giants, elves and mermaids were just myths. I wish these were legends shared from crazy old grandparents to crazy old grandparents around campfires. After all, that is what I used to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never would have thought they lived on the other side of our mirrors in a world called Cielieu. But they do...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never would have thought there were humans, better known as Volsin that lived among them with the ability to create light from a single thought. But there are...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never would have thought I was one of them... But I am...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am the last Arthur and I was brought to the human world after a Volsin, filled with greed, began to strip the light from our kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The human world was supposed to be a safe haven... but he s found us and the only way to stop him is to go back to Cielieu and begin training as a student in the Elpida Castle of Light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said I wish the contents of this book were purely fictional and not my life...</description>

  <description>Josie Byrne's life is spiraling out of control.  Her parents are divorcing, her boyfriend Nick has grown distant, and her physics teacher has it in for her.  When she's betrayed by the two people she trusts most, Josie thinks things can't get worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she starts having dreams about a girl named Jo. Every night at the same time‚Äî3:59 a.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jo's life is everything Josie wants: she's popular, her parents are happily married, and Nick adores her.  It all seems real, but they're just dreams, right?  Josie thinks so, until she wakes one night to a shadowy image of herself in the bedroom mirror ‚Äì Jo.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josie and Jo realize that they are doppelg√§ngers living in parallel universes that overlap every twelve hours at exactly 3:59. Fascinated by Jo's perfect world, Josie jumps at the chance to jump through the portal and switch places for a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Jo‚Äôs world is far from perfect.  Not only is Nick not Jo's boyfriend, he hates her.  Jo's mom is missing, possibly insane.  And at night, shadowy creatures feed on human flesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the end of the day, Josie is desperate to return to her own life.  But there‚Äôs a problem: Jo has sealed the portal, trapping Josie in this dangerous world.  Can she figure out a way home before it‚Äôs too late?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From master of suspense Gretchen McNeil comes a riveting and deliciously eerie story about the lives we wish we had ‚Äì and how they just might kill you.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Two misfits.&lt;br&gt;One extraordinary love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleanor&lt;/em&gt;... Red hair, wrong clothes. Standing behind him until he turns his head. Lying beside him until he wakes up. Making everyone else seem drabber and flatter and never good enough...Eleanor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Park&lt;/em&gt;... He knows she'll love a song before he plays it for her. He laughs at her jokes before she ever gets to the punch line. There's a place on his chest, just below his throat, that makes her want to keep promises...Park.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set over the course of one school year, this is the story of two star-crossed sixteen-year-olds‚Äîsmart enough to know that first love almost never lasts, but brave and desperate enough to try.</description>

  <description>When Sam's dad whisks him and his brother off to a remote beach town for the summer, he's all for it-- at first. Sam soon realizes, though, that this place is anything but ordinary. Time seems to slow down around here, and everywhere he looks, there are beautiful blond girls. Girls who seem inexplicably drawn to him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Sam meets DeeDee, one of the Girls, and she's different from the others. Just as he starts to fall for her, she pulls away, leaving him more confused than ever. He knows that if he's going to get her back, he'll have to uncover the secret of this beach and the girls who live here.</description>

  <description>Eden Newman must mate before her 18th birthday in six months or she'll be left outside to die in a burning world. But who will pick up her mate-option when she's cursed with white skin and a tragically low mate-rate of 15%? In a post-apocalyptic, totalitarian, underground world where class and beauty are defined by resistance to an overheated environment, Eden's coloring brands her as a member of the lowest class, a weak and ugly Pearl. If only she can mate with a dark-skinned Coal from the ruling class, she'll be safe. Just maybe one Coal sees the Real Eden and will be her salvation her co-worker Jamal has begun secretly dating her. But when Eden unwittingly compromises her father's secret biological experiment, she finds herself in the eye of a storm and thrown into the last area of rainforest, a strange and dangerous land. Eden must fight to save her father, who may be humanity's last hope, while standing up to a powerful beast-man she believes is her enemy, despite her overwhelming attraction. Eden must change to survive but only if she can redefine her ideas of beauty and of love, along with a little help from her "adopted aunt" Emily Dickinson.</description>

  <description>New from #1 New York Times bestselling author Meg Cabot, a dark, fantastical story about this world . . . and the underworld.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though she tries returning to the life she knew before the accident, Pierce can't help but feel at once a part of this world, and apart from it. Yet she's never alone . . . because someone is always watching her. Escape from the realm of the dead is impossible when someone there wants you back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now she's moved to a new town. Maybe at her new school, she can start fresh. Maybe she can stop feeling so afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only she can't. Because even here, he finds her. That's how desperately he wants her back. She knows he's no guardian angel, and his dark world isn't exactly heaven, yet she can't stay away . . . especially since he always appears when she least expects it, but exactly when she needs him most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if she lets herself fall any further, she may just find herself back in the one place she most fears: the Underworld.</description>

I'm not completely unfamiliar with her works. One of my favorite movies of all time was adapted from one of her novels-- The Princess Diaries. All that being said...]]>

  <description>Juliette hasn‚Äôt touched anyone in exactly 264 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette‚Äôs touch is fatal. As long as she doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don‚Äôt fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war‚Äì and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she‚Äôs exactly what they need right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The magical world of &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling authors P. C. Cast and Kristin Cast comes to comics!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until recently, Zoey Redbird was an average high-school student worrying about grades, boys, and breakouts. But priorities have a way of changing when you are Marked as a vampyre, enroll in the vampyre academy House of Night, and have to figure out a whole new social hierarchy, affinities for elemental magic, and physiological changes that make you crave blood.</description>

  <description>Galen is the prince of the Syrena, sent to land to find a girl he's heard can communicate with fish. Emma is on vacation at the beach. When she runs into Galen‚Äîliterally, &lt;em&gt;ouch!&lt;/em&gt;‚Äîboth teens sense a connection. But it will take several encounters, including a deadly one with a shark, for Galen to be convinced of Emma's gifts. Now, if he can only convince Emma that she holds the key to his kingdom...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told from both Emma and Galen's points of view, here is a fish-out-of-water story that sparkles with intrigue, humor, and waves of romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana‚Äôs quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too‚Äîbut on his own terms.&lt;br&gt;¬†&lt;br&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey‚Äôs singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success‚Äîhis multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family‚ÄîGrey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey‚Äôs secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>America's bestselling guide to caring for a baby, with over 10 million copies in print, "What to Expect the First Year "is the bible for taking care of a newborn though the milestone of his or her first birthday. The Second Edition incorporates the most recent developments in pediatric medicine. Every question and answer has been revisited, and in response to letters from readers, dozens of new Q&amp;amp;As have been added. The book is more reader-friendly than ever, with updated cultural references, and the new material brings more in-depth coverage to issues such as newborn screening, home births and the resulting at-home newborn care, vitamins and vaccines, milk allergies, causes of colic, sleep problems, SIDS, returning to work, dealing with siblings, weaning, sippy cups, the expanded role of the father, and much more. An updated cover and all-new black-and-white line illustrations complement the fresher book with a fresher look.</description>

  <description>Everybody gets to be supermodel gorgeous. What could be wrong with that? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tally is about to turn sixteen, and she can't wait. Not for her license - for turning pretty. In Tally's world, your sixteenth birthday brings an operation that turns you from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to have a really great time. In just a few weeks Tally will be there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tally's new friend Shay isn't sure she wants to be pretty. She'd rather risk life on the outside. When Shay runs away, Tally learns about a whole new side of the pretty world and it isn't very pretty. The authorities offer Tally the worst choice she can imagine: find her friend and turn her in, or never turn pretty at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The choice Tally makes changes her world forever...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Alyson No√´l's bestselling Immortals series has been hailed as "addictive," "beautiful," "haunting," and "mesmerizing."

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first book in Alyson No√´l's extraordinary new Immortals series. Enter an enchanting new world, where true love never dies...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a horrible accident claims the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever Bloom can see people's auras, hear their thoughts, and know someone's entire life story by touching them. Going out of her way to avoid human contact to suppress her abilities, she has been branded a freak at her new high school ‚Äî but everything changes when she meets Damen Auguste.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damen is gorgeous, exotic and wealthy. He's the only one who can silence the noise and random energy in her head - wielding a magic so intense, it's as though he can peer straight into her soul. As Ever is drawn deeper into his enticing world of secrets and mystery, she's left with more questions than answers. And she has no idea just who he really is - or &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; he is. The only thing she knows to be true is that she's falling deeply and helplessly in love with him.</description>

  <description>How do you defy destiny?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Helen Hamilton has spent her entire sixteen years trying to hide how different she is‚Äîno easy task on an island as small and sheltered as Nantucket. And it's getting harder. Nightmares of a desperate desert journey have Helen waking parched, only to find her sheets damaged by dirt and dust. At school she's haunted by hallucinations of three women weeping tears of blood . . . and when Helen first crosses paths with Lucas Delos, she has no way of knowing they're destined to play the leading roles in a tragedy the Fates insist on repeating throughout history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Helen unlocks the secrets of her ancestry, she realizes that some myths are more than just legend. But even demigod powers might not be enough to defy the forces that are both drawing her and Lucas together‚Äîand trying to tear them apart.</description>

  <description>There's something achingly familiar about Daniel Grigori.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious and aloof, he captures Luce Price's attention from the moment she sees him on her first day at the Sword &amp;amp; Cross boarding school in sultry Savannah, Georgia. He's the one bright spot in a place where cell phones are forbidden, the other students are all screw-ups, and security cameras watch every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Daniel wants nothing to do with Luce--and goes out of his way to make that very clear--she can't let it go. Drawn to him like a moth to a flame, she has to find out what Daniel is so desperate to keep secret . . . even if it kills her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dangerously exciting and darkly romantic, &lt;em&gt;Fallen &lt;/em&gt;is a page turning thriller and the ultimate love story.</description>

  <description>The first book in a new trilogy from L. J. Smith!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elena Gilbert is alive--again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Elena sacrificed herself to save the two vampire brothers who love her--the handsome, brooding Stefan and the sleek and dangerous Damon--she was consigned to a fate beyond death. Until a powerful supernatural force pulled her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Elena is not just human. She has powers and gifts that were bestowed on her in the afterlife. What's more, her blood pulses with an overwhelming and unique force that makes her irresistible to any vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stefan wants to find a way to keep Elena safe so that they can make a life together. Damon, however, is driven by an insatiable desire for power, and wants Elena to rule as his princess. When Stefan is lured away from Fell's Church, Damon seizes his chance to convince her that he is the brother she is meant to be with. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a darkness is infiltrating the town, and Damon, always the hunter, is now the hunted; he becomes the prey of a malevolent creature that can possess him at will, and who desires not just Elena's blood but her death.</description>

  <description>What if the hottest guy in the world was hiding a nameless evil, and all he wanted was you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the start of this heart-pounding new installment of the bestselling House of Night series, Zoey's friends have her back again and Stevie Rae and the red fledglings aren't Neferet's secrets any longer. But an unexpected danger has emerged. Neferet guards her powerful new consort, Kalona, and no one at the House of Night seems to understand the threat he poses. Kalona looks gorgeous, and he has the House of Night under his spell. A past life holds the key to breaking his rapidly spreading influence, but what if this past life shows Zoey secrets she doesn't want to hear and truths she can't face?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the run and holed up in Tulsa's Prohibition-era tunnels, Zoey and her gang must discover a way to deal with something that might bring them all down. Meanwhile, Zoey has a few other little problems. The red fledglings have cleaned up well - they've even managed to make the dark, creepy tunnels feel more like home - but are they really as friendly as they seem? On the boyfriend front, Zoey has a chance to make things right with super-hot ex-, Erik, but she can't stop thinking about Stark, the archer who died in her arms after one unforgettable night, and she is driven to try to save him from Neferet's sinister influence at all costs. Will anyone believe the power evil has to hide among us?</description>

  <description>Life sucks when your friends are pissed at you. Just ask Zoey Redbird - she's become an expert on suckiness. In one week she has gone from having three boyfriends to having none, and from having a close group of friends who trusted and supported her, to being an outcast. Speaking of friends, the only two Zoey has left are undead and unMarked. And Neferet has declared war on humans, which Zoey knows in her heart is wrong. But will anyone listen to her? Zoey's adventures at vampyre finishing school take a wild and dangerous turn as loyalties are tested, shocking true intentions come to light, and an ancient evil is awakened in PC and Kristin Cast's spellbinding fourth House of Night novel. (""Recommended for readers age 13 and older"")</description>

  <description>Dark forces are at work at the House of Night and fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbird‚Äôs adventures at the school take a mysterious turn.¬† Those who appear to be friends are turning out to be enemies.¬† And oddly enough, sworn enemies are also turning into friends.¬† So begins the gripping third installment of this ‚Äúhighly addictive series‚Äù (&lt;em&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/em&gt;), in which Zoey‚Äôs mettle will be tested like never before.¬† Her best friend, Stevie Rae, is undead and struggling to maintain a grip on her humanity.¬†Zoey doesn‚Äôt have a clue how to help her, but she does know that anything she and Stevie Rae discover must be kept secret from everyone else at the House of Night, where trust has become a rare commodity.¬† Speaking of rare: Zoey finds herself in the very unexpected and rare position of having &lt;em&gt;three &lt;/em&gt;boyfriends.¬†Mix a little bloodlust into the equation and the situation has the potential to spell social disaster.¬† Just when it seems things couldn‚Äôt get any tougher, vampyres start turning up dead.¬†Really dead.¬†It looks like the People of Faith, and Zoey‚Äôs horrid step-father in particular, are tired of living side-by-side with vampyres.¬† But, as Zoey and her friends so often find out, how things appear rarely reflects the truth‚Ä¶</description>

  <description>Fledging vampyre Zoey Redbird has managed to settle in at the House of Night finishing school. She finally feels like she belongs, even gets chosen as the Leader of the Dark Daughters. Best of all, she actually has a boyfriend... or two. Then the unthinkable happens: Human teenagers are being killed, and all the evidence points to the House of Night. While danger stalks the humans from Zoey‚Äôs old life, she begins to realize that the very powers that make her so unique might also threaten those she loves. Then, when she needs her new friends the most, death strikes the House of Night, and Zoey must find the courage to face a betrayal that could break her heart, her soul, and jeopardize the very fabric of her world.</description>

  <description>The House of Night series is set in a world very much like our own, except in 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres have always existed.¬† In this first book in the series, Zoey enters the House of Night, a school where, after having undergone the Change, she will train to become an adult vampire -- that is, if she makes it through the Change.¬† Not all of those who are chosen do.¬† It's tough to begin a new life, away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.¬† She has been Marked as special by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx.¬† But she is not the¬†only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers.¬†¬†When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite club, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A SACRED OATH&lt;br&gt;A FALLEN ANGEL&lt;br&gt;A FORBIDDEN LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romance was not part of Nora Grey's plan. She's never been particularly attracted to the boys at her school, no matter how hard her best friend, Vee, pushes them at her. Not until Patch comes along. With his easy smile and eyes that seem to see inside her, Patch draws Nora to him against her better judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after a series of terrifying encounters, Nora's not sure whom to trust. Patch seems to be everywhere she is and seems to know more about her than her closest friends. She can't decide whether she should fall into his arms or run and hide. And when she tries to seek some answers, she finds herself near a truth that is way more unsettling than anything Patch makes her feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For she is right in the middle of an ancient battle between the immortal and those that have fallen - and, when it comes to choosing sides, the wrong choice will cost Nora her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;I knew we were both in mortal danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, in that instant I felt well. Whole. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, the blood pulsing hot and fast through my veins again. My lungs filled deep with the sweet scent that came off his skin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was like there had never been any hole in my chest. I was perfect - not healed, but as if there had never been a wound in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella ever could have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a part of him - and I didn't know how dominant that part might be - that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bella Swan moves to the gloomy town of Forks and meets Edward Cullen, her life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. With his porcelain skin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now, he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Bella doesn't realize is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And it might be too late to turn back...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Nothing ever came between sisters Alice and Charlie.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;If by nothing, you mean everything. The sisters haven‚Äôt been able to stop fighting since they arrived in Serenity Point two weeks ago. Those two weeks changed their lives. And Serenity Point has changed &lt;em&gt;them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Friends didn‚Äôt.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Charlie has a new group of friends and a new life. Jude and Cybill are beautiful, exciting, and dangerously seductive. And though Sasha is proving to be a friend and confidante to Alice, Alice can‚Äôt get away from the people, places, and events that mire her in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Boys couldn‚Äôt.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Alice loves Tommy, but the memory of Camilla, dead and gone, is driving a wedge between them. And Alice‚Äôs ex-boyfriend Patrick won‚Äôt give up on her, no matter what she says to keep him away. Jude is slowly giving up his bad boy ways for Charlie‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not smooth sailing if Cybill has anything to say about it. And then Nick arrives: Dr. Van Stratten‚Äôs former intern seems to know things about last summer‚Äî things that Jude and Tommy would rather not be revealed. Alice is determined to find out what.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Their family falling apart never would.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;While the sisters grapple with the terrible truth about their family, the one-year memorial of Camilla‚Äôs death looms. The tension mounts and sparks fly as bright as July Fourth fireworks‚Äîand Alice and Charlie team up to find out the truth that everyone seems to be hiding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Until they got to Serenity Point.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; Is Camilla their enemy and rival‚Äîeven six feet under? Or is she their sister, whose memory they have to protect? And what really happened to her that night on the bridge? In a town built on secrets and lies, can the truth stay buried for long?¬†</description>

  <description>When Chelsea Handler needs to get a few things off her chest, she appeals to a higher power - vodka. You would too if you found out that your boyfriend was having an affair with a Peekapoo or if you had to pretend to be honeymooning with your father in order to upgrade to first class. Welcome to Chelsea's world - a place where absurdity reigns supreme and a quick wit is the best line of defense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this hilarious, deliciously skewed collection, Chelsea mines her past for stories about her family, relationships, and career that are at once singular and ridiculous. Whether she's convincing her third-grade class that she has been tapped to play Goldie Hawn's daughter in the sequel to Private Benjamin, deciding to be more egalitarian by dating a redhead, or looking out for a foulmouthed, rum-swilling little person who looks just like her... only smaller, Chelsea has a knack for getting herself into the most outrageous situations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea&lt;/em&gt; showcases the candor and irresistible turns of phrase that have made her one of the freshest voices in comedy today.</description>

Traveling the world with her scientist father, doted on by her wealthy and glamorous neighbor Evie, Marina‚Äôs life seems perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything changes in the summer of her sixteenth year when she is sent to live with her Aunt Abby and Cousin Cruz in the lovely seaside town of Aptos, California.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a few weeks after arriving, sixteen year-old Marina has nearly drowned twice, enchanted the hottest guy in high school, and discovered a supernatural creature. If she can manage to survive some increasingly dangerous encounters with unpredictable mermaids, she might be able to unlock the mystery of her past and appease the mysterious forces that want something from her...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And maybe even find true love along the way.</description>

  <description>Even angels make mistakes in this page-turning epic romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When her parents are murdered before her eyes, sixteen-year-old Helen Cartwright finds herself launched into an underground London where a mysterious organization called the Dictata controls the balance of good and evil. Helen learns that she is one of three remaining angelic descendants charged with protecting the world's past, present, and future. Unbeknownst to her, she has been trained her whole life to accept this responsibility. Now, as she finds herself torn between the angelic brothers protecting her and the devastatingly handsome childhood friend who wants to destroy her, she must prepare to be brave, to be hunted, and above all to be strong, because temptation will be hard to resist, even for an angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Michelle Zink masterfully weaves historical fantasy with paranormal romance to create a gripping tale of love and betrayal.</description>

  <description>Every dish in this very unique cookbook has one thing in common: the main ingredient¬†is children! Many famous culinary witches have contributed‚Äîfrom Barfa Stew-Wart to India's favorite Kideeta Skingh and Janie Groviller from Britain‚Äîand each of their recipes is introduced by the general editor Esmelia Sniff. Recipes range from such tangy delights as Seared Tina in Boy Sauce on a Bed of Fragrant Lice to the more filling Bratwurst and Upset Cabbage to sweet Flat Jacks. Featuring a dark subject matter but laugh-out-loud jokes, absurd characters, and beautiful illustrations, this is the perfect cookbook for parents and children alike.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Imagine there is someone you like so much that just thinking about them leaves you desperate and reckless. You crave them in a way that's not rational, not right, and you're becoming somebody you don't recognise, and certainly don't respect, but you don't even care. And this person you like is unattainable. Except for one thing... He lives downstairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abbie has three obsessions. Art. The ocean. And Kane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But since Kane's been back, he's changed. There's a darkness shadowing him that only Abbie can see. And it wants her in its world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gothic story about the very dark things that feed the creative process.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>When you're sixteen and no one understands who you are, sometimes the only choice left is to run. If you're lucky, you'll find a place that accepts you, no questions asked. And if you're really lucky, that place has a drum set, a place to practice, and a place to sleep. For Kid, the streets of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, are that place. Over the course of two scorching summers, Kid falls hopelessly in love and then loses nearly everything and everyone worth caring about. But as summer draws to a close, Kid finally finds someone who can last beyond the sunset.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school‚Äîuntil now. He's about to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;R. J. Palacio has written a spare, warm, uplifting story that will have readers laughing one minute and wiping away tears the next. With wonderfully realistic family interactions (flawed, but loving), lively school scenes, and short chapters, &lt;em&gt;Wonder&lt;/em&gt; is accessible to readers of all levels.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A BIG NOVEL ABOUT A SMALL TOWN ...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Barry Fairbrother dies in his early forties, the town of Pagford is left in shock.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty fa√ßade is a town at war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils ... Pagford is not what it first seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations?</description>

  <description>Since the 1970s humans have forced supernaturals to live in caged cities. Silver brands embedded in their foreheads identify them by species: a full moon for Vampires, a crescent moon for Shifters, a pair of wings for Fairies, and the list goes on, for each supernatural species has been tagged and categorized by humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lanore Vesta is marked with a silver X, the brand of Mixbreeds, second-class citizens shunned by society. She stays to herself, revealing her ability to create fire only during emergencies. All she wants to do is graduate college and stop having to steal to survive. But when she stumbles upon a murder in progress, she catches the attention of a supernatural killer. Now all she wants is to stop finding dead bodies in her apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enlisting help from her Were-cheetah ex-boyfriend MeShack and a new mysterious friend named Zulu, she is steered through the habitat‚Äôs raunchy nightlife. But their presence sometimes proves to be more burden than help, as they fight for her attention.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the corpses pile up, and the scent of blood fills the air, Lanore is left wondering: Will she find the psycho or die trying?</description>

  <description>The Goddess War begins in &lt;em&gt;Antigoddess&lt;/em&gt;, the first installment of the new series by acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Anna Dressed in Blood&lt;/em&gt;, Kendare Blake.&lt;br&gt;¬†&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Old Gods never die‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Or so Athena thought. But then the feathers started sprouting beneath her skin, invading her lungs like a strange cancer, and Hermes showed up with a fever eating away his flesh. So much for living a quiet eternity in perpetual health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperately seeking the cause of their slow, miserable deaths, Athena and Hermes travel the world, gathering allies and discovering enemies both new and old. Their search leads them to Cassandra‚Äîan ordinary girl who was once an extraordinary prophetess, protected and loved by a god.¬†&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These days, Cassandra doesn‚Äôt involve herself in the business of gods‚Äîin fact, she doesn‚Äôt even know they exist. But she could be the key in a war that is only just beginning.¬†&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Hera, the queen of the gods, has aligned herself with other of the ancient Olympians, who are killing off rivals in an attempt to prolong their own lives. But these anti-gods have become corrupted in their desperation to survive, horrific caricatures of their former glory. Athena will need every advantage she can get, because immortals don‚Äôt just flicker out.¬†&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every one of them dies in their own way. Some choke on feathers. Others become monsters. All of them rage against their last breath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Goddess War is about to begin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management software (DRM) applied.</description>

  <description>For hundreds of years, the vampire Balthazar has been alone-without allies, without love.&lt;br&gt;When Balthazar agrees to help Skye Tierney, a human girl who once attended Evernight Academy, he has no idea how dangerous it will be. Skye's newfound psychic powers have caught the attention of Redgrave, the cruel, seductive master vampire responsible for murdering Balthazar and his family four centuries ago. Now Redgrave plans to use Skye's powers for his own evil purposes.&lt;br&gt;Balthazar will do whatever it takes to stop Redgrave and exact his long-awaited revenge against his killer. As Skye and Balthazar stand together to fight him, they grow closer-first unwillingly, then undeniably. Balthazar realizes his lonely world could finally be changed by her. . . .</description>

  <description>"Your mother hollers that you're going to miss the bus. She can see it coming down the street. You don't stop and hug her and tell her you love her. You don't thank her for being a good, kind, patient mother. Of course not--you launch yourself down the stairs and make a run for the corner. &lt;br&gt;""Only, if it's the last time you'll ever see your mother, you sort of start to wish you'd stopped and did those things. Maybe even missed the bus. &lt;br&gt;""But the bus was barreling down our street, so I ran. &lt;br&gt;"Fourteen kids. One superstore. A million things that go wrong. &lt;br&gt;In Emmy Laybourne's action-packed debut novel, six high school kids (some popular, some not), two eighth graders (one a tech genius), and six little kids trapped together in a chain superstore build a refuge for themselves inside. While outside, a series of escalating disasters, beginning with a monster hailstorm and ending with a chemical weapons spill, seems to be tearing the world--as they know it--apart.</description>

  <description>Life is bleak but uncomplicated for sixteen-year-old Tess, living in a not-too-distant future where the government, faced with humanity's extinction, created the Chosen Ones, artificial beings who are extraordinarily beautiful, unbelievably strong, and unabashedly deadly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Tess begins work at Templeton, a Chosen Ones training facility, she meets James, and the attraction is immediate in its intensity, overwhelming in its danger. But there is more to Templeton than Tess ever knew. Can she stand against her oppressors, even if it means giving up the only happiness in her life?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>As an obedient orphan of the U.N.A. (the super-country that was once Mexico, the U.S., and Canada), Alenna learned at an early age to blend in and be quiet‚Äîhaving your parents taken by the police will do that to a girl. But Alenna can‚Äôt help but stand out when she fails a test that all sixteen-year-olds have to take: The test says she has a high capacity for brutal violence, and so she is sent to The Wheel, an island where all would-be criminals end up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The life expectancy of prisoners on The Wheel is just two years, but with dirty, violent, and chaotic conditions, the time seems a lot longer as Alenna is forced to deal with civil wars for land ownership and machines that snatch kids out of their makeshift homes. Desperate, she and the other prisoners concoct a potentially fatal plan to flee the island. Survival may seem impossible, but Alenna is determined to achieve it anyway.</description>

  <description>Elyse knows what it means to keep a secret. She's been keeping secrets her whole life. Two, actually. First, that she ages five times slower than average people, so that while she looks eighteen years old, she's well over eighty. Second, that her blood has a mysterious power to heal. For Elyse, these things don't make her special. They make life dangerous. After the death of her parents, she's been careful to keep her secret as closely guarded as possible. Now, only one other person in the world knows about her age and ability. Or so she thinks. Elyse is not the only one keeping secrets. There are others like her all over the world, descendants of the very people the Greeks considered gods. She is one of them, and they have been waiting for her for a long time. Some are waiting for her to put an end to centuries of traditions that have oppressed their people under the guise of safeguarding them. Others are determined to keep her from doing just that. But for Elyse, the game is just beginning-and she's not entirely willing to play by their rules.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;But there I go, getting ahead of myself. Skipping straight to the part where I was front-page news and they were calling me Dorothy, instead of starting at the beginning...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dodie's parents go missing just as final year exams are about to start, she convinces herself they're fine. But when the least likely boy in class holds the key ‚Äì quite literally ‚Äì to the huge secret her parents have been hiding all these years, it's up to Dodie, her sister, the guy from school, and two guys she's never met before, to take on the challenge of a lifetime. So now Dodie's driving ‚Äì unlicensed ‚Äìto Sydney, and being chased by bad guys, the police, and one very handsome good guy.</description>

  <description>It's been thirty days, two hours, and seventeen minutes since Calder left Lily standing on the shores of Lake Superior. Not that she's counting. And when Calder does return, it's not quite the reunion Lily hoped for. Especially after she lets her father in on a huge secret: he, like Calder, is a merman. Obsessed with his new identity, Lily's dad monopolizes Calder's time as the two of them spend every day in the water, leaving Lily behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then dead bodies start washing ashore. Calder blames his mermaid sisters, but Lily fears her father has embraced the merman's natural need to kill. As the body count grows, everyone is pointing fingers. Lily doesn't know what to believe‚Äîonly that whoever's responsible is sure to strike again. . . .¬†</description>

  <description>Fierce, seductive mermaid Syrenka falls in love with Ezra, a young naturalist. When she abandons her life underwater for a chance at happiness on land, she is unaware that this decision comes with horrific and deadly consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost one hundred forty years later, seventeen-year-old Hester meets a mysterious stranger named Ezra and feels overwhelmingly, inexplicably drawn to him. For generations, love has resulted in death for the women in her family. Is it an undiagnosed genetic defect . . . or a curse? With Ezra‚Äôs help, Hester investigates her family‚Äôs strange, sad history. The answers she seeks are waiting in the graveyard, the crypt, and at the bottom of the ocean‚Äîbut powerful forces will do anything to keep her from uncovering her connection to Syrenka and to the tragedy of so long ago.</description>

  <description>A dystopian thriller follows a boy and girl on the run from a town where all thoughts can be heard -- and the passage to manhood embodies a horrible secret. &lt;br&gt;Todd Hewitt is the only boy in a town of men. Ever since the settlers were infected with the Noise germ, Todd can hear everything the men think, and they hear everything he thinks. Todd is just a month away from becoming a man, but in the midst of the cacophony, he knows that the town is hiding something from him -- something so awful Todd is forced to flee with only his dog, whose simple, loyal voice he hears too. With hostile men from the town in pursuit, the two stumble upon a strange and eerily silent creature: a girl. Who is she? Why wasn't she killed by the germ like all the females on New World? Propelled by Todd's gritty narration, readers are in for a white-knuckle journey in which a boy on the cusp of manhood must unlearn everything he knows in order to figure out who he truly is.</description>

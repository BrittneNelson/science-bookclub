  <description>The hugely anticipated follow-up to Matt Shaw's best-selling horror story 'The Cabin'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I sat up and rested my back against the soft padded wall. I wonder whether the padding on the wall is to stop me from hurting myself, as they had explained when I first got here, or to drown the sounds of my banging and screaming as I beg for them to let me out; not that they ever will."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deemed unfit to stand trial after murdering his family, Craig was sent to the very Asylum (centred around the ghost stories) which led to his downfall. Here he hoped for nothing more than peace and quiet, as he struggled to get to grips with what he'd done, but the vengeful spirits had other ideas as they set about revealing their secrets to him.</description>

  <description>A collection of erotic forbidden romance novellas from some of today's bestselling authors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Release date: April 2014&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Novellas include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing with Desire by Kasey Millstead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rules are clear:  &lt;br&gt;No sex with the patrons.  &lt;br&gt;Dance like no one’s watching. &lt;br&gt;Fuck them with your eyes.&lt;br&gt;Make love to them with your moves.  &lt;br&gt;But, no sex with the patrons. Ever.&lt;br&gt;Why is it, when someone tells you not to do something…or someone…you immediately want to do what they told you not to?&lt;br&gt;In Ana’s case, that someone is Ethan Faulkner.  Rich, sexy and confident, and a patron of the exclusive gentleman’s club where she works as a dancer.&lt;br&gt;Will Ana play by the rules, or will Ethan have her Dancing with Desire?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sins of the Flesh by Adriane Leigh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;She walked into his church wounded and seeking solace, what she didn't expect to find was temptation so sharp and sweet under one snow-white collar. &lt;br&gt;Their relationship was never innocent. &lt;br&gt;From the beginning, their attraction was combustible; the magnetism all-consuming; the sexual tension explosive, begging them to succumb to their dark desire in . . . sins of the flesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duty of Care by Lisa Edward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Toni Masters, moving from a small country town to the city, to pursue her nursing career, is a dream come true. But her first day on North Ward is not what she had hoped for. &lt;br&gt;Toni’s first patient encounter is with twenty-six year old Michael Davidson, or Harley as he is known to his friends. Harley is difficult and miserable being stuck in a hospital bed, and only seems happy when he has the nurses running in circles. But all Harley’s efforts to antagonize the new nurse, only make Toni push back and give as good as she gets.&lt;br&gt;A mutual respect is born along with a growing attraction, and Toni vows to do all she can to make Harley’s stay in North Ward as comfortable as possible. &lt;br&gt;But how far will Toni take her duty of care?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Secret Service by Liv Morris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cammie Douglas is a spoiled and promiscuous beauty who's completely out of control. She attends the University of Texas where her life revolves around finding her next hook-up. Her father, Senator Anthony Douglas is a candidate for President and fears his "little" girl's reckless lifestyle could damage his campaign. He persuades Secret Service agent Jude Warner to watch-over Cammie and try to rein in her careless behavior. &lt;br&gt;Jude is dark and handsome, the silent-type, trained to live a life of control and regiment. When he meets and begins to guard Cammie, Jude fights a raw sexual attraction to her making his life both heaven and hell. Naughty Cammie is determined to have him join her on the wild side by playing a game of sexual seduction. Can Jude resist his desire to possess Cammie? Or will he sacrifice everything to be with her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burning Desire by Vicki Green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young eighteen year old Riley Morris has been in a nursing program for almost a year now but little did she know she would soon be living in a mansion with Parker Wright, a thirty five year old sexy man and taking care of his dying bedridden wife. Parker has made it no secret to Riley of his desire for her once she moves in but she’s trying not to give in to her own desire for him with the guilt of situation that has her there but can she? Will she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Mother Doesn't Know by Nikki Worrell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriella Tuttle is a 19 year old girl who works for her step-father’s construction company. She lives at home with her mother and step-father, Sofia and Rick Jameson. They were a happy family until 2 years ago when Sofia fell in with the wrong crowd in an effort to recapture her youth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of 37, Rick has had enough. He’s done with Sofia’s abusive behavior. He’s done watching her lying around the house, strung out on the drug of the week. But he is not willing to leave Gabriella alone with her. As wrong as he knows it is, Rick has had an unhealthy attraction to his step-daughter from the time she started high school. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that Gabby’s an adult, and Rick’s ready to get Sofia out of his life, dare he make the move to become something other than a step-father to Gabby? His mind isn’t so sure, but his body has been ready for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Taste of Mr. Davenport by Jessica Ingro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carter Davenport has watched his daughter’s best friend Claire come out of her shell over the last two years. And what has been exposed has him more than intrigued. He’d like nothing more than to peel back her layers and devour what’s underneath, but Claire is officially off limits to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Claire Reynolds met Elisa Davenport during her first year of college, she never dreamed she'd one day find herself having an illicit affair with Elisa's unbelievably sexy father. Now that she’s had a mouthwatering sample, she wants more. After all, one taste is never enough…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One promising summer vacation leads to stolen glances, erotic touches and steamy encounters neither can forget. Like all things taboo, will their relationship have an expiration date? Or will Claire show Carter they are more than just a forbidden romance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wicked, Wicked, Wicked Witch, by Penny Reid &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;High school senior, Maleficent Taylor, has a problem, she’s a witch who is infatuated with a prince. She’s not a real witch, but she does play one at Disney World in the evenings and on weekends. In life and in the movies, everyone knows that the beautiful princess always ends up with the handsome prince, and the witch always loses. But, much to Maleficent’s surprise, she soon learns Phillip isn’t a run-of-the mill prince. Sure, he may dress country club casual and appear clean cut; but he’s got a dirty mouth, tempting tattoos, and magic hands. Maleficent discovers that sometimes, if she’s wicked enough, the witch wins.</description>

  <description>“You’d never see the ghosts, not properly. You’d only catch a glimpse of their shapes out of the corner of your eye and you’d hear their stolen, vengeful scream; an ear-piercing shriek to steal the lives of anyone who heard it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * * * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Craig, the trip to the cabin was supposed to be a quiet retreat from his hectic city life where he could concentrate on writing his latest novel. For his wife, Susan, and his two kids, Jamie and Ava, it was supposed to be a weekend vacation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For all of them, it became a nightmare.</description>

  <description>Lost in Me is the first book in the Here and Now series, a spin-off of the New York Times and USA Today bestselling New Hope series. This sexy amnesia love triangle is intended for mature readers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~ ~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing I remember is having drinks at Brady’s and trying to avoid eye-contact with my life-long crush—the gorgeous, unattainable Maximilian Hallowell. They tell me that was a year ago, but I have no memories of anything since then. What I do have is this ring on my finger that Max says he gave me, and this much-thinner body I’ve dreamed of most of my life. Aside from a case of retrograde amnesia, everything seems almost...perfect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the deeper I immerse myself into this new world of mine—planning a wedding to a man I don't remember dating, attempting to run a business I don't remember starting—the clearer it becomes that nothing is as it seems. Do I have the life I’ve always wanted or is it a facade propped up by secrets I don't even know I have? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I need answers before I marry Max, and the only person who seems to have them is the angry, tatted, sexy-as-sin rocker Nate Crane. And Nate wants me for himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~ ~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lost in Me is not a standalone novel, as the story continues in Here and Now book two, FALL TO YOU, releasing in June.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kylie Scott returns with the highly anticipated follow-up to international bestseller &lt;em&gt;Lick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Mal Ericson, drummer for the world famous rock band Stage Dive, needs to clean up his image fast—at least for a little while. Having a good girl on his arm should do the job just fine. Mal doesn’t plan on this temporary fix becoming permanent, but he didn’t count on finding the one right girl. Anne Rollins never thought she’d ever meet the rock god who plastered her teenage bedroom walls—especially not under these circumstances. Anne has money problems. Big ones. But being paid to play the pretend girlfriend to a wild life-of-the-party drummer couldn’t end well. No matter how hot he is. Or could it?&lt;br&gt;</description>

Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret—something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;   Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all—she’s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia—or each other—but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband’s secret.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;     Acclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spouses—and, ultimately, ourselves. &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;</description>

  <description>WARNING: This novel contains disturbingly explicit sexual and deviant content that may be considered offensive to some readers, including rape, torture and cannibalism.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Hillary Greyson awakens from a horrific nightmare only to discover that she faces an even grimmer reality.  Naked on a bed in an unfamiliar, empty room, she is unable to move her limbs.  Worse, she cannot remember who she is.  Panic-stricken, Hillary desperately searches her mind for answers, but finds nothing more than fear and confusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man enters the room—a stranger to Hillary.  He introduces himself as Dr. Morrison.  Seemingly benign, he informs Hillary that she is there for her own good…that she is under his care until she regains her memory.  Hillary cannot remember anything, but her instincts warn her not to trust this man who claims to be her doctor.  She can only hope that someone will come looking for her…that someone will find her before it is too late.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several weeks later, Hillary’s situation has grown even more dismal.  Still unclothed, coarse ropes bind her limbs to the bed while she is fed intravenously.  Two new strangers have entered her life—Monica, Dr. Morrison’s wife, and Dr. Bentley, who claims to be her psychiatrist.  Yet they are more evasive than forthcoming.  Her questions remain unanswered.  She is trapped, with no hope of escaping…left to piece together the mystery of her miserable existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abused and neglected, Hillary knows that with each passing day, her chance of survival diminishes.  She spends her long days wasting away, growing depressed…growing angry.  When all hope seems lost, a cruel twist of fate provides the opportunity she has been waiting for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With renewed hope and an unrelenting will to survive, Hillary does whatever it takes to escape.  She yearns for her freedom more than anything in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hillary just wants to go home….</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"Sweet women leave a bad aftertaste in my mouth, because I feel guilty for dirtying them." Jagger tightened his grip on my wrists, making me scream into his hand. He smiled and lowered his beautiful face to mine, his expression almost evil.

(Rita's and Camila's viewpoints).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Past:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christo stalks Sophia in the past, while Jagger reveals a dangerous side of his personality.

  <description>I know I'm a monster, but Elle made me feel like a man. If she knew what I did, about my life with MM, she'd never love me. So I lied. Well, I starfished, and in the end, it brought my world crashing down around me.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't go back to being a monster, because that would mean existing without Elle. So I've made a plan. A plan that could kill me. It doesn't matter though, because I'd rather be dead than live a life without Elle in it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I survive, will Elle forgive me?  If I tell her everything, will she see past the monster?  Will she see the man?</description>

  <description>WARNING: This novel contains references to sexual and deviant content that may be considered offensive  to some readers, including rape, torture and cannibalism.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After sustaining years of sexual abuse by the father she had once loved and trusted, Hillary Greyson finally confides in her mother, only to be called a liar.  Just when all seems hopeless and Hillary has no one to turn to, she discovers an ally, a voice within her that promises to make everything all better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Relying on her one and only friend--the voice of reason, Hillary puts an end to the sexual abuse and those she deemed blameworthy for her  suffering.  Fueled by rage, Hillary lashes out against everyone who hurt her until she is apprehended in the woods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For months, Hillary is left alone in an empty room, tied naked to a bed in the home of a man claiming to be her doctor...a man who says that she is there for her own good.  Hillary finds a way to escape and discovers that she has been delivered to the doctor by a military man, Lieutenant Alan Langford, for the sole purpose of being used as a test subject in an unauthorized and unethical biomedical research experiment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hillary knows there’s just one thing left to do.  With the voice of reason now silent, she has found her own voice, along with the strength and resolve to find this man—-this military lieutenant who prolonged her suffering—-and make him pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hillary just wants revenge….</description>

  <description>I am a Master. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must know this fact to understand my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I capture women. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I break them down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I rebuild them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they are lucky, they are sold into the professional hands of another Master. If they are less fortunate, they are buried beneath the ground, never to be thought of again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I lust for the control, I demand absolute submission and my body yearns to warp the minds of those I train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Power is the only thing I’ll ever need and I am addicted to the feeling of ultimate control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am wealthy, good-looking, educated and charming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I am - in no way - a good man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not want love. &lt;br&gt;I do not want kindness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She thought she could change me by giving me the two things I knew I never wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was wrong.</description>

  <description>***Warning~ This is NOT a book for children***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This romantic comedy is meant for mature readers as it contains unsavory (naughty) language and sexual content***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sixteen-year-old Delilah Welling never understood why Darcy Strong despised her so much. Especially since their mothers had been friends for a lifetime. So when Delilah is asked to be The Junior Bridesmaid in Darcy's wedding, Delilah is understandably surprised and reluctant to say yes. Upon her mother's insistence, Delilah finally agrees determined to look at the bright side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   And there couldn’t be a brighter side than Hugh Rowen, a.k.a. the groom. Delilah has always been in love with Hugh and could never understand what a nice guy like Hugh was doing with a wench like Darcy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Before the wedding, Delilah discovers that the bride-to-be is keeping a torrid secret. Fearful that she will hurt Hugh, she remains silent, going about her Junior Bridesmaid duties as planned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Until...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   All hell breaks loose during the wedding ceremony. Embarrassed and devastated, Delilah flees the wedding. But not before hurting the love of her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Twelve years later, Delilah is 28 and living a happy existence in New York. Until one day when she receives a message addressed to JUNIOR?  Has Hugh hunted her down twelve years later to exact revenge or is he in New York for a different reason entirely? Either way, twelve years is a long time to wait to find out!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is a stand alone romantic comedy meant for mature readers due to mature content and language. Hopefully you will find it to be a funny, lighthearted, entertaining read!***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Release March 2014!!"</description>

  <description>It’s said that women and men are from two different planets when it comes to communication, but how can they overcome the obstacles of prehistoric times when one of them simply doesn’t have the ability to comprehend language?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ehd’s a caveman living on his own in a harsh wilderness. He’s strong and intelligent, but completely alone. When he finds a beautiful young woman in his pit trap, it’s obvious to him that she is meant to be his mate. He doesn’t know where she came from; she’s wearing some pretty odd clothing, and she makes a lot of noises with her mouth that give him a headache. Still, he’s determined to fulfill his purpose in life – provide for her, protect her, and put a baby in her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth doesn’t know where she is or exactly how she got there. She’s confused and distressed by her predicament, and there’s a caveman hauling her back to his cavehome. She’s not at all interested in Ehd’s primitive advances, and she just can’t seem to get him to listen. No matter what she tries, getting her point across to this primitive, but beautiful, man is a constant – and often hilarious – struggle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With only each other for company, they must rely on one another to fight the dangers of the wild and prepare for the winter months. As they struggle to coexist, theirs becomes a love story that transcends language and time.</description>

  <description>Rita is inundated with questions from Frano:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why doesn't she have an Italian accent?&lt;br&gt;Why can't she remember everything?&lt;br&gt;How did she get to America?&lt;br&gt;How did she become an FBI agent?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jagger instead is taking control back and becoming a master again. Can you guess who he's taking as a slave? Camila is going to be furious when she sees who Jagger is focusing on, while Matteo will want to kill Jagger for it. But, Jagger now has the power and will try to force Matteo into betraying Christo and the &lt;em&gt;Padre&lt;/em&gt; with promises of giving this person back. Will it work?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New additions to Episode 8: &lt;strong&gt;Sophia's&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;the Padre's&lt;/strong&gt; viewpoints.</description>

A fierce warrior, Hope is given no choice but to kill Aaron Carmichael.  Caught in her attempt, Hope is captured by Aaron’s top guard in an effort to discover who sent her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever loyal and protective, Xander Black’s sole objective is to defend Aaron and Maddy.

  <description>Everyone has a secret...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe Hyde is on borrowed time. He's been hiding his identity for over four years-hidden from the world that used to adore him--obsess over him--driven to the edge of insanity by one poor choice. &lt;br&gt;But that one choice, altered the course of his life forever. &lt;br&gt;Pretending isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially when pretending means hiding your real self from the people that care about you the most. But if anyone ever discovered the truth it wouldn't just be his life at risk--but hers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saylor doesn't hate men. &lt;br&gt;Just Gabe. &lt;br&gt;Only Gabe. &lt;br&gt;He's a reckless, happy-go-lucky, silver spoon fed pain in her ass. Everything about him makes her more and more confused. Unfortunately they both donate time at the same Group Home. If she wasn't afraid of flunking, she'd be long gone. She hates that she's attracted to him almost as much as he hates that he's attracted to her--and she can tell, especially since their first encounter ended up making her knees so weak she couldn't form coherent sentences for weeks afterwards. But the closer she gets to him, the more confused she becomes. He isn't who he says he is, and he's hiding something big. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happen when two worlds collide? Two worlds that never should have met in the first place? Some secrets are too big to be hidden forever--the only question? Will his destroy everyone he loves? Or finally bring about the redemption he's been craving for the past four years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has a secret...What's yours?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Virgin. Sex addict. Daredevil.  Alcoholic. Smartass … Jackass. Her five friends are about to be filmed. Reality TV, be prepared.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rose Calloway thought she had everything under control. At twenty-three, she’s a Princeton graduate, an Academic Bowl champion, a fashion designer and the daughter of a Fortune 500 mogul. But with a sex addict as a sister and roommate, nothing comes easy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After accepting help from a producer, Rose agrees to have her life filmed for a reality television show. The Hollywood exec is her last chance to revive her struggling fashion line, and boundaries begin to blur as she’s forced to make nice with a man who always has his way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Connor Cobalt is a guy who bulldozes weak men. He’s confident, smart-as-hell and lives with his equally ambitious girlfriend, Rose Calloway. Connor has to find a way to protect Rose without ruining the show. Or else the producer will get what Connor has always wanted—Rose’s virginity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This New Adult Romance can be described as Friends meets The Real World. Expect fist fights, drugs, sex of varying degrees, crude humor and competitive alpha males. Definitely for mature &lt;s&gt;readers&lt;/s&gt; audiences only.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Authors' Note***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiss the Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a spin-off of the Addicted series. If you'd like to read the Addicted series beforehand, you should read them in order (see below) before starting &lt;em&gt;Kiss the Sky &lt;/em&gt; or else the time jumps will be jarring. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Addicted Series Recommended Reading Order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addicted to You (Addicted #1)&lt;br&gt;Ricochet (Addicted #1.5)&lt;br&gt;Addicted for Now (Addicted #2)&lt;br&gt;Kiss the Sky (Spin-Off)&lt;br&gt;Hothouse Flower (Spin-Off)&lt;br&gt;Thrive (Addicted #2.5)&lt;br&gt;Addicted After All (Addicted #3)</description>

  <description>***A Standalone Horror Romance***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note about this book: Donners of the Dead is set in 1851 – couples were often thrust into marriage together with short courtships, racism was widespread and not overly frowned upon, and women had little to no rights. What wouldn't fly in today's day and age was unfortunately the norm back then - it is worth keeping that in mind when reading this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jake McGraw was unlike anyone I’d ever known. He was brash, rude, unapologetic and arrogant; chauvinistic, close-minded, and terribly stubborn. He was built like a tree, tall with a hard chest and wide shoulders and hands that looked like they could wrestle a bear. He was a cigar-chomping, scruffy-faced, beast of a man. I was pretty sure I hated him. And I know he hated me. But among the flesh-eating monsters in these snow-capped mountains, he was the only thing keeping me alive &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1851 and pioneers in search of California gold are still afraid to travel on the same route as the tragic Donner party did years before. When the last wagon train to go into the Sierra Nevada mountains fails to arrive at their destination, Eve Smith, an 18-year old half-native girl with immense tracking skills is brought along with the search party, headed by an enigmatic former Texas Ranger, Jake McGraw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they find deep in the dangerous snow-covered terrain is a terrifying consequence of cannibalism, giving new meaning to the term “monster.” While the search party is slowly picked off, one by one, Eve must learn to trust Jake, who harbors more than a few secrets of his own, in order to survive and prevent the monstrosities from reaching civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is NOT New Adult***</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Flesh-eating zombies, dirty sex, and a shattered past…&lt;br&gt;What’s more dangerous—the man who broke her heart or those trying to eat it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fighting to survive, Eve finds herself alone in the world after the Crave—the only parallel of her former life. On the hunt for her sister, she runs into Gage—the first and only boy to have her heart and break it. It’s been four years and he isn’t a boy anymore, nor is he the same person he used to be. Against her better judgment, Eve agrees to stay with him when he divulges information on a safe haven near the small town they grew up in—but that doesn’t mean she has to like it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning home elicits a myriad of emotions that both Eve and Gage thought they had buried. The past and present collide and they are forced to the face bitter deceits that ruined them in the before and threaten to destroy them now…</description>

  <description>Josie Banks is a girl without a past.  After being found unconscious with no memory, she was shuffled in and out of foster homes where she suffered years of abuse. An experience that left her broken, damaged, and clinging to drugs and meaningless hook-ups to numb her pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Josie disappeared years ago, she took a piece of Tristan with her.  She’s the girl he thought he lost forever—the one he’s never been able to forget.  Now a twist of fate has brought them back together, and he never wants to let her out of his inked arms again.  But Tristan is haunted by a dark past of his own.  On the run from ruthless criminals that shattered Josie’s world years ago, reentering her life puts them both in danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Josie and Tristan’s lives become tangled once again, they find themselves unwilling and unable to escape the relentless pull that draws them together.  But will the past leave their love in ruins—or bind them together for a lifetime?</description>

  <description>Campbell Lee St. Martin has always played by the rules. He follows his head not his heart, but when that backfires not once, but twice, changes are in store for this Mr. Play It Safe. He’s instantly attracted to Jenny’s uninhibited sexuality but soon learns that together, they are highly combustible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jenny thinks Campbell is a bastard and she doesn’t mind putting him in his place. What he needs is a hard slap across the face, which Jenny is willing to provide even if it means the loss of her job, but it doesn’t. Instead, their chemistry forces them together in a physical relationship that neither of them will ever forget. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it possible to build on a relationship that started from lust?</description>

  <description>Two women.  Carly and Tabitha.  They each have suffered life-altering events that have left them both traumatically damaged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carly Sloan’s life was perfect until her security and innocence was torn from her.  The vast repercussions from horrific events threaten to destroy her stability and her chances for a happily ever after. Kyle Finnegan comes into Carly’s life at the height of her turmoil. Can he help her find what she desires most?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabitha Fletcher has constantly suffered from a very young age.  She has been hiding from her past, which was full of sadness, loss and abuse.  She has been so brutally damaged that she has very little hope for redemption.  The revolving door of men only leads her deeper into misery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What circumstance brings these two women together and can they help each other heal?  And will they each find what they need?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Redemption.&lt;br&gt;Love.&lt;br&gt;Family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Dear Emily” is the first book in the “Forever Family” series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is not suitable for young readers.  It is intended for mature adults only (18+).  It contains strong language, adult/sexual situations, non-consensual sex and some violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Teaser - Unedited and subject to change**&lt;br&gt;Copyright Trudy Stiles 2013&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Emily,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do I start off a letter to a child I have yet to meet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A child that has always been in our hearts? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A child that is meant for our family?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your Daddy and I cannot wait for the moment we are able to hold you in our arms for the first time.  To lay our eyes on your perfect face, eyes, toes. To breathe in the essence of a new baby, swirling scents of powder and linen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We cannot wait to feel your beating heart against our chests and to listen to your slow and steady breaths. To hear your soft baby noises.  To soothe your crying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have always dreamed of you, Emily.  We’ve dreamed that someday our family would be blessed with a child.  We are so close.  Our new family is within reach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are here hoping, waiting, praying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love and kisses,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Momma&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My eyes are glistening with tears as I scrawl my signature at the bottom of the letter, touch my fingers to my lips, press them onto her name and close my journal.  I look over to my left where Kyle is softly snoring, sleeping soundly.  I mouth the words “I love you” to him, touch his back lightly, put my journal in my night table drawer and turn out the soft light by my bedside.  I curl my body into his, tuck my head into his chest and hold on tight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love this man with all that I am and I love the father that he is going to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My heart is full of hope.</description>

  <description>Phoenix has been stumbling through life since her brother Adric's tragic death but after eight years, she is finally piecing what remains together. She has a nice apartment, a steady job and not to mention a fresh new 'relationship' with her childhood friend, Kade Haze. He's the sexy boy next door she never even dreamed of falling for, but can’t seem to stop the pull she feels toward him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Just when life began to make sense again and a feeling of normalcy was on the horizon, Phoenix's carefully constructed walls come crashing down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      When walking into the tattoo shop one day, the last thing she’s expecting to see is Kellan Haze, Adric’s best friend no one has seen or heard from since the day they found her brother’s body. He’s nothing as she remembers him as a child, with his wild messy hair, tattoos that cover most of his undeniably sexy body and eyes so intense it makes her legs quiver with one look. The one thing even she can’t deny is the instant rush she feels just by being in his presence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      But how can you choose between love and lust when one of these hold a dark secret, one that can crush your world to pieces and leave you gasping for air. Who can you trust when your mind is pulling you in two different directions and your heart has to choose for you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      The Haze brothers are sexy, daring and possibly  . . . dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      This Regret is a story of love, lust, betrayal and danger with an ending that no one saw coming.</description>

  <description>What could be more peaceful than a small town nestled in the plush and picturesque Appalachian foothills along the Ohio River? Seemingly nothing unless you actually live in such a place and experience the incestuous nature of the meddling, gossip, and desire that can fester there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Lane has cornered the market on virtue in her small town, yet there are forces that want to take that innocence away from her. Unfortunately, the depths of deception, often undetected by the pure of heart can be harmful to the unsuspecting soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an English teacher, dreamer and hopeless idealist Abby immerses herself in romantic fiction to fill the void in her reality. There is one author in particular who speaks directly to her heart and she foolishly makes him the model lover by whom all suitors are to be judged. When others try to bridge that gap, idyllic small town America becomes a mysterious place to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Novel Obsession is a great mix of Mystery, Suspense, Intrigue, and romance. It will answer the question:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it possible for two people to fall in love having never met?</description>

  <description>Chaos never felt this good!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Adult only! This novel is Dark, Twisted, and really Sexy! Absolutely not for the weak at heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blurb: Rain’s been washing blood off her hands for far too long. After five years, she accepts the fact that she’s still a little crazy but feels as if she’s finally gotten it all under control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parties, drugs, and sex flood Jude’s life, and music and scandal run through his veins. He’s the son of a rock god and grandson of a jazz legend. It's no surprise that his own star is on the rise, and with so many groupies vying for his attention, his childhood best friend Rain keeps him anchored in reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s nothing like him—an art student with no idea of her own beauty, who would rather curl up with a sci-fi novel than party in the spotlight. Everything changes when she asks him for a unique favor: she wants him to take her virginity. He’s more than willing to oblige, but things get complicated when his pervy father gets involved. Meanwhile, intense feelings rise to the surface, ones neither Rain or Jude are prepared to deal with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If their relationship has any chance for survival, she must finally confront the demons of her past, and he must face the addictions of the present. When the smoke clears, will they find that sex between best friends was a good idea, or will they discover they had been Flirting With Chaos the entire time?</description>

  <description>Two billionaire brothers enjoy twisted games where women are the sport. They find a female, date her, and compete to see who can bed her first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad they picked the wrong one this time. Dawn's too smart for their verbal play and too quick to get trapped by clever ploys. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more the brothers work to capture her heart, the more they discover she might not be theirs to play.</description>

  <description>This title introduces a film by Almodovar, based on Jonquet's novel, due on 18th November 2011, starring Antonio Banderas. Richard Lafargue is an eminent plastic surgeon haunted by dirty secrets. He has an operating theatre in the basement of his chateau and keeps his partner Eve imprisoned in her bedroom, a room he has equipped with an intercom and 300-watt speakers through which he bellows orders. Eve is only allowed out to be paraded at cocktail parties and on the last Sunday of each month, when the couple visit a young woman in a mental asylum. Following these outings, Lafargue humiliates Eve by forcing her to perform lewd sexual acts with strangers while he watches through a one-way mirror. In alternating chapters, Jonquet introduces seemingly unrelated characters - a criminal on the run after murdering a policeman, and an abducted young man who finds himself chained naked in a dark chamber, forced to endure all manner of physical torture at the hands of a mysterious stranger, whom he calls Mygale, after a type of tropical spider. All of these characters are caught in a deceitful web, waiting to meet their fate.</description>

  <description>I want to tell you how great my life was. How I lived without regrets. With constant laughter. Without any tears. I want to tell you how I lived each moment to the fullest. How each breath I took was fresh and full of life. With eagerness. Without any fear.&lt;br&gt;I want to tell you all of that, but then my story would be masked with lies and not worth telling.&lt;br&gt;My life didn’t start until I left my past. And I left everything. My mother, my friends, my name.&lt;br&gt;My new name, the name everyone knows me by is Erin Lewis.&lt;br&gt;Four years after finding the courage to leave her hometown in Alabama, Erin is finally happy with where her life has led her. Not only is she secure in her environment, but the relationships she has formed center her, making her forget how damaged she once was. Before she can fully settle into her new life, her past crashes into her present, unraveling a set of events that destroy the very foundation she has built her new life on.</description>

  <description>Julia fell down on her knees next to his lifeless body, her heart filling with dread as she noticed the left side of his face was covered in blood. He had fallen off the motorbike, hitting his temple on a sharp-edged rock. His head injury looked really, really bad.&lt;br&gt;“Michael?” she whispered softly, putting a trembling hand on his forehead. “Can you hear me?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia has been in love with Michael for years. He’s the hottest guy in school, and she can’t believe her luck when they finally hit it off during Senior Prom. Her dream doesn’t last, though: after a few dates, he callously dumps her out of the blue. Summer vacation starts with Julia feeling heart-broken and miserable.&lt;br&gt;But then she rescues Michael in the woods when he has a motorcycle accident in a heavy thunderstorm. From that point onward, her life is turned upside down. Michael has changed completely after the blow to the head that nearly killed him... and he wants her back. But why is he so different? And will she be able to trust him this time around?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can the boy who broke your heart ever win it back again..?</description>

  <description>Teagan Cross, college senior, rebel, and wiseass extraordinaire, goes from princess to pauper in a single phone call. Overnight, her life of privilege becomes one of survival, and no matter where she turns, it seems like the world is out to get her. She's not going to fall apart, though.  She's a rebel and she's strong … determined to live life on her own terms … and nothing's going to stop her from getting things done and making things right. But when a twist of fate brings her to the doorstep of a different kind of Rebel, she's forced to figure out when something's worth fighting for and when something's worth letting go.</description>

  <description>I love two men. I screw two men. I am in a relationship with them both, and they are both aware there is another. That is all they need to know, that is all I let them know. They don’t need to know a name; they don’t need to know anything but that they are not alone in my heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have accepted the situation. Stewart, because his life is too busy for the sort of obligations that are required in a relationship. Paul, because he loves me too much to tell me no. And because my sexual appetite is such that one man has trouble keeping up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we exist, two parallel relationships, each running their own course, with no need for intersection or conflict. It works for us, for them, and for me. I don’t expect it to be a long-term situation. I know there is an expiration date on the easy perfection of our lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should have paid more attention, should have looked around and noticed the woman who watched it all. She sat in the background and waited, tried to figure me out. Saw my two relationships, the love between us, and the moment that it all fell apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She hates me. &lt;br&gt;I don’t even know she exists. &lt;br&gt;She loves them. I love them. &lt;br&gt;And they love me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EVERYTHING else hangs in the balance.</description>

  <description>I didn't see it coming, didn't realize how different everything would be within the space of a month. I would fall in love with one man, I would kill another, and I would lose my body, my mind, my soul - my freedom to them. I was an operative, a strong woman, someone sent in to save others, but under these two men I became weak - or pretended to be. I didn't like being weak, it angered me. If I had free rein I could cut my masters in two. But I wasn't there for pride, I was there to free those women and to take down the two men who sold them as sex slaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those men needed to be punished&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I would do it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter the cost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or how much I lost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because I am Rita Kovak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MY MASTERS' NIGHTMARE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#Dark Erotica&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: Like a television series, this book series is broken up into seasons and episodes. Each episode is approximately 20,000 words long, with a new one coming out on average every three weeks until the first season has ended. There will be fifteen episodes per season. The character on the cover will change after five episodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This series is a soap opera, so has crazy plot twists. It also has M/M and M/F non-con and dub-con. It is very dark and violent, so if this isn't for you, don't read it.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Father Michael is coming to supper. Will it be Jagger's last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jagger’s erratic behavior is concerning Frano, but not as much as the threat the Donatelli family bring. They want Jagger and will continue to run the D’Angelo business into the ground until he’s handed over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Frano finally relents, agreeing to giving Jagger ten lashes of a whip as punishment for mutilating Father Michael, Alberto shows his true colors, bringing with him a new era of servitude, something Rita never anticipated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rita's discovery as an FBI agent puts her life at risk, but her resemblance to Jagger's first lover may send her to hell.</description>

  <description>"Some crimes can never be forgotten." &lt;br&gt; Kate Evans doesn't take risks. She chose her apartment with care-a safe district with a good neighbor-a place where she can live a quiet, unassuming, under-the-radar existence. Then she makes one mistake and opens her door to accept a delivery of flowers from a secret admirer and her life will never be the same again. A guy she's never seen before bursts into her apartment and asks her to marry him. Jack Thompson won't take no for an answer and drags Kate on a cross country journey to hell. &lt;br&gt; Invalided out of the police, Nathan Beranson works as a private investigator in San Antonio, Texas where he spends too much of his time following unfaithful spouses and delivering the bad news to their partners. When his fiancee cheats on him with Jack Thompson, the half-brother Nathan's only just met, he becomes obsessed with Jack in the same unhealthy way as his revenge-seeking clients. By the time Nathan finally realizes putting the ghosts of the past to rest is a wiser option than settling an old score, it's too late. He's already been drawn into his sibling's latest deadly game and Nathan and Kate find their nightmare is only just beginning.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five year old Jack Falcon doesn’t do relationships, and why would he when he has woman after woman literally throwing themselves at him? For Jack, life is perfect just the way it is. He works hard and he plays harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack’s life changes when he meets Belle. Unlike any woman he’s ever met, there is something about this girl that makes him unable to keep away, something beyond the youthful beauty and her innocent spirit. Belle is strong and independent, a big leap from the usual brainless chicks he tends to attract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack begins a dangerous game. He is determined to seduce Belle, and without realizing it, his feelings for her develop beyond anything he has ever felt before. Things become complicated when he learns there are good reasons as to why he should stay the hell away from her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can you stay away from someone you want to spend every waking minute with? And what do you do when you know eventually you will destroy that person? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their feelings for each other deepen, Jack struggles with his own internal demons which threaten to rip them apart. Jack is torn between following his heart and listening to his head, which keeps telling him he is not good enough for her. She deserves better than what he can give her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How far will he push before they both fall over the edge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Really, I’m not as bad as my reputation makes me out to be. In fact, I’d go as far to describe myself as a decent guy. I just have no interest in a relationship that extends beyond a quick fuck when it suits me. I really don’t see how it’s my fault or problem if a chick falls for my boyish charms. Every woman seems to think she can change me, that she somehow has something all the other notches on my belt didn’t have.”</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;To trust is to get hurt, to be loved could end in death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone sees Ash as the toughest of the Rata brothers, the tall, tattooed man who is untouchable. But not many know of his past, of a tormented youth, which almost saw him take his own life. For ten years he's lived with the nightmares of his stepfather raping him, and how it destroyed his family. Further tormented by his first love leaving him, he tries to move forward with his new partner Beth, but is unable to open up to her, his past continuing to eat away at his soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth knows Ash is keeping her in the dark, and every word he doesn't say, every secret he keeps, pushes her further into his brother's arms, someone who doesn't understand boundaries, a trait that has given Dante a wild reputation: the man every woman wants to bed. Hedonistic and uncontrollable, Dante desires Beth to the point of madness, his bipolar condition worsening with the stress of his hidden desires. He wants to control her, to take her, but he is deeply reliant on Ash, and like his brother, he hides his true nature. On the outside he shows a confident swagger that gets him the attention of both sexes, but on the inside all he wants is one woman who sees him as more than a sexual object.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sledge, the youngest of the three Rata brothers, finds himself in a different situation, dealing with the affections of his best friend: Beth's brother Corey. Diagnosed with cancer, Corey wants Sledge more than life itself, even though he believes Sledge is homophobic and would find him disgusting if he confessed his love. But when another man shows interest in Corey, Sledge's jealousy eats away at him, and makes him reassess his sexuality, and whether he could be more than a friend to Corey - whether he could be his lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the Rata family's love life is thrown into tangles, the brothers' stepfather escapes from prison with one thing on his mind: To get Ash once again. Someone he will kill for - and has killed for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(R18)</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE NOTE: &lt;em&gt;This is not a romance book, if you want romance start from book 2. See additional notes at the bottom of the blurb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The novel shines a light on a cultural sector rarely addressed in fiction writing, and the fast-paced narrative befits a contemporary thriller fiction novel."&lt;/em&gt; -HarperCollins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life on the rough side of New Zealand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this South Auckland neighbourhood where gang culture, drink, drugs, sex and violence is already a way of life, a vicious attack on a teenage girl sparks a ripple effect of revenge and fury. Live the carnage through multiple viewpoints as the tale unfolds to a bloody climax. NOT for the fainthearted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: Language and sexual references are graphic. 18+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional notes:&lt;/strong&gt; This book has no M/M. It has different main characters from book 2 and 3. The Rata brothers are minor characters in book 1 and major characters from book 2 onward. Graffiti Heaven is a prequel series based around Ash Rata when he was younger.</description>

  <description>A mistake made long ago…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pain buried so deep…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bailey Trent returns home to her small little Ozark mountain town after being away for nearly six years, she knows she’ll face the ghosts of her past. It does not mean she’s prepared to come face to face with the cruelest of those memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darren Cory’s life is a shell of what it once was, and when he’s forced to endure the cause of his agony, hatred abounds quickly. But hating Bailey destroys him too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Darren find a way to move past the pain and forgive the woman he once cared so much for before his anger consumes them both? Or will he drag them into the hell of an unforgiven past.</description>

  <description>The epic, final installment in the Asylum Trilogy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sanity is a funny word. &lt;br&gt;Sanity. &lt;br&gt;Sanity. &lt;br&gt;To be sane. &lt;br&gt;To have clear thoughts. &lt;br&gt;To be able to distinguish the difference from fantasy and reality. &lt;br&gt;I used to think that my sanity was still intact. &lt;br&gt;That all of my marbles were still in the bag known as my mind. &lt;br&gt;That I would never—EVER—let Oakhill get the best of me. &lt;br&gt;Now, I’m not so sure. Now I’m not sure if I really am sane… &lt;br&gt;Or if I’ve lost my mind once and for all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;There will be two spin off novellas for Aurora just so you know. And the first one will be up soon so keep a look out!&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;If I stay, he will kill me. If I leave, he'll destroy Addie and Drew.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jillian Kane appears to have it all - a successful career, a gorgeous home, a loving husband, and two wonderful children. The reality behind closed doors is something else entirely. For nine years, she has hid the bruises and the truth of her abusive marriage in order to protect Addie and Drew, knowing, if she left, Gordon would destroy her-destroy them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When, in an act of desperation, she flees, her worst nightmare is realized, and she finds herself on the run with her two young children, no money, and no plan. With Gordon in hot pursuit, there is only one inescapable certainty: No matter where she goes, he will find her. Kill her. And take her children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A riveting page-turner, HUSH LITTLE BABY exposes the shame and terror of domestic violence as well as the disturbing role manipulation and sabotage can play in the high-stakes game of child custody. Suspenseful and unforgettably moving, it's a novel about the unbreakable bonds of family and the astounding, terrifying devotion of a mother's love.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Infinite possibilities….&lt;br&gt;Infinite passion…..&lt;br&gt;Infinite danger….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His touch spirals through me, warm and sweet, wicked and hot. I shouldn’t trust him. I shouldn’t tell him my secrets. But how do I not when he is the reason I breathe? He is what I need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the young age of eighteen, tragedy and a dark secret force Lara to flee all she has known and loves to start a new life. Now years later, with a new identity as Amy, she’s finally dared to believe she is forgotten–even if she cannot forget. But just when she lets down her guard, the ghosts of her past are quick to punish her, forcing her back on the run.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a plane, struggling to face the devastation of losing everything again and starting over, Amy meets Liam Stone, a darkly entrancing recluse billionaire, who is also a brilliant, and famous, prodigy architect. A man who knows what he wants and goes after it. And what he wants is Amy. Refusing to take “no” as an answer, he sweeps her into a passionate affair, pushing her to her erotic limits. He wants to possess her. He makes her want to be possessed. Liam demands everything from her, accepting nothing less. But what if she is too devastated by tragedy to know when he wants more than she should give? And what if there is more to Liam than meets the eyes?</description>

  <description>The story of Jonathan Drazen and Monica Faulkner continues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it's time Monica stepped up to the plate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;I looked down at him, with his tourmaline eyes and copper hair and believed him despite my better judgment. Then I forgave him despite my misgivings. I loved him just because I did. My heart wasn’t sensible or guarded enough. Not by a sight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was a walking raw nerve ending of emotion, as if the years I’d spent away from men and sex had made me more emotional, more vulnerable, more foolish than before. I ran my fingers through his hair, feeling like the victim of a crime of consent.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Here's how it's going to be, Goddess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until you surrender yourself to me fully, I will not touch you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the world can know you belong to me, I will not kiss you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going to be inches away, at your side. I'm going to whisper in your ear and put my breath on your neck, but the heat of my skin will not feel the shudder of yours until you commit yourself to me completely and without reservation.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; What you’re breaking isn’t some little, meaningless coupling. We aren’t some casual fuck, and we never were. Not from the first night. Not from the first time I laid eyes on you. You were built for me.  I denied it as long as I could, but we were meant to be together. You are the sea under my sky. We’re bound at the horizon. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"You’re mine. The minute I told you to spread your legs and you did it, you were mine. When I told you to beg for it and you did, you were mine. When you put your hands behind your back without being told, I owned you."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No. God, no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Monica, and no matter what Jonathan says, I am not submissive.</description>

  <description>When Jonathan was gone I couldn’t stop thinking about him, and the first thing he did when he got back was demand more of me. I’m willing to give him my orgasms and my time, but I find myself giving up pieces of my heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My career is on track, and even though I can’t write a thing, I can sing. So I’ll go to the art opening with him, because his ex wife will be there. I feel this need to protect him from hurt, though in bed, his domination brings me to my knees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This man is going to break me into a million little pieces.</description>

  <description>After the death of her husband's grandparents, Alice and her family&lt;br&gt;inherit a century old farmhouse located on the outskirts of Pittsburg,&lt;br&gt;New Hampshire. With the house paid off, and with plenty of room for her&lt;br&gt;family to grow, it quickly outshines their small overpriced apartment in&lt;br&gt;Brooklyn, New York. Alice thinks their new home is idealistic, but&lt;br&gt;unnervingly isolated. What Alice doesn't know is that an unknown terror&lt;br&gt;has risen just over the Canadian border, and the latest town to be&lt;br&gt;overtaken by chaos and a nameless horror is only 30 miles away.</description>

  <description>Opposites attract in a sexy tale of unexpected love&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Dempsey patriarch suffers a heart attack, Lucas Dempsey steps up to keep the doors of the family restaurant open. The proverbial prodigal son returns home to Anchor Island—putting family first and his quest to make partner at his high-powered law firm on hold. Sporting a bruised ego after losing his fiancée to his older brother, Lucas would rather walk on glass than spend six weeks within spitting distance of the happy couple. But family duty calls. And that duty includes working side-by-side with a tantalizing spitfire intent on driving him mad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tough-as-nails boat mechanic Sid Navarro is happy to trade her tools for an apron to help the Dempseys in their time of need. That is, until she realizes she’ll be working alongside Lucas, the man she’s loved from afar since she first laid eyes on him in high school. Lucas could charm the paint off a schooner, but Sid knows she doesn’t fit his girl-next-door type. To show her true feelings would mean certain heartbreak, but the temptation of Lucas in her bed might be more than she can resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a rocky start punctuated by verbal barbs and exasperating arguments, things heat up between them—big-time—but their steamy affair turns more than casual in a matter of weeks. Sid’s life has become the dream she’s always wanted, and Lucas has fallen hard for the last woman he ever expected to love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this affair has an end-date, as Lucas must return to his life and career in the big city, a place where Sid would never fit in. When the end comes earlier than expected, walking away turns out to be a challenge neither of them wants to win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up to the Challenge is a sexy, fast-paced, romantic story of family, island life, and finding love in unexpected places.</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a virtuous and tender love story. It’s chaotic, ruthless, and tragic. This story takes love and kills its innocence, steals away the pure moments, and crushes the hearts of the broken. A story born in childhood, tying one girl to one boy, leads to a destructive path—that hurts more than it doesn’t, that shatters more than it heals—testing the love that binds the two through a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tegen Matthews is the daughter of Dorothy Kelley, a club whore in the Hell’s Horsemen. A plain little girl, Tegen falls into the gritty world of the motorcycle club. When she meets a sweet, caring boy, she embraces the warmth and affection he shows her. Cage West is the son of the president of the Hell’s Horsemen. Tall and blond with deep brown eyes, as he grows up Cage realizes the power of his dimpled smile and smooth drawl. With one chance encounter, Tegen becomes forever tied to Cage. Following is a wayward journey that is filled with regrets, mistakes, and heartache, pulling at the threads that hold them together. Cage and Tegen fight hard but love harder, and in the end, what matters is where the journey takes one girl and one boy, who have been twined with one another since the beginning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Tegen and Cage’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love doesn’t erase a broken heart, and it sure doesn’t change people. But no matter how old, how flimsy, how frayed the rope of love is, it keeps you tethered to the people you love.</description>

  <description>Love and Lists is the first book in the Chocolate Lovers spinoff - Chocoholics: The foul-mouthed offspring tell their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Gavin Ellis has always had the love and support of his family ever since he was a little boy and couldn't stop talking about his penis.  He's also always had their unsolicited advice and uncanny knack of embarrassing him at all costs.  Now that he's an adult and trying to convince the love of his life to love him back, things haven't changed very much from when he was younger.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gavin's best friend Tyler suggests he make a to-do list of items that will ensure he wins the girl, Gavin is one-hundred-percent on board: after a few six packs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After puking in the shrubs, a bad experience with Viagra, a Sex-Ed course gone wrong, and a slew of other mishaps courtesy of his family and friends, Gavin is pretty sure this list will be the death of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, trying to make someone love you with a list isn't always the best idea.  Especially when "Show her your penis" is the first "to-do" item...</description>

  <description>A ROMANTIC SUSPENSE NOVEL. No one knew a woman lived there or that she even existed. A monster, living in darkness...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At twenty-two, Nicole doesn't even look human anymore. The beast made sure of that. So she hides. A monster, consigned to a life of fear and solitude. This is all she deserves, she is quite sure of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then one day out of the blue, the autographed baseball caught by Brian Jensen at the latest Marlins game enters her prison and manages to turn her world completely upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temptation comes in the form of pity at first, and then perhaps something more.  Does she dare to believe the things she's told, that this is not the life she was meant to live? That being a monster is not her forever-fate? And will she be willing to risk everything, to reach out and accept the helping hands around her and share her deepest, darkest secrets? She knows only too well that hands can hurt. Finding out whether they can also heal is a risky proposition, especially when the beast is still out there. Looking for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This story was inspired by true events. If you liked the movie "Sleeping With the Enemy", then you might like this story too. CONTENT WARNING: Violence, foul language, and adult situations. Not meant for younger readers.**</description>

  <description>Ambrose Young was beautiful.  He was tall and muscular, with hair that touched his shoulders and eyes that burned right through you. The kind of beautiful that graced the covers of romance novels, and Fern Taylor would know.  She'd been reading them since she was thirteen.  But maybe because he was so beautiful he was never someone Fern thought she could have...until he wasn't beautiful anymore.&lt;br&gt;	Making Faces is the story of a small town where five young men go off to war, and only one comes back.  It is the story of loss.  Collective loss, individual loss, loss of beauty, loss of life, loss of identity.  It is the tale of one girl's love for a broken boy, and a wounded warrior's love for an unremarkable girl.  This is a story of friendship that overcomes heartache, heroism that defies the common definitions, and a modern tale of Beauty and the Beast, where we discover that there is a little beauty and a little beast in all of us.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A full-length book from the miniseries readers RAVED about!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lust is a dangerous thing. It can make you believe things that are not real. It can seduce your mind and lead it blindfolded to the cliff that will be its demise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would you do if you could leave your life? Wake up one day and be someone else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I signed the contract. I left Candace Tapers and her slutty, strip club life behind, abandoned every part of that life with one hesitant swipe of my pen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agreement was clear:&lt;br&gt;1. Sex&lt;br&gt;2. Photo ops&lt;br&gt;3. No romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I need a wife. I am not signing up for romance, or affection, or a full time job. I will not love you. I will have no use for you other than sex and photo ops."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sex with Nathan was easy. More than easy. Panty-melting, can-never-get-enough HOT. I had begun to think that I could live this new life, showered in luxuries, orgasms, and diamonds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I started tripping over secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disclaimer: The Dumont Diaries contains a strong alpha male, super hot explicit sex, and twists and turns that might cause unnatural heart palpitations. This book does not contain BDSM elements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out why readers are saying:&lt;br&gt;"This man is sexy, scary and a total mystery."&lt;br&gt;"twisted, delicious, sexy..."&lt;br&gt;"this book took my breath away, caused gasps, heart clutches and desire for more."&lt;br&gt;"the writing is HYPNOTIC."&lt;br&gt;"Phenomenal."&lt;br&gt;"Intensely Gripping"&lt;br&gt;"Highly addictive"&lt;br&gt;"I LOVED IT"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*The Dumont Diaries was originally released, and is still available as a four-part miniseries. This book combines the four pieces of the miniseries into one, full-length novel.</description>

  <description>After losing her band mate and brother to a drug overdose, rising rock star Hayley finds herself in a downward spiral. The new album from her band Plush is received as a critical and commercial disaster. She finds new hope and friendship in Enzo, the replacement guitarist who inspires her to reach new creative heights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But soon their collaboration crosses the line and Hayley, who is married with two children, retreats from Enzo’s advances. As Hayley slowly discovers Enzo’s dark and troubled history, she realizes she may have let a madman into her home and that her mistake may cost the lives of the people closest to her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written by KATE CRASH, a musician, multimedia performance artist, and writer based out of Hollywood who contributed four songs to the movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This stand alone story tells a personal, visceral, firsthand account of the film and the four years leading up it.</description>

  <description>The Back-Up List has only ever been a joke- that's it. Madison Grey has a celebrity crush list of possible replacement husbands ready with the off-chance her husband might inexplicably vanish. Clearly, Madison was not prepared for- A. her husband's untimely death and B. Calvin Hunt, rock god and top man on her Back-Up List to begin crushing on her. Talk about your cruel cosmic ironies. It has only been six months since her entire family was killed in a tragic accident and he's looking to her for a hook-up! Really? Calvin Hunt, rock icon, is living the dream of any womanizing man-whore- that is until he spots the first unavailable woman he's ever met. What the hell? Is she gay? He's busily seducing her with concert tickets and exotic getaways, all while he's touring. There are plenty of obstacles he'll have to overcome to be with her and he'll need all the help he can get from his stoic bodyguard, his nosy Oprah-channeling brother and even Madison's bizarrely quirky friends who are all fighting to cross his name off of Madison's Back-Up List.</description>

  <description>My heart stopped and suddenly it was hard to breathe. His voice always had that effect on me. It was like poison slowly running through my veins killing me bit by bit. Like a drug that I couldn't get enough of even though I was almost down to my last breath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jace took a step forward and grabbed my hand. He slowly trailed his fingers over my face and backed me into the wall. My heart stopped again if that was even possible. "You can't leave," he whispered. "I need you." His warm breath kissed my lips as he bit his bottom lip and placed both of his hands around my face. They were warm and soft to the touch. Too big for my fragile face, although I wanted to bury myself in them. "Breathe. There is no one here but the two of us. Breathe," he whispered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Avery Hale had spent her whole childhood abused by her drunken, hopped-up parents. Broken from a lifetime of hate and pain she grew up realizing that trust and love just didn't exist. Not in her world at least. After turning the age of eighteen, she packed up and moved far away determined to escape her hurtful past and start a new life. Once on her own she comes to the conclusion that the emptiness still exist. Doing what she had to to survive she found herself mixed up in exotic dancing and meaningless sexual relationships unable to feel anything, for anyone. She was sure that her life was worthless and there was nothing left for her. On the other hand, so she thought.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After meeting a beautiful stranger, jace, her life suddenly is turned upside down. Everything that she truly believed suddenly gets questioned and then she is left to figure out if there is really more to her than she could ever have imagined. Jace, having some secrets of his own puts the pain of his own past behind to do what he can to help Avery.Can the love of another broken person be enough to help Avery, or is she already too far gone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Avery's life is pulled in many directions as she tries to find herself, and not everyone and thing is what they seem to be in this story of love, trust and opening up. Finding herself and learning to love herself might just be the hardest thing she's ever had to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find this book on Amazon.com &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wake-Up-Call-Victoria-Ashley/dp/1490906134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1378062783&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=wake+up+call+victoria+ashley" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Wake-Up-Call-Vi...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You know how sometimes, your high school crush grows up to be an insanely famous movie star? Okay, probably not. But I do.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;~Layla Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in high school, Trip Wiley’s fanbase only encompassed the denizens of the nothing little suburb of Norman, New Jersey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, all that is about to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer of 2000, Layla Warren is enjoying her career as a journalist in New York City (well, sort of), while Trip spends most of his time grabbing Hollywood by the balls. In the days before what will turn out to be his skyrocketing fame, they’ll find themselves confronted with some life-altering choices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember When 2&lt;/em&gt; is the second story in an NA romance trilogy. It will bring you back to that exuberant and riotous time of life in your twenties when you struggled to figure out your place in the world and the person you were meant to be…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…and the person you were meant to be &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Intended for ages 18+ due to some questionable language and sex.**&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Parker Davis has conquered three major American cities and is the new ‘it’ man in massage. He earned the nickname ‘Feather Light’ for his sensual touches, tender caresses, and soft voice eliciting an almost orgasmic release. Clients from all over clamor for his services and his clientele are growing by the minute. Business is at its peak, which makes Parker a busy man who has no time to deal with problems, let alone dwell on his blindness. With his declining vision, Parker has to accept his limitations and the changes brought forth by this disease, but he is not ready to relinquish the last control he has left. He is still the master in his bedroom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelly Storm, a Hollywood actress, will do whatever it takes to get some much-deserved peace. Being famous has its perks, except the little privacy her popularity afforded her is slowly eating at her. With the paparazzi hounding her every minute of the day, and her personal life under constant scrutiny, Kelly wants a semblance of normalcy wherever she can get it. Under the urging of a close friend, she agrees give Parker a try. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their first meeting is nothing she expected. Kelly finds comfort in his gentle probing and the spellbinding experience guaranteed to keep her coming back for more. Parker knows the woman on his table is special. He feels her vulnerability with his fingertips and her smooth curves leave a burning ache inside him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night of steamy passion is all it takes to know that they wanted each other in more ways than one. Kelly hides in heavy disguises, making it impossible for Parker to know her true identity. What secret is Kelly keeping and will she trust Parker enough to tell him the truth? Will Parker see beyond Kelly’s lies to show her what a future with him holds?</description>

  <description>Brooke Wright has only two goals her senior year at Charity Run High School: stay out of trouble and learn to forgive herself for the past. Forgiveness proves elusive, and trouble finds her anyway when she discovers a secret club at school connected to the death of her best friend. She learns that swim team members participate in a “Fantasy Slut League,” scoring points for their sexual acts with unsuspecting girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke, wracked with guilt over her friend’s death, decides to infiltrate the league by becoming one of the “unsuspecting girls,” and exact revenge on the boys who stole away her best friend. An unexpected romance complicates her plans, and her dogged pursuit of justice turns her reckless as she underestimates just how far the boys will go to keep their sex club a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is a New Adult fiction book with mature themes. It contains graphic sex and language and a description of sexual violence.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>When college sophomore Angela Birch sneaks from Texas to Mexico for Spring Break, she believes the worst that can happen is her parents finding out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst is falling for the ruse of handsome, alluring Fernando. One spontaneous choice whisks Angela across the world to the pseudo paradise of Spain’s Mediterranean Riviera where she has another choice to make: live cooperatively as one of billionaire Marco Ruiz’s slaves, or die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Douglas’s future was seized and choked when deliberate tragedy struck his Scottish family at the age of sixteen. He spent his remaining youthful years infiltrating the U.K.’s crime world, seeking power, control, and revenge, all leading to a position as an undercover agent. With nothing to lose, Colin accepts the seemingly impossible job of rescuing America’s famous missing girl, Angela Birch. Colin knows that to enter a snake lair, one must become a snake. It turns out to be a mission which will put his desire for control to the ultimate test, and make him wish for things he never knew he wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*AUTHOR'S NOTE*    Escape from Paradise is a work of fiction intended for adult readers, containing graphic sexual scenarios and strong language.</description>

  <description>Val receives a calling card from a very dangerous boy who wants to play with her. It's a game without rules, logic, or consequence, and he'll stop at nothing to claim her as his—even if it means destroying them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, Valerian Kimble got herself entangled with a burgeoning sociopath intent on adding her to his own columns of wins and losses. She managed to escape him, but at a terrible cost...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This time it's personal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a high school senior, Val is a pale shadow of the girl she once was and still recovering from the terrible trauma she suffered at his hands. She is understandably reluctant when her friends receive mysterious invitations to a theme party being held in one of the old manor homes on the edge of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right away, something about the party seems off. The other guests are secretive, and strangely hostile. Cell phones don't work. Doors lock and unlock, seemingly at will. And the festivities start to take a turn for the sinister as the evening progresses. Because their host loves games. Loves them so much that he's decided to make a little wager. The deadline is sunrise. The stakes? Their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let the games begin&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>Haunted is a novel made up of stories: twenty-three of the most horrifying, hilarious, mind-blowing, stomach-churning tales you'll ever encounter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are told by the people who have all answered an ad headlined 'Artists Retreat: Abandon your life for three months'. They are led to believe that here they will leave behind all the distractions of 'real life' that are keeping them from creating the masterpiece that is in them. But 'here' turns out to be a cavernous and ornate old theater where they are utterly isolated from the outside world - and where heat and power and, most importantly, food are in increasingly short supply. And the more desperate the circumstances become, the more desperate the stories they tell - and the more devious their machinations to make themselves the hero of the inevitable play/movie/non-fiction blockbuster that will certainly be made from their plight.</description>

  <description>He followed her because he wanted to own her. She trusted him because she wanted excitement. There's a saying that curiosity can kill … but Valerian Kimble is beginning to learn that satisfaction might just be worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourteen-year-old Valerian lives in an age where antiheroes and bad boys are portrayed as the romantic ideal, and good guys are passe and boring. So when Gavin Mecozzi, the school's brilliant but twisted loner, begins to show an interest in her after a chance meeting in a pet store, Val is intrigued. He's charming and poetic and makes her feel things that she thought were only possible in books--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because somebody is stalking Val. Somebody who wants to hurt her. Own her. Possess her. Maybe even kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As her meetings with Gavin unravel into a more complex and frightening relationship, Val can't help but wonder if the new boy in her life is her depraved and obsessive stalker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And whether he's capable of murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is running out.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>The fourth and final installment in the sexy miniseries, The Dumont Diaries!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have discovered the witch who started this disaster, and her name is Cecile. She is the lock around my husband's heart; she is the barrier between me and everything I ever wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have decided to fight. For his heart, for my father, for the Jimmy Choos that rest on my perfectly manicured feet. The problem with a fight is that there is ultimately a loser. And in a situation like this, she has the advantage and a clear head start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I am here, and she is not. And I have not shared everything. I have some secrets and some advantages of my own. I will fight to the death, if not of my body, than of my heart. And if my heart is destroyed in this battle, I will find a way to survive. Poor planning may not be the final chapter in my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Do Us Part is a novella, 16,000 words in length, and is the final volume of The Dumont Diaries, a 4-part series.&lt;br&gt;The Dumont Diaries series synopsis:&lt;br&gt;Candace Tapers' life finally takes an upward swing when Nathan Dumont, shipping heir and notorious playboy, sweeps her away to a lifestyle of wealth and privilege. But that life comes with strings, and she is soon pulled in directions she never expected, discovering secrets and ulterior motives in the man who shares her bed.</description>

  <description>He watches me. Watches as my husband makes me submit, makes me do things that, even in their depravity, bring me pleasure. He knows what I like, and how I like it. But while Nathan dominates my body, Drew is interested more in my soul.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can only bend so far before I break. Drew is my crack, my weak point around which everything else splinters. Even as more secrets are unveiled and all of the signs point to danger, I roll farther into this world. Into this high-brow life, into both of their beds.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to what end? At this point, I don’t know what’s in more danger: my heart or my life. For these men, these two men who I am pushed and pulled between? They seem to be much more interested in my death than they ever were my life.</description>

  <description>Book 2 of The Dumont Diaries (four books in the series)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Nathan Dumont, heir to Dumont Shipping, steps onto the scene with a new wife, the media sits up and takes notice. But nothing can be found on the new Mrs.Dumont. No family history, private school chums, or expensively hidden skeletons in couture closets. It is as if she has materialized out of thin air, and wearing Chanel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life in a fairytale sucks. Even if it does come complete with eight inches of wontleavemealone steel. But when that glorious package is attached to a man that won’t give me a second glance, much less a piece of his heart, what good is a wedding ring and boatloads of cash?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make matters worse, I am slowly stumbling along and finding red flags. Flags that make me think there is more to this fairytale than meets the eye. In fact, I’m not so sure it’s a fairytale at all. It looks to be much, much worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Hold is a novella, approximately 60 pages, and is book 2 of a 4-part series.</description>

  <description>My life, inside this apartment is simple. It works, as long as I follow the rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Don’t leave the apartment. Not in case of fire, not to mail a letter, not to run an errand. The door stays shut, and I stay inside.&lt;br&gt;2. Don’t get attached to clients. I take off my clothes, I stand in front of the camera, and I perform. What they want, I give. Their secrets, I keep. Everything I tell them, is a lie.&lt;br&gt;3. Don’t kill anyone. I’ve obeyed that rule for over three years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My life, inside this apartment was simple, and it worked. Then, I started breaking rules.</description>

  <description>The lights have become a blanket of sorts, wrapping me in their warmth, shielding me from whatever is out there to hurt me. They block the faces that stare, the eyes that follow my movement. I used to squint when they came on, would duck my head to avoid the glare. But ducking takes me under the glare and reveals the world behind the lights, and that is a world I don’t want to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When salvation comes in the form of six feet of drop-dead-gorgeous, complete with a limo and a thick wad of cash, my stilettos run happily out the door to freedom. They say that money doesn’t buy happiness. But it does buy escape. Happiness is an overrated fairytale.</description>

  <description>I'm not your typical girl. I've been running away from the memories that haunt me for so long that depression has become my only comfort. I was content in the darkness...until Wes Michals offered to be my light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't know that time wasn't my ally -- that every second that ticked past was one step closer to the end of something that was beginning to mean the end of myself. He tried to warn me. He promised me all he was able to offer--each moment as it came--but it would never be enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes when you think it's the end, it's only the beginning. Wes thought he could save me, but in giving me everything, he ruined me. Because after one kiss, one touch, I couldn't--I wouldn't ever be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And from that moment on, his heartbeat became my own.</description>

  <description>You know that saying about how sometimes you're the windshield and sometimes you're the bug? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's true. Take me, for example. I shook the Georgia dust from my feet fifteen years ago,vowing never to leave Manhattan. I traded sweet tea for Chardonnay, fried chicken for nouvelle cuisine, lazy days on my aunt's front porch for ad campaigns and board meetings, and the guy who broke my heart for my handsome boss, who soon became my fiance. Perfect, right? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until my sister called. We haven't spoken since I left home—because she married the guy who broke my heart. What's more, she called to say my father is dying—but he refuses to finish until I show up. So I'm back in the hottest, dinkiest small town in Georgia, facing my sister and my old boyfriend over the heads of the—count them—five children. It couldn't get weirder, right? Unless you count Sam Parker—a long-forgotten classmate, now the town doctor—and how good he's beginning to look to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm falling apart, I think, wondering why resentment and wounded pride seem silly here in Walton, where forgiveness and acceptance go hand-in-hand with homecoming. And I'm beginning to suspect that I'm falling in love for real this time, with a man whose touch is so right, I feel like I'm...&lt;em&gt;Falling Home&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He was a man who didn’t deserve a second chance. But he needed one…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily and her husband Sandy Portman seemed to live a gracious if busy life in an old-world, Upper West Side apartment in the famous Dakota building.  But one night on the way to meet Emily, Sandy dies in a tragic accident.  The funeral isn't even over before Emily learns she is on the verge of being evicted from their apartment.  But worse than the possibility of losing her home, Emily is stunned when she discovers that her marriage was made up of lies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Emily is forced on a journey to find out who her husband really was . . . all the while feeling that somehow he isn't really gone.  Angry, hurt, and sometimes betrayed by loving memories of the man she lost, Emily finds comfort in a scruffy dog named Einstein.  But is Einstein's seemingly odd determination that she save herself enough to make Emily confront her own past?  Can he help her find a future—even after she meets a new man? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Julia and Michael meet in high school in their small, poverty-stricken West Virginia hometown. Both products of difficult childhoods -- Julia’s father is a compulsive gambler and Michael’s mother abandoned his family when he was a young boy – they find a sense of safety and mutual understanding in each other. Shortly after graduation they flee West Virginia to start afresh. Now thirty-somethings, they are living a rarified life in their multi-million-dollar,Washington D.C. home. From the outside it all looks perfect – Julia has become a highly sought-after party planner, while Michael has launched a wildly successful flavored water company that he sold for $70 million. &lt;br&gt;But one day Michael stands up at the head of the table in his company's boardroom -- then silently crashes to the floor. More than four minutes later, a portable defibrillator manages to jump-start his heart. Yet what happened to Michael during those lost minutes forever changes him. Money is meaningless to him now - and he wants to give it all away to charity. A prenuptial agreement that Julia insisted upon back when Michael's company was still struggling means she has no claim to his fortune, and now she must decide: should she walk away from the man she once adored, but who truthfully became a stranger to her long before his near-death experience - or should she give in to her husband's pleas for a second chance and a promise of a poorer but happier life?</description>

  <description>Through the corridors of the Windy City’s criminal courts, single mother Libby Tucker knows exactly how far she’ll go to save her cancer-stricken son’s life. The undefeated defense attorney is prepared to take her fight all the way to the majors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Circumstances force Libby to plead her case at the cleats of celebrity baseball player Banford Aidan Palowski, the man who discarded her at their college graduation. Libby has worked her backside bare for everything she’s attained, while Aidan has been indulged since he slid through the birth canal and landed in a pile of Gold Coast money. But helping Libby and living up to his biological duty could jeopardize the only thing the jock worships: his baseball career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If baseball imitates life, Aidan admits his appears to be silver-plated peanuts, until an unexpected confrontation with the most spectacular prize that’s ever poured from a caramel corn box blindsides him. When he learns about his son’s desperate need, it pricks open the wound he’s carried since he abandoned Libby and the child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Libby wants is a little anonymous DNA, but Aidan has a magical umpire in his head who knows Libby’s a fateball right to the heart. When a six-year-old sage and a hippy priestess step onto the field, there’s more to settle between Libby and Aidan than heartache, redemption, and forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What does it take to rise from life’s depths, swim against the current, and breathe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weighted down by the loss of her parents, Blythe McGuire struggles to keep her head above water as she trudges through her last year at Matthews College. Then a chance meeting sends Blythe crashing into something she doesn’t expect—an undeniable attraction to a dark-haired senior named Chris Shepherd, whose past may be even more complicated than her own. As their relationship deepens, Chris pulls Blythe out of the stupor she’s been in since the night a fire took half her family. She begins to heal, and even, haltingly, to love this guy who helps her find new paths to pleasure and self-discovery. But as Blythe moves into calmer waters, she realizes Chris is the one still strangled by his family’s traumatic history. As dark currents threaten to pull him under, Blythe may be the only person who can keep him from drowning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book is intended for mature audiences due to strong language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: due to mature content recommended for Ages 17+</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;At the heart of The Husband’s Secret is a letter that’s not meant to be read&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My darling Cecilia, if you’re reading this, then I’ve died...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret—something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .&lt;br&gt;Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all—she’s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia—or each other—but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband’s secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spouses—and, ultimately, ourselves.</description>

  <description>Catherine has been enjoying the single life for long enough to know a good catch when she sees one. Gorgeous, charismatic, spontaneous - Lee seems almost too perfect to be true. And her friends clearly agree, as each in turn falls under his spell. But there is a darker side to Lee. His erratic, controlling and sometimes frightening behaviour means that Catherine is increasingly isolated. Driven into the darkest corner of her world, and trusting no one, she plans a meticulous escape. Four years later, struggling to overcome her demons, Catherine dares to believe she might be safe from harm. Until one phone call changes everything. This is an edgy and powerful first novel, utterly convincing in its portrayal of obsession, and a tour de force of suspense.</description>

  <description>EVIL DOES EXIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An abandoned house, a serial killer, and a victim reaching out from the grave. A woman races against time to unearth buried secrets before she becomes a ghost herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                      YOU ARE NOT ALONE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madeline Anderson goes to Isabelle Island, Washington, to sell a family home abandoned over forty years before. Strange things occur the moment she steps on the property. Inside the dilapidated old house, items move about on their own accord. Noises come from empty rooms. She has a vivid, recurring dream of a woman running for her life. The wind rustling through the trees sounds like urgent, murmuring voices. When the cacophony dies down, one single word emerges: Madeline, Madeline, Madeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YOU CAN NOT HIDE &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first, Doug Lindstrom, the hot fireman helping Maddy restore the old home, doesn't believe anything bizarre is going on. He’s certain Maddy is jumping at shadows because the local kids call the house haunted. That is until he witnesses horrific violence he can't explain. After Maddy’s life is threatened not once, but twice, Doug vows there will not be a third time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THEY ARE WATCHING                &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While searching for answers, Maddy uncovers astonishing secrets about her aunt's past. Finding more questions then answers, she digs deeper until she stumbles across evidence of a cold case involving a serial killer named The Seaside Strangler. Now Maddy must unmask the killer. The life she saves just might be their own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DON'T FORGET TO PICK UP THE NEXT SPINE TINGLING BOOK IN THE SPIRITS TRILOGY: SPIRITS AMONG US     &lt;br&gt;AVAILABLE NOW!</description>

  <description>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media--as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents--the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter--but is he really a killer? &lt;br&gt; As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet?</description>

  <description>"Hi, I'm the guy who reads your e-mail, and also, I love you . . . "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Fremont and Jennifer Scribner-Snyder know that somebody is monitoring their work e-mail. (Everybody in the newsroom knows. It's company policy.) But they can't quite bring themselves to take it seriously. They go on sending each other endless and endlessly hilarious e-mails, discussing every aspect of their personal lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Lincoln O'Neill can't believe this is his job now- reading other people's e-mail. When he applied to be "internet security officer," he pictured himself building firewalls and crushing hackers- not writing up a report every time a sports reporter forwards a dirty joke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lincoln comes across Beth's and Jennifer's messages, he knows he should turn them in. But he can't help being entertained-and captivated-by their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time Lincoln realizes he's falling for Beth, it's way too late to introduce himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would he say . . . ?</description>

  <description>It’s one thing to bring the woman you love back into your life. It’s another to try and keep her there. For Dex Foray, con­vinc­ing Perry Palomino to open her­self to their bur­geon­ing rela­tion­ship has been more chal­leng­ing than hunt­ing ghosts, bat­tling demons and stalk­ing Sasquatch com­bined. Add in the fact that the only way they can keep their Exper­i­ment in Ter­ror show run­ning is to take on a third part­ner in the form of the mys­te­ri­ous Max­imus Jacobs — all while inves­ti­gat­ing a sin­is­ter voodoo sect in New Orleans — and you’ve got the per­fect South­ern storm and a recipe for dis­as­ter. Luck­ily, Dex has never been one to back down, even when his life –and heart — are on the line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come Alive is told from Dex’s POV.</description>

  <description>Perry Palomino has fought her demons – and won – but the battle is far from over. She’s now left broken and on her own, leaving behind her life and family in Portland to focus on giving Dex Foray – and the Experiment in Terror show – a second chance. But their past mistakes continue to tease and test their relationship, as does the wild and desolate terrain of the Canadian Rockies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The snow-covered peaks and ravenous forests hide an urban legend too unbelievably frightening to be true and the only way the duo has a chance of surviving is if Perry can let in the very man who sent her to hell and back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rated 16+ for lan­guage, gore and sex­ual content&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>When the life you wanted has crumbled beneath your fingers, there’s nothing left to do but pick up the pieces and soldier on. You’ve done this before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what happens when you no longer feel like yourself anymore? When fires spontaneously start-up around you, when you hear growling coming from underneath your bed, and you no longer recognize your face in the mirror. What happens then?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ghost-hunter Perry Palomino doesn’t have much time to find out. Now, the evil she used to hunt is a lot closer to home. It’s inside of her, taking over her life bit-by-terrifying bit, and there’s only one person who can help her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If part of her doesn’t kill him first.</description>

  <description>It’s been two months since Perry Palomino and Dex Foray’s relationship reached a new turning point, two months since Perry started a new life in Seattle, and two months since their Experiment in Terror show took on a new partner, ex-Wine Babe Rebecca Sims, and found a new level of success. But whenever there is light in their lives, the madness still has a way of coming back in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the team is sent back to the stormy Oregon coast to investigate a haunted school, Perry wants to use the opportunity to reconnect with her family and reintroduce Dex into their lives. Only Perry’s not the only one who’s reaching out – her grandmother Pippa has started appearing to her with disturbing warnings and Perry’s presence at the school has ignited a chilling new wave of supernatural phenomenon. Once used a century ago as a sanatorium to house children dying of tuberculosis, the school’s past residents are slowly coming back to life and with one thing on their mind. They want someone to play with, someone to join them. Forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even when dead, some children get whatever they want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And they want Perry.</description>

  <description>With the Experiment in Terror show finding some success, amateur ghost hunters Perry Palomino and Dex Foray embark on their most terrifying investigation yet. A tiny, fog-shrouded island in the rough strait between British Columbia and Washington State has held a dark secret for decades: It was a former leper colony where over forty souls were left to rot, die and bury each other. Now a functioning campground, Perry and Dex spend an isolated weekend there to investigate potential hauntings but as the duo quickly find out, there is more to fear on D’Arcy Island than just ghosts. The island quickly pits partner against partner, spiraling the pair into madness that serves to destroy their sanity, their relationship and their very lives.</description>

  <description>Lilith Bresson, an independent, successful young artist, is forced to travel from her home in Spain to the wild borderlands of northern England, to repay her feckless father’s latest debt by painting a portrait of the enigmatic Lady Blaine Albermarle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her first night at Albermarle Hall she meets Finn Strachan, Blaine’s ‘companion’, a cultured and hauntingly beautiful young man who seems to have it all. But Lilith has an artist’s eye, and a gift for seeing what lies beneath the skin. She soon discovers that Blaine is more gaoler than lover, and if the price is right, depravity has no limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the weeks pass, Lilith finds that she too is drawn into the malign web that her patron has spun, yet against the odds she forges a strong friendship with the damaged, dysfunctional Finn. In a dark, modern twist to an age-old story, Lilith Bresson proves that sometimes it’s the princess who needs to become the rescuer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that this storyline contains depictions of drug abuse, violence and non-consensual sexual activity.</description>

  <description>How do you keep existing when your heart is so splintered, so completely torn to shreds, your pulse is fading?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’re…broken.  How do you move forward when every breath is nothing more than a constant ache?  Living becomes an insidious reminder that you threw away the single largest part of yourself. Your…soul.  No amount of distraction can pull you from the torture of losing your…life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that Emily Cooper has walked away from her first love, she finds herself running toward her only love.  Unraveling fast, but clinging to hope, Emily risks all she has left on the man that has consumed her every thought and dream since the day they met.  Will Gavin take her back?  And if so, will their reunion be a collision of two hearts destined to complete one another and rekindle a love that knew no boundaries?  Or will scars from their past rip open, tearing slowly at what each of them was meant to be?  Can fate, the ultimate game changer, mend the shattered road it laid out from the start?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only time will tell…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tick-Tock…</description>

  <description>The dark secret Kayden has kept hidden for years is out. Worse, he's facing charges for battery. The only way he stands a chance against the charges is if Callie speaks up, something he'll never ask her to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie knows Kayden is going back to his dark place and desperately wants to save him. But saving him means admitting her secrets aloud. Callie and Kayden are stronger than they think, especially when they're together. Together they move forward, face their demons, and finally start to heal from their traumatic pasts.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A 2012 Readers' Choice Awards Finalist in Romantic Suspense!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A woman without a past…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a tragic accident left her with no memory, Kate Alexander struggled to fit in with a husband and world that didn’t feel right. She’s had no reason to question what friends and family have told her, not until her husband is suddenly killed and she finds a photo of a young girl in his office. A girl who can’t be anyone but a daughter Kate didn’t know she had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A man desperate for a reason to live…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan Harrison lost his wife in a plane crash five years ago. To cope with the pain of her loss, he dedicated himself to his job and to raising their daughter. Now a successful pharmaceutical executive, Ryan has everything a man could want—money, fame and power—but he’d give it all up in a heartbeat for just one more day with the woman he still loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two lives about to converge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Kate begins to dig into a past she doesn’t remember, evidence leads her to San Francisco and puts her on the path toward Ryan, a man who sees in her the woman he loved and lost. Kate feels a draw to Ryan, one she can’t explain, but is that feeling enough to convince her this is where she’s supposed to be? As Ryan and Kate search for answers, they uncover lies long buried, a passion hotter than either expected and a danger that threatens…even now…when the second chance they’ve both been searching for is finally within reach.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Secret of Ella and Micha&lt;/em&gt; comes a mesmerizing novel of fate, friendship, and the healing power of love . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE COINCIDENCE OF CALLIE &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;KAYDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Kayden, suffering in silence was the only way to survive. If he was lucky, he could keep his head down, do as he was told, and make it through the day. But one night it seemed like his luck-and his life-might finally end . . . until an angel named Callie appeared just in time to rescue him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie has never believed in luck. Not since her twelfth birthday when everything was taken from her. After the worst was over, she locked up her feelings and vowed never to tell anyone what happened. Now, six years later, she continues to struggle with the painful secret that threatens to consume her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fate lands Kayden and Callie at the same college, Kayden is determined to get to know the beautiful girl who changed his destiny. Quiet and reserved, Callie still fears letting anyone else into her world. But Kayden is certain that Callie has come back into his life for a reason. And the more he tries to be a part of her life, the more he realizes that, this time, it's Callie who needs to be saved . . .</description>

  <description>Ellie Watt is used to starting over. The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents' latest scam. Now she’s much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for – Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. Ellie’s counting on Camden still being in love with her but what she’s not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers Ellie’s plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesn’t dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and it’s one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***The Artists Trilogy is a dark and sexy contemporary ride about three flawed individuals caught in a world where it's so easy to justify the bad things we do. This is a pure adult read (Not YA or NA).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 1st book in the trilogy. It is followed by the novella On Every Street (released in March 2013) and the sequel Shooting Scars (released in May 2013). The third and final book in the series will also be released October 15, 2013.***</description>

  <description>Alice Love is twenty-nine, crazy about her husband, and pregnant with her first child. &lt;br&gt;So imagine Alice’s surprise when she comes to on the floor of a gym (a gym! She HATES the gym) and is whisked off to the hospital where she discovers the honeymoon is truly over — she’s getting divorced, , she has three kids, and she’s actually 39 years old. Alice must reconstruct the events of a lost decade, and find out whether it’s possible to reconstruct her life at the same time. She has to figure out why her sister hardly talks to her, and how is it that she’s become one of those super skinny moms with really expensive clothes. Ultimately, Alice must discover whether forgetting is a blessing or a curse, and whether it’s possible to start over.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;She doesn’t want to deal with the past...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, Ashley Fitzgerald witnessed the death of her parents in a tragic fire and blocked the memory.  She pretends to have moved on, is a successful artist and photographer, until the morning she opens her door to a stranger she assumes is a model and asks him to strip to his briefs .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;He wants to expose the truth....&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wealthy businessman Ron Noble has the body, the jet, the fast cars and the women, but he hides a deadly secret.  His father started the fire that killed Ashley’s parents.  Now someone is leaving him clues that could exonerate his father and they lead to Ashley’s door.  Blindsided by the blazing attraction between them and a merciless killer silencing anyone who was there the night of the fire, Ron dare not tell Ashley the truth.  Yet the answer he seeks may very well tear them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;While a demented arsonist...SLOW BURN(s)...and plots his ultimate revenge.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>A baby brought them together -- and even though Alli has always loved her strong, sexy husband Sam and the life they've made together, she's now decided to set him free to follow his youthful dreams. For although she worships Sam, it's no longer enough for her to be wife and lover when she knows she holds so little of his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam has always dreamed of a life away from the close-knit world of Tucker's Landing, but marriage and fatherhood ended all that. Now Sam is torn between what was and what was meant to be. He must decide if it's time to rekindle the dreams of the past...or accept Alli, and her love, just the way she is.</description>

  <description>James and Bianca’s tumultuous story continues in the sequel to In Flight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James has initiated Bianca into a dark and drugging world of passion and pain. He taught her about her own submissive, masochistic nature, and she fell swiftly and deeply in love with the undeniably charming and impossibly beautiful Mr. Cavendish, but a painful misunderstanding and the return of the brutally violent demon of her past have combined to overwhelm Bianca, and, confused and hurt, she pushes him away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been over a month since the shocking attack that hospitalized her, and since she told a distraught James that she needed space, but her feelings haven’t gone away. Even she knew that it was only a matter of time before he would cast his spell on her again…</description>

  <description>Lucas had it all – popularity, a devoted girlfriend, a brotherly best friend, and a loving mother who would do anything for him. His life was right on course to be a successful and fulfilling one, until the crash changed everything. It happened late one night during a sudden downpour. That evening, three young lives were lost and one life was left irrevocably altered. As the lone survivor, Lucas finds himself surrounded by swirling gossip of reckless drunkenness from the small town he used to warmly call home. Amid his own guilt and self-hatred, Lucas struggles to find hope, find peace, and maybe, even find love again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SKoW Award winner 2010 - Best Het, Most Memorable</description>

  <description>What if love can’t heal all wounds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second Chances, Book 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After too many years of secretly loving her best friend, Zoey realizes she’s been shortchanging herself. It’s time to take action. This New Year’s Eve heralds the year she’s going to tell Rob the truth. Even if he is on the road, reaching for musical stardom with his band.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her plan is derailed when she discovers a lump in her breast—and it’s not “nothing to worry about”. How can she ask Rob to take a chance on love when her future is so uncertain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob has spent his entire life chasing his dream, but the moment he hears Zoey’s voice on the phone, he realizes he’s been running the wrong race. Zoey never sounds like she’s been crying. Ever. Without a second thought, he books a flight for home, determined to give her everything she needs. A shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold…and nights of intensely emotional, passionate sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His biggest challenge, though, is convincing his best friend that he’s in it for the long haul. Because he finally knows what he wants, and it’s not fame and fortune. It’s her—and her love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Product Warnings&lt;br&gt;This book runs the emotional gamut between scorching-hot passion and the pain and fear associated with cancer. Keep a box of tissues next to your glass of ice water.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“When the devil tells you to stop struggling, do you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment Eden wakes up, she knows she’s not in Kansas anymore. She isn’t even on Mitch’s doorstep, her dark-side’s favorite place to dump her. No, she’s somewhere far worse. And far more sterile. Sometimes a girl needs to adapt, be flexible, change. And that’s exactly what Eden will do, all the way back to Mitch. No matter what she has to do to get there. Because &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; life depends on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch has lost something he’d never thought he’d find to begin with. And “It’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all” is a lie. A lie people tell themselves to make the pain go away. But the pain doesn’t go away, not in someone like Mitch. It festers. It grows. Until it can’t be held back anymore, even by the bars of a cage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** &lt;em&gt;Jekyll&lt;/em&gt; is a continuation of Mitch and Eden’s story and may prove confusing to those who haven’t read Book I. So why not go check it out? Heck, the first book is cheaper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** This novel is also intended for adults, as it includes lots of cursing, biting sarcasm, and some truly evil people</description>

  <description>This novel is intended for adults only. It includes lots of cursing, descriptive sex, biting sarcasm, and dark themes. HYDE was inspired by Stevenson's novella but is not a retelling, in part because he and this author have very different definitions of 'bad boy'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honesty is impossible when you don't know the truth to begin with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitchell Turner is everything women want most in a man--he's charismatic, successful, and undeniably gorgeous. But he's not a man--he's a monster. By venting his rage 24/7, Mitch keeps people out of the danger zone that surrounds him. But, after the most incredible night of his life, he realizes that might not be possible. Except the woman he wakes up with claims she doesn't remember any of it. And that kind of thing can make a guy insecure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eden Colfax is kind, loyal, honest to a fault, and cavity-inducing sweet. To rid herself of the monsters that haunted her broken childhood, Eden doesn't lie, doesn't curse, and definitely never wakes up naked in strangers' beds...until the day she does. Then the flashbacks start--places she's never been, people she's never met, blood she's never spilled. And the only person with any answers is a man she never wants to see again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they don't know is that someone is manipulating them, determined to find out exactly what they're capable of. And when the truth leaves them nothing to hold onto, they will be forced into a partnership neither expected. Or wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in life, who you trust is as important as who you are. And when you can't even trust yourself, sometimes the only person you can rely on is the last person on earth you should be falling for.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Opposites in every way . . . except the one that matters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaw Landon loved Rule Archer from the moment she laid eyes on him. Rule is everything a straight--A pre-med student like Shaw shouldn’t want--and the only person she’s never tried to please. She isn’t afraid of his scary piercings and tattoos or his wild attitude. Though she knows that Rule is wrong for her, her heart just won’t listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a rebel like Rule Archer, Shaw Landon is a stuck-up, perfect princess-and his dead twin brother’s girl. She lives by other people’s rules; he makes his own. He doesn’t have time for a good girl like Shaw-even if she’s the only one who can see the person he truly is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a short skirt, too many birthday cocktails, and spilled secrets lead to a night neither can forget. Now, Shaw and Rule have to figure out how a girl like her and a guy like him are supposed to be together without destroying their love . . . or each other.</description>

  <description>I've spent most of my life trying to make it to a future that still hasn't happened, or avoid a past that won't let me go. I don't remember when I've ever just stopped to live in the present, to hold on to the seconds I'm in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's so much more to life than breathing.</description>

  <description>Sam wakes up in the hospital expecting to find his girlfriend by his bedside. Instead, he finds a bleached-blond diva, claiming to be his fiancée, hovering over him. When he learns that he's just woken up from a coma and has lost the last three years of his life, any semblance of stability he thought he had falls down around him. All he wants – all he needs – is Lil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	After countless visits with her shrink and too many sleepless nights waiting for the one man she loves to walk back through the door, Lil wants nothing more than to separate herself from the life she used to have. But the moment Sam smiles at her, Lil knows it's going to take more than self-restraint to stay away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second-Rate Chances is about a young man fighting to regain his memory, and the one thing in his life that felt real. A modern-day Samson and Delilah, it's a look at what it means to love and be loved, and to fight though it seems hopeless.</description>

He tried putting his life back together, but found civilian life difficult after all he’d experienced in Nam. Raising his young daughter, Vanessa, by himself after his wife left, he found it difficult to commit to one job or one woman for any length of time. Then he met a young woman who made him feel good about himself again and who fell in love with Vanessa as well. But one day his life changed drastically and he left without a word to the girl, believing he was doing what was best for her. Now, years later, she has walked back into his life and he believes they may have a second chance at love–except she hates him and he doesn’t understand why. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danielle Westerly fell in love when she was only eighteen and her heart was broken when he left her without a word. Her heartache was increased when she made a fateful decision that would alter her future, and she blamed him for her loss. Years later, she is single and has built up a successful career when she accidently runs into the man who was responsible for her past pain. Yet, their chemistry is undeniable. Can Dani give up her anger and let go of the pain of the past and fall in love again with the man she has hated all these years?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dani and Michael share a journey of heartache, loss and painful memories that threaten to keep them apart. Can they get past these and finally find love again?</description>

  <description>He was tall, at least six feet, with dirty blond hair that hung over his eyes. His T-shirt read &lt;strong&gt;Nietzsche Is My Homeboy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, that was Matt.  Who Julie Seagle likes. A lot.  But there is also Finn.  Who she flat out loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicated? Awkward?  Completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But really, how was this freshly-minted Boston transplant and newbie college freshman supposed to know that she would end up living with the family of an old friend of her mother's? This was all supposed to be temporary.  Julie wasn't supposed to be important to the Watkins family, or to fall in love with one of the brothers.  Especially the one she's never quite met. But what does that really matter?  Finn &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt; her, like no one ever has before. They have &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here's the thing about love, in all its twisty, bumpy permutations—it always throws you a few curves.  And no one ever escapes unscathed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best-selling author Jessica Park mines the territory of love’s growing pains with wit, sharp insights, and a discernible heat and heartbeat. Her previous novels include Relatively Famous and she authored the e-shorts &lt;em&gt;What the Kid Says&lt;/em&gt; (Parts 1 and 2) and &lt;em&gt;Facebooking Rick Springfield&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you.  A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck.  I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of rage and without a purpose, former pianist Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone discovering her past and to make the boy who took everything from her pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All 17 year-old Josh Bennett wants is to build furniture and be left alone, and everyone allows it because it’s easier to pretend he doesn’t exist.  When your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone except Nastya, a hot mess of a girl who starts showing up and won’t go away until she’s insinuated herself into every aspect of his life.  The more he gets to know her, the more of a mystery she becomes.  As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he may ever learn the secrets she’s been hiding or if he even wants to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sea of Tranquility is a slow-building, character-driven romance about a lonely boy, an emotionally fragile girl, and the miracle of second chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please Note:  This book contains mature content including profanity, drug/alcohol use, and sexual situations/language.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Jack and Lexi never had a typical relationship. After 2 years without speaking, she receives a phone call that changes everything. He unexpectedly asks her to convince the new girl, Bekah, that he's ready to commit. Jack is calling now after everything they had been through because there is another woman. She can't believe it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow Lexi in this heart wrenching drama as she relives her past relationship, or lack thereof, with Jack, and not just in her own mind, but to his fiance-to-be. Throw in Bekah's hot brother who always seems to be in the right place at the right time, a past with more secrets to unravel than you can even imagine, and you get a recipe for disaster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out what happens to Lexi as she travels to Atlanta to get the closure she so desperately desires from Jack, and how the bumps of life seem to keep getting in the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Words: 152,477 (approximate)*</description>

  <description>"I won't tell anyone, Echo. I promise." Noah tucked a curl behind my ear. It had been so long since someone touched me like he did. Why did it have to be Noah Hutchins? His dark brown eyes shifted to my covered arms. "You didn't do that-did you? It was done to you?" No one ever asked that question. They stared. They whispered. They laughed. But they never asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So wrong for each other...and yet so right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows what happened the night Echo Emerson went from popular girl with jock boyfriend to gossiped-about outsider with "freaky" scars on her arms. Even Echo can't remember the whole truth of that horrible night. All she knows is that she wants everything to go back to normal. But when Noah Hutchins, the smoking-hot, girl-using loner in the black leather jacket, explodes into her life with his tough attitude and surprising understanding, Echo's world shifts in ways she could never have imagined. They should have nothing in common. And with the secrets they both keep, being together is pretty much&lt;em&gt; impossible.&lt;/em&gt;Yet the crazy attraction between them refuses to go away. And Echo has to ask herself just how far they can push the limits and what she'll risk for the one guy who might teach her how to love again.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"No one tried to get involved with me, and I kept to myself.  This was the place where everything was supposed to be safe and easy.  How could Evan Mathews unravel my constant universe in just one day?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the affluent town of Weslyn, Connecticut, where most people worry about what to be seen in and who to be seen with, Emma Thomas would rather not be seen at all. She’s more concerned with feigning perfection while pulling down her sleeves to conceal the bruises - not wanting anyone to know how far from perfect her life truly is. Without expecting it, she finds love. It challenges her to recognize her own worth - but at the risk of revealing the terrible secret she’s desperate to hide. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reason to Breathe is an electrifying page turner from start to finish, a unique tale of life-changing love, unspeakable cruelty, and one girl’s fragile grasp of hope.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Come forth with an open mind, for an unconventional tale of love..&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dublin native Freda Wilson considers herself to be an acquired taste. She has a habit of making offensive jokes and speaking her mind too often. She doesn't have the best track record with first impressions, which is why she gets a surprise when her new neighbour Nicholas takes a shine to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicholas is darkly handsome, funny and magnetic, and Freda feels like her black and white existence is plunged into a rainbow of colour when she's around him. When he walks into a room he lights it up, with his quick wit and charisma. He is a travelling cabaret performer, but Freda doesn't know exactly what that entails until the curtains pull back on his opening night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is gob-smacked and entirely intrigued to see him take to the stage in drag. Later on, Nicholas asks her if she would like to become his show assistant. Excited by the idea, she jumps at the chance. Soon she finds herself immersed in a world of wigs, make-up and high heels, surrounded by pretty men and the temptation of falling for her incredibly beautiful employer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this story of passion and sexual discovery, Nicholas and Freda will contend with jealousy, emotional highs and lows, and the kind of love that only comes around once in a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publication date: 16th December 2012.</description>

  <description>I wasn't always in love with Colton Calloway; I was in love with his younger brother, Kyle, first. Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;To want what you’re not supposed to have…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is only nineteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is his new stepfather’s daughter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits. His famous father’s guilt money, his mother’s desperation to win his love, and his charm are the three reasons he has never been told no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaire Wynn left her small farmhouse in Alabama, after her mother passed away, to move in with her father and his new wife in their sprawling beach house along the Florida gulf coast. She isn’t prepared for the lifestyle change and she knows she’ll never fit into this world. Then there is her sexy stepbrother who her father leaves her with for the summer while he runs off to Paris with his wife. Rush is as spoiled as he is gorgeous. He is also getting under her skin. She knows he is anything but good for her and that he’ll never be faithful to anyone. He is jaded and has secrets Blaire knows she may never uncover but even knowing all of that…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaire just may have fallen too far.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Alternative Cover Edition for ASIN B00BCSTV6S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A relationship in transition. &lt;br&gt;A husband with old insecurities. &lt;br&gt;A wife with new uncertainties.&lt;br&gt;A teenage daughter who crashes into their lives with no warning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The love story that began in &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17795042.Coming_Home" title="Coming Home"&gt;Coming Home&lt;/a&gt; continues!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;or two decades, their friendship survived the roller coaster ride to fame and the tumult of her first marriage to his best friend. Now that they've finally found their way home to each other, songwriters Casey Fiore and Rob MacKenzie are about to face another challenge, one that neither of them could have anticipated: Rob's teenage daughter, Paige.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still haunted by the ghost of Casey's first husband, charismatic rock icon Danny Fiore, they've been tiptoeing around the elephant in the living room. While Rob struggles with long-held insecurities, Casey is gradually blossoming into the woman she was always meant to be. But with change comes uncertainty, and even as she finds herself overwhelmed by the ferocity of her feelings for her new husband, Casey wrestles with divided loyalties and the unexpected changes this marriage has wrought in her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the fifteen-year-old daughter Rob never knew comes to live with them, the quiet life they've carved out for themselves in Casey's rural Maine hometown is turned upside down. Paige MacKenzie is prickly as a porcupine, hurt and angry and resentful toward the father she's convinced deliberately deserted her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Casey and Rob face the challenges of parenting a rebellious teenager while trying to become a family, they unravel secrets and discover truths about themselves and their relationship, truths that, if not dealt with, could threaten the future of their marriage.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternative cover version of ASIN B008KJAIDC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the USA Today bestselling author of FINAL EXIT comes a breathtaking novel about love, friendship, and the fine line between the two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Songwriter Casey Bradley is just eighteen years old on the day that handsome, charismatic singer Danny Fiore blows into her life and sets her heart on fire.  Good girl Casey has never done anything her dad would disapprove of, but the first time she looks into those turbulent blue eyes, the first time she hears that golden voice, she's ready to give up everything -- home, family, fiancé -- to follow Danny wherever his dreams lead them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together with guitar wizard Rob MacKenzie, Casey writes the songs that catapult Danny to a fame beyond their wildest imaginings.  Through the lean years, when there isn't enough to eat, and the fat years, when life comes at them so quickly there's no time to breathe, they're an unstoppable hit-making machine, the holy trinity of rock and roll.  But the road to success is littered with land mines.  Rivers of darkness flow through her troubled marriage, and every time Danny breaks her heart, it's Rob who picks her up, dusts her off, and glues the pieces back together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It isn't until an unimaginable tragedy rocks their solid foundation that Casey is forced to question who she is and what she really wants from life.  As she searches for herself amid the wreckage, she discovers the bittersweet truth that the choices a woman makes at thirty may differ vastly from those she made at eighteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COMING HOME is a poignant story about the seasons of a woman's heart, and the roundabout route we sometimes have to take to get to where we're meant to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't miss the love story that readers have called "epic," "compelling," "captivating," and "beautifully written."</description>

  <description>It's been twelve years since Tru Bennett last saw Jake Wethers, her former best friend and boy she once loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Wethers, sexy, tattooed and deliciously bad lead singer, and brains behind The Mighty Storm, one of the biggest bands in the world, left Tru with a broken heart when he moved from England to America with his family when they were both fourteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent to interview Jake for her music column by the magazine she works for, they are both unprepared for the sparks that fly the instant they reconnect. Only, there’s a complication to their instant feelings for one another—Will, Tru’s boyfriend of two years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Jake makes Tru a job offer she can't refuse—travelling the world with him and his band. But taking the job means leaving Will behind, and being on the road with the band means spending an inordinate amount of time with Jake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Tru strong enough to resist the delectable bad boy who once held her heart so completely, or will she willingly risk it all for one night with the world's most notorious womanizer?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;The worldwide phenomenon continues as Eva and Gideon face the demons of their pasts, and accept the consequences of their obsessive desires…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn’t resist. I saw the dangerous and damaged soul inside–so much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I’d been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession…</description>

  <description>Lou Clark knows lots of things. She knows how many footsteps there are between the bus stop and home. She knows she likes working in The Buttered Bun tea shop and she knows she might not love her boyfriend Patrick.&lt;br&gt;What Lou doesn't know is she's about to lose her job or that knowing what's coming is what keeps her sane.&lt;br&gt;Will Traynor knows his motorcycle accident took away his desire to live. He knows everything feels very small and rather joyless now and he knows exactly how he's going to put a stop to that.&lt;br&gt;What Will doesn't know is that Lou is about to burst into his world in a riot of colour. And neither of them knows they're going to change the other for all time.</description>

  <description>This is the second book in the November Blue series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;November Harris is lost. After a failed romance with musician Bo Cavanaugh, Ember is left struggling to regain her true self. The problem is, Bo won’t go away and Ember's stance is firm—she doesn't want him back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrian Turner, Ember's ex-boyfriend-turned confidant, is patient with her heartbreak, but he can't hold back his own feelings forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she sorts through her past, in an effort to plan a solid future, Ember will find that sometimes even the best laid plans bow to the soul's desire for reckless abandon.</description>

  <description>Jesika Reynolds’ heart was left broken one year ago when her husband died, leaving her and her son alone in this world. Slowly, she started putting the pieces back together of her life. Knowing that she may never open herself up to love again. That was until the day Derek came into the picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does this gorgeous stranger seem to care so much, so suddenly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derek Jordan's charm drew her in with an instant connection, and familiarity that helps her feel at ease. Her heart is falling at his feet, but as their relationship grows, so does a secret from both of their pasts that neither saw coming. One by one, the threads slowly start to unravel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can their newly sought love stand up against the secrets that life is unlocking to their pasts? Or can they decide together that moving forward and forgetting the past is the only option for them to find true happiness?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Intended for Mature Audiences**</description>

  <description>Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother’s house one afternoon doesn’t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she’s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse—she doesn’t know his real name or where he lives, she’s ninety percent certain he’s a criminal and that the “business” he talks with her brother isn’t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he’d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she’s not interested in becoming “property of”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Romantica® contemporary erotic romance from Ellora’s Cave</description>

  <description>A fallen boxer.&lt;br&gt;A woman with a broken dream.&lt;br&gt;A competition…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He even makes me forget my name. One night was all it took, and I forgot everything and anything except the sexy fighter in the ring who sets my mind ablaze and my body on fire with wanting…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remington Tate is the strongest, most confusing man I’ve ever met in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s the star of the dangerous underground fighting circuit, and I’m drawn to him as I’ve never been drawn to anything in my life. I forget who I am, what I want, with just one look from him. When he’s near, I need to remind myself that I am strong–but he is stronger. And now it’s my job to keep his body working like a perfect machine, his taut muscles primed and ready to break the bones of his next opponents . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the one he’s most threatening to, now, is me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want him. I want him without fear. Without reservations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only I knew for sure what it is that he wants from me?</description>

  <description>As their careers catch fire, Grace and Jack -- everyone’s favorite foul-mouthed, funny, and feisty couple -- find themselves on opposite coasts. Grace has landed in New York City, where she loves being onstage again, particularly because she’s playing a fabulous character in a musical written by her old college flame, Michael. Their rekindled friendship makes exploring the city that much more fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait, it’s just friendship, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, in L.A., Jack can scarcely keep up with the swirling throngs of women who track him everywhere he goes, the endless press appearances, and the ridiculous rules his manager, Holly, keeps concocting for him -- all part of the buildup to the release of Time, his steamy new film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank goodness for phone sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even when their schedules allow them to connect, Grace and Jack must keep their relationship off the radar and away from paparazzi cameras. Sure, the sex is sensational, but can this duo survive swirling rumors, the demands of their chosen professions, Grace’s raging internal battles, and a whopping nine-year age difference? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tick-tock, the clock is ticking. Isn’t it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice Clayton brings the second installment of a tale told with her magical mix of humor and heat, so cuddle up under the sheets and flip on the Golden Girls. Grace and Jack are at it again.</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Camryn Bennett had always been one to think out-of-the-box, who knew she wanted something more in life than following the same repetitive patterns and growing old with the same repetitive life story. And she thought that her life was going in the right direction until everything fell apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined not to dwell on the negative and push forward, Camryn is set to move in with her best friend and plans to start a new job. But after an unexpected night at the hottest club in downtown North Carolina, she makes the ultimate decision to leave the only life she’s ever known, far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a purse, a cell phone and a small bag with a few necessities, Camryn, with absolutely no direction or purpose boards a Greyhound bus alone and sets out to find herself. What she finds is a guy named Andrew Parrish, someone not so very different from her and who harbors his own dark secrets. But Camryn swore never to let down her walls again. And she vowed never to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with Andrew, Camryn finds herself doing a lot of things she never thought she’d do. He shows her what it’s really like to live out-of-the-box and to give in to her deepest, darkest desires. On their sporadic road-trip he becomes the center of her exciting and daring new life, pulling love and lust and emotion out of her in ways she never imagined possible. But will Andrew’s dark secret push them inseparably together, or tear them completely apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Due to sexual content and language, this book is recommended for 17+ – Adult Contemporary Women’s – New Adult Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>After making a bad decision when she was very young, Kia Clementine finds herself in hell. Then, suddenly, within the time it takes for a shotgun to blast, her hell changes. Completely. Then out-of-the-blue she sees Sampson Cooper, her celebrity crush. A man the whole world knows is decent. A man the world knows is loyal. A man the world knows is good. All of these very unlike her now dead husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s sitting at a table right next to hers. And she catches his eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terrified of the interest Sam shows in her, Kia finds the courage to go out with him. Not long after, she shares her dark secrets and Sam shares that he’ll stop at nothing to gain her trust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sam leads Kia to heaven, Kia realizes that Sam is living his own hell. But although he gives her beauty and she gives him everything, he withholds his trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with all the beauty Sam shows her, Kia wants it all. But Sam forces Kia to make a heartbreaking decision and only she can decide. It’s all or nothing.</description>

  <description>Eighteen year old Jay Stevenson is living a horrible nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years ago, she had the world in the palm of her hand, but in one moment, it was ruined. Secrets, lies, and the worst imaginable betrayal haunt her new reality. Burying her problems under a cold façade seems to be the only way to cope until it all catches up with her.  Soon, she loses control of the lonely world she built around her, and the past, present, and future collide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three guys are there when it all comes crashing down: JT, the perfect boyfriend she never wanted to give up; Rhye, the local bad boy “rock star” who made her forget the past; and Kane, the funny and sweet tattooed bartender who wants her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secrets must be kept. Choices must be made. Is it possible to move forward while still chained to the wicked vices of the past?</description>

  <description>"One of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read." ~Jelena's Book Blog&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia Lang expected a nice night away from the office–free of thoughts about the case, her failed engagement, her past. But she should have known better. Her past haunted her every chance it got these days, and tonight it came in the form of lyrics she never expected to hear again–not after a decade, not in the arms of another man and definitely not in the form of a confession. Now, Julia must discover for herself if the song–and more importantly, the man behind it–is enough to leave her new life for her small-town, Missouri roots and a second chance at love.</description>

  <description>Olivia Kaspen has just discovered that her ex-boyfriend, Caleb Drake, has lost his memory. With an already lousy reputation for taking advantage of situations, Olivia must decide how far she is willing to go to get Caleb back. Wrestling to keep her true identity and their sordid past under wraps, Olivia’s greatest obstacle is Caleb’s wicked, new girlfriend; Leah Smith. It is a race to the finish as these two vipers engage in a vicious tug of war to possess a man who no longer remembers them. But, soon enough Olivia must face the consequences of her lies, and in the process discover that sometimes love falls short of redemption.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; You must stick to your CONVICTION, but be ready to abandon your assumptions - &lt;/em&gt; Denis Waitley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book #3 of the Consequences Series—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were still lessons to learn and consequences for the truth!&lt;br&gt;When Claire Nichols met Anthony Rawlings, she didn’t know they had a past, or that he had plans for her future. Over time, the role of teacher changed—games became reality—and domination turned to desire. Despite an insurmountable history, Claire and Tony found their way back to one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when they seemed to have it all—love, respect, and the promise of a family—the game master exposed the truth. Claire’s world once again spun out of control. Unwilling to allow her child to suffer the consequences of an old vendetta, Claire fled...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one time, Claire was held captive in an opulent mansion—then her incarceration was a cell inside a state penitentiary. Was her new prison—a tropical island—truly less lonely? Perhaps that was the game master’s plan, all along? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who will save Claire from her oldest nightmare and her newest reality? Will it be Tony? Can he forgive her for leaving him—again? Harry? Will he utilize previously unknown connections to save the woman who infiltrates his thoughts? Maybe Phil? Will his devotion in keeping Claire and her child safe be rewarded? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the cards are played—sins of the past, innocent victims, and truths are revealed. With compartmentalization no longer an option, is the reality too much? Could there be an even worse isolation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the game master dealing from a stacked deck, can this new high-stakes game possibly be won?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it’s all over and their cards are on the table—SOME will discover their bets were too high—they have nothing left to lose—ALL will learn the crucial lesson—the most important rule—there are CONSEQUENCES for the TRUTH! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aleatha Romig’s CONVICTED!&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book #2 of the Consequences Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Nichols endured the CONSEQUENCES of Anthony Rawlings’ vendetta.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she first arrived to his home, her goal was survival.  Through strength and compartmentalization Claire captivated her captor.  Her resilience in the face of his rule threatened Anthony’s well developed plan. He thought he taught her to behave-but domination became desire and Claire taught Tony to love.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their passion and adoration in a world of opulence appeared perfect, yet the reality was a roller coaster of emotion.  Claire’s world teetered on the edge of sanity as Antony monitored her every move. When given the opportunity to flee, Claire drove away—a fateful decision which began a well laid plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unbeknownst to either of them, there were others who saw past the perfect facade of Anthony Rawlings. There were others who saw the TRUTH. Conspiracy and unfulfilled promises result in an early prison release for Claire. Not just a release—a pardon. According to the law, her crime never happened! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will it be that easy? Faced with freedom from her past—can Claire seize it? Can she build a new life, mend her broken spirit, become the woman she once was, and seek her own revenge? Or is it all a game? And does the game master have different plans?&lt;br&gt;How does Sophia Burke fit into the puzzle that is Tony and Claire? Will her presence affect the future of this well esteemed man? Can he dominate twice? Is that his goal? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRUTH continues the tumultuous saga of CONSEQUENCES,introduces new players, and uncovers more intrigue. Aleatha Romig skillfully weaves past transgressions through current deception to create a fervent world of obsessed desire. In this reality can an all-consuming relationship survive? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When buried sins are discovered they threaten not only Tony and Claire’s future—but their very lives!  Will the TRUTH be revealed in time?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book #1 of the Bestselling Consequences Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony Rawlings had a plan—to teach Claire Nichols to behave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Nichols had a plan—to survive!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an unfamiliar bedroom within a luxurious mansion, Claire Nichols wakes to memories of a brutal abduction. All of her recollections have one common denominator, the man she just met—Anthony Rawlings. Unbeknownst to Claire, Anthony has had her in his sights for a long time. Every action has consequences—and his actions resulted in their chance meeting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing incomprehensible circumstances, Claire must learn to survive as she comes to terms with her new reality—every aspect of her livelihood is now dependent upon the tall, dark-haired, dark-eyed tycoon. Anthony may appear to the world as a prosperous, benevolent, kind businessman, but in reality Claire learns he is also a menacing, controlling captor with very strict rules: do as your told, public failure is not an option, and don’t divulge private information. Failure to follow these rules and more, are met with serious consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an effort to earn her freedom, Claire learns her lessons well and before long, she unknowingly captivates her captor. Anthony/ Tony reluctantly becomes enthralled with Claire’s beauty, resilience and determination. Their interaction instigates strong emotions, including—fear, anger, love, and lust—as their journey flows into uncharted waters of intrigue and passion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the opening criminal abduction, through the twists and turns, to the unlikely romantic thrills, the suspense climaxes as Aleatha Romig utilizes vivid detail, allowing this novel to unfold like a movie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you put the pieces of the puzzle together? Claire Nichols abduction wasn’t a random act—did she learn her lessons well enough? Will these unlikely lovers remain true--or will she learn the truth before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>The first night after Caroline moves into her fantastic new San Francisco apartment, she realizes she's gaining an intimate knowledge of her new neighbor's nocturnal adventures. Thanks to paper-thin walls and the guy's athletic prowess, she can hear not just his bed banging against the wall but the ecstatic response of what seems (as loud night after loud night goes by) like an endless parade of women. And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed. Suddenly, Caroline is finding she may have discovered a whole new definition of neighborly...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a delicious mix of silly and steamy, Alice Clayton dishes out a hot and hilarious tale of exasperation at first sight...</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a "typical love story". This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. It’s intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesn’t happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and develops—with hurt, sacrifice, and heartache—over the span of a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When she’s a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the club—but that’s where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himself—a man worthy of love—and Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he can’t live without.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Eva and Deuce’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t easy. &lt;br&gt;Nothing worth doing ever is.&lt;br&gt;And love is worth everything.</description>

  <description>Drew and Jenny have spent years being the envy of their friends with their out of control sex lives - well, not really.  Mostly it makes their friends want to throw up in their mouths a little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With two little kids and two busy lives, for the first time, Drew and Jenny aren't on the same page in the bedroom.  Drew will stop at nothing to get his previously amorous wife back in the sack, and Jenny will do anything for a full night of sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carter and Claire, and Jim and Liz are their usual (un)helpful selves and are full of advice for the discontented duo, wanting nothing more than to help restore order to the usually happy couple's lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the third and final installment of the Chocolate Lovers Series, will Drew and Jenny find the spark that's been missing in their marriage, or will the trouble they're having cause a stickier situation than the time Jenny poured honey all over Drew and he fused himself to a tree?</description>

  <description>With her thirtieth birthday looming, Emma Harrison finds her biological clock clanging and the elusive knight in shining armor yet to appear. She’s running out of options, especially after her gay best friend backs out from being her sperm donor. Of course, there’s always a sperm bank, but Emma fears a donor mix-up might impregnate her with the spawn of Satan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resident company womanizer, Aidan Fitzgerald, is used to always getting what he wants, especially in the bedroom. When Emma spurns his advances at the company Christmas party, he's determined to have her no matter what it takes. After Aidan learns of Emma's predicament, he is quick to offer a proposition that will benefit them both. He will father Emma's child, but she must conceive it with him naturally. Not one for hook-ups or casual sex, Emma is reluctant to take him up on his offer, but his charm, coupled with her intense desire for motherhood, wins out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon their baby-making sessions become more than just physical. Aidan can't seem to walk away from her while Emma begins to wonder if Aidan could be the one. But can Aidan leave his past behind to become the man Emma needs him to be?</description>

  <description>Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he's asleep) toddler a better life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Carter's undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire's panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.</description>

  <description>Douglas Ashton is the cold and unfeeling owner of the gothic Victorian Mansion, Sommersgate House. Julia Fairfax is his stubborn American sister-in-law. After tragedy strikes, Douglas and Julia are forced to live together at Sommersgate and raise their newly orphaned nieces and nephew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Douglas has no desire to raise his dead sister’s children nor does he want the distraction of the tempting Julia living under his roof. Julia is struggling with grief and trying to make a go in a new country without much help from impossibly handsome but even more impossibly remote Douglas. Not to mention, she has to deal with the active hostility of Douglas’s frosty, Attila-the-Hun-in-a-skirt mother, Monique.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Douglas decides the best way to give the children what they need, get his mother to behave and give himself what he wants is to marry Julia. When he tells her (yes, tells her) she will be his wife, Julia thinks Douglas is (probably) insane. And anyway, she’s decided if she ever has another husband (since the last one wasn’t so great), he was going to be short, balding, have a paunch and worship the ground she walks on (none of these characteristics define Douglas in the slightest).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One more thing, Sommersgate House is haunted by the ghosts of the man who built the house and the woman who was the love of his life. They both died mysteriously at Sommersgate months after it was finished. When they did, a curse settled on the house making it seem strangely alive. And the only way for the beautiful but frightening house to rid itself of this curse is for its owner to find true love.</description>

  <description>When the local police department's secrets are revealed and the wife he's forced to marry is murdered, Chace finds himself the town of Carnal's hero. Knowing how deep in the mud he was forced to sink, Chace feels he'll never get clean. The quiet, content future he envisioned of the love a good woman with whom he could build a family was now beyond his reach. The only thing he can do is find his wife's murderer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he isn't the only one looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While searching for new leads, he runs into Faye Goodknight, the town's quiet, shy, pretty librarian. Chace has long since had his eye on what could possibly be the town's last remaining virgin but he has also long since given up hope he could make her his. Faye is pure and clean and Chace refuses to dirty her with his sordid past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pure and clean Faye may be, but when the shy librarian is forced to go head to head with the man who she's had a crush on since he hit her hometown, Chace finds Faye is full of surprises. And he doesn't know what to do with her.</description>

  <description>No connections. Play it safe. These were the rules Ivey lived her life by.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she hit Mustang, Colorado, a perfectly imperfect town where the citizens were welcoming and one of them included the tall, beautiful, macho man rancher cowboy, Grayson Cody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the run for a decade, Ivey knew she was supposed to play it safe. But she was tired of being on the run. She wanted a normal. She wanted real. She wanted a home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she wanted Grayson Cody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Grayson Cody wanted Ivey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one who looked at them couldn’t see they belonged together. There was one man in this world for Ivey and one woman in this world for Grayson Cody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So they fell in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just as quickly as they fell together, they were betrayed and torn apart. Separated for years, Ivey was certain her life would not include her rancher cowboy. Until the town of Mustang reached out to her when Gray was in trouble. Even though she thought he broke her heart, she charged in to help. Then Gray and Ivey discovered they were betrayed and, not only that, Gray had an enemy who would stop at nothing to defeat him.</description>

  <description>When Luke Quintain's fiancee dumped him, Catherine Lang understood immediately that she was the perfect solution to his problem. Leggy, flame haired and wise beyond her years, she decided that he should marry her instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even though Luke needed a wife by his thirty-sixth birthday or he would lose his inheritance, he had to say "No!" Well, that was what he tried to say, but somehow Cat left with a ring on her finger and a wedding date on her calendar. And Luke could only curse his grandfather's positively medieval blackmailing scheme...and count the seconds till the wedding night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cat, of course, knows her own mind -- and her own heart -- and she wants Luke. Meanwhile, Luke is wondering how long this will play out, and hoping that it might be a little longer with each passing day. The problem is, he's quite capable of doing something very stupid -- like falling for Cat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because sometimes love just doesn't take no for an answer.</description>

  <description>There are some mistakes we make that we will regret for the rest of our lives.  For Christian, it was the day he betrayed Elizabeth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian Davison has a plan for his life.  He is determined to become an attorney and to one day take his place as partner in his father’s law firm.  Nothing will stand in his way, not even Elizabeth Ayers and their unborn child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Christian cuts her from his life, Elizabeth spends the next five years struggling to provide for her daughter and willing to sacrifice anything to give her child a safe, comfortable life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five years, Christian has regretted the day he walked away from his family and will do anything to win them back just as Elizabeth will do anything to protect her daughter from the certain heartache she believes Christian will bring upon them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Christian wrestles his way into their lives, Elizabeth is faced with asking herself if it is possible to forgive someone when they’ve committed the unforgivable and if it is possible to find a love after it has been buried in years of hate.  Or are there some wounds that go so deep they can never heal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say everyone deserves a second chance.</description>

  <description>When Lily Jacobs was born, she inherited Fazire – a genie. Her family had three wishes and they’d only ever used one so Fazire was stuck in the human world. This worked since he’d become a member of the family anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with a genie, Lily's young life wasn’t perfect. To escape the kids making her miserable at school, Lily buried herself in romance novels. One day, when the teasing was just too much, she used one of her wishes. She told Fazire she wanted to find a man like in her books and she made the most complicated wish Fazire had ever heard. Her wished-for man had to be impossibly handsome, virile, fierce, rugged and ruthless (amongst a dozen other things).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also had to think she was beautiful and he had to love her more than anything in the world.&lt;br&gt;Nathaniel McAllister wasn’t born to a life where there were such things as genies granting wishes. His life was filled with drugs, crime and neglect. He was running errands for a gangster before he was in his teens and, even though life and hard work led him to wealth and respectability, he always knew, deep down, he was dirty. When Nate met Lily he knew he was no good for her but as virile, fierce, rugged and ruthless as he was, Nate was no match for the pull of sweet, innocent Lily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Lily’s wish included that she and her hero go through trials and tribulations to test their love. And Fazire wasn’t only a good genie, he loved Lily – so he gave her exactly what she wanted.</description>

  <description>All his life Tate McCullom has been taught to be responsible, and he is the very model of what a respectable man should be. Until the night he gets drunk and sleeps with a woman he barely knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, six weeks later, she's pregnant, alone, and broke. Once again, Tate must take responsibility for his actions, and makes plans to marry his child's mother. There's only one problem...he has to tell his fiancée.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Grayson hasn't had an easy life. As the daughter of the town whore, people either avoid her or think she's like her mother. For Abby, it's a struggle just to fill her belly and keep a roof over her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loneliness and a secret yearning for this man she thought she'd never have led her to spend the night with Tate. But the last thing she needs is a baby when she can barely take care of herself. Desperate, but too proud to ask for help, she finally agrees to accept a job from Tate - the job of being his wife. Now she has almost everything she's ever dreamed of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, only one thing will gain her Tate's love - his realization that the night he spent with her was no drunken accident. It was a last-ditch attempt to win the woman he really wanted.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The sensational second novel in Joan Johnston’s new Western historical romance series set in the world of Bitter Creek.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; CAN SECRETS AND SECOND CHOICES EVER LEAD TO LOVE?&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;After three months in a mail-order marriage, Hannah Wentworth McMurtry is a widow—pregnant, alone, and near death in the Wyoming wilderness. Though she is saved by a man with a face cut from stone, she still grieves the husband who died on their journey west. Hannah needs a husband, but does she dare marry another stranger?&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Flint Creed has also lost someone he loved—when the woman he hoped to marry chose his younger brother instead. Now he must find a ranch wife of his own. But every female in the remote Wyoming Territory is too old, too young, or already married . . . until he discovers Hannah on the prairie. Flint doesn’t pretend to love her, but he doesn’t tell her he loves another woman, either. Hannah doesn’t pretend to love him, but she doesn’t tell him about the child she carries. Though danger surrounds them on the Wyoming frontier, the greatest threats of all are the secrets within—revelations that could destroy the new life Hannah and Flint have begun to cherish.</description>

  <description>THE CON MAN&lt;br&gt;Reuben Jones walks on the wrong side of the law -- a card shark, a master of deception, a man who long ago buried the truth of his life so deep that no one would ever find it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE LADY&lt;br&gt;Grace Russell has had to learn a few tricks herself in order to hold on to the crumbling California vineyard that is the only thing in the world she can call her own...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CROOKED HEARTS&lt;br&gt;When Grace meets Reuben she's dressed as a pious Catholic nun; he's posing as a blind Spanish aristocrat. But he gets an eyeful when the pretty sister lifts her skirts to adjust the little silver derringer strapped to her thigh ... So begins this sexy, rollicking ride through the gambling halls and sinful streets of 1880s San Francisco, where two "crooked hearts" discover that love is the most dangerous -- and delicious -- game of all.</description>

She is struck down all too soon&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Tess, a new life begins at her death, in post-Civil War America. She is now Amarylis Rafferty, wife and mother of three--and she can hear.

  <description>SEPARATE YESTERDAYS&lt;br&gt;When Brianne Quinlan woke up after the accident, she thought she was losing her mind. Gone were the last things she remembered: her car, the highway, and the tall buildings that lined the road. Instead she found herself in a meadow surrounded by trees and rolling lawns. And when she lifted her head her eyes met the magnetic blue gaze of the most remarkably handsome man she'd ever seen. As he effortlessly lifted her onto his horse, Brianne was unable to even utter a protest...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ONE TOMORROW&lt;br&gt;On a routine ride to survey his plantation, Ryan Barrington could not believe what he saw. Lying beneath a tree was a beautiful woman, dressed in bizarre clothing, her long copper-colored hair surrounding her like a veil. He had never seen such a fetching apparition, and he was sure that she had been sent by a friend to entice him. He thought to send her on her way, but when he lifted her in his arms Ryan knew he was lost. He caressed her creamy flesh and kissed her ripe lips feeling a rush of desire that could not be denied. He vowed to find out her true identity and make her is own with TIMELESS PASSION.</description>

His peace is shattered by the mischievous creature with the wicked dimple and mysterious past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned, cheated of her inheritance, Emily Claire Scarborough has sailed halfway around the world to find the man who promised her father he would take care of her, then abandoned her to an English boarding school. She is determined to make him pay for her years of loneliness--with nothing less than his heart.</description>

  <description>She knew she was heading towards disaster. Every instinct told her to run, but Jesse Ward was a hard man to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been five days’ since Ava O’Shea left Jesse drunk and raging at Lusso – left behind a man who drowned her in his intensity and blindsided her with his touch. Getting over this man was never going to be easy. And now he’s back in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has questions she needs answering, but her determination to get these answers will give the pleasure-seeking playboy the power to destroy her again. She needs to keep her eyes wide open and caution at the forefront of her mind, an ambitious intention when Jesse Ward is within touching distance. And he plans to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s dark, he’s broken – Ava knows this, but the only way to find out how dark and how broken is to get beneath the steely exterior of this man.</description>

  <description>Witch and day-walking demon Rachel Morgan has managed to save the demonic ever after from shrinking, but at a high cost. Now strange magic is attacking Cincinnati and the Hollows, causing spells to backfire or go horribly wrong, and the truce between the races, between Inderlander and human, is shattering. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel must stop the occurrences before the undead vampire masters who keep the rest of the undead under control are lost and it becomes all-out supernatural war. However, the only way to do so is through the ancient elven wild magic, which carries its own perils.</description>

  <description>There's only one thing in life Lucien Knight really hates, and that's husbands who cheat on their wives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's only one problem in Sophie Black's life. Her cheating husband...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment Lucien &amp;amp; Sophie meet, the seal is set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romantic, emotional &amp;amp; intensely erotic, &lt;em&gt;Knight and Play&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect read for lovers of international bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Bared To You&lt;/em&gt;. Let yourself be swept away by Part One of the Knight series from Kitty French, a romance so hot it'll burn your fingers...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CEO of Knight Inc. Lucien Knight is catch-your-breath gorgeous and damaged by his troubled past in Norway. All grown up and relocated to London, he's built his empire of adult clubs from the ground up to become the gorgeous patron saint of the sex industry. No one knows the dark childhood secrets that have given Lucien a backbone of steel and a heart encased in ice.  No one until Sophie Black, that is...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment girl-next-door Sophie accepts the job as Lucien Knight's PA, she understands how Alice must have felt when she tumbled down the rabbit hole. Lucien takes her safe, vanilla life away and plunges her head first into a huge dish of fantasy flavours. Rich, spicy chocolate covered with dark, oozingly lickable sauce? Check. Tutti-frutti with indecently red, glistening cherries on the top? Yes please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucien strips away all of Sophie's inhibitions, and when he instructs her to select three new toys, she soon realises he has more than a game of Monopoly on his mind... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's opened the door to a whole new pleasure packed world without limits, and Sophie is utterly intoxicated. But how far is she willing to go? And what happens when she has to step back into reality again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucien &amp;amp; Sophie's is a story of star crossed love and forbidden passion, a sexual odyssey that spans the globe and changes both of their lives forever. Let it change yours, too.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The sweeping plains held the promise of a lifetime.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linnea&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eager to begin her first teaching position, lovely Linnea Brandonberg stepped off the train looking as grown up and worldly as her eighteen years would allow. The golden fields and fragrant wheat of Alamo, North Dakota, were as new and different as the Westgaard family with whom she would live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teddy&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Farm life in 1917 was hard and bitter—but tiny, spirited Linnea was determined to brave its challenges. And as World War I threatened to take those she held dear, Linnea grew to womanhood in the arms of Teddy Westgaard, a man who thought he'd never find love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story of passion. A story of heartache. A story of a way of life that will long be remembered—with people and places as real as the emotions of the heart.</description>

  <description>THE BEST MAGIC OF ALL IS THE KIND THAT MAKES LOVE COMES TRUE ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alec, Duke of Belmore, did as he pleased --- and he wanted to marry the beautiful, bubbly girl who had positively bewitched him: Joyous MacQuarrie, who had appeared from nowhere and turned stately Belmore Park upside down with merriment and mischief. It hardly mattered that her Scottish bloodline was shrouded in mystery. But Alec's heated desire turned ice-cold when he discovered that this winsome lady was, in fact, a witch --- whose powers of white magic were not always perfectly under control ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too late, Joy knew she was desperately in love and that nothing could stop the course of their destiny --- the scandal threatening to destroy her and the passion that held them both spellbound in a forbidden, irresistible match.</description>

  <description>Arriving on a lush Pacific island, Eulalie Grace LaRue was soon to be reunited with the father she hadn't seen since childhood. Yet before Lollie's dreamed-of meeting could take place, the lovely Southern belle was caught in the crossfire of a violent revolution -- and thrown into the rugged arms of Sam Forester. On the run in the jungle, the battle-scarred soldier of fortune didn't know what to do with the pampered blonde placed in his care. Survival was his top priority, but he could not resist Lollie's seductive charm...or deny the growing attraction between them. Though Sam thrived on chance and risk, falling in love was the one chance he wasn't willing to take.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Powerless against the desire that consumed them both, Lollie surrendered to his passionate embrace. But when he dismissed her affections, she was determined to fight for him...to prove that in the steamy heat of paradise, two hearts would find the love of a lifetime....</description>

  <description>The last thing widow Althea Winsloe wanted to do was remarry. Unfortunately, her meddlesome mountain neighbors had other plans. So, one autumn night they banded together and gave Althea a shocking ultimatum: She was to find herself a husband by Christmas...or the town would do it for her! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Althea knew she had her choice of any single man in Marrying Stone, Arkansas. Yet the only one she felt truly comfortable with was Simple Jess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweet and gentle, Jess wasn't as smart as your average man. But his tender manner stirred Althea's heart in ways she had never dreamed possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would take a miracle to find a husband in Marrying Stone. But sometimes miracles are right under your nose.</description>

  <description>In 1866 on the empty Kansas prairie, two children shared a few desperate moments that changed their lives. For years afterward, each nursed a secret dream—that the other had grown into a special person—brave, good, kind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Norah Hawkins and Caleb Sutton cross paths again, dreams die. She is a bitter, suicidal widow. He is a gunman with little conscience and few scruples. Alternately angry, repelled, and attracted, the two form an uneasy partnership to hold land she owns and he covets against a marauding neighbor. Their bargain never included love, or did it?</description>

  <description>The Bandit and the Gentleman&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both were wounded in the same train robbery in frontier Colorado and left on Abigail McKenzie's doorstep to nurse back to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gentle, loving David, promising her a happiness she'd lost hope of finding, was all a lady could wish for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse stood for everything she hated: he was rude, violent, roughly handsome and disturbingly sensual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was Jesse's mocking mouth that troubled her dreams, Jesse who made her feel a hundred things a lady should never know, Jesse who challenged her every waking hour. She fought him with all the stiff propriety her stubborn will commanded ... but in her burned the aching embers of love too long denied--love that would force her to a choice no woman should ever have to make...</description>

When he disappears with her inheritance after their wedding, Juliette sets out to find the scoundrel. She never expects to meet Clara Klaus, who ran a boardinghouse until Jean Jacques swept her off her feet, then swept himself out of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While following the trail of their no-good husband, Clara and Juliette run into Zoe Wilder, another victim of the debonair Jean Jacques. Now Juliette's ready to put a bullet in his cheating heart. When these three vengeful ladies embark on a misbegotten quest to Alaska, things get downright dangerous--especially for the unsuspecting men they entice along the way. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A CONVENIENT BRIDE&lt;br&gt;Burdened by family debts, Heather Ashford has no choice but to exchange her dreams of romance and accept the proposal of ruggedly handsome cattle baron Sloan McCord. However the widowed rancher is more than she bargains for. Tormented by a deep sorrow, Sloan keeps his heart well guarded, even as he sets her body on fire night after night. But each time Heather gazes into his ice blue eyes, she realizes she wants more from this man than his passion--she wants his love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AN IRRESISTIBLE GROOM&lt;br&gt;But Sloan McCord has vowed never to love again. Although his infant daughter needs a mother, he doesn't want--or need--a wife. He is surprised that Heather, an elegant city-bred lady, turns his remote Colorado ranch house into a home, and tenderly cares for his child. She is beginning to haunt his thoughts by day and steal his breath by night--and this he cannot have if he is to keep a safe distance. Does his fierce bride of convenience have the strength to heal his broken heart--before he breaks hers?</description>

  <description>When news came that there was trouble back in Texas, Holt McKettrick left his mail-order bride at the altar and never looked back. He just hoped he'd be in time to save the man who raised him as a son and stop his best friend from hanging. Setting fire to her wedding dress in the town square probably wasn't the best way to stand her ground, but Lorelei Fellows was through with men and their schemes. All she wanted was to stake her claim on a little piece of Texas. With Holt McKettrick as her new neighbor, things began to look up. He was a straight shooter with a strong will, a steady aim and a hungry heart, and the sparks between them couldn't be denied--if they could just make it through a cattle drive and a range war without killing each other.</description>

  <description>Widow Kate Blakely knew nothing of love - but she knew plenty about unhappiness. She'd married young, hoping to put down roots in a safe haven, but her husband had shattered her naiveté, and made her fear for her beloved daughter's safety until the day he died.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she first met her new neighbor, Zachariah McGovern, all she saw was danger. But Zach saw much more. He saw beauty, he saw tenderness. He knew he could rescue Kate Blakely from her past - if only she would let him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Zach couldn't know, however, was the price that had to be paid to save the woman he loved.</description>

  <description>It’s no easy feat transitioning from the disciplined arena of competitive gymnastics to the artistic whirl of the Cirque du Monde. Kelsey Martin finds secret inspiration in Theo Zamora, a dark, taciturn trapezist–until his partner dies in a tragic accident and he decides to leave the circus for good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theo doesn’t understand why Kelsey reaches out to him, only that she compels him with her unique combination of innocence and recklessness. Before long the two are collaborating on an aerial silks act for a new production, the Cirque de Minuit. Theo’s impatience with Kelsey’s naivete is matched only by his passion for her, and the two soon become embroiled in a tempestuous, consuming romance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But some still blame Theo for his partner’s accident, and danger wraps up the two performers as inevitably as the scarlet silk of their act. Theo and Kelsey must find a way to connect and trust one another as he leads her deeper and deeper into a dangerous world of control and desire.</description>

  <description>Carrie Montgomery had grown up with seven adoring older brothers, and she was used to getting her way rather easily. Joshua Greene was only looking for a hardworking, practical mail-order bride to help with the farm and feed and clothe his children. Yet from the moment Carrie saw his photograph, saw his devastatingly handsome, sorrowful smile, the petite and pampered beauty knew she was the perfect wife for him. Josh didn't see it that way. Wed by proxy, he refused to be charmed by his new bride's blond curls and effervescent laughter, or impressed by her trappings of wealth...even if his son and daughter believed she was a fairy princess come to life. He was furious -- and ready to send her packing, until a near tragedy convinced him that her beauty was more than skin-deep. But even after he had yielded to the wild desire that surged between them, Josh could not admit how much he truly needed her. Then an old scandal threatened to re-emerge, and he realized that he could lose her forever....</description>

  <description>The year is 1889, and Rachel Hollister hasn't set foot outside her house in five years. Ever since a savage attack left her family dead, she's cordoned herself off from the outside world, afraid to let anyone into her home --- or into her heart. But now trouble has appeared on her doorstep --- and suddenly she has no choice but to let a handsome rancher invade her well-guarded existence ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confirmed bachelor Joseph Paxton grudgingly offers to take up temporary residence at the Hollister ranch --- even though it's obvious Rachel doesn't want his protection. But once he catches a glimpse of his beautiful young ward and her remarkable spirit, he'll do anything to break through the dark spell that's walled off her heart. It may take a miracle, but he's determined to make her see the refuge he's offering in his embrace --- and the splendor that exists beyond her front door. Otherwise he'll just have to build a safe haven big enough for the both of them ...</description>

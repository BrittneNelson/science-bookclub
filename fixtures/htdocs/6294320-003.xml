  <description>High school senior Liv Evans has one rule: No attachments.  She’s lost enough in her life and has vowed to do whatever it takes to make sure she never again feels the emptiness of losing someone she loves.  Boys are a fun distraction, but a serious relationship is something she’d rather live without.  Her determination for a future free of pain and heartbreak is put to the test when she meets–and quickly forms an unexpected bond–with Logan Tanner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan has always been a free spirit, but ever since a life-changing event took place, which left him doubting the integrity of those who are closest to him, he’s taken that term to a whole new dangerous level.  Learning the hard way that life is too short for worries or work–and that women can’t be trusted–Logan has exchanged steady work for street racing.  When Liv walks into his world, everything he thought he knew about life and women is challenged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In The Fine Line, Liv and Logan will discover if it’s possible for true love to have a future, or if history is destined to repeat itself.</description>

  <description>How long would you wait to be with the one that you love? How much of yourself would you hide in order to keep them? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooks knows the moment he meets Vivian that he will do whatever it takes to protect her, even if it means leaving her. Running from his past, he spends the next decade trying to forget the shattered heart that he left behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there any betrayal worth the cost? Are there some sins that cannot be forgiven?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a lifetime of rebuilding the walls guarding her heart, Vivian confronts the harsh reality that some fortresses are not meant to stand. Winding through a gray fog of disappointment and deceit, she must conquer her deepest fears to accept the love she believes she is too unworthy to have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the paths of these two battered hearts cross once more, together they seek redemption for their sins. However, when the secrets of their pasts come knocking on their door, forgiveness and love will be tested, and they will be forced to answer the question: “When the lies run out, will the truth finally set you free?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgive Us Our Trespasses is an adult contemporary novel and is not intended for younger readers due to mature content.</description>

  <description>“I can’t take it! I’ve been craving you ever since I saw you the other day. I haven’t stopped thinking about you since you disappeared ten years ago! I need you Steph. I’m sorry…” ~ Eric Sutherland&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephanie Wilcox never saw it coming after giving up that life ten years ago of constantly being verbally and emotionally abused by her drunken father. She didn’t run, but when she left, she never looked back. Forced by her abusive father to live with her Aunt Elizabeth, she had to leave behind the one person that had shown her true love. In her mind, Eric Sutherland, deserved so much more and being with her would only bring him down. She never stopped loving the sun-kissed boy who held her hand and touched her kindly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was years later when Stephanie met Travis Barnes, a young self-made billionaire who swooped in and helped mend some of her loneliness. However, after marrying Travis, he began to show who he really was and he was the type of man she was accustomed to, after growing up with an abusive father, and regardless of his flaws she still loves him. After all, why would she deserve any better?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eric broke, his kindness, his pure heart, it all fell apart that day Stephanie left. He did all he could to reach her, but it was hopeless. All the sadness, anger, and sorrow built up inside him over time and no one could replace the love he had for Stephanie. Fighting has been his outlet and now as a well-known UFC undefeated fighter, his career is all he has, but no matter how hard he tries to forget her, he can’t. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later he comes face to face with those large brown eyes that belong to the one girl he’s always loved and everything changes. This time he won’t let her get away.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;HE HAS A LEGACY TO SAVE…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michael Hale's company is in jeopardy. In the wake of his father's death and transitioning to CEO, projects are circling the drain and that may cost him everything. Come to find out, the consultant hired to fix things is the "one who got away" many years ago. This time he's playing for keeps, and he intends to win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;SHE SHOULD NEVER SAY NEVER…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elise Jackson swore she wouldn't come near Michael Hale again. He sucker punched her professionally, and he broke her heart. Still, a job’s a job, and they can both be adults. But high emotion and late nights working lead to passion neither of them can deny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have one week. Can the two of them pull Michael's company out of the fire and heal their old wounds?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Five dishonored soldiers.&lt;br&gt;Former Special Forces.&lt;br&gt;One last mission.&lt;br&gt;These are the men of Hard Ink.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since hard-bodied, drop-dead-charming Shane McCallan strolled into the dance club where Crystal Dean works, he’s shown a knack for getting beneath her defenses. For her little sister’s sake, Crystal can’t get too close. Until her job and Shane’s mission intersect, and he reveals talents that go deeper than she could have guessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shane would never turn his back on a friend in need, especially a former Special Forces teammate running a dangerous, off-the-books operation. Nor can he walk away from Crystal. The gorgeous waitress is hiding secrets she doesn't want him to uncover. Too bad. He’s exactly the man she needs to protect her sister, her life, and her heart. All he has to do is convince her that when something feels this good, you hold on as hard as you can—and never let go.</description>

  <description>I know what you’re thinking. “You were such a jerk, Nick!” Believe me, I know I screwed up the best thing I had going in my life, but that was kind of my thing. I’d learned how to run cons before I could even form complete sentences, and I’d always been selfish. But I changed. Lila forgave me, my brother and I were getting along, and I was trying to make a name for myself in the music world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least that was what I was trying to do when I negotiated my way into the recording studio with pop superstar Sadie Sinclair. I thought it would be a piece of cake—charm my way into her heart and into her record label’s good graces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when I thought I had it all figured out, I got mixed up in a web of lies, manipulation, and deception. A web that had me questioning my motives and desires altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was the fame and fortune really worth the price?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.elizabethleewrites.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.elizabethleewrites.com&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date on release schedule!

  <description>Love........................The Ultimate Loss of Control&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Rain and Raven Medici are identical twins. Although they come from a loving close-knit family their childhoods couldn’t have been more different. Raven went to school and was exposed freely to the outside world. Rain on the other hand was born with a blood disorder and denied many normal childhood experiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Once grown, Raven becomes a lawyer at their dad’s firm Kane &amp;amp; Medici in NYC. Rain along with her only childhood friend Tommy Conte, builds a very successful business as professional photographers. Traveling between Europe and Manhattan, and enjoying a world that was kept from her, Rain vows never to be controlled again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Dominick Kane is a product of his upbringing. He’s powerful, self-assured and knows he can achieve anything he desires. Nothing gets in his way. There is only one thing he has ever failed at. A relationship with his father Vincent Kane. Upon his father’s death, Dominick vows revenge. The events he sets in motion put him on a collision course he himself will be unable to control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     In a bizarre twist of fate, Dominick kidnaps Raven as part of his plan for revenge. Only to discover afterward, he has taken Rain by mistake.  Rain knows she can never survive being confined again. So she strikes a bargain with the devil and agrees to help Dominick get back what he feels rightly belongs to him. His father’s share of Kane &amp;amp; Medici.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Dominick decides to use the strong attraction growing between Rain and himself to control her in every way imaginable. Too bad no one ever taught Dominick you can’t control the heart. Nothing could have prepared him for the effect Rain would have on his. &lt;br&gt;Will this plan of revenge turn into unconditional love? Or will Dominick and Rain’s need for control ultimately destroy them and any possibly chance for a real future together.......&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*****This book contains sexual content and is not intended for any one under the age of 18.*****</description>

Their first meeting is anything but amicable—but they’re soon together again in an entirely different and more unpleasant situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dillon responds to a home invasion and assault, the last person he expects to see is his son’s fiery-tempered—and damn attractive—teacher, who has been haunting his thoughts since he aggravated her only days before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It soon becomes clear that Katrina’s attacker’s intentions are far more sinister than anyone initially realized and Dillon and Katrina’s time together becomes a necessity. But as the investigation heats up and their attraction mounts, Dillon is faced with a choice. Ignore the rules about getting involved with a witness—or risk it all for love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Romantica® contemporary erotic suspense romance from Ellora’s Cave</description>

I couldn’t breathe without Maddie. Maddie was my life. The saying about dying for your child is the absolute truth. The other things you would do are comparable to that of death. I know, I did those things. I did unthinkable things, all for Maddie. I continued the lie, the secrets with the one man who had no right. People say you always have options. That’s a lie. I had no choice. I did it all for her... for my Maddie.&lt;br&gt;           Adult content...Sex /adult language.</description>

  <description>Tessa “Rain” Donahue believed she was happy. Dancing in a burlesque show at the ‘Happy Valley Cabaret’ gave her a sense of power. Shots of tequila gave her courage. One-night-stands gave her variety. Her nights usually ended as the sun was rising. Her head held high as she walked away from a stranger’s warm bed, high heels in hand. Tessa thought she had all she ever wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reese Nichols, owner of the custom motorcycle shop ‘Deadly Seven’, was living his dream. He was his own boss, never having to answer to anyone. To him, money was no object. What he lacked, however, was something that money couldn’t buy. Reese woke up every morning knowing she was out there—his soul mate. One drunken night years ago Reese met Madame Miranda, the carnival fortune teller who instructed him on how to find the one who was meant for him. With his plan in place, Reese searched for the only one who could pass the test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tragedy kept Reese and Tessa from realizing their fate years ago. Destiny brought them back together for another chance. Would Reese recognize that she was something special? Would Tessa figure out that it was all a test? Through it all, would they both sin for love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Contains mature content including f/f scene***</description>

  <description>Knox and Charlotte's story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Knox Wellington opens the door to Charlie Davenport, he's not expecting the fiery brunette with whiskey colored eyes and a feisty personality. Sparks fly immediately, even though their initial meeting is nothing but hostile. Their chemistry is undeniable, but the chip on Knox's shoulder threatens to destroy any hope of him wooing the sweet, southern volunteer sent to help with his rehabilitation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Little does he know she's no Southern Belle, as she gives as good as she can take. As unexpected circumstances push them closer together, heads butt, patience is tested, and flames ignite as they dance around their mutual attraction, both of them jaded from broken pasts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They've both been burned before, so when their feelings of lust, desire, and wanting are inflamed in the heat of the moment, will they finally be able to get over the pain of the past or will their relationship be reduced to ashes before it can ever really begin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*While this book is a standalone, characters from Ignite, book 1, will appear in Knox's story.</description>

  <description>After a night of raw passion with the man Claire O’Briene had been secretly admiring for years, she thought their time together had come once and for all. Fate had finally brought them back to each other, but unfortunately nothing had changed. He was still the same man who ran away from relationships. Against his better judgment, Mason Bradley gave in to the temptation and allowed himself one night with the one woman he’d been too afraid to want … too afraid to need. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Six months after leaving Claire and regretting every minute of it, Mason gets called in for an undercover mission that’s not only dangerous, but brings back a past he spent years trying to forget. A past of fighting … of getting in the ring and using his fists to get what he wanted: money, women, and drugs. Now there are fighters turning up dead, and it’s Mason’s job to find out the truth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing he might not come out of the mission alive, Mason seeks out Claire to tell her how he truly feels, only to find another man competing for her love as well. Fighting is what he’s good at, and for once he will be fighting not only for justice … but for love.</description>

  <description>After spending the last two years stuck behind bars for a crime she didn’t commit, Harlow ‘Princess’ Gavelson’s time inside has finally come to an end, and she’s ready for revenge. Unfortunately, being the daughter to the Vice President of the Ravage Motorcycle Club cuts into her plans, as orders must be followed. Trying to settle back into this life is proving difficult when the tables are turned and the woman who framed her is out for blood. Lucky for Princess, growing up in a MC has taught her how to hold her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After spending years in hell overseas, Donavon ‘Cruz’ came home to lose the very thing he went into hell for, sending him to the darkest moments of his life. Joining Ravage two years ago was his safe haven, and he protects his family at all costs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a dark-haired bombshell struts into the club’s shop, he’s caught off guard but immediately knows she’s the one he’d do anything for. Tough as nails, and taking no crap from anyone, he’s captivated by a woman who could handle this life. Trying to meet the needs of the MC business and follow his heart proves to be difficult when the two collide, and lives are at stake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can these two find a way to be together, or will the needs of Ravage cost them everything, including their lives?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*Contains mature content including, sex and violence. Mature audiences only.*&lt;/strong&gt;

He’s the one man she never expected to have and the only man she’s determined to keep. He’s her forever, and there’s nothing she wouldn’t do for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost, that is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan announces that he’s accepted a job offer that requires yet another move. Angry he didn’t discuss his decision with her first, Emogen refuses to pack up and follow. She has a career, too, and she’s not ready to give it up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although determined to make the long distance thing work, their lives and careers begin to take a toll on the relationship, leaving them to wonder if they’re doing the right thing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes love isn’t enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you lose the one thing you are certain of, will you fight to get it back? Or will you let it go?</description>

  <description>Tess has just discovered sex. And now, she’s about to discover sex as a weapon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Seattle barista and art student is happy with her beautiful Brit boyfriend, Ben — especially in the bedroom. But while Ben’s her first, she’s hardly his. And Ben’s sexual history seems to be popping up in Tess’s face like something out of a zombie movie, and it has her questioning his commitment — and questioning whether his appealing alpha maleness is just a cover for a controlling personality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe one that’s meant to keep her from asking too many questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Ben the problem, or is everybody from his past the problem? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tess is asking the questions, and pushing hard for answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Nicole, the ex-fiancé who cheated on Ben, trying to worm her way back into his life? Was there something between Ben and Tess’s best friend, Erin? Or what’s going on with Ben’s adored teenage sister, Caroline, and Ben’s best friend Dan? And how did Ben get Tess a job interview with Mr. Andrews, his sophisticated but slimy boss at the music magazine? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Tess comes to learn, relationships — especially sexual ones — are as much about power as love. With each new discovery, she finds herself in a struggle to hold her head together as much as her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to find where her own power lies.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;NEW ADULT/ADULT CROSSOVER ROMANTIC COMEDY NOVELLA &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A martini glass of sizzling romance, a jigger of suspense and crime, perfectly shaken with a twist of wacky humor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where would you draw the line between love and trust? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Colin’s feisty great grandma Helga mysteriously disappears, Natalie and the gun-toting Svetlana rush to the rescue. With the help of Russian mafia goons and Natalie’s girlfriends, they get more than they bargained for. Natalie invites trouble into her life all over again. She could find herself questioned by the police, or worse, her relationship with Colin could become rickety once more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so the race begins: with grandma Helga on the loose, Colin turns to the police for help, and Natalie is a stiletto heel tip outside of the law. But being in the wrong has never felt so vindicated.&lt;br&gt;******************************************************** &lt;br&gt;**Warning: due to sexual situations, nasty language, and a high dose of sarcasm this book may not be appropriate for readers under 18 years old. &lt;br&gt;Not intended for prudes who get easily affronted**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***The books in the Almost Bad Boys series should be read in order. They are not stand-alone books:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost Matched (book 1)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost Broken Up (book 2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost Too Far (book 3)***</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;"Have you heard the saying, 'sex sells'? Well, I'm the supplier."&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finnley Felton sells sex.&lt;br&gt;Jennifer Downs is a virgin.&lt;br&gt;With the help of lady luck, the two meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Money. Bright lights. Sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jennifer is made an offer: sell her virginity to the highest bidder and transform into one of Finnley's girls. But she finds herself weak for him, and doesn't fully realize what she's agreed to until it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she rise to the challenge and play by the rules in a land where money is king and love is prohibited? Or will she lose herself and values in the attempt?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weak for him is not considered a "dark" read, but does have unlady-like language, adult subject matter, and s-e-x-ual situations. Weak for Him does not have a cliffhanger. There is resolution but the story does continue on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If you think I am bluffing by when I say that "Weak For Him" will give you the ride of lifetime, then I say, take a gamble and see for yourself."   –Tiffany @ The Naughty Book Dames"</description>

Buds of doubt start rooting in Hayley’s confidence, making her rethink her decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And just when it seems that they might make it together after all, life happens.

  <description>When Katie Harrington becomes engaged to Branson Stone she believes her life is right on track for all her dreams to come true. However, flashes of a life she never lived haunt her-leading her to discover a past that has been purposely erased from her memory in order to protect her from horrible truths. The look on her fiance's face as she retells everything she remembers will forever be etched in her mind. Instead of catching and comforting her, he lets her go. Retreating to the family's cottage on the Outer Banks for the summer, Katie's heart begins to heal. She succumbs to the allure of a dangerously handsome local, Aidan Romero. But as soon as Katie begins to let go and move on with Aidan . . . Branson finds her. Now Katie is torn between two lives-facing her painful past with Branson, or moving on with Aidan and keeping the secrets safely buried forever.</description>

  <description>Jag Jensen and Ellen Love had been best friends their whole lives until he turned thirteen and started noticing girls his own age, but that didn’t mean he stopped watching out for eleven-year-old Ellen. By his senior year in high school, baseball had taken the front seat in his life, with a scholarship to college and a pro career looming on the horizon, when sophomore Ellen caught his attention and they struck up their friendship again. Although Ellen wanted more, Jag didn’t want to drag her into what he knew would be a crazy life, but love has a way of deciding one’s future, and eventually they became a couple. Ellen followed him to California as he began his pro career, but his wild and hectic lifestyle screwed everything up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Jag is lost, realizing he’s never been without his best friend in his life. Learning to live without Ellen doesn’t settle well with him, so while trying to remain at the top of his career, he also wants to get his girl back, which proves to be more difficult than he thought it’d be. Will Ellen give him another chance or does that sort of thing only happen in the sappy romance novels she always used to read? Jag hopes she’s willing to try again as he puts his heart on the line for the woman he knows will always be his forever and a day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the second book of the True Love Trilogy</description>

  <description>Blair is looking for an escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;West is looking for a connection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One down and out woman. One isolated rock star. Life at the top is lonely, but so is life at the bottom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blair is just looking for someone to take the edge off her crappy life. Dull the pain, breathe a little life into her neglected body. A chance meeting at a bar leads to a night of passion. No names, no personal details. Just sex.&lt;br&gt;Well, it wasn't personal until she sees the guy standing on a stage ten meters in front of her. How the hell didn't she realize that the guy who blew her mind is the guitarist out of that dirty rock'n'roll band, Affliction? And why is he chasing her down the street? And how does he know her name?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes you find the things you didn't even know you were looking for in the most unexpected places.</description>

  <description>Warning: Don't read this book if you hate f**ked up alpha males, strong female leads, hot sex, and a kismet love story six years in the making. Oh yeah and a plot twist that will leave you reeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NFL quarterback, Zolt Hamil was America’s heartthrob until a career ending injury changed his life. Years later, he’s picked up the pieces and carved out a new path for himself. But the mental and physical scars of that day have left him moody and reclusive, and his only relief is indulging in pleasure and pain with his many one night stands. Though many women have tried, Zolt refuses to care about any of them. Only one woman has his heart; a hallucination of a young, sable-eyed, blonde beauty whom he conjured that painful day on the football field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the first day at his new job at a law firm in Scottsdale, Arizona, Zolt comes face to face with his hallucination, Irelyn Wilkes. Their fateful connection, and explosive passion for each other pulls them together, and this time, Zolt refuses to let her slip from his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Irelyn has her own demons to fight and her controlling boyfriend is one of them. He doesn't take kindly to other people playing with his toys, and he’ll stop at nothing to keep her by his side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Irelyn and Zolt defy the odds and find a way to be together? Or, will the events set in motion years ago keep them apart forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book 2, Being Zolt will be release early June 2014&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A gritty, urban New Adult Cinderella story where the princess can do her own rescuing — she just needs someone to believe in her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sister to car thieves, ex-girlfriend to a drug dealer, high school dropout, no-hoper and loser — Jess is on the sidelines, watching her life become one epic fail. Her dreams of university are fading fast, as the people in her life fight to confine her to their own expectations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Sebastien, a gifted cellist from a very different walk of life. Sebastien is clean and strong and talented. He likes and respects her, but he too has expectations. Sebastien seems to think she can do anything, and Jess, despite her fears and the secrets she hides, is starting to believe him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just as Jess dares to hope, the secrets in her past and the lies in her present catch up with her. All seems lost and she has to make a choice. Between past and future. Between home and hope. Between now and never. And this is now.</description>

  <description>Finally able to put her harrowing past to rest, Raina looks forward to her future with Kas, but the Ghost has other plans. As the FBI team gets closer to taking down the largest human trafficking ring in the modern world, the Ghost begins a wicked game, making Raina the pawn and the target. Never before encountering a worthy adversary, he's fascinated by Raina and is enjoying the refreshing challenge of her intellect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   The danger ignites to a blazing new level, and Kas struggles between the need to finally exorcise the Ghost and his need to protect his wife. Tension mounts as an internal battle wages, tormenting Kas as he watches Raina put her all into taking down the man responsible for horrific sex slavery and gruesome deaths. When a new player takes control, Jefferson orders the end of the Ghost's game with Raina, which results in one final, devastating act, leaving Kas desperate and willing to do whatever it takes to save her...by whatever means necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Disclaimer: Due to sensitive issues of abuse, human trafficking, and mature scenes, The Rain Trilogy is intended for readers 18+</description>

  <description>Shattered when Raina runs after his marriage proposal, Kas is hell-bent to find her and bring her home, where she belongs.  He will bend every law necessary to do so, willing to do anything to protect Raina from her demons and the men who haunt her, going as far as placing his career and life on the line to save hers.  Raina will give up everything she has worked so hard to achieve, even flee the country to keep Kas from the wrath and powerful reach of her abusive father.&lt;br&gt;      In the midst of the FBI team closing in on the Ghost, another ghost from Raina's past taunts her, promising that she will be his.  Meanwhile, a different trafficking ring is gaining strength in New Jersey.  Michael solicits Raina's help, needing her smooth, sultry voice to win the audition for the new singer in the ring leader's swanky night club. Raina knows her life is in jeopardy with the dangers of being undercover, but she is blindsided when she discovers that it's her heart that is threatened with a mortal blow.   &lt;br&gt;   Raina tries to heal from the nightmares of her dark past as the grisly bodies of innocent victims surface when the team gets closer to discovering the identity of the man responsible for the infuriatingly clever and powerful slavery ring.  When Raina finally comes face to face with the Ghost, he quickly engulfs her in a twisted game of cat and mouse, delivering a veiled threat as he slips through her fingers.  As the ghosts of her past and present ensnare her in their deadly web, Raina realizes the danger has just begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Disclaimer: Due to sensitive issues of abuse, human trafficking, and mature scenes, The Rain Trilogy is intended for readers 18+</description>

  <description>Raina has tried to forget her past, forget the pain, but when she finds herself staring straight into the fury blazing in her ex-boyfriend's eyes, her dark past comes rushing back. Furious with herself for actually having chosen someone like her father, she uses that anger to her advantage and fights for her life...and for her future that she prays will involve the man she can't seem to get out of her head. Kas is a natural leader, a fierce fighter, the type of man you send in when you need to get the job done. He is a courageous hero who is used to risking his own life to save others, but can he save the one who has captured his heart from her horrific past and the men who are hell-bent on destroying her? As Kas and Raina try to navigate through the twists and turns of a deviously intelligent human trafficking group, they find solace in each other's arms. Can they infiltrate the trafficker's tight ring, saving the innocent lives from imminent danger before it's too late?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written primarily in 3rd person POV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Disclaimer: Due to sensitive issues of abuse, human trafficking, and mature scenes, The Rain Trilogy is intended for readers 18+. Although Saving Rain does not include 'mature' scenes, the final two novels do.</description>

  <description>***Season 1's first collection, containing episodes 1-5*** &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't see it coming, didn't realize how different everything would be within the space of a month. I would fall in love with one man, I would kill another, and I would lose my body, my mind, my soul - my freedom to them. I was an operative, a strong woman, someone sent in to save others, but under these two men I became weak - or pretended to be. I didn't like being weak, it angered me. If I had free rein I could cut my masters in two. But I wasn't there for pride, I was there to free those women and to take down the two men who sold them as sex slaves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those men needed to be punished &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I would do it &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter the cost &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or how much I lost &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because I am Rita Kovak &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MY MASTERS' NIGHTMARE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This series has non consent and dub consent in it.</description>

  <description>*** This is a love story, a romantic thriller, and a stand-alone (no cliff-hanger). Warning: Graphic sex, violence, and psychological abuse. Age 18+ only. ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name was Joshua Carter. Now it's whatever she wants it to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is a Deliverer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She lures young men and delivers them to be sold. She delivers the strikes that enforce their obedience. She delivers the sexual training that determines their purchase price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as she delivers, the arrangement that protects her family will hold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delivering is all she knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one thing she can't deliver is a captive from slavery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And her stubborn slave thinks he can deliver her...from herself.</description>

  <description>After eight years as a professional poker player, Cashel St. Martin needed a break. The endless glow and ceaseless action of Vegas had lost its luster and his interest. He missed his family and still wore the bracelet Isabela had woven for him all those years ago. In fact, he’d never taken it off. He was willing to give all of his success away for a chance to patch things up with the only woman he’d ever loved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isabela had thought of him every hour of everyday since he’d been gone. She’d loved him and she knew he’d loved her but he’d just left it all behind and never once looked back. Now he was back and wanted to pick up where they’d left off all those years ago. He must be insane. After all, this wasn’t Vegas. Relationships required trust, not luck. Hell, he’d been lucky she hadn’t punched him in his too handsome face.</description>

  <description>Logan St. Martin has secrets. For instance, why does he operate a brewery instead of putting his medical license to use? Why is he so unlike the rest of the St. Martin family? Mysteries aside, he is smart and successful in all that he endeavors and he has set his sights on Miss Jessica Hunter, a flame haired goddess who owns the Italian restaurant in town. A business merger is the next item on his agenda. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jessica Hunter is on a mission. Her child needs a father, a responsible and disciplined man that will make a good role model for her son. Certainly not some irresponsible brute with shaggy hair and facial stubble whose wardrobe consists of flip-flops, cargo shorts, and screen-print T-shirts. However, while her son has need of a father, her body has needs that have gone unfulfilled for over five years and it seems a shame to waste the steamy bronzed hunk of man that is Logan St. Martin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their first encounter leads to an unexpected but explosive bout of steamy sex, Logan tells Jessie there’s absolutely nothing that can keep him from making her his, including the pits of hell. Too bad Jessie has no intention of following him on his way to eternal damnation.</description>

  <description>As Cory slaked his lust with yet another woman, he thought this one might be married, but he didn’t want to dwell too hard on that. Since he’d opened his vet practice in Whiskey Cove, women had thrown themselves at him and he’d given them what they wanted. He asked no questions, just pleased them and himself. And then she arrived, fresh-faced in cutoffs and a tank top, cradling her sick dog. He hadn’t cared what women thought about him, until now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brook saw Dr. Corrigan St. Martin emerge from the exam room straightening his necktie. And then she saw her landlord’s wife smoothing her clothes down as she followed behind him. Brook wondered if he’d known the woman was married. She’d heard the rumors about the vet, that he was shameless about his licentious behavior. But he was a devoted vet. And completely irresistible. Maybe there was more to the man than his reputation.</description>

  <description>I sat in my room at our family’s tattoo parlor, Forever Steel staring at the phone. I hadn’t stopped looking at the picture of this crazy, quirky, insanely beautiful blonde haired blue eyed siren that invaded the Jersey Shore a month ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carly Smythe was not my type at all. She was a twenty year old student at Stanford University in California, smart as hell, and funny. The shit kicker was she was so awkwardly unaware of what any man with pulse could see, and that was that she was a damn heartbreaker with a body that made me hard the very first time I saw her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She made me crazy, she snuck out to see me, and then avoided any sexual advances I made on her, until I finally kissed her, and I didn’t wait for an invitation either: I took those pouty little lips and made them mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carly was also an avid reader of those books, you know “Mommy Porn.” So my game had to be stepped up. Who the hell am I kidding? She could see through my game immediately, and it didn’t have the same effect it did on every other girl I hooked up with. And she didn’t go running for the hills, either. I fell hard… and fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abe (her cousin) knew all the shit that had gone down in my life for the past five and a half years and in order to make this work, which I wanted it to... I needed to set the record straight, put it all on the line, give her the 411, and let her decide if after everything, she still wanted to give it up to a guy like me. A tattooed, pierced, f-up, with a past that was sure to send any girl into a tail spin. She was not any girl, she was…different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Youtube video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbCedqMOrW0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbCedq...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>Strike is the second book in the Completion Series. There is no connection to Play (book I) except the sports theme. Strike is a standalone HEA novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen-year-old Jaycee Shumway breaks into professional baseball player, Reed Tyler’s home, to steal the second most valuable set of balls he owns. Neither of them expect their striking attraction or battle of wills to lead them to a homerun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaycee has more than herself to worry about. When Reed discovers she has a younger brother and sister, he’s quickly caught up in their world of need and heartbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baseball season begins and the separation puts Reed and Jaycee’s game on hold. With bases loaded and hearts on the line, will Reed convince Jaycee that she needs him to win or will Jaycee strike out and walk off the field forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This New Adult book is intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>Kaiya Marlow has always been cautious, precise in every decision she makes. When her dark past threatens to resurface, she decides to take precautions to protect herself by enrolling in self-defense classes at her gym.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her instructor, Ryker Campbell, is the tattooed womanizer everyone warns about. Kaiya attempts to resist Ryker's advances, but the more time they spend training together, the harder it is for Kaiya to resist him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryker's view on relationships is simple: strictly sex, nothing more. Haunted by demons from his past, he never allows himself to become attached to any woman. No attachment means no weakness, no vulnerability, no pain. He doesn't realize that his whole world is about to be turned upside down when Kaiya enters his self-defense class. Determined to have her, at least for one night, Ryker sets a plan into motion that will change both of their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will love be able to heal their scars, or are they too deep to overcome?</description>

  <description>As a married mother of three, Addison Greyer has always been known for doing the right thing. Hoping to keep it that way, she fought like hell to avoid falling for the mysterious, highly successful, albeit broken man whom the world knows as William Hartman. But what Addison didn't understand was that you can't help who you fall in love with and that it almost never happens the way you think it should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for Addison, William Hartman and her desire for him continue to occupy her mind every single waking moment of the day. There's something undeniable in the way he makes her feel. From the way he looks at her to the way he so eloquently professes his love and longing via written letters, it suddenly becomes pretty clear that some rules were made to be broken. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the two of them separated by a trial, public opinion, and a marriage that seems to be unraveling by the hour, Addison tries to keep it all together as life as she knows it is falling apart. However, as the pressure mounts, Addison soon realizes the price she'll pay to keep everyone else happy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this highly anticipated sequel to Bedrock, Addison and William rekindle their torrid, sensual affair through a series of love letters. What remains to be seen is whether their love and desire for one another can sustain them as they attempt to overcome the realities of their broken pasts and build a future together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to heavy subject matter, strong language, and sexual content this book is for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>Bumping Noses and Cherry Pie is a book of short stories in a brand new genre—Circuspunk. It contains 26 stories about the circus, carnivals, sideshows, midways and fairs featuring clowns, magicians, freaks, carnies and the crazy cast of characters that go along with them. “This ain't your mama's roller coaster ride! That is unless your mama does acid before hitting the amusement park!” says Mimi Williams, author of Beautiful Monster. “Hate clowns or love them, you are going to enjoy reading her zany and sometimes poignant look at a world we both love,” adds Jim Rose of the Jim Rose Circus and author of Freaks Like Me. This is a wild ride of stories that begins with the rape of a circus poodle by one of the show’s rescue mutts and doesn’t let up until an overweight daredevil Elvis impersonator becomes a circus stuntman—diving 35 feet into a flaming kiddie pool of water. In between, the combination of satire, splatter and the wild and wacky will have you laughing, with brief respites of stories that will touch your heart and make you think. A professional clown for 9 years, Ms. La Marr tells it like it is, like it should be and like those of you who with clown phobia would like it to be. Put on your rubber nose, put your big shoes up on the coffee table and enjoy Bumping Noses and Cherry Pie. The first Circuspunk book ever!</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover for ASIN B00FQSM6S0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is taking a chance with your heart worth the escape, or was it better to have never loved at all? Can forgiveness really set you free? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the unexpected death of her Dad, and the haunting manner in which he died, Riley Shaw built invisible walls around her heart. Barriers she created to protect her from splintering into broken pieces that couldn’t be repaired. She was unable to move forward from her past, letting the guilt of her parent’s mistakes dictate her own choices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dean Warren was safe. Being with him was innocent and peaceful because she didn’t truly love him. His words held her captive in a false sense of security. His eyes were deceptive, and his promises of never pushing her beyond what she was willing to give were broken, leaving Riley in a state of regret and doubt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joshua Parker had the power to take what was left of Riley’s splintered pieces and ruin her completely, or make her whole again. He was her best friend, her next-door neighbor—everything she wanted and settled on never having. Loving him was as easy as breathing air. The fear of losing him forever was more real to her than the feelings she couldn’t escape. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When faced with the very thing she feared the most, and in the arms she thought were safe, Riley finds herself questioning every decision she has made over the past two years. When she finally escapes the doubt in her head, and accepts the truth in her heart, is it too late? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I'm so close to the edge of the cliff that I know one more breath, one more inch, I could fall.” -Riley Shaw&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Not recommended for anyone under the age of 17 due to underage drinking, sexual content and adult language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is book one in a series and is not a standalone.***</description>

  <description>At eighteen, Kara Duncan had already made her fair share of mistakes, choosing the wrong boy and earning herself a bad reputation in the process. Hurt and humiliated, she'd packed up and moved on, sure that everyone in Bella Warren, Arkansas, would be better off without her. She'd planned never to return, but when crisis strikes, she has nowhere else to turn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After seven years, Wade Chester thought his feelings for Kara were finally ancient history. Until he sees her again, standing on his front porch just as she'd done a million times before. She needs his help—and his family's crops—if her canning business is going to survive. The rest of his family has let bygones be bygones, so why is it so hard for him to let go of the past?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Kara claims to be interested only in putting things right, the old heat flaring between them is undeniable. But Wade will need to risk his heart—and the reputation of his farm—to prove that they're meant to be together.</description>

  <description>Logan Rettino never imagined she'd fall so far. Dropped by her ex on national TV, she's gone from prima ballerina to ring card girl, reduced to revving up the crowds before MMA bouts. However distasteful she finds her new job, it pays well…and she needs the money if she's ever going to rebuild her life. Promised a huge bonus if she can convince a brooding, gifted welterweight to keep fighting, she'll do whatever it takes to earn his trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keane O'Shea is unbeatable in the octagon. A former marine, he fights with a ruthlessness no gym jockey can match. He knows his brutal strength is too much for the delicate ex-ballerina, regardless of how fascinating he finds Logan's tight dancer's body. But one private performance and he's drawn to her in a way he can't—or won't—resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Logan discovers the heartbreaking truth that lies beneath this handsome warrior's rage, she'll need to forfeit everything she thought mattered for the one thing that matters the most: saving Keane from himself.</description>

  <description>James Micheal Whren is brilliant, beautiful, rich, and taken—with his genius for creating music. He's desired by many, yet commits to no one but his muse. Just twenty-eight, and at the pinnacle of his career, on the eve of his brother's funeral his father shatters his life, and James is left abandoned in hell with no one real to save him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His odyssey to freedom takes him beyond the looking glass, to the reflection of friends and lovers. Humbled and alone, James escapes to the Greek island of Corfu. But instead of finding solace there, loneliness almost consumes him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Elisabeth, and her son, Cameron. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reverb is a love story, a psychological thriller paced with romantic suspense. The story chronicles intricately woven characters fraught with frailties that possess us all, and that linger long after the read. It is a tale of redemption—the evolution of a modern man from solipsist to integrated awareness, and the journey that inadvertently awakens his capacity to love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spun from The Magus, also about a man who learns to love someone other than himself, and way beyond 50 Shades of Gray, Reverb is told like Crime and Punishment--modern, clean, edgy verging on sharp. Like nothing you've read, guaranteed.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; He’s exquisitely hot. Exquisitely tousled. Exquisitely screwed in the head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cammibelle Hicks just wants to survive her first year of college. Desperate to forget her troubled past, she throws herself into her degree and book review blog. So what if her life is one long tumblr page of grumpy cat GIFs? She doesn’t need to get out more, and she definitely doesn’t need a man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter von Styles approaches life like he’s spoiling for a fight: with a tempting scowl. A cage-fighting, ex-rocker billionaire, it’s unclear why Hunter’s at college. Frankly, it makes no sense. Then Cammie falls into him—literally—at a party, and he’s obsessed. He needs her more than a moist towelette at a barbecue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Cammie’s friends warn her against Hunter, she can’t resist his charms; especially not when he buys her shoes. And GoodReads. And a unicorn. But when her handsome best friend, medieval reenactor Archer Riddick, makes a play for her heart—and challenges Hunter to a jousting match—it turns out that Hunter has demons of his own. Demons that aren’t real ones, but metaphorical ones—which are MUCH WORSE, when you think about it…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Hunter and Cammie on an emotionally exhausting journey into love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And co-dependence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And probably therapy.</description>

But who will get their happy ever after?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romantic, emotional and intensely erotic, Knight &amp;amp; Day is the thrilling final installment of the USA Today bestselling Knight Series from Kitty French.</description>

  <description>After Evan Arden was imprisoned by the enemy for a year and a half, he returned from the desert as a military hero. He’d suffered some minor injuries during his captivity, was discharged from the Marines with just a touch of shellshock, but was considered otherwise unharmed. Now he wonders how he ended up where he is now – incarcerated in Chicago’s Metropolitan Correctional Center for using his sharpshooting expertise to take out the neighborhood park with a high-powered sniper rifle and multiple rounds of ammunition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lia Antonio, the woman he rescued from the desert heat the previous year, is the only person who can bring him out of his sleep-deprived psychosis and mounting PTSD. When she does, Evan knows he can’t just let her go again. He’s never considered leaving the business before – who retires from the mafia? – but he’s determined to get both Lia and himself out of harm’s way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan faces forces from multiple directions as a deal to get him out of jail turns more deadly and dangerous than he ever could have imagined. With a three-way mob war on the horizon and the feds holding evidence over his head, Evan has no choice but to throw himself into the middle of another war-zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his efforts to make things right in his own mind, Evan crosses the wrong man and finds himself on the business end of the cross-hairs. With his observation skills and intelligence, he tries to keep a step ahead of his former co-workers, but this time, it isn’t just his own life on the line – he’s got to protect Lia from the man who once called him son.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Love is like an avalanche. It hits hard, fast and without mercy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least it did for me when Sculpt, the lead singer of the rock band Tear Asunder knocked me off my feet. Literally, because he’s also a fighter, illegally of course, and he taught me how to fight. He also taught me how to love and I fell hard for him. I mean the guy could do sweet, when he wasn't doing bossy, and I like sweet.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it all shattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidnapped. &lt;br&gt;Starved.  &lt;br&gt;Beaten. &lt;br&gt;I was alone and fighting to survive.&lt;br&gt;When I heard Sculpt's voice, I thought he was there to save me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(It is highly recommended to read "With You" the novella first).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Warning: This book contains some disturbing situations, strong language and sexual content. Over 18 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a love story with some dark elements. Dark contemporary romance. No cliffhanger and next in the Tear Asunder series is Ream's story (the band's lead guitarist).</description>

  <description>“There would be no happy ending for us. He was too damaged. I was too broken.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years ago, Lorrie’s mother was murdered. But that wasn’t the end of it. Reeling from the tragedy,  Lorrie’s father spiraled into alcohol, depression, and finally suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two most important people in Lorrie’s life are both gone but she’s still alive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trying to recover from the tragedy, Lorrie returns to campus, ready to pick up the pieces of her life. All Lorrie wants is to get back to “normal.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets Hunter. The man, the legend, “the Hammer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter is a cage fighter who takes on every fight like he’s got nothing to lose. His life is a tangled mess of girls, booze, and fist fights. And while it may seem like he’s got a devil-may-care attitude, he’s fighting a private cage-match with a monster he can’t defeat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lorrie knows that Hunter is the exact type of guy she should stay away from, especially in her fragile state, but Hunter has other ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Hunter and Lorrie grow closer together, will they be able to overcome their pain and heal each other? Or will they both end up wrecked?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WRECKED&lt;br&gt;RESCUED (WRECKED BOOK TWO: Coming Early 2014)</description>

  <description>New York City, May 2000. The Internet bubble has burst and Evan, a computer programmer, is fired with an email from his boss. The next day, his girlfriend dumps him, also via email. Afraid to check any more emails, Evan desperately seeks a rebound romance but the catastrophes that ensue go from bad to hilariously worse.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, Evan meets Sammy -- someone whose legendary disasters with females eclipse even his own. To reverse their fortunes, they recruit their friends -- Trevor, Yi, and Carlos -- to form a group of five guys who take on Manhattan in pursuit of dates, sex, and adventure.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Evan, a closet writer, falls desperately in love with a Hollywood starlet, he schemes to meet her by writing a novel that will sweep her off her feet. Sammy knows nothing about publishing but is confident of one thing: Evan's book should have the word "sex" in the title. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With musings about life, relationships, and human psychology, this quintessential New York story about the search for happiness follows five men on their comical paths to trouble, self-discovery, and love.</description>

  <description>***Author Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong.***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up the way I did, you’d think I’d be more screwed up than what I actually am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon as I turned sixteen, I left that bump in the road I called home and took my chances on the street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best decision I ever made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, at the age of twenty six, I’m educated, employed and damn good at my job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friends have become my family. Like me, they know what it’s like to grow up unloved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the saying is true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world makes way for those who know where they are going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know where I’m going and I’ll get there eventually. On my own terms and at my own pace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then there’s him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel his eyes on me. I see him hiding in plain sight. He watches me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He makes me feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s unconventional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m sure you’re wondering how a person falls in love with their stalker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So am I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This isn’t a story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my life.</description>

  <description>This book is meant for a mature reader as it contains some steamy scenes and salty language - you will however laugh, maybe whimper (not cry) and fall in love with all of the characters!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anda like a lot of people, detests her job. She's been trying to get fired for as long as she could remember and goes out of her way to blow off every assignment that she is given. But when one of her "missions" ends badly, well more badly than usual, her boss who happens to be her mother "drops" her into the the fray hoping she will learn her lesson. But the only lesson she is about to learn is how fast she can fall for a smokin' sexy aviation engineer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Miller is the oldest Miller brother. He is successful, handsome and wants for very little having reached many of his goals by the ripe old age of 25. But when he sets his gaze on Anda, his brother's new "counselor?"...He can't believe his eyes. She is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen and experiences an attraction for her like never before. For the first time in his life, Sam is fearful that he might not get what he wants. A gorgeous, awe inspiring, blond beauty who's recently developed an obsession for mashed potatoes;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did I mention that Anda is a Dream Weaver? Hmmm...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This book is recommended for adult readers due to its mature content.</description>

  <description>She is a woman on the run. Pain, loneliness and terror are what she is leaving.  Where she is headed doesn’t matter as long as it’s away from the hell her life has become. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joshua Bennett is trapped in a prison of his own making by the memories of his past. Traumatized and isolated, he is a reclusive writer, living a quiet, lonely life, his only companion his dog, Bear. It is what he knows, what he has accepted to be his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One dark night, one huge storm, and one ice patch brings them together. He finds himself with an unexpected houseguest with no memory. She wakes up a stranger to herself and the man watching her. Even more mysterious is the lack of any sort of identification with her or in her car. She is an enigma to both of them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trapped by the storm and isolated from the outside world, they slowly open up, learning to trust and love, until the world once again shows up, threatening the fragile peace of their newly discovered world, and tearing them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are many twists and turns as they struggle to find each other, overcoming both the mental and physical elements that keep them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story about overcoming our fears, finding love and learning to live again.</description>

  <description>Try – verb: to make an attempt or effort to do something or in this case…someone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sex. Logan Mitchell loves it, and ever since he realized his raw sexual appeal at a young age, he has had no problem using it to his advantage. Men and women alike fall into his bed—after all, Logan is not one to discriminate. He lives by one motto—if something interests you, why not just take a chance and try?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he wants to try Tate Morrison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just coming out of a four-year marriage with an ex-wife from hell, a relationship is the last thing on Tate’s mind. He’s starting fresh and trying to get back on his feet with a new job at an upscale bar in downtown Chicago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only problem is, Tate has caught the unwavering and unwelcome attention of  Mr. Logan Mitchell – a regular at the bar and a man who always gets what he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Night after night Tate fends off the persistent advances of the undeniably charismatic man, but after an explosive moment in the bar, all bets are off as he finds his body stirring with a different desire than his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As arrogance, stubbornness and sexual tension sizzles between the two, it threatens to change the very course of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan doesn’t do relationships. Tate doesn’t do men. But what would happen if they both just gave in and…tried?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GENRE: M/M</description>

  <description>Thirty-one year old Claire Hatley is running from Seattle having just discovered that her live-in boyfriend has traded her in for a twenty-two year old hostess.  Devastated and alone Claire must make a fresh start.  She answers an ad for a chef at a guest ranch just outside Colorado Springs and finds herself face to face with Cole Mitchell, quite possibly the sexiest man to ever ride a horse.  Common sense tells them to stay away from each other, but their attraction is not to be denied. He gives her a glimpse of what love should be, but just as she starts to trust him, the past comes back to tear them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Claire and Cole as they embark on the stormy love affair of a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Oh...and for those of you with husbands/boyfriends, please tell them “you’re welcome” from MJ.)</description>

  <description>Ruby has been in love with Ford since their university days, but she hasn't seen her former best friend in years--not since the one unforgettable kiss they shared right before he went off globe-trotting and she stayed behind. When he returns to town unexpectedly for their friends' New Year's Eve wedding, the sparks between them ignite, but can her wanderer ever settle down? Ford has never forgotten Ruby, or the kiss that changed everything between them, despite the many women he has tried to erase her with. His return to England for the wedding means a second chance with Ruby--but will one passion-filled evening with her be enough, or has he finally found his home?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Fans of &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bared to You&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Release Me&lt;/em&gt; will be hooked on &lt;em&gt;Ruined&lt;/em&gt;, an electrifying journey of emotional and sexual discovery that pushes two damaged souls to their breaking point—and beyond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;He’s the last man Chloe Girard should love . . . but the first she ever could.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethan Frost is a visionary, a genius, every woman’s deepest, darkest fantasy—even mine. And, somehow, I am his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stole into my life like a dream. Turned my reality upside down and made my every desire come true—especially those I never knew I had. He demanded everything I had to give and gave me everything of himself in return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But dreams don’t last forever, and ours is no exception. Because my nightmares are darker, and my wounds deeper, than I could ever reveal. And as much as Ethan wants to protect me, the secrets we we share will only tear us apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from other Loveswept titles.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>This is the first book in a series of three in the life of Erik Ead. Erik is a psychiatrist. He rides a motorcycle in a Motorcycle Club. He is tattooed. He is confident to the point of perceived arrogance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erik does not believe in love and he doesn’t live in a mansion -he rides a motorcycle in a MC. He does not have an airplane. Erik is extremely confident, real, and knows what he wants. He wants a woman to submit; with no commitment for love. Erik will settle for nothing less than owning Kelli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelli is a college graduate scheduled to go to a university at the end of the summer. She meets Erik, who is older than she is. Immediately she is intrigued by him. Kelli has never been in a relationship at all. Kelli has spent her life being promiscuous, and using men for sex. Kelli, after meeting Erik, wants to do nothing but please him. Kelli doesn’t quite understand why, and waits on Erik to explain to her why she is the way she is, and what to do next .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Love isn't real. Love is what people say to you so they can keep fucking you. So they can keep your interest. I don't want lies. I want my ass slapped, my hair pulled, and treated like a little whore." – Kelli with an “I”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When these two begin to spend time together, things begin to change; personalities, interests, and the need for affection. What happens is something that must be experienced by the reader. This book is, again, not watered down. This book has tremendous depth to those that are looking to find it. It will, upon completion, allow you into the minds, hearts, and heads of people as they develop a D/s relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, if you have always wondered about what a Dominant/submissive relationship is all about – less the airplanes, mansions, and billions, read Baby Girl. It’s real, it’s raw, and it’s got the hottest, steamiest real sex you can imagine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plan on being up all night.</description>

  <description>Overachiever Mary-Kate Grant (who is indeed named after an Olsen Twin) has followed every rule to the letter to pursue her dream of working in TV programming.  Ripping a page from the “hard work pays off” playbook, she takes an assistant level job at a Chicago sports network to break into the industry.&lt;br&gt;MK has no time or desire for a relationship right now—she is totally focused on her career and being independent, unlike the other women in her family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But MK’s plans are run through the shredder when she finds herself working for William Cumberland, a British media mogul who made his fortune with Connectivity, a social media site. William blows into Chicago just like the winds off Lake Michigan and purchases the group of networks MK works for—and makes her his personal assistant in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly MK finds her career plans in jeopardy. William makes her question everything she has ever thought and has the uncanny ability to see right through her. And for the first time in her life, MK finds herself not only questioning what she wants for her career but for her personal life as well…</description>

  <description>Sometimes the wrong choice can be just right . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fun and fearless, Cora Lewis knows how to keep her tattooed "bad boy" friends at the Marked in line. But beneath all that flash and sass is a broken heart. Cora won't let herself get burned again. She's waiting to fall in love with the perfect man—a baggage-free, drama-free guy ready for commitment. Then she meets Rome Archer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rome Archer is as far from perfect as a man can be. He's stubborn, rigid, and bossy. And he's returned from his final tour of duty more than a little broken. Rome's used to filling many roles: big brother, doting son, supersoldier—but none of those fit anymore. Now he's just a man trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life while keeping the dark demons of war and loss at bay. He would have been glad to suffer through it alone, until Cora comes sweeping into his life and becomes a blinding flash of color in a sea of gray.Perfect may not be in the cards, but perfectly imperfect could just last forever . . .</description>

  <description>When fiercely independent Vivian Reese is thrust onto the national stage during a heated presidential campaign, she doesn't expect to become a media darling. She also doesn't expect to start to fall for her sexy new bodyguard, Marcus Locke. But when threats start surfacing against the sitting President's campaign and all evidence points to Vivian, she doesn't know who to trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delta Force Operator turned FBI agent Marcus Locke is supposed to be investigating campaign finance crimes. He's not supposed to be checking out the sexy, eloquent campaign spokeswoman Vivian Reese, who's one of his prime suspects! But when they are caught in the middle of a presidential race that is quickly turning deadly, he is forced to put both his heart and his job in the line of fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tempers flare and passions ignite as the campaign gets dangerous, but when bullets start to fly will either of them survive?</description>

  <description>Lieutenant Evan Arden sits in a shack in the middle of nowhere, waiting for orders that will send him back home - if he ever gets them. Other than his loyal Great Pyrenees, there's no one around to break up the monotony. The tedium is excruciating, but it is suddenly interrupted when a young woman stumbles up his path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has two choices - pick her off from a distance with his trusty sniper-rifle, or dare let her approach his cabin and enter his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why not? It's been ages, and he is otherwise alone...</description>

  <description>Cory Marcel worked tirelessly over eight grueling years to develop a successful military career. After her commanding officer violently assaulted her, she lost everything—especially her trust in people. Despite the emotional damage threatening to sink her, Cory agrees to accept a new job at a furniture store in Perfect—a job that could offer the fragile brunette the chance to start over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ted Lovejoy cofounded Langford &amp;amp; Lovejoy Heritage Furniture, but lately he feels like an outsider in his own business. When he meets Cory, Ted realizes his company can do more than just build furniture—it can also help rebuild lives. He longs to help Cory recover from her pain, yet every time he gets too close to her heart, she pushes him away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Cory can’t resist her attraction to Ted, she fears the demons haunting her will drag down both of them. Could this kind, soft-spoken man help her finally bury the past…and unlock a future full of hope and happiness?</description>

  <description>On a scorching hot summer day in Elkwood, Alabama, Claire Lambert staggers naked, wounded, and half-blind away from the scene of an atrocity. She is the sole survivor of a nightmare that claimed her friends, and even as she prays for rescue, the killers — a family of cannibalistic lunatics — are closing in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder returns from Iraq to the news that his brother is among the murdered in Elkwood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In snowbound Detroit, a waitress trapped in an abusive relationship gets an unexpected visit that will lead to bloodshed and send her back on the road to a past she has spent years trying to outrun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Claire, the only survivor of the Elkwood Massacre, haunted by her dead friends, dreams of vengeance... a dream which will be realized as grief and rage turn good people into cold-blooded murderers and force alliances among strangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's time to return to Elkwood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the spirit of such iconic horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance, Kin begins at the end and studies the possible aftermath for the survivors of such traumas upon their return to the real world — the guilt, the grief, the thirst for revenge — and sets them on an unthinkable journey... back into the heart of darkness.</description>

  <description>Ethan Hudson is a man accustomed to being in control...of all situations in his life. Yet, much to his dismay, he finds himself at the mercy of cancelled flights that are determined to mess with his well-ordered plans. Added on to this dilemma is his unexplained attraction for his male colleague... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Mallloy believes in going after what he wants...and fate appears to have given him the golden opportunity to make his move. His desire for Ethan has been brewing for months, and now is the time to let the other man know exactly how he feels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stranded in Paradise is an erotic romp through anticipation, discovery, and excitement. With a strong m/m focus, hang on tightly because there is a surprise menage a trois ending that you don't want to miss! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotica....menage a trois....m/m...m/f...m/m/f &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpt.... &lt;br&gt;Eyes widening as he lifted the glass back to his mouth for another fortifying sip of liquid courage, Ethan inhaled deeply. The liquor slid down his throat easier this time, and he took a deep breath. "You're saying that you want to..." he trailed off, afraid to vocalize his suspicions about what he thought the younger man wanted. Jesus, if he was wrong, their friendship might be irreparably damaged, and that was the last thing he wanted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I'm saying that I think you need some human contact, man. Some TLC. And I'm saying that I'm more than willing to provide you with it. If you'll let me," David explained slowly, remaining perfectly still in front of the polished dresser that he leaned against. He’d always been taught that honesty was the best policy. He hoped that lesson didn’t fail him now. &lt;br&gt;"Dave...I've never...with a man...I've never..." Ethan faltered, mentally cursing his own ineptitude. For months, he’d wondered about this. His body screamed that this was the moment he had been waiting for, but now that it was here, he was suddenly unable to even string together a coherent sentence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"E.G., it's okay," David assured him softly, loving the way the lights bounced off Ethan’s ebony locks. "I'm not exactly an expert myself, but I'm attracted to you...and not in a conveniently platonic kind of way. I wanna be straight up with you about that. I want you, E.G. In every way there is." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Call me Ethan," Ethan demanded huskily, staring back into Dave’s chocolate eyes across the room as he avoided addressing what the other man had just said. “Everybody else calls me E.G. I want you to call me Ethan.”</description>

  <description>The most relentless, deeply disturbing thriller writer since Jeffery Deaver and Gillian Flynn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For years, best friends Sarah and Jennifer kept what they called the “Never List”: a list of actions to be avoided, for safety’s sake, at all costs. But one night, against their best instincts, they accept a cab ride with grave, everlasting consequences. For the next three years, they are held captive with two other girls in a dungeon-like cellar by a connoisseur of sadism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, at thirty-one, Sarah is still struggling to resume a normal life, living as a virtual recluse under a new name, unable to come to grips with the fact that Jennifer didn’t make it out of that cellar. Now, her abductor is up for parole and Sarah can no longer ignore the twisted letters he sends from jail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, Sarah decides to confront her phobias and the other survivors—who hold their own deep grudges against her. When she goes on a cross-country chase that takes her into the perverse world of BDSM, secret cults, and the arcane study of torture, she begins unraveling a mystery more horrifying than even she could have imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A shocking, blazingly fast read, Koethi Zan’s debut is a must for fans of Karin Slaughter, Laura Lippman, and S.J. Watson.</description>

  <description>There's a new Alpha in town . . . and he's a Brit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darcy Nicole Sheridan, is 22 years-old, beautiful, single, spirited, sexy and  - spoiled. She knows that about herself. Raised by wealthy (and doting) parents as an only child, Darcy pretty much coasts through life until her heart is inexplicably broken by her G-Man, Darin. Darcy doesn't handle rejection well; she isn't used to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To ease the pain, Darcy flies to Belize over the Christmas holiday fully intending to wallow in self-pity and distance herself from D.C. and the pain that originated there. Her pity party is short-lived however, after observing a very handsome, very intriguing man on the beach with a beautiful blonde. The blond gets ditched and it's Darcy that becomes the focus of the smokin' hot, wealthy and somewhat mysterious 'E.J.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some very interesting things happen in Belize, but it doesn't end there. Once back in D.C., there are even more surprises in store for Darcy, including a new male roommate, her best friend Lindsey's wedding, and a surprise encounter with "E.J." that leaves Darcy confused in more ways than one!  Shortly thereafter, surprising changes are in store for Darcy's career, love life and even a repentant Darin shows up in the mix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Readers will get a bonus glimpse of Taz and Lindsey's HEA and perhaps even see some loose ends tied up with respect to the Rat Bastard!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As always, this latest release of the "G-Man Series" will keep you on the edge of your seat through the laughter, tears, angst, drama and mystery.  Easton is sure to be a favorite 'G-Man' of many in this newest release of the series! He's an alpha like no other . . . &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>I trust you …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are the three words that Melissa Ashford wishes she could say to someone; to the one person she can fully give herself to and not worry about being betrayed. Being twenty-eight years old and divorced from a cheating ex-husband, Melissa enjoys her freedom … until one night when she finds herself indulging in a one night stand that changes everything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s something about the alluring Brett Walker that has Melissa feeling things she’s never had with any other man. These feelings not only scare her, but push her past her limits as well. Just when she begins to open her soul to this new love, their bond is put to the test by jealousies from the past trying to break them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not only Melissa’s trust that’s put on the line, but Brett’s as well. Will their love be strong enough to get them through the lies? Will Melissa finally be able to say those three words she’s been dying to say? I trust you …</description>

  <description>“What gives you a thrill Kristen?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I knew that giving in to Vincent Sorenson was a risk, but it was one I was willing to take. I had hidden my heart for so long and for the first time in a long time, Vincent was close to breaking down the walls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a trip to Vincent’s exclusive private island reveals the real Vincent underneath the layers of suave nonchalance, I thought we were close to the start of something special.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when things were looking up for us, I would discover the one secret that Vincent never intended for me to find.</description>

  <description>“What gives you a thrill Kristen?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The minute I saw Vincent Sorenson, I knew he was trouble. Billionaire. Bad boy. And dangerously sexy. He was everything I craved, and nothing I needed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t just avoid him. The higher ups at my company decided they needed his business, and I was on the team to bring him in. Vincent Sorenson didn’t seem as interested in business as he was in me, but I knew that was a door better left unopened. If I got involved with him, it would only unearth the pain I spent years trying to bury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought I had it under control, but I seriously underestimated Vincent’s seductive charm and silver-tongue. I would soon find out how delicious it would feel to let myself fall into this forbidden surrender.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; Rated R18. Contains sexually explicit content, both M/F &amp;amp; M/M.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dante Rata learns what’s &lt;em&gt;Behind the Lens&lt;/em&gt; in this explosive sequel to &lt;em&gt;Behind the Tears.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dante has a problem with sex&lt;/em&gt; – he gets way too much of it. Women want him, force themselves upon him, fight each other to get into his bed, and this ripped to the bones sex god even attracts male admirers. But when Dante discovers hidden cameras in his bedroom, he soon learns his sexual prowess is famous and the women who have been throwing themselves at him are porn actresses, paid to trick him into performing for the financial gain of an underground pornography ring - an organisation who forces people into sexual slavery. Dante’s efforts to outwit Ant Torres, the porn-ring’s instigator, ends with Dante trapped into performing live for his fans; with the threat of death to his loved ones if he doesn’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dante’s brother, Sledge, also has a problem with sex&lt;/em&gt; – but with the same-sex. He finds himself attracted to Corey, his best mate. After Sledge is told devastating news about his family, he falls into Corey’s bed, taking him as a lover. Ashamed of what he has done, Sledge tries to hide the relationship from his family and friends, something which makes Corey feel like a dirty little secret. When he finds Sledge talking to a pair of females at a party, he flies into a jealous rage, outing Sledge in front of everyone. Humiliated, Sledge runs out on Corey, which inadvertently leads Corey to Torres’s bed, where he is made to perform for the camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Corey is dropped off at home, drugged and traumatised, Sledge learns about the pornography ring and the danger his brother is in. Intent on revenge as well as saving his brother, he sets out to bring down Torres, along with his crime syndicate anyway he can – whether it takes him with it or not.</description>

  <description>**Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual content and language, mature subject matter**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Contemporary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lost. That one single word best describes my life at this very moment. I lost the last games of the season and both my team and my coach blame me. I lost the last two months because I drowned in my own despair like a complete loser. And I lost the only girl who ever mattered because I was afraid being with me would destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now I realize how truly lost I am without her. She has become my story…and even though she acts like she’s moved on, I know she still thinks about me just as much as I think about her. She’s beautiful, sweet—and so damn vulnerable, all I want to do is help her. Be there for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love her…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only I could convince Fable to give me a second chance. Then I wouldn’t feel so lost anymore, and neither would she. We could be found together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Breakout New Adult sensation Monica Murphy returns with a hot new contemporary romance—a heartfelt story of second chances, forgiveness, and redemption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commitment.&lt;/em&gt; That’s what I really want from Colin. Ever since my brother, Danny, died in Iraq, Colin’s done so much to help me, including giving me a job at his popular restaurant so I can leave my crappy waitressing job at the strip joint. But lying in bed with him every night to comfort him from his horrible nightmares isn’t enough anymore. I know he feels guilty about Danny’s death, about not going to Iraq, but I can’t keep living this double life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love him desperately, but he’s got so many demons, and if he can’t open up to me now, then he’ll never be the real partner I need him to be. I gave him a month, and now I’m out of here. If he truly loves me like he says, he knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>New Adult Contemporary Romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Mature situations and sexual content recommended for ages 17+**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Temporary. That one single word best describes my life these last few years. I’m working at a temporary job until I can finally break free. I’m my little brother’s temporary mother since our mom doesn’t give a crap about either of us. And I’m that temporary girl all the guys want to get with because I give it up so easily. According to the rumors, at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now I’m the temporary girlfriend of Drew Callahan, college football legend and all around golden guy. He’s beautiful, sweet—and he’s hiding way more secrets than I am. He’s brought me into this fake life where everyone seems to hate me. And everyone seems to want something from him. The only thing he seems to want though is…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t know what to believe anymore. All I know is, I think Drew needs me. And I want to be there for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>Natalie Sullivan is on the verge of a breakthrough most archaeology grad students only dream of: discovering a lost city. Her research points to a farm in Ireland, but to excavate she needs permission from the new owner: the Michael O'Connor, popular NFL running back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On TV Mike seems so charming and good-natured that Natalie figures getting his cooperation will be a breeze. So she's not prepared to deal with the arrogant—and adamantly opposed—man she meets in person. Or the way one look from him sends shivers down her spine…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined to kick-start her career, Natalie travels across the Atlantic and finds herself sharing an inn with Mike, who has come to Ireland in search of his roots. She tells herself her interest is strictly professional, but the more she gets to know him, the harder it is to deny her personal attraction to the sexy sports star. And when Mike confides why he refuses to allow the dig, Natalie must decide if she can follow her heart without losing sight of her dreams.</description>

  <description>Secrets and lies. They are everywhere: haunting her, tormenting her. In the midst of it all, he’d been her escape, her passion. The only person she’d trusted in six years. And then he’d made her doubt that trust, cutting her deeply. But as she’d once told him, she was damaged, not broken. She is ready to fight and not just for survival. She is fighting for the truth and she won’t stop until she has it, not even for…him.</description>

  <description>(Author note: This is NOT a dark romance.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delilah “Lily” Flynn is used to her drab existence. Lily’s been living it for twenty two years. &lt;br&gt;Her boring life is suddenly turned on its head when she’s rudely kidnapped from her bedroom.&lt;br&gt;Or so she thinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nox Taylor is far too high up in his field to be assigned a babysitting job. &lt;br&gt;There’s nothing more he wants than to complete his mission so he can be rid of the smartass tomboy, Lily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day after day, Nox watches Lily and her strange ways. She’s unlike any woman he’s ever met. &lt;br&gt;Getting close to the girl is purely for her own protection…right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily never imagined she’d make her first real friends in captivity. &lt;br&gt;What lengths would she go through to keep them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This is a stand alone novel and is unrelated to Friend-Zoned**</description>

  <description>In this first installment of the exciting new psychosexual thriller, The Flesh Cartel, orphaned brothers Mat and Dougie Carmichael are stolen in the night from their own home. Taken to a horrifying processing facility, they are assessed, microchipped, and subjected to unspeakable brutality—all in preparation for sale to the highest bidder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world where every person has a price, the beautiful and subduable PhD student Dougie is highly prized. His brother, a rough-edged MMA fighter, is less desirable—and potentially too dangerous—but he still has his own appeal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abused and locked up under round the clock surveillance, with no idea where they are or even why they’ve been taken, escape seems impossible, which leaves staying together their only hope. And after being separated once by the foster system, they'll do anything to keep it from happening again. Anything at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Publisher's note: This title contains material some may find objectionable or trigger-inducing, including explicit violence, non-consent, and forced incest.)</description>

  <description>When it comes to love, she's a professional skeptic. Is it too late for a career change?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there's one thing Georgiana Down is an expert in, it's bad relationships. That's what inspired her blog, Down on Love, where she gives snarky advice--usually along the lines of "dump him." In fact, George is abstaining from men all together. At least that's the plan--until she makes a trip back to her tiny hometown in the Catskills, where meddling is an art form. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;George loves helping out with her new baby niece, but she's counting the days until she returns to Boston. Then she runs into Casey Bowen, her high school crush. The boy she once loved is now a handsome grown man--and suddenly George needs a little advice of her own. She's in the right place, because when she drunk posts on her blog, everyone in Marsden has something to say about George and Casey. It's like high school all over again--but maybe this time she'll get things right. . .</description>

  <description>She was meant to be his destruction…&lt;br&gt;A pawn played in a perilous game between father and son…&lt;br&gt;Yet, her strength was more than either man could imagine. &lt;br&gt;As Maddy learns to save herself… &lt;br&gt;She becomes the one thing that could set the son free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Madeleine Clark was raised to become a concert cellist. Sheltered and naïve, she remains hidden behind her music, a protection from the world around her.  On the night of her first solo performance, Maddy accepts the admiration of a stranger and finds herself captive in a cruel and twisted power struggle between a sadistic father and his son, Aaron.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Seemingly dangerous and uncaring, Aaron manages the business operations of his father’s estate.  Wanting nothing to do with the slaves kept at the Estate, Aaron refuses to take part in the deeper depravities of his father.  Despite his resistance, Aaron’s father ‘gifts’ him with a petite, brunette woman he can’t refuse.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     A bond forged in conspiracy and deceit, Aaron struggles to save Maddy by teaching her to survive in the world in which he’d been raised.  An unlikely union, Aaron soon learns that great strengths can exist within small packages, while Madeleine learns that love and light can exist in the darkest of places.</description>

  <description>An old flame rekindled . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zara Cinders always knew Ham Reece was the one, but he wasn't interested in settling down. When she found someone who was, Ham walked out of her life. Three years later, Zara's lost her business, her marriage, and she's barely getting by in a tiny apartment on the wrong side of the tracks. As soon as Ham hears about Zara's plight, he's on her doorstep offering her a lifeline. Now, it will take every ounce of will power she possesses to resist all that he offers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ham was always a traveling man, never one to settle down in one town, with one woman, for more time than absolutely necessary. But Ham's faced his own demons, and he's learned a lot. About himself, and about the life he knows he's meant to live. So when he hears that Zara's having a rough time, he wants to be the one to help. In fact, he wants to do more than that for Zara. A lot more. But first, he must prove to Zara that he's a changed man.</description>

  <description>Savanna Christy, a pastor’s daughter, is on a rebellion. Once her Dad told her the Bible warns of opening doors that shouldn’t be opened. She’s become obsessed with finding out if those doors are just as invisible as the God she’s been raised to know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, during another thrill-seeking adventure, Savanna and her friends Amy and Lucky, head thirty minutes out of their small town of Tonopah, to check out the Goldfield Hotel, known to be one of the most highly active places for paranormal activity in the nation. Together the three of them break in, hoping to open one of the doors the Bible speaks of, and in the middle of a satanic séance the three of them are dragged to various places of the hotel. But when the door shuts before Savanna’s cornered, something saves her. As footsteps slowly make their way to where Savanna is under a window, she reaches out her hand. Daniel, an entity who’s been locked away between space and time, becomes just as visible as Savanna. And her energy can give him life again, only when they touch (which triggers an addiction).</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Lessons in Laughing Out Loud&lt;/em&gt; comes a moving and heartwarming novel about a woman who escapes an abusive relationship and flees with her young daughter in search of a kind stranger she met many years earlier.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remembering the letter that says, “&lt;em&gt;You are a remarkable woman and you deserve all the happiness, contentment, and love in the world. I, for one, know that I have never met anyone quite like you,” &lt;/em&gt;Rose Pritchard turns up on the doorstep of a B&amp;amp;B in England’s lake district. It is her last resort, as she and her seven-year-old daughter Maddie have left everything behind. They have come to the village of Millthwaite in search of the person who once offered Rose hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost immediately Rose wonders if she’s made a terrible mistake—if she’s chasing a dream—but she knows in her heart that she cannot go back. She’s been given a second chance—at life, and love—but will she have the courage to take it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blending wit, insight, and emotion with a sensitive touch and a warm dose of humor, Rowan Cowan has crafted a poignant novel that will linger with you long after the final page has been turned.</description>

  <description>Scarlett Spencer's life is a mess. Her lemon of a marriage has just imploded and she is headed to Beverly Hills, toddler in tow, to move in with her highly over-sexed mother, CeCe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having to move in with her mother at the ripe old age of thirty-five seems to loudly announce her failure as an adult. Scarlett is keenly aware that she is paying the price for her history of poor choices in men - and so is her young son, Oliver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living in cramped quarters with one's mother is not without its challenges - even in Beverly Hills. Living amongst the rich and beautiful can really highlight your own perceived shortcomings and Scarlett has never felt more of a failure. Finding employment again after being a stay-at-home mother isn't easy, as she struggles to put together pieces of a puzzle that never quite fit before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scarlett's mother CeCe is wildly successful in the men department and has more dates than any woman half her age. CeCe has been married three times, so leaving husbands is a subject she knows something about. She counsel Scarlett that "Husbands are left by putting one foot in front of the other, and never looking back." Of course, the difference is that CeCe usually has the next man waiting in the wings...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After much prodding from CeCe, Scarlett wades back into the Hollywood dating pool - this time as a single mom- and finds that all the rules have changed.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note: This is an alternate cover edition, asin:B00AUV1R42&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years before Trip Wiley could be seen on movie screens all over the world, he could be seen sitting in the desk behind me in my high school English class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was back in 1990, and I cite the year only to avoid dumbfounding you when references to big hair or stretch pants are mentioned. Although, come to think of it, I am from New Jersey, which may serve as explanation enough. We were teenagers then, way back in a time before anyone could even dream he’d turn into the Hollywood commodity that he is today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case you live under a rock and don't know who Trip Wiley is, just know that these days, he’s the actor found at the top of every casting director’s wish list. He’s incredibly talented and insanely gorgeous, the combination of which has made him very rich, very famous and very desirable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And not just to casting directors, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can’t confirm any of the gossip from his early years out in Tinseltown, but based on what I knew of his life before he was famous, I can tell you that the idea of Girls-Throwing-Themselves-At-Trip is not a new concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should know. I was one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And my life hasn’t been the same since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Remember When is the first book in an NA romantic comedy trilogy, but there is NO CLIFFHANGER. It is intended for mature teen readers and immature adult ones due to some high school sex scenes, underage drinking, questionable language and 1980s flashbacks.**</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The rules are clear—until they're broken. Lauren Layne puts a New Adult spin on Pygmalion, also the inspiration for Pretty Woman, and gives the classic love story its edgiest twist yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Who knew that pretending you're not falling for someone would be so much more difficult than pretending that you are?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephanie Kendrick gave up her whole summer to ace her NYU film school screenwriting course, so she's pissed to be stuck with a preppy, spoiled frat boy as her writing partner. Then again, with her piercings, black-rimmed eyes, and Goth wardrobe, Stephanie isn't exactly Ethan Price's type, either. He's probably got his eye on some leggy blonde with a trust fund... or does he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the summer scene kicks off in the Hamptons, Ethan is desperate to make his snobbish mother forget the pedigreed girl who broke his heart. While Stephanie's a stretch as a decoy, the right makeover and a pastel cardigan just might do the trick. She may not love the idea of playing Ethan's brainless Barbie girlfriend, but the free rent and luxurious digs make a tempting offer. So does the promise of a ready-made screenplay idea inspired by their charade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Stephanie steps into Ethan's privileged world, the "acting" begins to feel all too real. The kissing and touching that were intended to fool the Hamptons crowd wind up manipulating "them." And Stephanie faces a question she's too afraid to ask: Is Ethan falling for the real her or for the dolled-up princess he wants to see?</description>

  <description>She forgot how to hate, and now she’s learning how to love...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brain-damaged Nia Beaudine can’t remember her life before The Accident. Someone intentionally ran over her and left her for dead. Now she’s living in the ‘witch’s house’ she inherited in the village of Miracle, relearning how to live on her own. Well, almost on her own – the talking cat helping her cope is a bonus. But when a hate-filled family member shows up with a gun, Nia knows she needs real help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Army Sergeant and PTSD sufferer Rob Ackerman regularly covers for his identical twin, the village constable, and answers Nia’s emergency call. This strange young woman immediately sees he’s not his brother. In return, he sees that the only way she can fully live in her new life is to find out why someone in her old life tried to kill her...and might try again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they dig up Nia’s past, the attraction between them grows. Their brains may be damaged, but their bodies and hearts are working just fine.</description>

  <description>Korinne Anders had it all. She had the perfect job, the perfect house, and the perfect husband. When tragedy strikes, her world takes a devastating turn. Six months after losing her husband to a car accident, Korinne vows it to herself never to love again. If she doesn’t allow another man in her heart, then there’s no reason for her to feel the pain of loss. This plan seems to work, but is put to the test when Korinne’s best friend can’t stand to see her suffering any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Korinne’s long-time friend, Jenna Perry, has an idea and it involves helping her friend find the spark of life in her soul no matter what it takes. Korinne didn’t know that Jenna’s plan meant bringing back a past love, a second chance with the man that Korinne had to leave in college, but always kept a place for in her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Galen Matthews learns of Korinne’s loss and that she’s finally moved back home, he wants nothing more than to be there for her. The love he felt for Korinne years ago has never left him, and now he’s given a second chance to not only mend her heart of her loss, but to also continue the love they shared in the past. Will his love and determination make her strong enough to give fate a second chance, or will her fear of losing another love make her run away?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What will Korinne do when she’s faced with a love so powerful that no matter what she does there’s nowhere to run from it?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;We’d both gone missing at one point, but Claire had one thing I didn’t. Someone to notice. So why was I the one still here and she the one still gone?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen year old Megan Smith has spent the past year working in a small town diner in the middle of nowhere. Life is quiet, simple, &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;. Then comes the news that her look-a-like has gone missing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still damaged both physically and mentally, Megan's not looking to be noticed. Wherever she goes from here, it's a road she needs to take alone. But when Nickolas Ellis takes the job as the new nightshift cook, it scares her how easily her defenses crumble down, down, down for him. But there are secrets she can't bear to share with just anyone, unspeakable acts that continue to haunt, and when the similarities of Claire’s abduction couples with the fear of an unwanted visitor in town, the urge to run before it all happens again intensifies, threatening the only happiness Megan's ever found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Romantic Suspense / Dark Realistic Fiction&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended for 17+ for mature and &lt;u&gt;disturbing situations&lt;/u&gt;, language and &lt;u&gt;sexual content&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>**Please note that this story-line contains violence and some non-consensual sexual activity. This includes reference and some in depth discussion/imagery of battery, under-age sexual references, rape, torture and murder. This is not an exclusive list - You have been warned**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I looked at the man in front of me, he didn't look scary or threatening, to anyone else he looked harmless. He had a wide white smile that could make any girl melt, he had shaggy long blonde hair and innocent baby blue eyes. His Australian accent added to his worldly charm. He looked like a sweet and kind surfer but with a jaw gripped tight that showed anger. I looked down at the blade gripped in his palm and the blood dripping from the edges. His face read that of almost sorrow, but only almost. I looked at the floor, my voice lost in a scream. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I looked down at her soft cheeks, her auburn hair and her still green eyes. She wasn't blinking, she wasn't breathing. I saw the crimson red spread from her cut throat all over the Italian marble floor. It seeped into the cracks. This girl, this fifteen year old girl with blood staining her favourite floral dress... She couldn't be my sister, I wouldn't believe it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I foolishly thought this would be the worst day of my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was the day I was taken, that was the day I met Draco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can be read as a standalone alternatively - part 1 of 3.</description>

  <description>A couture wedding dress designer to the rich and famous, Lexi LaCroix’s image means everything. But crossing paths with a sexier-than-sin, bad-boy biker makes Lexi realize how much living she’s sacrificed for her success and one touch is all it takes to threaten her carefully choreographed life. When that touch fills far more than just Lexi’s physical needs, she finds herself torn between the career she needs and the bad-boy she craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jax Chamberlin gave up the superficial life of acting for the thrill of running his own stunt company years ago. But a recent betrayal proves he’s still too close to the limelight to find a woman who doesn’t plan to use him as a stepping-stone to success. When the charming and mysterious Lexi offers him a totally anonymous hook-up during an out of town trip, Jax accepts. Only Lexi is more sextacular than charming, and Jax wants more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lexi’s got a major hang-up over his renegade lifestyle, and Jax isn’t willing to change his ways. Especially not when he discovers who she really is. Because if she finds out his connections could catapult her to the top of her career, he’s afraid the fantasy woman he’s falling for might just end up like all the other gold-diggers. And this time, it’s not just his bad-boy reputation at risk, but his heart, too.</description>

At school, Brian suffers even more torment, delivered by bullies who seem to enjoy making his life miserable. The only bright spot in Brian's life is Carly, the girl on whom he's had a crush for years. As his relationship with her evolves, so do the problems at home and the confrontations at school.

  <description>An explosive, erotic novel about two sisters, each of whom embarks upon a voyage into the heart of evil and a game with a seductive man who knows no rules or limits. Only one returns.  Successful, attractive, and in control, Nora seemed so different from her shy, terribly vulnerable younger sister. Grieving for Franny, Nora reads her diary and is stunned when it reveals a secret sadomasochistic affair with a mysterious professor known only as M. Nora vows to seek justice for the sister she never really knew and undertakes a daring scheme to seduce this lethal and manipulative man in the hope of uncovering information about the murder. Instead, she finds herself in thrall to his bizarre sexual magnetism, trapped in a passion so dark and perverse, and yet so compelling, that she is willing to risk her life. And she is in danger, although it may be from someone much closer to her than M., someone so close she might not see it until it is too late.  With an ending as startling as it is haunting, Topping From Below is unlike any novel you’re ever read. Ever.</description>

      <![CDATA[The first thing I have to comment on, is that I wasn't appalled by the book in the least.  The author may have gone outside the box a bit with the BDSM but I think it was needed in order to build up the immorality of M.

  <description>’Tis the season for romance, second chances, and Christmas cheer with this new novel from Debbie Macomber.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Carrie Slayton, a big-city society-page columnist, longs to write more serious news stories. So her editor hands her a challenge: She can cover any topic she wants, but only if she first scores the paper an interview with Finn Dalton, the notoriously reclusive author. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Living in the remote Alaskan wilderness, Finn has written a mega-bestselling memoir about surviving in the wild. But he stubbornly declines to speak to anyone in the press, and no one even knows exactly where he lives.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Digging deep into Finn’s past, Carrie develops a theory on his whereabouts. It is the holidays, but her career is at stake, so she forsakes her family celebrations and flies out to snowy Alaska. When she finally finds Finn, she discovers a man both more charismatic and more stubborn than she even expected. And soon she is torn between pursuing the story of a lifetime and following her heart.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Filled with all the comforts and joys of Christmastime, &lt;em&gt;Starry Night&lt;/em&gt; is a delightful novel of finding happiness in the most surprising places.</description>

  <description>Delilah Palmer has control of her life and outward personality, blocking the truth just below the surface. A façade meant to be normal and hide the scars of her childhood. She’s made a good life for herself, became a lawyer, and is free from the tortured past that haunts her daily. Until he comes along and breaks open the cracks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Thorne has a past of his own. On the surface he is loved by all, personable, extroverted; everything Delilah isn’t. Hidden beneath is a dark and tormented man that only Delilah has to power to unveil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crammed in a small office together they see through each other’s masks, and the draw becomes too much, igniting an explosive relationship. Holloway and Holloway Law has a strict non-fraternization policy, forcing them to conceal their breach. Despite their efforts, separation becomes impossible, deceptions escalate, and Nathan has trouble coping; teetering on the edge of being overtaken by his past demons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What secrets does he harbor that could keep him from giving in? What keeps him from healing and moving forward? And Delilah, where does she fit into all this turmoil?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they accept love and deal with all the trials that come their way when secrets are exposed? Or will they fall through the cracks of their pasts and be consumed by all that haunts them?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;WICKED above her hipbone, GIRL across her heart&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Words are like a road map to reporter Camille Preaker’s troubled past. Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, Camille’s first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;NASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her family’s Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;HARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With its taut, crafted writing, &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/em&gt; is addictive, haunting, and unforgettable.</description>

  <description>~SKALS Book #2~&lt;br&gt;Revenge is a very personal thing…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After eliminating a hostile SKALS member turned rouge, Sebastian returns home to deal with the aftermath. He no longer trusts his security team, and to make matters worse, he’s got blood on his hands he can’t wash clean. Still, he is determined to try and put an end to the past and start a new life with Taylor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything in him wants to be the man she needs him to be, but that decision won’t come easy. His family is in shambles, his director is breathing down his neck, and worse of all, Steven Laychee is circling, looking for a way to take down the man who killed his brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not a matter of if Laychee will strike. It’s a question of when and who will remain standing in the end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT your average romance. It's a dark, gritty, sometimes erotic psychological thriller with a heavy emphasis on plot. It also contains elements of dominance and discipline with dubious consent, psychological conditioning, and mental manipulation. There’s also gunfire and violence. If any of this offends you, this may not be the book for you. Intended for mature audiences only.</description>

  <description>After a chance encounter in the woods leaves her shaken and reeling, the last thing Taylor McAvay wanted to do was accept an invitation to dinner. Then again, after seeing what Sebastian Baas was capable of, she felt she had little choice. The guy did just save her life, and the feel of his partner’s assault rifle pressed against her cheek still lingered in her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she discovers surprises her. Beneath the armor and fatigues, is a smart, attentive, and sophisticated man. Unable to resist, Taylor finds herself drawn in by the Special Agent’s charm. Everything about Sebastian, from his imposing presence to his hypnotic eyes, pulls her under his spell. When a drive by shooting leaves her apartment riddled with bullets, she falls under his command as well—not to mention the shadow of a lethal, underground organization known as SKALS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her lover has a dark and dangerous side he tries to keep hidden, but when a series of events sends their lives spiraling out of control, she realizes there is much more to him than meets the eye. Whether she wants to leave or not doesn't matter. Taylor soon learns, when it comes to Sebastian and SKALS, there is no escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT your average romance. It's not a feel good story. It's a dark, gritty, sometimes erotic psychological thriller with a heavy emphasis on plot. It also contains elements of dominance and discipline with dubious consent, psychological conditioning, and mental manipulation. There’s also gunfire and violence. If any of this offends you, this may not be the book for you.</description>

  <description>*new adult romance*&lt;br&gt;**explicit scenes and language**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t care what my cousin says; I am not the queen of impossible relationships. I mean, just because my last boyfriend tried to kill me and left a bit of a scar on my neck, then forced me to move across the country and legally change my name to Reese Randall to escape him, does not mean—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Oh, who am I kidding? For a freshman in college, I have to have the worst dating track record ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It’s no wonder love is the last thing on my mind when Mason Lowe enters my life. But the chemistry between us is like bam! Our connection defies logic. And he’s just so freaking hot. Being around him makes me feel more alive than I’ve ever felt before. I even like bickering with him. He could be my soul mate...except for one teeny tiny glitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's a gigolo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boy, do I know how to pick them.</description>

  <description>Nineteen-year-old Cheyenne tries to portray the perfect life to mask the memories of her past. Walking in on her boyfriend with another woman her freshman year in college threatens that picture of perfection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-one-year-old Colt never wanted college and never expected to amount to anything, but when his mom's dying wish is for him to get his degree, he has no choice but to pretend it's what he wants too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheyenne needs a fake boyfriend to get back at her ex and Colt needs cash to take care of his mom, so they strike a deal that helps them both. But what if Cheyenne’s past isn’t what she thought? Soon they’re trading one charade for another—losing themselves in each other to forget about their pain. The more they play their game, the more it becomes the only thing they have that feels real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Cheyenne and Colt know life is never easy, but neither of them expect the tragedy that threatens to end their charade and rip them apart forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A standalone contemporary romance novel about love, hate, cruelty and forgiveness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her name is Lana. She wasn’t dealt the easiest cards in life. She wasn’t dealt the hardest. She has an illness, but she doesn’t let it rule her. The first time she laid eyes on her best friend’s twin brother she fell in love at first sight. It didn’t last very long. He was a hateful boy who made her miserable. The happiest day of her life was when he moved away to London six years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Robert. He breaks the ones who love him. He’s always liked to play games with Lana, see how far he could push her. He once thrived on her pain, but no more. Now she’s coming to London to live with his sister for the summer and this time he plans on being her friend instead of her tormentor. But Lana is scarred by his past bullying. She doesn’t trust him, nor does she have any reason to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the two find themselves living under the same roof, they call a truce. This summer will change both of their lives, as they put their history aside and learn one another from scratch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fear takes over, we use cruelty as a mask. Robert and Lana’s story will see their masks slip away as the love they felt on the inside shows its true face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Not suitable for younger readers. Contains strong language and scenes of a sexual nature.**</description>

  <description>Four decades after it first shook the nation, then the world, William Peter Blatty's thrilling masterwork of faith and demonic possession returns in an even more powerful form. Raw and profane, shocking and blood-chilling, it remains a modern parable of good and evil and perhaps the most terrifying novel ever written.</description>

  <description>Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has since become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the "Secret Annexe" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.</description>

  <description>The story follows the exploits of seven children as they are terrorized by an eponymous being, which exploits the fears and phobias of its victims in order to disguise itself while hunting its prey. "It" primarily appears in the form of a clown in order to attract its preferred prey of young children. The novel is told through narratives alternating between two time periods, and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. It deals with themes which would eventually become King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma, and the ugliness lurking behind a façade of traditional small-town values.</description>

  <description>I can’t remember the last time I felt completely safe. Security seemed more like a luxury to me, reserved for those who were fortunate enough to have picture perfect childhoods. For those who didn’t bear the ugly scars that keep me bound in constant, debilitating fear. I’ve run from that fear my entire life. But when I met him, for once, I couldn’t run anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He scared the hell out of me in a way that excited every fiber of my being. It wasn’t the tattoos or the piercings. It wasn’t the warmth that seemed to radiate from his frame and blanket me whenever he was near. It was just…him. The scary beautiful man that threatened to alter 23 years of routine and rituals, and make me face my crippling fear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Kami and I am constantly afraid. And the thing that scares me the most is the very thing I want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Don’t worry,” he smiled, pulling me into the hard warmth of his chest. “I’ve got you. I’ll always catch you when you fall.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And just like that, Blaine had staked his claim on the untouched part of me that no living soul had ever moved. He had captured every fear, every reservation, and crushed them in the palm of his inked hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Disclaimer: Abuse is real- verbal, emotional, physical and sexual. It takes place all around us; it doesn’t discriminate against race or gender, wealth or poverty. It affects us all- those of us who’ve had to live through it, or watch it happen, even those of us who’ve only heard about it. We are all affected. We are all forever changed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not a story for the faint of heart; this is the story of one woman’s very real struggle through a world against her, the people who hurt her, her real life demons and the people who showed her that every gray sky, no matter how dark, has a sun waiting to break through.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***Inspired by true events***&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Morgan starts her life in a bad situation, she doesn't really know what she wants out of life. She's never had anyone to look up to or help guide her in the right direction. She had it rough and never dreamed that it could get worse. However, she finds that it can and it does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She learns what real hell is when she meets the husband that she doesn't want to marry but isn't given a choice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she escape? She can and does, only to wake up and find herself right back at square one.&lt;br&gt;_____________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning! This is not your everyday fall in love romance. This book contains disturbing situations,  strong language, graphic, sexual content - some forced, some not. If it's a happily ever after love story that you are looking for, you should probably move on. If you are up for the ride, stick around and it may just turn into a love story after all.</description>

  <description>A childhood crush who moved away. An adult love that shattered her world. Twenty-seven year old Mackenzie Tillson hasn’t been living for quite some time, rather, just existing. Life is passing her by and even with the love of her friends and family she can’t quite seem to snap out of the disconnected bubble she has created around her. Moving day by day as a shell of a person who once knew what it meant to live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until one day, the boy who first had her heart comes back. With a vengeance...Drew Dean has been apart from the girl he loved all of those years ago for far too long and now that fate has provided them with a second chance, he will make it clear to her that she is, and always has been the one for him. But what Drew discovers in the process, is Mackenzie may just end up being completely unreachable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it possible to get through to someone who has no intentions of ever letting anyone in again? Can a person find their way through the darkness and emptiness they've created? For Mackenzie, trudging along in life alone is where she feels she deserves to be. But will she find it in her to fight and break the barrier of the internal distorted view she has of herself? Or will she let everyone and everything slip away?&lt;br&gt;As Mackenzie tries to piece together the remnants of her shattered existence, she inadvertently discovers life, love and loss are one in the same. A hopeful journey to be taken with an ending to fill the emptiness she's carried for too long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book contains adult situations and some explicit language.*</description>

  <description>As the captain of a schooner catering to the elite on the Caribbean Seas, Sebastian Stark does his best to avoid any human encounters.  Interacting with people isn’t his thing, and he prefers the company of a bottle of vodka, a shot glass, and maybe a whore.  There’s no doubt he’s hiding from a checkered past, but he does well keeping everything to himself…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…until the night his schooner capsizes, and he’s stuck on a life raft with one of the passengers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raine’s young, she’s cute, and Bastian would probably be into her if he wasn’t suffering from alcohol withdrawal. As the days pass, DTs, starvation, and dehydration become the norm.  Even the most closed person starts to open up when he thinks he’s going to die, but when she realizes their traumatic pasts are connected, it’s no longer the elements that have Bastian concerned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has no idea how he’s going to Survive Raine.</description>

  <description>Dying is what changed Mary O’Reilly’s life. Well, actually, coming back from the dead and having the ability to communicate with ghosts is really what did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, a private investigator in rural Freeport, Illinois, Mary’s trying to learn how to incorporate her experience as a Chicago cop and new-found talent into a real job. Her challenge is to solve the mysteries, get real evidence (a ghost’s word just doesn’t hold up in court), and be sure the folks in town, especially the handsome new police chief, doesn’t think she’s nuts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-four years ago, a young woman drowned in the swimming pool of a newly elected State Senator. It was ruled an accident. But now, as the Senator prepares to move on to higher positions, the ghost of the woman is appearing to the Senator’s wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary is hired to discover the truth behind the death. She unearths a connection between the murder and the disappearance of five little girls whose cases, twenty-four years later, are still all unsolved. As she digs further she becomes the next target for serial killers’ quest to tie up all his loose ends.</description>

  <description>Black Friday - the official opening of the Holiday Shopping Season and Patrice Marcum is stuck in the middle of her local superstore with a crying infant, a near hysterical desire to just abandon the diapers and milk she desperately needs, and the snowstorm of the century dumping a half-foot of snow on the parking lot outside. She needs a miracle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The little old lady seemed sweet, but there was no way Patrice was going to leave three-month old Jeremy with a stranger. She looked outside at the snow-covered parking lot and saw yet another distressed shopper’s cart topple over in the drifts. The old lady sensed her distress and volunteered to call a store employee to help watch over Jeremy while Patrice got her car. The older gentleman, wearing a store badge with the name “Ron,” seemed too good to be true. What could be safer?&lt;br&gt;Less than five minutes later, after brushing the snow off the van and driving across the crowded and snow-packed parking lot, Patrice pulls up in front of the store. Jeremy is not there. Pushing back panic, she rushes into the store and looks around. Jeremy is not inside either. She pushes through the line at Customer Service, the associate calls Ron on the intercom, and issues a Code Adam. When Ron appears and he’s only seventeen years old, Patrice realizes the worst. “Oh God! They’ve taken my baby!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary O’Reilly, Private Investigator, is decorating her office for the holiday season when the newly installed bell over her door jingles. She looks over to see a six year-old boy standing next to her desk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His name is Joey Marcum and he wants to hire Mary to find his baby brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary nodded. “Okay, Joey, but I’ll want to work with the police on this one. Do you have any problems with that?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joey paused. “No, I guess you can talk to them.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“That’ll be helpful.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“But you can’t tell my mom you’re working for me,” he said, “Promise?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Yes, I promise.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joey shrugged. “I don’t think she’d understand, seeing that I’m dead, you know.”</description>

  <description>When Samantha Ricketts finds herself placed in a town half-way across the country, her only worry is how did she get there, but when her life is saved by a handsome and mysterious man, the connection they feel is almost more than she can stand. Zander Smith was only acting on his instincts and training when he moved the dark-haired woman to safety but what he got from his heroics wasn't the distressed woman he had thought he was helping but a fireball of fury that sparked a storm within himself. Together they tap into the supernatural to uncover the mysteries surrounding the strange town they were slowly growing fond of before they became part of its history.</description>

  <description>Adelaide Carmichael knows that she's lost her mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's aware that she's being sent to The Oakhill Institution, but she's been told that she's being sent there to get better. She's been told that the staff is there to help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it doesn't take Adelaide long to discover that she was very, very wrong about The Oakhill Institution. Patients roam the halls like zombies. Electric currents vibrate through the plaster walls. Patients are fed sedatives like mashed potatoes and now Adelaide knows one thing for sure, she wants out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she'll do whatever she can to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpt~&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I used to climb the giant willow tree in my back yard. It was like a game for me and mommy because she'd always come looking for me. The funny thing is that she always knew where I was but she played along anyway. I was perched above her head in the tree, trying to contain my laughter and she was below, her forearm positioned against her forehead. She squinted out into the field full of yellowed, dead grass. Then she said, “Little bird! Where did you fly to?”&lt;br&gt;The orderlies’ footsteps thunder in my ears and sound off in sync with my hammering heartbeat.&lt;br&gt;I've never pushed myself so hard in my entire life. I'm winded. Starting to feel exhausted. &lt;br&gt;Don't stop now.&lt;br&gt;Don't stop now. &lt;br&gt;It's just a few more feet.&lt;br&gt;I am almost there.&lt;br&gt;I feel the orderlies’ breath down the back of my neck and feel the tug as his fingertips grasp the edge of my hospital gown. I wrench away though, finding a second wind when I'm at the edge of the forest. &lt;br&gt;Busting through the thicket at the entrance to the forest, I hear Aurora's frantic shouts in my head.&lt;br&gt;Run, Adelaide! Run!&lt;br&gt;The sound of her voice is the only thing that keeps me going. Knowing that she wanted me to escape, and get out even if she couldn't is the only thing keeping the burning sensation inside of my lungs from spreading and dousing the rest of my body in flames.&lt;br&gt;Run, Adelaide! Run!&lt;br&gt;I will run, Aurora, I will.&lt;br&gt;I will run for you.&lt;br&gt;And me. &lt;br&gt;I won't stop.&lt;br&gt;I promise.&lt;br&gt;I'll keep going just like you wanted me to.&lt;br&gt;I'll keep running until I can't anymore.</description>

  <description>For nine years, they drift through life, unable to forget the one who holds the strings to their hearts. In an attempt to escape the pain of her past, Melanie finds herself trapped in a loveless marriage, while Daniel loses himself in a career that means nothing without Melanie by his side. Now, when their lives intersect, neither can deny the connection they felt so long ago. But will the power that drew them together be enough to heal the wounds from their past, and do they have the courage to overcome the insecurities and fears that threaten to keep them apart? Pulled is a story of attraction and separation, of destiny and duty, of a love so strong it refuses to give up even when all others have.</description>

  <description>The truth is out there...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dex-Files is a compilation novel that accompanies the Experiment in Terror Series and is not to be-read as a stand-alone. In the Dex-Files we find a variety of scenes and chapters from the enigmatic Dex Foray's POV from books #1-6 in the series. Some of these scenes have been previously published, albeit from Perry's POV, while other scenes are completely new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to it not being a stand-alone, the novel also contains some major spoilers and should be read only by those who have read all the published books in the series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Darkhouse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Lighthouse Meeting&lt;br&gt;*Pie Scene&lt;br&gt;*Jenn and Dex&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Red Fox &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Bar Scene - extended&lt;br&gt;*Playing Nurse&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book #3 - Dead Sky Morning&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Strippers&lt;br&gt;*Truth or Dare&lt;br&gt;*Tent Scene&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book #4 - Lying Season&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*The Big Question&lt;br&gt;*The Xmas Party&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book #5 - On Demon Wings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*A Phone Call&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book #6 - Into the Hollow&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Bailout</description>

  <description>With Book Two of the Experiment in Terror Series, Perry Palomino and Dex Foray trade in the stormy Oregon coast for the unforgiving deserts of New Mexico. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the for­got­ten town of Red Fox, New Mex­ico, a Navajo cou­ple is tor­tured by things unseen and by motives unknown. Wild ani­mals slink through their house in the dark, a bar­rage of stones pound their roof nightly, and muti­lated sheep car­casses are turn­ing up on their prop­erty. Armed with a cam­era and just enough to go on, Perry and Dex travel to the des­o­late locale, hop­ing to film the super­nat­ural occur­rences and add cred­i­bil­ity to their flail­ing web­cast. Only their show has a lot more work­ing against them than just grow­ing pains. Tested by dubi­ous ranch hands, a ghost from Dex’s past, and shapeshift­ing decep­tion, the ama­teur ghost hunters must learn to trust each other in order to fight the most ancient of myths…or die trying.</description>

  <description>There’s always been something a bit off about Perry Palomino. Though she’s been dealing with a quarter-life crisis and post-college syndrome like any other twentysomething, she’s still not what you would call “ordinary.” For one thing, there’s her past which she likes to pretend never happened, and then there’s the fact that she sees ghosts. Luckily for her, that all comes in handy when she stumbles across Dex Foray, an eccentric producer for an upcoming webcast on ghost hunters. Even though the show’s budget is non-existent and Dex himself is a maddening enigma, Perry is instantly drawn into a world that both threatens her life and seduces her with a sense of importance. Her uncle’s haunted lighthouse provides the perfect catalyst and backdrop for a horrific mystery that unravels the threads of Perry’s fragile sanity and causes her to fall for a man, who, like the most dangerous of ghosts, may not be all that he seems.</description>

  <description>Waking up in Vegas was never meant to be like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evelyn Thomas’s plans for celebrating her twenty-first birthday in Las Vegas were big. Huge. But she sure as hell never meant to wake up on the bathroom floor with a hangover to rival the black plague, a very attractive half-naked tattooed man, and a diamond on her finger large enough to scare King Kong. Now if she could just remember how it all happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing is for certain, being married to rock and roll’s favourite son is sure to be a wild ride.</description>

  <description>Is love an infection or is it a sick addiction, when there's nowhere left to run?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse has a curious attraction to Charlie, a hostess at the restaurant where he works. Outwardly he’s rude, awkward and unapproachable. But his sudden bursts of charm are inescapable. A devastating childhood filled with physical and emotional abuse have left him complex and frigid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie, an innocent, is quickly mystified. Her craving for him generates an infatuation and a purpose. Losing weight and gaining confidence, she begins taking more risks. She defies her past, damaged and tender, in order to move ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If nobody makes the first move then nobody gets hurt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their journeys take them down parallel paths which leave them just as emotionally unmatched and conflicted as the day they met. As the story progresses the viewpoints change, giving the reader an insight to the character’s thoughts and feelings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Psychological Fiction, Contemporary Romance, Women's Fiction.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Although these books are part of a series, they do not need to be read in order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life may not turn out like we planned, but sometimes that’s what makes it perfect…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hadley Foster has always been a planner. But, since the age of nineteen, things haven’t exactly gone according to plan… not at all. And the changes continue to mount when a trip to Europe with her best friend starts a domino effect in all aspects of her life. Suddenly, the future she had envisioned for herself seems unlikely to happen. It’s time to make a new plan… or accept the dominoes as they fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Kelly has a great life. He’s a successful self-published writer who’s living his dreams. But, something is missing. Hadley Foster. Letting her slip through his fingers is one of his biggest regrets. Over time, he had to accept the idea of being without his first love as he watched her fall in love with someone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When circumstances bring Jason and Hadley back into one another’s lives, they’re forced to deal with their past, their present and the possibility of a future together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Note from the author:  You do not need to read either Bouquet Toss or Champagne Toast to follow this story.  It is a stand-alone book that connects to Champagne Toast. **</description>

  <description>24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole.  &lt;br&gt;Seriously. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he’s got his reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.  What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work.  His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. &lt;br&gt;So he slipped far, far from it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with.  If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? &lt;br&gt;Wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila.  &lt;br&gt;Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart.  He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense.  Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows that.  And he’s working on it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is that enough to make her stay?</description>

  <description>Leather and lace don't strike sparks. Or do they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's Valentine's Day, but Macy Rodgers isn't feeling the love. Aside from a torrid, one-night fling in a backseat a few months back, her love life has been sorely lacking, but fortunately she has devious friends who feel like playing Cupid. Wouldn't they be shocked to learn that the match they've made for her is the same one that steamed up the back of that '69 GTO...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth "Ghost" Warren has just returned to town after an extended absence. Between his grandmother's failing health, his job as a tattoo artist, his band's gigs, and a crazy ex that won't leave him alone, he's stretched thin. Cautious cowgirl Macy is the last thing he needs thrown into the mix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's all country, he's all heavy metal—and Macy knows that if anyone can propel her out of her rut, it's Seth. But when their worlds collide, it's anyone guess if they'll survive with their hearts intact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains explicit sex, graphic language, road trips, troublemaking exes, emotional baggage, and an unconventional but exceptionally hot hero tatted and pierced for your pleasure...</description>

  <description>Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane. The dark secrets of her past weren’t something she ever intended to share with anyone. They would never understand. No one would ever get close enough to find out. There was always a chance she’d go crazy sooner than they expected…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Woods Kerrington had never been one to be attracted to fragile females. They seemed like too much work. He wasn’t in it for the work just the pleasure. A night full of naughty fun had been exactly what was on his mind when he’d laid eyes on the hot little number that didn’t know how to pump gas and needed some help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he didn’t know was she was as fragile as they came.&lt;br&gt;The carefree girl who spoke her mind and didn’t care what the world thought of her was more breakable than he could ever imagine…</description>

  <description>17-year-old Kate has lived her whole life in abject poverty, with an alcoholic father and drug-addicted mother, who severely abuses Kate. At school, her second-hand clothing marks her as a target. Her refusal to stand up for herself makes her the recipient of her classmates taunts and bullying. That is, until Henry returns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry Jamison moved away six years earlier, just as he and Kate had begun an to develop feelings for one another. He returns to find the bright, funny, outgoing girl he had known now timidly hiding in corners, barely speaking to anyone around her, suspicious of even him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate can’t figure out what game Henry is playing with her - for surely it is a game. What else would the gorgeous, popular boy from her past want with her? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate finally decides to trust Henry’s intentions, opening her heart to him. Just when it seems he might be genuine in his friendship, tragedy strikes, threatening everything Kate has worked so hard to gain. Can Henry help her to overcome this new devastation, or will it tear them apart forever?</description>

  <description>He won't hesitate to put his life on the line...but will he ever risk his heart? &lt;br&gt;Falling for Justice Garrett was a high point in Patience McGraw's otherwise awkward adolescence. Even after he disappeared, Patience never forgot the boy who captured her heart. Now, he's back in Fool's Gold, California, and her passion for him is as strong as ever. But how can she trust that he won't abandon her again-and her daughter, too? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When bodyguard Justice Garrett was a young man, witness protection brought him to this idyllic town and he never forgot its warmth, or the sweet beauty of his childhood friend. He's returned to open a defense academy, and the Patience he once knew is all grown up. He can't resist her smile, or her curves. But Justice's past doesn't make him husband, or father, material. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patience and Justice think they'll succumb to just one kiss... Then one more... Okay, just one night together. But they might learn that falling in love is beyond anyone's control.</description>

  <description>From Adriane Leigh, an Amazon Bestselling author in Erotica, comes a passionately evocative story about wanting what's forbidden, and giving in to desire so sharp and sweet it threatens to consume...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On impulse, Georgia Montgomery buys a beach house on the North Carolina coast looking for a summer of sun, sand, margaritas and best friends. A charming, seductive, and sexy-as-sin visitor isn't what she bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georgia is instantly drawn to Tristan Howell, the pleasure-seeking playboy with an easy smile and eyes the deepest shade of green she's ever seen. She tries to ignore the desire that burns between them, but just like an addiction-one look, one touch, one taste is never enough. Tristan shows her pleasure like she's never known, and over the course of the summer she must decide if she can let go of the world she's always known to embrace the future she isn't even sure she has with the irresistible ladies man who makes it his goal to free her body and soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For mature audiences.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sweet, bookish Neve Slater always plays by the rules. &lt;/strong&gt;And the number one rule is that good-natured fat girls like her don't get guys like gorgeous, handsome William, heir to Neve's heart since university. But William's been in LA for three years, and Neve's been slimming down and re-inventing herself so that when he returns, he'll fall head over heels in love with the new, improved her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she's not that interested in other men. Until her sister Celia points out that if Neve wants William to think she's an experienced love-goddess and not the fumbling, awkward girl he left behind, then she'd better get some, well, experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Neve needs is someone to show her the ropes, someone like Celia's colleague Max. Wicked, shallow, &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt; Max. And since he's such a man-slut, and so not Neve's type, she certainly won't fall for him. Because William is the man for her... right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Somewhere between losing weight and losing her inhibitions, Neve's lost her heart - but to who?&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Grace Valley, California---where blood runs thicker...ties bind stronger...and love is all the more sweet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visitors to the town often remark about the valley's peace and beauty---both of which are plentiful.  Unlocked doors, front porches, pies cooling in the windows---this is country life at its finest.  But visitors don't always see what lies at the heart of a community.  Or just beyond...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;June Hudson grew up in Grace Valley, the daughter of the town doctor.  Leaving only to get her medical training, she returned home and followed in her father's footsteps.  Some might say she chose the easy, comfortable route...but June knows better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For June, her emergency room is wherever she's needed---or wherever a patient finds her.  Always on call, her work is her life, these people her extended family. Which is a good thing, since this is a town where you should have picked your husband in the ninth grade.  Grace Valley is not exactly the place to meet eligible men---until an undercover DEA agent suddenly starts appearing at all sorts of strange hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everybody has secrets down in the valley.  Now June has one of her own.</description>

She never thought he’d pack his bags and leave because he “needed space.” With her newfound single status and fear of being alone, Ellery buries herself in her artwork and paintings until one night she helps a mysterious intoxicated stranger get home safely. Little did she know the mysterious stranger is none other than CEO and millionaire Connor Black.  After finding Ellery in his kitchen the next morning and assuming she broke his #1 rule about sleepovers, he becomes intrigued, not only by her stubbornness and defiance, but by her kindness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor Black, emotionally dead and damaged, that stemmed from a personal tragedy, made a vow to never love or fall in love with a woman, until Ellery Lane walked into his life by accident. After she opens up and shows him her world, Connor starts to feel emotions and feelings he never knew existed. Despite the rumors and warnings regarding Connor Black and his use and misuse of women, Ellery finds herself being drawn into his world.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellery knows they can never be together because she is harboring a deep secret that could destroy Connor emotionally forever.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join Connor and Ellery as they embark on a journey of courage, love and strength. Will it be enough to save them?</description>

  <description>Sienna Jensen had no plans to return home when she graduated college last spring—after all, her dreams lie in California. But when she discovers her grandmother’s Nashville home has been foreclosed, and the new owner has started the eviction process, Sienna has no other choice but go back to Music City. And she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she’d see again. The man who now holds the deed to her grandma’s estate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When millionaire rock star Lucas Wolfe finds the outspoken redhead glaring at him from across a courtroom, he’s both infuriated and intrigued. He still can't get the night Sienna almost spent with him out of his mind, and the chemistry between them is as undeniable as it was two years ago. He craves Sienna more than ever. And just like everything Lucas hungers for, he’s determined to have her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Lucas will do whatever it takes to lure Sienna into his bed, even if that means making a deal with her: ten days with him, playing by his rules, and he’ll hand over the deed to her grandmother’s home. Though she agrees to the arrangement, Sienna is conflicted. Because of her duty to her family. Because of promises she’s made to herself and a past that still haunts her. And as Lucas’s game of seduction continues, and Sienna is introduced to his dark, erotic world and even darker background, she realizes that at any moment, she could be devoured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*This novel contains adult situations and content*&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>James and Bianca’s story draws to a close in the explosive conclusion to the Up In The Air Trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a short but earnest courtship, Bianca can no longer deny her feelings for James, and though she’s tried her hardest, she can’t help but see that he cares deeply for her, as well. In a completely uncharacteristic move, she has put aside her misgivings and agreed to live with the enigmatic billionaire. Is her leap of faith the beginning of something wonderful, or is it too much, too fast?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As James and Bianca feel a growing need for each other that neither can deny, circumstances beyond their control intervene, trying to tear them apart. Amidst the ever mounting threat of a monster who wants Bianca dead, and the constant pitfalls of an indiscreet past that James can’t seem to escape, can these two passionate lovers manage to find their happily ever after?</description>

  <description>When reserved flight attendant Bianca gets one look at billionaire hotel owner James Cavendish, she loses all of her hard-won composure. For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions. But what tempts her like never before is the dominant pull he seems to have over her from the moment they meet, and the promise of pleasure, and pain, that she reads in his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>Mixed martial arts fighter Reid Andrews’s chance to reclaim his title as light heavyweight champ is shattered when he’s injured only months before the rematch. To make sure he’s healed in time, his trainer sends him to recuperate under a professional’s care—Reid’s best friend’s little sister, all grown up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disorganized and bookish Lucie Miller needs some professional help of her own. She’d do anything to catch the eye of a doctor she’s crushed on for years, so when Reid offers seduction lessons in exchange for 24/7 conditioning for the biggest fight of his career, Lucie jumps at the chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Reid finds himself in the fight of his life...winning Lucie's heart before she gives it to someone else.</description>

  <description>Sometimes, to see the eyes of your greatest enemy, you need to look into a mirror.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this final chapter of Mitch and Eden's story, everyone will be tested. Morality and honor weighed against getting the job done. But desperation can make people do things they never thought they’d be capable of. And returning from hell is a pretty damn big wake-up call, especially once Mitch realizes that the woman he loves has been in a different kind of hell…and she can’t get out of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*** STRANGE CASE is the conclusion of Mitch and Eden’s story and may prove confusing to those who haven’t read the first two books. This novel is intended for adults. It includes lots of cursing, biting sarcasm, descriptive sex, and some seriously bad team morale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other books in this trilogy:&lt;br&gt;Hyde, an Urban Fantasy (Book I)&lt;br&gt;Jekyll, an Urban Fantasy (Book II)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear reader,&lt;br&gt;Although Strange Case marks the end of this trilogy, it isn't the end of the Hyde world. Thank you for your support and for taking a risk on a series that can be crude and cruel but is, at its core, a love story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go to my website and sign up for my newsletter to receive an announcement when the book is available, as well as a deleted scene between Mitch and Eden (it's a dramatic one btw)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ReadLaurenS.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.ReadLaurenS.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

  <description>I was never supposed to be a rock star. I had my life all planned out for me. Play football in college. Go to the NFL. Marry my high school sweetheart and live happily ever after. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I broke both our hearts that day when I told her I was leaving. I was young. I made the right decision for me, but the wrong decision for us. I’ve poured my soul into my music, but I’ve never forgotten her. Her smell, her smile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now I’m going back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After ten years.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope I can explain that after all this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I still want her to be my forever girl.</description>

  <description>If you’re looking for a story about a good, humble girl, who’s been hurt by someone she thought she could trust, only to find out she’s not as vulnerable as she thought she was and discovers an empowering side of herself that falls in love with the guy who helps her find that self, blah, blah, blah...then you’re gonna’ hate my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because mine is not the story you read every time you bend back the cover of the latest trend novel. It’s not the “I can do anything, now that I’ve found you/I’m misunderstood but one day you’ll find me irresistible because of it” tale. Why? Because, if I was being honest with you, I’m a complete witch. There’s nothing redeeming about me. I’m a friend using, drug abusing, sex addict from Los Angeles. I’m every girlfriend’s worst nightmare and every boy’s fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Sophie Price... And this is the story about how I went from the world’s most envied girl to the girl no one wanted around and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</description>

  <description>Drew Evans is a winner. Handsome and arrogant, he makes multimillion dollar business deals and seduces New York’s most beautiful women with just a smile. He has loyal friends and an indulgent family. So why has he been shuttered in his apartment for seven days, miserable and depressed? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’ll tell you he has the flu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we all know that’s not really true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katherine Brooks is brilliant, beautiful and ambitious.  She refuses to let anything - or anyone - derail her path to success. When Kate is hired as the new associate at Drew’s father’s investment banking firm, every aspect of the dashing playboy’s life is thrown into a tailspin. The professional competition she brings is unnerving, his attraction to her is distracting, his failure to entice her into his bed is exasperating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, just when Drew is on the cusp of having everything he wants, his overblown confidence threatens to ruin it all.  Will he be able untangle his feelings of lust and tenderness, frustration and fulfillment? Will he rise to the most important challenge of his life? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Drew Evans win at love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tangled is not your mother’s romance novel.  It is an outrageous, passionate, witty narrative about a man who knows a lot about women…just not as much as he thinks he knows.  As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing he never wanted in life, is the only thing he can’t live without.</description>

  <description>Alyssa Boyd had big plans.  Big plans that included getting the hell out of the little town she’d grown up in with her two best friends. When she decided it was time to let one of them know her true feelings for him; a change of plans resulted in a tragic turn of events.  Now, Alyssa is left alone to find her way out of the darkness that an untimely death has left in its wake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse Vaughn was never good at letting people in.  He’d learned a long time ago that it’s easier that way because people leave, or, unfortunately, die.  The one person he wanted to let in doesn’t want him anymore. The only problem is he can’t stop thinking about her.  Jesse returns to the childhood home he left behind with one goal in mind… to convince her that they should be together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jesse finds Alyssa she’s not the same girl he left behind.  She’s wild, reckless and hell-bent on not giving Jesse a second chance.  Lucky for Jesse, his stubborn streak has always been a mile-wide and he’s not about to give up on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your life has been shattered can you really pick up all the pieces and move on?</description>

  <description>Getting drunk homecoming night your senior year is never a good idea, but Jake Hayes never expected it all to end with a car crash and a t-post embedded in his throat. His biggest regret about it all? What he never said to Samantha Shay. He's been in love with her for years and never had the guts to tell her. Now it's too late. Because after that night, Jake will never be able to talk again. When Jake returns to his small island home, population 5,000, he'll have to learn how to deal with being mute. He also finds that his family isn't limited to his six brothers and sisters, that sometimes an entire island is watching out for you. And when he gets the chance to spend more time with Samantha, she'll help him learn that not being able to talk isn't the worst thing that could ever happen to you. Maybe, if she'll let him, Jake will finally tell her what he didn't say before, even if he can't actually say it.</description>

  <description>Life isn’t always about fairytales and happily ever-after’s according to Seth Jordan. After having his world shattered and heartbroken beyond repair, he had always sworn off the idea of love. He was perfectly content with continuing his life with worthless one night stands and no strings attached sex. That was until one blue-eyed blonde managed to seep into places he thought were cemented shut. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like a jack hammer, Mallory Prentice came into Seth’s life and cracked the hard exterior that surrounded his heart. She’s the one woman he was starting to feel might be worth taking a chance on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life doesn't always hand you the easy road. Sometimes you are constantly hit with the bad and have no hope of any good ever showing up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Seth and Mallory realize that ultimately they are the ones who are in control of their life’s outcome? Will they embrace the future and fight for their own happiness, or will they keep lingering in past mistakes and let it keep them apart? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is all about forgiveness and second chances. Once you come to that conclusion and just go for it, there is…no going back.</description>

  <description>I had the perfect life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful and loving husband.Three gorgeous little girls.  &lt;br&gt;Successful career.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing missing was the white picket fence.  I really wanted that fence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, I lost that life.  I lost my husband.  And I lost myself.  But, eventually, I found my way through the darkness.  I’ve made peace with my new life. I have my girls, and that’s all that matters. They are my world.  I have no illusions of ever falling in love again or getting whisked away on a white horse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; came back into my life. On a freakin’ motorcycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no way I’ll let him turn my life completely upside down.  &lt;em&gt;Absolutely&lt;/em&gt; no way.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How long can I keep pretending that I’m happy with my life being right-side up?</description>

  <description>Ella and Micha have been best friends since they were kids. But one tragic night shatters their friendship and their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ella used to be a rule-breaker with fiery attitude who wore her heart on her sleeve.

  <description>When Jacqueline follows her longtime boyfriend to the college of his choice, the last thing she expects is a breakup two months into sophomore year. After two weeks in shock, she wakes up to her new reality: she's single, attending a state university instead of a music conservatory, ignored by her former circle of friends, and failing a class for the first time in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving a party alone, Jacqueline is assaulted by her ex's frat brother. Rescued by a stranger who seems to be in the right place at the right time, she wants nothing more than to forget the attack and that night - but her savior, Lucas, sits on the back row of her econ class, sketching in a notebook and staring at her. Her friends nominate him to be the perfect rebound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own. Suddenly appearances are everything, and knowing who to trust is anything but easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mature Young Adult / New Adult</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left. Determined to find a distraction from the pain of losing Jack Henry, she immerses herself in her music. But with her old life comes old acquaintances and new expectations. When Laurelyn refuses her record producer’s outrageous demands, she finds herself without a career—until an unforeseen opportunity presents itself. From there it’s a rocket ride straight to the top where Laurelyn finds the success she’s always dreamed of. Will it be enough to bring her the happiness she so deserves, or will the absence of Jack Henry leave her wanting more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Henry McLachlan never expected to fall in love with Laurelyn Prescott—but he did. After he foolishly let her slip through his fingers, he spends three months searching for her, but their reunion doesn’t come easy. The woman he finds isn’t the same one who drifted away without a goodbye. No longer an insecure girl on an Australian adventure, this Laurelyn is a successful musician with a promising career. Her dreams are becoming a reality, and Jack is terrified his American girl won’t have a place for him in her new life. With only a month to convince her otherwise, will it be enough time to make her visualize a life beyond the glitz and glamour, a life that includes him?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Falling in love isn't always easy or pleasant. The intense and angst-filled story of Emma and Scott is a painful, gut-wrenching and exhausting portrayal of how hard it can be to let go...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Picking up the pieces and starting again in the US, Emma enrols in college with her cousin, Ashley. She is finally free to do what she wants and live how she chooses, and no man will ever rule her decisions or emotions again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until Scott Mason walks on stage...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intense bad boy Scott is the lead singer of a popular local rock band. A ladies’ man and Ashley's long-time friend, Scott holds an instant fascination for Emma — she finds herself drawn to him, even though he represents everything she hates and needs to stay away from in a guy. He treats females like he does a cigarette — light it, use it, and lose it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For her cousin's sake, Emma makes an effort to get along with Scott, but she soon discovers that there is more to him than first appears, making him even more dangerous in her eyes. Behind the façade of friendship, jealousy, obsession, fear and insecurity fester — an internal battle rages as she fights her attraction and does everything she can to stop history from repeating itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing she knows for sure is that if she breaks her rule, it may destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Contains mature content — recommended age 17+.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of Australia’s most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and that’s why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they’re always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s his game and his rules. He’s content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, she’s exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and language.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A sometimes funny, tragically graphic, compelling tale of a woman suffering...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***WARNING- GRAPHIC CONTENT and THEMES ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has no name of her own. She is every name everyone has ever called her. She is nameless. She has a good job, a beautiful home and a wonderful husband. She is everything she was supposed to be. She has structure and stability, but she is lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is trying. Her whole life is spent trying; yet her whole life has been nothing but an apology. She is so tired of trying and failing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In just one week, she learns her entire life is a series of brutalities. She learns intense, consuming passion for the first time with a beautiful stranger. She learns love within this passion, and she learns heartbreak while without.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowly her breakdown overcomes her. She tries to rise above her circumstances, but when she has nothing left to fight with; she tries to ease the pain forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperately, she fights her way through the agony of life, and she returns with a gentle hope. She wants to live, and she wants to love, for the first time in her life. Now, she has a name. Now, she can be 'her'... Any HER that she wants to be.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Some things are worth waiting for…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling thousands of miles from home to enter college is the only way nineteen-year-old Avery Morgansten can escape what happened at the Halloween party five years ago—an event that forever changed her life. All she needs to do is make it to her classes on time, make sure the bracelet on her left wrist stays in place, not draw any attention to herself, and maybe—please God—make a few friends, because surely that would be a nice change of pace. The one thing she didn’t need and never planned on was capturing the attention of the one guy who could shatter the precarious future she’s building for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things are worth experiencing…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple that’s just so… so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous, but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible, he brings out a side of her she never knew existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things should never be kept quiet…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Avery starts receiving threatening emails and phone calls forcing her to face a past she wants silenced, she’s has no other choice but to acknowledge that someone is refusing to allow her to let go of that night when everything changed. When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar? And can Cam be there to help her or will he be dragged down with her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And some things are worth fighting for…&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Love plumbs deep below the surface. In 1946, Sarah, a grieving war widow goes to the carnival with friends and is riveted by the tattooed man in the freak show, adorned in head to toe body art. Later she discovers the man hiding in her hayloft, escaped from imprisonment by the evil owner. She shelters Tom on her farm, fighting a powerful attraction while learning about his mysterious past and gentle nature. When a child goes missing, Tom uses his psychic gift to find her but his assistance doesn't relieve the locals' mistrust of such an exotic stranger. Small-town prejudice tears the lovers apart and a very real threat from the carnival owner endangers them. Can the lovers rise above obstacles of fear and hatred to create the family both have always craved?</description>

  <description>Alexis Sky Martine thinks of herself as the average girl-next-door that does what she has to do to get by, have fun and enjoy life. &lt;br&gt;She is madly in love with her sexy, drop-your-panties-at-first-sight, hottie boyfriend who is equally in love with her; more like downright obsessed. He treats her like she is his heart; like he needs her to exist; like he would do anything in his power to make her happy.&lt;br&gt;Lexi knows Landyn James loves her just as much as she loves him, if not more. Deep down, she also knows high school sweethearts aren’t expected to last, but their relationship is different. They are soul mates. Their connection is unbreakable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What could possibly go wrong when you have love like that...?&lt;br&gt;Everything.&lt;br&gt;What will the future hold...?&lt;br&gt;Only time will tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author's Note: Contains Adult Content – Namely, a teenager-turned-woman with a very dirty mouth and fiery temper that may or may not know how to throw a punch. Also includes hot and steamy scenes, and a small glimpse into physical/verbal abuse.</description>

  <description>Emmy thinks her boss Kyle Sterling of Sterling Corporations is a jerk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, she sleeps with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emmy tries to put the mistake behind her, but then finds herself snowed in with Kyle. As the snow builds, so does the heat in the house between the two. The problem is that Kyle has a steady girlfriend that he is unwilling to break up with. Emmy cuts Kyle off and starts dating Luke. Even as their relationship takes off, Emmy is finding Kyle hard to shake. He is blatant in his feelings and desires for Emmy, putting her in an awkward situation. She tries hard to resist Kyle, but deep down inside Emmy's motives are shady. When Emmy succumbs to her hidden feelings for Kyle without setting Luke free, devastating consequences ensue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to her two men, Emmy daydreams about doing violent things to her loud mouthed, opinionated mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With some humor and sarcasm, and of course, some tequila, Emmy's world will flip upside down as she deals with the results of "accidentally on purpose" falling for two men at once.</description>

  <description>What happens when the one that got away comes back?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel and Ben. Ben and Rachel. It was them against the world. Until it all fell apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been a decade since they last spoke, but when Rachel bumps into Ben one rainy day, the years melt away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment they met they’d been a gang of two; partners in crime and the best of friends. But life has moved on. Ben is married. Rachel is definitely not. In fact, the men in her life make her want to take holy orders…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet in that split second, Rachel feels the old friendship return. And along with it, the broken heart she’s never been able to mend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you love David Nicholls and Lisa Jewell then this is the book for you. Hilarious, heartbreaking and everything in between, you’ll be hooked from their first ‘hello’.</description>

  <description>After enduring a horrific childhood, William Jackson lives a solitary existence working as a computer programmer from his Minnesota home. His safe routine is blown to pieces when the daily sight of an unknown woman walking her dog sends his heart into a tailspin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Jenny Fitzgerald’s love life is at a definite low. Her only potential date in sight is her annoying and creepy coworker, Evan—until a stunning man appears before her like a gift from some kindly sex god. Who is she to turn down what’s offered to her on a hunky blond platter? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Will and Jenny’s friendship develops as their hunger grows into love. Meanwhile, a jealous Evan watches, his rage building until it explodes in a brutal act of violence that tears Jenny’s life apart. Will struggles to help her rebuild her courage and sense of self as his own demons and fragile memories threaten their chance at happiness—but perhaps they can learn to heal each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains a realistic, violent near-rape scene.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Emily Vargas has been taken captive. As part of his conditioning methods, her captor refuses to speak to her, knowing how much she craves human contact. He's far too beautiful to be a monster. Combined with his lack of violence toward her, this has her walking a fine line at the edge of sanity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Told in the first person from Emily's perspective, &lt;em&gt;Comfort Food&lt;/em&gt; explores what happens when all expectations  of pleasure and pain are turned upside down, as whips become comfort and chicken soup becomes punishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCLAIMER: This is not a story about consensual BDSM. This is a story about “actual” slavery. If reading an erotic story without safewords makes you uncomfortable, this is not the book for you. This is a work of fiction, and the author does not endorse or condone any behavior done to another human being without their consent.</description>

  <description>Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We’d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Texas Frontier, 1826&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kit Barclay followed her husband into the wilds of Texas only to be widowed. Stranded with her mother- and sister-in-law to care for, with no hope of rescue before winter sets in, Kit has only one goal: survival. So when a lone horseman appears on the horizon, and then falls from his mount in fever, Kit must weigh the safety of her family against offering aid and shelter to the handsome stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trace Watson has lost everything that ever mattered to him. Trying to forget, he heads to the frontier colony of San Felipe, not caring if he lives or dies. But when he wakes to discover he's being nursed back to health by a brave young widow, he vows to repay her kindness by guiding the three women back to civilization, no matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Kit and Trace are fighting the elements, Indian attacks and outlaws—as well as feelings they both thought were long buried...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Kidnapped, drugged, and about to be sold to the highest bidder, Desdemona Carlisle is having a hell of a time maintaining her English pride. Then she sees the man in black, galloping through the Egyptian desert on a pure white steed. Desdemona could not have conjured a more dashing savior in her wildest fantasies. But an unlikelier hero would be impossible to find: Harry Braxton is a rogue, a scoundrel, and a born opportunist—who has already broken Desdemona’s heart once before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As brilliant as she is beautiful, Desdemona still hasn’t learned how to stay out of trouble—which suits Harry just fine. Running from a painful past, and rumored to be involved in nefarious endeavors, Harry will never be a proper match for Desdemona. But when she catches the eye of his cousin, the irritatingly honorable Lord Blake Ravenscroft, Harry vows to claim his one true desire, once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Romance with strength, wit, and intelligence. Connie Brockway delivers!"&lt;br&gt;-- "New York Times" bestselling author Tami Hoag&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Connie Brockway is a master at creating sparkling chemistry".&lt;br&gt;--Laura Kinsale&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"[Connie Brockway's] work brims with warmth, wit, sensuality, and intelligence".&lt;br&gt;--Amanda Quick&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Connie Brockway's powerful characters grab you by the heartstrings and pull you into their world, their hearts, their love!"&lt;br&gt;--Betina Krahn&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Connie Brockway's work is an absolute delight!"-&lt;br&gt;--Catherine Anderson, author of "Annie's Song"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Ms. Brockway [is] among the finest writers of the genre".&lt;br&gt;-- "Pen &amp;amp; Mouse"</description>

  <description>The news spread like brush fire through the whole county when widower Ancil Drayton announced his intention to start courting Miss Hattie Colfax. She was certainly spirited and delightfully sweet natured, and she'd managed to run her family farm almost single-handedly. But wasn't a twenty-nine-year-old lady farmer too old to catch a husband?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An Irresistible Suitor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All his life handsome, black-haired Reed Tyler had worked Miss Hattie's farm--and dreamed of one day settling down on his own piece of land with the pretty young woman he'd sworn to marry. Hattie was someone he could tell his hopes and troubles to--someone he looked on as a sister. So he thought, until the idea of Ancil Drayton calling on her made him seethe. Until the night a brotherly peck became a scorching kiss... and Reed knew nothing would bank the blaze--and that his best friend was the only woman he would ever love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A duke's son, Grayson Rhodes was a maverick who had left London's suffocating upper class world to earn his own fortune. So he seized the chance to work Abbie Westland's land...and from the moment he first saw Abbie, he was determined to use his arms to work the farm by day and to soothe her through the nights in his strong embrace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abbie, with her fiery determination, was different from the fragile beauties he'd known at home. In her, Grayson found an honest passion he'd never experienced before. But could their growing love survive the surprising reminder of her past that came to haunt them?</description>

  <description>It's hardly the type of wedding Fiona MacLean dreamed of. No family, no guests, just a groom who's been dragged -- literally -- to the altar. But if marriage to Black Jack Kincaid, the handsome wastrel she'd sworn never to see again, will avert a bloody war between their clans, so be it. Surely she can share his bed without losing her heart....  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Known throughout Scotland and London as a wild rogue, Jack is accustomed to waking in dire situations, but...married? Long ago, he and Fiona reveled in a youthful passion. Now, the fiery, sensual lass is his once more. And though their marriage is in name only, Jack is determined to win her forever -- body and soul....&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>BORN TO BE HIS BRIDE?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is said that Braden MacAllister, English baron and proud Highlander warrior, can fell an enemy with a single blow—and a woman with a single kiss.  But not Maggie, it seems.  For the fire-haired beauty, determined to end the long running feud that rages between their clan and its common foe, is immune to Braden's attempts to stop her foolishness.  But stop her he will, once he gets the meddling minx alone and favours her with a passionate caress and an irresistible kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter how she trembles beneath Braden's sensuous touch...he has given his heart to none.  But dare she dream that by assuring peace for her clan she may also be claiming the most magnificent Highlander for herself.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt; Fall in love with the first book in the Blood Rose trilogy-a romance of the Old West by a phenomenal new talent &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On a stagecoach traveling through New Mexico Territory, Jessica Thornton is a long way from the cool mists and lush gardens of her native England. An authoress and milliner, she carries the weight of a scandalous secret-a horrible shame that has brought her to the West on a desperate search for the only family she can trust: her brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; No one prepared Jessica for the heat and the hardships. And no one prepared her for a man like Brady Wilkins. For, despite the rancher's rough-hewn appearance and her own misgivings, Jessica must put her life in his hands after their stagecoach crashes. And she begins to see the man behind the callused hands and caustic wit. A man strong enough to carve out a home in the wilderness, brave enough to fight for his own, and passionate enough to restore her faith in herself-and in her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Abducted from her convent school, headstrong Scottish beauty Jennifer Merrick does not easily surrender to Royce Westmoreland, Duke of Claymore. Known as "The Wolf"; his very name strikes terror in the hearts of his enemies. But proud Jennifer will have nothing to do with the fierce English warrior who holds her captive, this handsome rogue who taunts her with his blazing arrogance. Boldly she challenges his will . . . until the night he takes her in his powerful embrace, awakening in her an irresistible hunger. And suddenly Jennifer finds herself ensnared in a bewildering web . . . a seductive, dangerous trap of pride, passion, loyalty, and overwhelming love.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Dream of Desire Awakened...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful Lady Emily dreams of the rapture of love and the joys of marriage. The youngest daughter of an English lord at war, she is shaken by the arrival of a mysterious stranger to her father's castle. Could this breathtaking man be Emily's yearned-for lover? Indeed, Draven de Montague, Earl of Ravenswood, has come for Emily...but romance has nothing to do with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the Tender Embrace of an Enemy...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Draven would never have entered the home of his most hated adversary had not the King himself ordered him to take in his foe's daughter for a year to forge bonds of peace between their two feuding houses. Worse still, here is a lass whose exquisite loveliness could tempt Draven to betray his sworn vow never to let anther close to his heart. Emily knows the searing heat of her passion could burn down the defenses of this proud warrior. But will the surrender of the sweet nectar of his lips and his bold, sensuous caress ignite a blaze so hot it consumes them both?</description>

  <description>The exquisite niece of Lord Edward and Lady Charlotte Malory, Regina Ashton is outraged over her abduction by the arrogant, devilishly handsome Nicholas Eden—and is determined to make the rogue pay . . . with his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A golden-haired seducer, Nicholas has been hardened by a painful secret in his past. And now that he has besmirched Reggie's good name, the hot-tempered lady has vowed to wed him. Her fiery beauty stirs Nicholas as no woman ever has—and the rake arouses Reggie's passion to an unendurable level. Such uncontrolled desires can lead only to dangerous misunderstandings . . . and, perhaps, to a love that can live only once in a lifetime.</description>

  <description>PROTECTING HER WAS HIS PASSION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; High-born though she is, Kate Campbell isn't afraid to draw her sword. When raiders strike, she rushes into the fray...and is lucky when a mysterious Highlander shields her from a deadly blow. Swept onto his stallion, she soon discovers that her rescuer is her clan's most hated enemy: Callum MacGregor, the man they call The Devil. Yet she cannot ignore his achingly tender touch or the way his fiery gaze leaves her breathless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; POSSESSING HER WOULD BE HIS PLEASURE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Callum MacGregor has taken many Campbell lives, but he's never saved one--until now. Mesmerized by this spirited lass, he wants her by his side, even if it means holding her for ransom. As his fingers graze her sumptuous curves and tangle in her unruly tresses, Callum realizes Kate Campbell is his most dangerous foe of all. For he can't make love to her without betraying his kinsmen and his honor...and surrendering his heart forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Kresley Cole introduces a thrilling new romance trilogy featuring fierce Scottish brothers with dangerous lives, dark desires, and a deadly curse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can he exact revenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High in the Pyrenees, a band of mercenaries led by Courtland MacCarrick wages war for General Reynaldo Pascal. When Court turns on the evil general, Pascal orders him killed, but Court narrowly escapes and exacts revenge by kidnapping Pascal's exquisite Castilian fiancée.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can she deny her passions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Annalía Tristán Llorente despises her towering, barbaric captor almost as much as she does Pascal. Her inexplicable attraction to the Highlander only fuels her fury. But nothing will stop her from returning to Pascal—for if she doesn't wed him, she signs her brother's death warrant, as well as her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can there be love between them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment Court discovers that Anna's prim façade masks a fiery, brave lass, his heart's ensnared, and he dares to defy the curse that has shadowed his life—&lt;em&gt;to walk with death or walk alone.&lt;/em&gt; But Pascal vows that he'll hunt the two, never stopping until he's destroyed them both.</description>

  <description>Noble Britton had suffered greatly at the hands of his first wife, and he refused to fall into the same trap again. This time he intended to marry a quiet, biddable woman who would not draw attention to herself or cause scandal. Gillian Leigh's honest manner and spontaneous laughter attracted him immediately. It mattered little that she was accident-prone; he could provide the structure necessary to guide her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But unconventional to the tips of her half-American toes―toes that one of them was constantly tripping over―his new bride turned the tables on him, wreaking havoc on his orderly life. And worse, demanding he surrender his heart. Perpetually one step behind his beguiling spouse, Noble suffered a banged-up head, a black eye, and a broken nose before he realized Gillian had healed his soul and proved that their union was no heedless tumble, but the swoon of true love.</description>

  <description>Andie Miller is ready to move on in life. She wants to marry her fiancé and leave behind everything in her past, especially her ex-husband, North Archer. But when Andie tries to gain closure with him, he asks one final favor of her before they go their separate ways forever. A very distant cousin of his has died and left North as the guardian of two orphans who have driven out three nannies already, and things are getting worse. He needs a very special person to take care of the situation and he knows Andie can handle anything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Andie meets the two children she quickly realizes things are much worse than she feared. The place is a mess, the children, Carter and Alice, aren't your average delinquents, and the creepy old house where they live is being run by the worst housekeeper since Mrs. Danvers. What's worse, Andie's fiancé thinks this is all a plan by North to get Andie back, and he may be right. Andie's dreams have been haunted by North since she arrived at the old house. And that's not the only haunting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What follows is a hilarious adventure in exorcism, including a self-doubting parapsychologist, an annoyed medium, her Tarot-card reading mother, an avenging ex-mother-in-law, and, of course, her jealous fiancé. And just when she thinks things couldn't get more complicated, North shows up on the doorstep making her wonder if maybe this time things could be different between them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Andie can just get rid of all the guests and ghosts, she's pretty sure she can save the kids, and herself, from the past. But fate might just have another thing in mind....</description>

  <description>A child bride, Sara Winchester had grown into a winsome beauty, joyfully anticipating the day when her husband Nathan, Marquess of St. James, would return to claim her heart at last. Charmingly innocent, she dismissed the ancient feud that divided Nathan's family from her own...and she was totally unaware of his past exploits as the notorious pirate, Pagan. The man who now stood before her was perplexing, arrogant and powerfully handsome...a warrior-gentleman whose gentle touch aroused her to the wildest, deepest pleasures of love. &lt;br&gt; Nathan had never bared his soul to any woman, but he was soon utterly beguiled and exasperated by Sara's sweet, defiant ways. Aboard his ship, &lt;em&gt;The Seahawk,&lt;/em&gt; she was brave, imperious and determined to win his heart completely -- yet upon their return to England, her love would be sorely tested as a vile conspiracy tried to tear them apart. With their future at stake, they would discover the true destiny of their passion...for all time!</description>

  <description>For Princess Gabrielle of St. Biel, Scotland is a land of stunning vistas, wild chieftains, treacherous glens, and steep shadows--skullduggery, betrayal, and now murder. Prized for her exquisite beauty, the daughter of one of England's most influential barons, Gabrielle is also a perfect bargaining chip for a king who needs peace in the Highlands: King John has arranged Gabrielle's marriage to a good and gentle laird. But this marriage will never take place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Gabrielle, everything changes in one last burst of freedom--when she and her guards come upon a scene of unimaginable cruelty. With one shot from her bow and arrow, Gabrielle takes a life, saves a life, and begins a war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within days, the Highlands are aflame with passions as a battle royal flares between enemies old and new. Having come to Scotland to be married, Gabrielle is instead entangled in Highland intrigue. For two sadistic noblemen, underestimating Gabrielle's bravery and prowess may prove fatal. But thanks to a secret Gabrielle possesses, Colm MacHugh, the most feared man in Scotland, finds a new cause for courage. Under his penetrating gaze, neither Gabrielle's body nor heart is safe.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An elite fighting force unlike the world has ever seen...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scouring the darkest corners of the Highlands and Western Isles, Robert the Bruce handpicks ten warriors to help him in his quest to free Scotland from English rule. They are the best of the best, chosen for their superior skills in each discipline of warfare. And to lead his secret Highland Guard, Bruce chooses the greatest warrior of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ultimate Highland warlord and a swordsman without equal, Tor MacLeod has no intention of being drawn into Scotland’s war against the English. Dedicated to his clan, the fiercely independent chief answers to no one—especially not to his alluring new bride, bartered to him in a bid to secure his command of the deadliest fighting force the world has ever seen. The treacherous chit who made her way to Tor’s bed may have won his hand, but she will never claim his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although her husband’s reputation is as fierce as his manner, Christina Fraser believes that something softer hides beneath his brutal shell. But the only warmth she feels is in their bed, in glorious moments of white-hot desire that disappear with the dawn. When Christina’s reckless bid to win her husband’s love goes awry and thrusts them into danger on the eve of war, Tor will face his ultimate battle: to save his wife and to open his heart—before it’s too late.</description>

  <description>In the spring of 1708, an invading Jacobite fleet of French and Scottish soldiers nearly succeeded in landing the exiled James Stewart in Scotland to reclaim his crown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Carrie McClelland hopes to turn that story into her next bestselling novel. Settling herself in the shadow of Slains Castle, she creates a heroine named for one of her own ancestors and starts to write.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when she discovers her novel is more fact than fiction, Carrie wonders if she might be dealing with ancestral memory, making her the only living person who knows the truth-the ultimate betrayal-that happened all those years ago, and that knowledge comes very close to destroying her...</description>

  <description>1879. In Blue Belle, Montana, everyone knew better than to mess with the Claybornes. The brothers had once been a mismatched gang of street urchins -- until they found an abandoned baby girl in a New York city alley, named her Mary Rose, and headed west to raise her to be a lady. They became a family -- held together by loyalty and love if not by blood -- when suddenly they faced a crisis that threatened to tear them apart....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble came to town with one Lord Harrison Stanford MacDonald. Armed with a swagger and six-shooter, he cut a striking figure -- but it soon became apparent to Mary Rose that he was too much of a gentleman to make it in her rough-and-tumble town. She asked her brothers to teach him the basics of frontier survival, which he acquired with ease. And soon he possessed a deep and desperate love for Mary Rose. She returned his affection wholeheartedly... until MacDonald revealed a secret that challenged everything she believed about herself, her life, and her newfound love. Now her search for identity and meaning would begin, raising questions that could only be answered if she listened to the truth within her heart....</description>

  <description>In the feuding English court, gentle Lady Madelyne suffered the cruel whims of her ruthless brother, Baron Louddon. Then, in vengeance for a bitter crime, Baron Duncan of Wexton—the Wolf—unleashed his warriors against Louddon's main. Exquisite Madelyne was the prize he catured...but when he gazed upon the proud beauty, he pledged to protect her with his life. In his rough-hewn castle, Duncan proved true to his honor. But when at last their noble passion conquered them both, she surrendered with all her soul. Now, for love, Madelyne would stand fast...as bravely as her Lord, the powerful Wolf who fought for...&lt;em&gt;Honor's Splendour.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>It's a classic plot: a marriage of convenience that lays the groundwork for true love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1119. Journeying from England to Scotland to wed a highlander, Lady Brenna had resigned herself to the arranged match. But when a band of fierce, painted warriors captured her en route, she fearlessly met their demand to marry their leader -- the quick-tempered laird Connor MacAlister. She couldn't know that her capture was merely the first act of vengeance against her betrothed, Connor's sworn enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna harbored no illusions that her husband was in love with her; after a hasty forest wedding, MacAlister assured her she could return home once she had borne him a son. But she could not deny that she had once proposed to MacAlister -- ten years ago, when she was just a child, and the visitor to her father's castle charmed her with his dazzling, unexpected smile. Now, as she sets out to win the brave chieftain whom she has come to adore, a legacy of revenge ensnares Brenna in a furious clan war -- and only her faith in her gallant hero can save her....</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;I’ve lost it. :( The only thing in the world I wasn’t supposed to lose. My engagement ring. It’s been in Magnus’s family for three generations. And now the very same day his parents are coming, I’ve lost it. The very same day! Do not hyperventilate, Poppy. Stay positive :) !!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Poppy Wyatt has never felt luckier. She is about to marry her ideal man, Magnus Tavish, but in one afternoon her “happily ever after” begins to fall apart. Not only has she lost her engagement ring in a hotel fire drill but in the panic that follows, her phone is stolen. As she paces shakily around the lobby, she spots an abandoned phone in a trash can. Finders keepers! Now she can leave a number for the hotel to contact her when they find her ring. Perfect!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Well, perfect except that the phone’s owner, businessman Sam Roxton, doesn’t agree. He wants his phone back and doesn’t appreciate Poppy reading his messages and wading into his personal life.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; What ensues is a hilarious and unpredictable turn of events as Poppy and Sam increasingly upend each other’s lives through emails and text messages. As Poppy juggles wedding preparations, mysterious phone calls, and hiding her left hand from Magnus and his parents . . . she soon realizes that she is in for the biggest surprise of her life.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Beauty is as beauty does...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silver-tongued Viscount Sanburne is London's favorite scapegrace. Alas, Lydia Boyce has no interest in being charmed. When his latest escapade exposes a plot to ruin her family, she vows to handle it herself, as she always has done. Certainly she requires no help from a too-handsome dilettante whose main achievement is being scandalous. But Sanburne's golden charisma masks a sharper mind and darker history than she realizes. He shocks Lydia by breaking past her prim facade to the woman beneath...and the hidden fire no man has ever recognized. But as she follows him into a world of intrigue, she will learn that the greatest danger lies within—in the shadowy, secret motives of his heart.</description>

  <description>Dopo tre deludenti stagioni in società, il padre di Daisy Bowman non usa mezzi termini: sua figlia deve trovare un marito, molto alla svelta. E se Daisy non incontrerà l’uomo dei suoi sogni, allora sarà costretta a sposare quello che suo padre ha scelto per lei: Matthew Swift.&lt;br&gt;Daisy è terrorizzata, sposerebbe chiunque altro piuttosto che quel borioso, rude individuo. Ma non ha fatto i conti con l’insospettabile charme che Matthew userà per conquistarla. Il ragazzo gracile e ambizioso che aveva conosciuto si è trasformato in un uomo attraente, maturo, pieno di vitalità. Proprio quando sta per arrendersi alla passione, però, scoppia uno scandalo che rischia di mandare all’aria tutto...&lt;br&gt;L’ultimo capitolo delle Audaci zitelle, quattro inseparabili amiche che fanno diventare la Londra vittoriana ironica, divertente e spregiudicata come la New York di Sex and the City.</description>

  <description>A wealthy and bitter exile, he most dangerous and desirable man in all of England, he burns to possess a proud, headstrong beauty who is promised to another. But winning Emma Stokehurst's exquisite hand through threats and determination does nothing to fill the empty spaces in Nikolas' heart until passion's magic carries the handsome, tormented prince back to a bygone era of splendor and romantic dreams. For there his destiny awaits him in a distant life. And in one remarkable woman's tender touch, achingly familiar but gloriously new, he must seek the elusive promise of ecstasy . . .and learn, at last, to love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;He is everything she wants to avoid...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For two years, Catherine Marks has been a paid companion to the Hathaway sisters—a pleasant position, with one caveat. Her charges' older brother, Leo Hathaway, is thoroughly exasperating. Cat can hardly believe that their constant arguing could mask a mutual attraction. But when one quarrel ends in a sudden kiss, Cat is shocked at her powerful response—and even more so when Leo proposes a dangerous liaison.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She is not at all what she seems...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leo must marry and produce an heir within a year to save his family home. Catherine's respectable demeanor hides a secret that would utterly destroy her. But to Leo, Cat is intriguing and infernally tempting, even to a man resolved never to love again. The danger Cat tried to outrun is about to separate them forever—unless two wary lovers can find a way to banish the shadows and give in to their desires...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Why is Lady Sophia looking for a lover? &lt;br&gt;And could she seduce the most marriageable man in London?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Sophia Sydney would do anything to ensnare the unattainable Sir Ross Cannon. Her goal: to ruin his reputation and cause a scandal that would be the talk of all London. So she insinuates herself into his life by gaining his trust and living in his house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every morning, her lush presence tempts him beyond all reason . . . the way she bends over the table to serve him the meals she has prepared . . . the way her hands oh, so gently—yet sensuously—brush against him. Every night, she promises with her eyes—and her body—that the hours before dawn could be spent in unbridled passion instead of restless sleep—if only he'd let her share his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She knows he is falling more in love with her each day. But she never counted on falling in love with &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. And she never dreamed he might very respectably ask for her hand in marriage.</description>

  <description>One ranch. Three sons. Only one will inherit...and on one condition. Tired of waiting for his sons to settle down, Arizona-territory rancher Angus McKettrick announces a competition: the first son to marry and produce a grandchild will inherit Triple M ranch. Now, three distinctly different, equally determined cowboys are searching high and low for brides. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kade McKettrick&amp;amp;#8217;s got five mail-order brides-to-be camped out at the local hotel, all more than eager to provide him with the heir that will win him the Triple M ranch. But Kade, the newly appointed marshal, has his hands full with a troublesome outlaw gang. Why, then, is he so easily distracted by pretty &amp;amp;#8220;Sister Mandy&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;amp;#8212;who most assuredly is not the nun she claims to be? On the run from her outlaw stepfather, Mandy Sperrin hides beneath her solemn disguise, and vows to keep her wild, passionate nature from the respectable citizens of Indian Rock. Yet when the handsome marshal makes it clear that he wants her, Mandy gives in to her heated desires....</description>

  <description>RUMORS AND GOSSIP ... THE LIFEBLOOD OF LONDON&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Olivia Bevelstoke is told that her new neighbor may have killed his fiancee, she doesn't believe it for a second, but, still, how can she help spying on him, just to be sure? So she stakes out a spot near her bedroom window, cleverly concealed by curtains, watches, and waits ... and discovers a most intriguing man, who is definitely up to something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir Harry Valentine works for the boring branch of the War Office, translating documents vital to national security. He's not a spy, but he's had all the training, and when a gorgeous blonde begins to watch him from her window, he is instantly suspicious. But just when he decides that she's nothing more than an annoyingly nosy debutante, he discovers that she might be engaged to a foreign prince, who might be plotting against England. And when Harry is roped into spying on Olivia, he discovers that he might be falling for her himself ...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;1814 promises to be another eventful season, but not, this author believes, for Anthony Bridgerton, London's most elusive bachelor, who has shown no indication that he plans to marry.&lt;br&gt;And in truth, why should he? When it comes to playing the consummate rake, nobody does it better...&lt;br&gt;--Lady Whistledown's Society Papers, &lt;/em&gt;April 1814&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this time, the gossip columnists have it wrong. Anthony Bridgerton hasn't just decided to marry--he's even chosen a wife! The only obstacle is his intended's older sister, Kate Sheffield--the most meddlesome woman ever to grace a London ballroom. The spirited schemer is driving Anthony mad with her determination to stop the betrothal, but when he closes his eyes at night, Kate is the woman haunting his increasingly erotic dreams...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary to popular belief, Kate is quite sure that reformed rakes do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; make the best husbands--and Anthony Bridgerton is the most wicked rogue of them all.  Kate is determined to protect her sister--but she fears her own heart is vulnerable.  And when Anthony's lips touch hers, she's suddenly afraid she might not be able to resist the reprehensible rake herself...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Getting to first base is a cinch...But getting home will take a grand slam...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pace Martin is the ace pitcher for the Pacific Heat. He's got the arm, the experience, and the wins. He's also got the pain, the pressure, and the possible end of his career looming over him. The last thing he needs now is a distraction, even if it comes in the form of a tough, beautiful, tell-it-like-it-is writer who sees past his defenses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holly Hutchins knows a good story when she sees one, and the tall, dark, and slightly attitude-challenged Pace Martin fits the bill. But when she realizes there's more at stake than just a win, she begins to see the jock in a different light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pace and Holly begin a seductive game, but in the face of unexpected betrayal and challenges, they'll have to find the courage to swing for the fences...</description>

  <description>All in one day, city girl Breanne Mooreland gets left at the altar, takes the flight from hell to her honeymoon--alone--loses her luggage, and ends up snowed in at a Sierra mountains lodge run by the kookiest staff this side of the Addams Family. Oh, and there just happens to be a gorgeous naked man taking a shower in her suite who says he isn't going anywhere. Burned-out vice cop Cooper Scott is in serious need of this vacation, and he's not about to give up the only available room during a bad snowstorm just because an upset, okay, make that insane, woman is having a conniption fit. They'll just have to make the best of it--her side of the bed versus his. But when Cooper wakes up kissing the long, leggy Breanne, he has other thoughts. Part of him wants to prove that not all men are scum, and another part of him entirely wants to show her exactly what that honeymoon suite is intended for. But that will have to wait, because a screaming Breanne has just stumbled on a very dead body.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The One Thing a Lady Must Never Do...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wealthy Lady Georgina Maitland doesn't want a husband, though she could use a good steward to run her estates. One look at Harry Pye, and Georgina knows she's not just dealing with a servant, but a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Fall In Love...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harry has known many aristocrats—including one particular nobleman who is his sworn enemy. But Harry has never met a beautiful lady so independent, uninhibited, and eager to be in his arms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With Her Servant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, it's impossible to conduct a discreet liaison when poisoned sheep, murdered villagers, and an enraged magistrate have the county in an uproar. The locals blame Harry for everything. Soon it's all Georgina can do to keep her head above water and Harry's out of the noose…without missing another night of love.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He came in search of a convenient bride...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;London's Ball of the Season is hardly the milieu for society black sheep Sebastian Reyne. But his younger sisters are in desperate need of care, and Sebastian is seeking a practical, down-to-earth wife. What he doesn't need is an effervescent sprite like Hope Merridew, a dazzling beauty and the darling of the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;...And found love instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who was that mysterious man who devoured Hope Merridew with his eyes? Rumored to be dangerous, and with a mysterious family heritage, the secretive Sebastian proves absolutely seductive to such an impetuous young lady. But was he really the one to make her dream of dancing the perfect waltz with the perfect man come true? Who'd imagine that one dance could ignite a passion so strong that it would seduce all into a delicious intrigue of sensuality and desire?</description>

  <description>Aspiring romance novelist Jane Sillee was completely in love with her fantasy man -- the hot and strapping dark-haired Highlander who d been coming to her in her dreams for years and inspired her sensual flights of literary fancy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was more than her imagination that conjured up the brilliantly woven tapestry sporting the spitting image of her magnificently arrogant warrior. It was more than a dream that transported her to medieval Scotland to break an evil spell. And it was more than she could handle when she found herself wrapped in the muscular arms of Aedan MacKinnon, who had his own fantasies to fulfill...</description>

  <description>It's taken him eleven centuries to find the right woman.  He's not about to lose her now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jessi St. James has GOT to get a life.  Too many hours studying ancient artifacts has given the archaeology student a bad case of sex on the brain.  So she figures she must be dreaming when she spies a gorgeous half-naked man staring out at her from inside the glass of an ancient mirror.  But when a split-second decision saves her from a terrifying attempt on her life, Jessi suddenly finds herself confronting six and a half feet of smoldering INSATIABLE alpha male.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Heir to the arcane magic of his Druid ancestors, Cian MacKeltar was trapped inside the Dark Glass eleven centuries ago.  And when the Dark Glass is stolen, an ancient enemy will stop at nothing to reclaim it.  For Jessi, the sex god in the mirror is not only tantalisingly real, he's offering his protection—from exactly what, Jessi doesn't know.  And all he wants in exchange is the exquisite pleasure of sharing her bed....</description>

  <description>A Warrior Of Immortal Powers&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a mighty Scottish warrior who lived in a world bound by ancient laws and timeless magic. But no immortal powers could prepare the laird of Castle Brodie for the lovely accursed lass who stood before him. A terrible trick of fate had sent her 700 years back in time and into his private chamber to tempt him with her beauty—and seduce him with a desire he could never fulfill. For this woman he burned to possess was also&lt;br&gt;the woman he had foresworn to destroy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Woman Caught In The Mists Of Time&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lisa felt the earth move under her feet, the fiercely independent 21st-century woman never dreamed she was falling...into another century. But the powerful, naked warrior who stood glaring down at her was only too real...and too dangerously arousing. Irresistibly handsome he might be, but Lisa had no intention of remaining in this savage land torn by treachery and war. How could she know that her seductive captor had other plans for her...plans that would save her from a tragic fate? Or that this man who had long ago forsaken love would defy time itself to claim her for his own....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Woman's Tender Touch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was born to a clan of warriors of supernatural strength, but Gavrael McIllioch abandoned his name and his Highland castle, determined to escape the dark fate of his ancestors. Hiding his identity from the relentless rival clan that hunted him, he called himself Grimm to protect the people he cared for, vowing never to acknowledge his love for ravishing Jillian St. Clair. Yet even from afar he watched over her, and when her father sent an urgent summons, "Come for Jillian," he raced to her side—into a competition to win her hand in marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Warrior's Steely Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why had he run from her so many years before? And why return now to see her offered as a prize in her father's manipulative game? Furious, Jillian vowed never to wed. But Grimm was the man she loved, the one who urged her to marry another. He tried to pretend indifference as she tempted him, but he could not deny the fierce desires that compelled him to abduct her from the altar. She was the only woman who could tame the beast that raged within him—even as deadly enemies plotted to destroy them both....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;An unabridged recording in 9 parts (10 hours, 23 minutes).&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Impossible...&lt;br&gt;Rupert Carsington, fourth son of the Earl of Hargate, is his aristocratic family's favorite disaster. He is irresistibly handsome, shockingly masculine, and irretrievably reckless, and wherever he goes, trouble follows. Still, Rupert's never met an entanglement--emotional or other--he couldn't escape. Until now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outrageous...&lt;br&gt;Now he's in Egypt, stranded in the depths of Cairo's most infamous prison, and his only way out is accepting a beautiful widow's dangerous proposal. Scholar Daphne Pembroke wants him to rescue her brother, who's been kidnapped by a rival seeking a fabled treasure. Their partnership is strictly business: She'll provide the brains, he, the brawn. Simple enough in theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inevitable...&lt;br&gt;Blame it on the sun or the blazing desert heat, but as tensions flare and inhibitions melt, the most disciplined of women and the most reckless of men are about to clash in the most impossibly irresistible way.</description>

  <description>Anya Gage has learned that to get anything good in life, you have to work for it. She has no expectations, no dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she finds herself at a party where she doesn’t want to be and she meets Knight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight Sebring knows who he is, what he wants and what he likes. And he gets it. But he never expected something as sweet as Anya Gage to wander into his bedroom during a party he did not expect to be having to borrow his phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight tries to leave Anya to the life she deserves of white picket fences and a man who watches football on Sundays – good, normal and clean. But when Anya comes to his nightclub and finds herself in a situation, he knows someone has to look after her, he can’t fight it anymore and he decides that man will be him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight teaches Anya that, just as with the bad, in life you should also expect the good. And he teaches her this by giving it to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Knight has a dark past and just as he desires Anya for exactly who she is, he fears when she finds out exactly the man he has become and always intends to be, she’ll leave him for good, normal and clean.</description>

  <description>Sophie Dempsey is content living a quiet life filming wedding videos until an assignment brings her to Temptation, Ohio. From the moment she drive into town, she gets a bad feeling; Sophie is from the wrong side of the tracks and everything in Temptation is a little too right. And when she has a run-in with the town's unnervingly sexy mayor, Phineas Tucker, making a little movie turns out to be more than a little dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yield to oncoming desire...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Sophie wants to do is film the video and head home. All Phin wants to do is play pool with the police chief and keep things peaceful. They both get more than they bargained for when Sophie's video causes an uproar and the proper citizens of Temptation set out to shut them down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to temptation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As events spiral out of control, Sophie and Phin find themselves caught in a web of gossip, blackmail, adultery, murder, and really excellent sex. All hell breaks loose in Temptation as Sophie and Phin fall deeper and deeper in trouble...and in love.</description>

  <description>It is the late 12th century and lovely Lady Judith Hampton is making plans to leave her home in England for a dangerous journey to Scotland. She is keeping a childhood promise to attend her dearest friend, Frances Catherine, in childbirth. But Judith has a private reason for visiting the Highlands: to locate the father she has never known. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing has prepared Judith for the sight of Iain Maitland, Frances Catherine's brother-in-law, the Scottish warlord who comes to escort her to his land. The Laird of his clan, Iain is the handsomest, most compelling man Judith has ever met. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though he finds Judith as stubborn as she is enchanting, passion rages between them from their first kiss--and grows into a love so great that he fears for their future together... for her father's identity is a devastating secret that could shatter the boldest alliance and the most glorious of loves!</description>

  <description>An innocent Mississippi wildflower in the early bloom of womanhood, headstrong Jessie Lindsay will do anything to thwart the charming, enigmatic fortune hunter who has come to wed her widowed stepmother. But there is far more to Stuart Edwards than Jessie first imagines. And in the heat of a blistering Southern summer, the handsome riverboat gambler will awaken feelings she has never known—and share with her his dangerous secrets—as reckless, undeniable desire propels them both toward scandal, possible ruin...and impossible love.</description>

  <description>She vowed not to love the gunfighter who made her burn with desire....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A shivering cold angel...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maura Reed was all alone in her Montana hotel, curled up in her robe and slippers, when the blizzard hit. It was cold, quiet, and lonely--until a rugged gunslinger blew in from the storm demanding shelter. Just for this night--this wild, stormy night--Maura wanted someone, something. Recklessly, she abandoned herself in his arms, knowing he would be gone by morning. The last thing she ever expected was the need that drove her into the wilderness . . . to find the stranger who haunted her dreams. . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hot, dangerous devil...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was the fastest gun in the West, a man who feared nothing until he met the woman who touched his heart. Quinn Lassiter didn't even recognize Maura when she cornered him in a distant saloon months later. Never in his wildest dreams did he see himself married--until he said the words that made her his wife. He was determined to do the right thing by the woman he'd wronged, but he'd never reckoned on falling in love with her. . . .</description>

  <description>He lived by night--the dark, dangerous highwayman who stole her heart....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It was a fine night for treachery, dark with a pale moon rising...." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like a wraith he appeared in the Coventry night, the notorious highwayman called Captain Starlight.  Renée d'Anton watched, breathless, as the cloaked figure commanded, "Stand and deliver!" and her coach shuddered to a halt.  Little did he know Renée had come in desperation to meet him.  For the dark, seductive highwayman was her only hope in a perilous game of chance....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was pure temptation, challenging Tyrone Hart to steal a set of heirloom rubies and name his price.  He couldn't resist her.  So he agreed to risk his life for the fiery beauty--to recover the jewels that would free her from an arranged marriage and an unspeakable threat.  But first Renée had to win his trust--even as she ignited passions that seduced him out of the shadows to sweep her into his arms....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bestselling, award-winning author Marsha Canham once again delivers dangerous intrigue, sensuous romance, and two unforgettable characters whose love story will touch your heart as it takes your breath away.</description>

  <description>After returning from war all but totally blind by a would-be assassin's hand, Nathan Oriel spends his days in bitterness and isolation. Until Isobel MacLeod--caught in his steely embrace one fateful night--shatters his world with her Scottish temper, her pride, and her courage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isobel, by her own admission a woman of too much brain and too little beauty, is a spinster devoted to keeping her wayward family out of trouble. To Nathan, however, she is beauty, hope, and salvation in one tempestuous package, and he is not above blackmail to coerce her into his world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaken by Nathan's raw passion and fierce determination, Isobel's own defenses and stubborn pride begin to crumble. But can she trust this enigmatic man enough to give him what he wants most dearly of all . . . her love?</description>

  <description>If I want to get married and have a family (and I do), it's time for a plan!! -from Hallie McCarthy's diary  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alarm on Hallie's biological clock is buzzing away. She's hitting the big three-0 and there's no prospect of marriage, no man in sight. But Hallie's an organized, goal-setting kind of person. She gives herself a year to meet Mr. Knight in Shining Armor. But all her dates are disasters. (There's the cheapskate and the sex fiend and...well, never mind.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Too bad she can't just fall for her good-looking neighbor, Steve Marris. He's definitely not her type. Anyway, Steve's busy trying to win back his ex-wife, Mary Lynn, who's busy getting married-but not to Steve. Life would be so much simpler if he could fall for someone else. Like...Hallie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They're friends, though-and sometimes friends become lovers. Sometimes friends become more....</description>

  <description>EYE OF SILVER, EYES OF GOLD is a story of romance and family conflicts set in Colorado in 1885.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anne Wells has embarrassed her rigidly proper family since she was a child with occasional but grievous lapses from ladylike behavior. They blame those lapses for the disgraceful fact that she is a spinster at 28.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cord Bennett, the son of his father's second marriage to a Cheyenne  woman, is more than an embarrassment to his well-to-do family of ranchers and lawyers - they are ashamed and afraid of their black sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Anne and Cord are found alone together, her father's fury leads to violence. Cord's family accepts that the fault is his. Can Anne and Cord use the freedom of being condemned for sins they didn't commit to make a life together? Or will their disapproving, interfering families tear them apart?</description>

  <description>Libby Ross fled betrayal and heartbreak in Chicago when she headed to Montana expecting a new start, children, and a good place to raise them. Instead she learned that she has been duped again by the cowboy who made her his mail-order bride. He died, leaving her with no money, nowhere to go, and no resources but her own ingenuity. Then she learned about the Lodestar Ranch and its owner, Tyler Hollins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides a lifetime of painful memories, Tyler had his hands full with immediate problems. Half his cattle were lost during the worst winter on record and his cowhands were about to quit if he couldn’t find a decent cook. Libby Ross fit the bill. She had never seen a man so attractive with such a sour disposition. But she sensed desire behind the wall Ty erected to keep everyone at a distance . . . a wanting so fierce it nearly broke her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They locked horns from the outset, but they could fight each other, or fight together to see their dreams come true . . .</description>

  <description>One ranch. Three sons. Only one will inherit...and on one condition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tired of waiting for his sons to settle down, Arizona-territory rancher Angus McKettrick announces a competition: the first son to marry and produce a grandchild will inherit Triple M ranch. Now, three distinctly different, equally determined cowboys are searching high and low for brides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If Emmeline Harding knows one thing, it's that she can't hold her liquor. And though she's not sure how she came to wake up next to a stack of gold coins in a brothel, she fears the worst. Fleeing town as a mail-order bride, she wonders: how will she ever confess her past to her handsome new husband?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freedom-loving Rafe McKettrick is a man of strong beliefs and stronger passions and he'll do anything to win the Triple M -- even marry a stranger. To his surprise, Emmeline's charms beguile him even as the secrets he senses she's hiding ignite jealousy and suspicion. But when a visitor from the past enters the high country, the newlyweds have no choice but to give up on a marriage in name only and seek a union that satisfies them body and soul.</description>

  <description>In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a particular virtue--Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is--she can't have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles to determine who her friends really are--and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes infuriating boy fits into the life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean death. And as she discovers a growing conflict that threatens to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.</description>

  <description>A hand-picked cadre of warriors, they had the fierce courage of their Scots forefathers, combined with the stealth and cunning of the Indians who lived beside them in the wilderness. Battling the French in a no-holds-barred combat, they forged a new brand of honor, became a new breed of men...&lt;strong&gt;MacKinnon's Rangers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iain MacKinnon had been forced to serve the British crown, but compassion urged him to save the lovely lass facing certain death at the hands of the Abenaki. He'd defied his orders, endangered his brothers, his men and his mission, all for a woman. But when he held Annie's sweet body in his arms, he could feel no regret. Though he sensed she was hiding something from him, it was too late to hold back his heart. In love and war, there are times when the only course of action is...&lt;strong&gt;Surrender&lt;/strong&gt;.</description>

  <description>Paige Darlington has a problem. See, she's the former apprentice to Satan's right hand, Becka Gibbs. As a result, she's got this pretty much all consuming need to be bad... not her fault, right? Well, that will be a small comfort when she loses all human emotions, including the ability to love and care about those who matter to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To keep his brother alive, Jed Buchanan works for Satan Jr., the heir to hell and the most evil being in existence. Jed has been forced to do a lot of unsavory things during his time on the "job" and his latest assignment - killing Becka Gibbs - isn't pleasant either. It only gets more complicated when he arrives at Becka's apartment, and inadvertently attacks Paige, a beautiful, sexy demon who decides that saving his black soul will be just the thing to keep her own from rotting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can the Devil's minion and the Devil's assassin possibly find true love?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Her heart may be in the right place...but her soul belongs to Satan.&lt;br&gt;Being Satan's most infamous minion is the only life Becca Gibbs has ever known. But now she's restless, sick and tired of stealing souls, and ready to break free on her own. Unfortunately, this gig isn't like any other job. Its first rule: Walk out on the Devil-and kiss your life good-bye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Rawlings is the last of the Markku, a race of fighters that broke from Hell to pull for the good. When his sister goes missing, and her ransom is the death of Satan, Nick's more than willing to take on the fight. The first step? Getting the devil's sexy right-hand helper on his side. The second? Well, if he can take his eyes-and hands-off of her, he's sure he'll think of it...&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Justine Bennett is cursing her life. She’s the Guardian of the Goblet of Eternal Youth, she hasn’t left the house in ages, and it’s been over 200 years since she’s had sex. Oh, and the Goblet has shape shifted into an espresso machine. Not exactly the stuff grand destiny is made of...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Derek LaValle is worried. Due to a family curse, he’ll be dead in the space of a week unless he finds the Guardian of the Goblet of Eternal Youth and beheads her. Which wouldn’t be a problem if she wasn’t so sexy, smart... and ready to behead him right back.</description>

  <description>In this dazzling, sensual novel, Dianne Duvall beckons readers into a world of vampires, immortals, and humans with extraordinary gifts…where passion can last forever, if you’re willing to pay the price…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once, Sarah Bingham’s biggest challenge was making her students pay attention in class. Now, after rescuing a wounded stranger, she’s landed in the middle of a battle between corrupt vampires and powerful immortals who also need blood to survive. Roland Warbrook is the most compelling man Sarah has ever laid hands on. But his desire for her is mingled with a hunger he can barely control…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his nine centuries of immortal existence, no woman has tempted Roland as much as Sarah. But asking her to love him is impossible—when it means forfeiting the world she’s always known, and the life he would do anything to protect</description>

  <description>In the City of Lights, two star-crossed lovers battle a fate that is destined to tear them apart again and again for eternity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kate Mercier's parents die in a tragic car accident, she leaves her life--and memories--behind to live with her grandparents in Paris. For Kate, the only way to survive her pain is escaping into the world of books and Parisian art. Until she meets Vincent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mysterious, charming, and devastatingly handsome, Vincent threatens to melt the ice around Kate's guarded heart with just his smile. As she begins to fall in love with Vincent, Kate discovers that he's a revenant--an undead being whose fate forces him to sacrifice himself over and over again to save the lives of others. Vincent and those like him are bound in a centuries-old war against a group of evil revenants who exist only to murder and betray. Kate soon realizes that if she follows her heart, she may never be safe again.</description>

  <description>Shattered after her experiences in war-torn Africa, pediatric surgeon Sage Anderson gives up medicine and moves to Eternity Springs.  There she finds a place to call home, but even her newfound success as a gifted artist isn't enough to keep her nightmares at bay.  Colt Rafferty is about to change all that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eternity Springs is a refuge for Colt, a place to ground himself when the stress of investigating tragedies takes its toll.  He has come here for a little R&amp;amp;R, but instead of relaxing, he finds himself fascinated by the mysterious redhead whose secrets beg to be discovered--a beauty running from her past, a heartsick woman in desperate need of the sweet sanctuary of a devoted man's embrace.  And he is just the man to show her the true path to peace--by offering her the healing p0wer of love.</description>

  <description>For five pounds in cash, the convict was hers. Though Cassie hated the slave trade, her Virginia plantation demanded the labor, and she knew this fevered man would surely die if she left him. But as his wounds healed and his muscled chest bronzed from the sun, Cassie realized Cole Braden was far more dangerous than his papers had indicated --- for he could steal her breath with a glance or lay siege to her senses with a touch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abducted, beaten, and given a new name, Alec went from master of an English shipbuilding empire to fourteen years of indentured servitude in the American colonies. There, he was known as Cole Braden, a convicted ravisher and defiler of women. And while he longed to ravish the auburn-haired beauty who owned him, he knew his one hope of earning her love --- and his freedom --- was to prove his true identity. Only then could he turn the tables and attain his ... Sweet Release.</description>

  <description>After the death of her fiancé, Catherine Johnson, a New York schoolteacher in 1901, travels to Nebraska to teach a one-room school and escape her sad memories. One afternoon, violence erupts in the sleepy town. Catherine saves deaf stable hand, Jim Kinney, from torture by drunken thugs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As she takes charge of his education, teaching him to read and sign, attraction grows between them. The warmth and humor in this silent man transcends the need for speech and his eyes tell her all she needs to know about his feelings for her. But the obstacles of class difference and the stigma of his handicap are almost insurmountable barriers to their growing attachment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Catherine flout society’s rules and allow herself to love again? Can Jim make his way out of poverty as a deaf man in a hearing world? And together will they beat the corrupt robber baron who has a stranglehold on the town?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romance, love and sensuality abound in this jam-packed, old-fashioned tale with plenty of heart and some steaming hot sex.</description>

  <description>Haven Antonelli and Carmine DeMarco had vastly different childhoods. Haven, a second-generation slave, grew up isolated in the middle of the desert, her days full of hard work and terrifying abuse. Carmine, born into a wealthy Mafia family, lived a life of privilege, never having to answer for anything he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both now seventeen, a twist of fate causes their worlds to collide, making them question everything they ever believed. Entangled in a web of secrets and lies, they learn that while different on the surface, they have more in common than anyone would think.</description>

  <description>Clementine Kennicutt, a ladylike New Englander, aches to leave her home and her oppressive father.  So when Gus McQueen, a cowboy with laughing eyes and big dreams, presses her to elope with him to his Montana ranch, she is ready.  But nothing has prepared her for the harsh realities of frontier life, or for the unpredictable hankering of her heart--and least of all for the fact that almost from the first moment she sets eyes on Zach, Gus's dashing, ne'er  do-well brother, she knows he's the one she was destined to love.  Brought up to be a lady, Clementine determines not to let the frontier--or her marriage--defeat her.  She devours life, befriending the town prostitute, defending Indians, and suppressing her heart's desire, until Zach forces her to face him and make her choice.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a vast canvas dotted with memorable characters and one rousing adventure after another--shootups, storms, a mine explosion, an attack by a rabid wolf, Penny Williamson has created an irresistible work of fiction that combines the heroic and gritty appeal of westerns like Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo with the romantic enchantment of The Thorn Birds..</description>

  <description>Thrown off a wagon train with two other women and trying to avoid jail for a murder they committed, Bailee Moore agrees to enter a "wife lottery"--a ploy concocted by the Cedar Point sheriff to secure wives for the men in the small Texas town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the sensible Bailee, however, marrying Carter McKoy is like exchanging one life sentence for another--especially since her new husband hasn't even seen fit to utter a single word in her presence. But still, she can't help thinking that something about this strong, silent farmer could be the key to leaving her troubled past behind...and making a worthy wager with her heart.</description>

  <description>A Ride On the Wild Side&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last place Catherine MacPherson ever expected to find herself was sitting on a Greyhound bus, handcuffed to a surly bounty hunter, with only a suitcase of her twin sister's flashy, shrink-wrap clothing to wear! Just two hours ago, the respectable schoolteacher was sitting quietly at home when this macho hunk crashed through her door, mistook her for her errant Miami showgirl sister, and hauled her off in his strong arms. And no matter how sexy he is, she's furious!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twins--ha! Sam McKade's the last person to ever fall for that line. He's finally got the gorgeous, leggy redhead just where he wants her--and no matter what outrageous tricks she pulls, he's not letting her get away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is, she's a lot smarter--and sweeter--than he'd expected. And he's got this deep-buried tenderness she hadn't expected. And their kisses are so hot, they just might burn up... before they sort it all out.</description>

  <description>Drake Vireo, the green dragon of Aisling's dreams, is finally ready to make an honest woman of her-if she can ever get him to the altar. Being stood up cools Aisling's jets, but not her passion, which is a good thing when Drake disappears and it's up to Aisling to find him. At least her doggie demon Jim is always at her side. Just call him a Guardian's best friend.</description>

  <description>Aisling Grey is juggling being a demon lord, a Guardian, and a wyvern's mate, even though she's keeping her distance from said wyvern, Drake, these days. But her presence is still required at a meeting of the green dragons. Since several attempts have been made on her life, Drake is sure to get protective of her. Which might not be a bad thing when war breaks out and all hell breaks loose--literally. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a "Goddess evoking" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger. At first the ever-practical Joy is ready to dismiss her vision as a product of too much gin and too many vampire romances, but while traveling through the Czech Republic with Roxy, Joy begins to have some second thoughts about her mystery lover because she is suddenly plagued by visions of a lethally handsome stranger. Then, when she and Roxy attend a local GothFaire, Joy meets Raphael Griffin St. John, head of security, and she becomes even more bewildered because the dark and dangerous Raphael seems too close to her dreams for comfort.</description>

  <description>Lucy Merritt has always defined herself by her body, whether dancing in a small avant-garde company or posing for art. But she has always felt as if something is wrong with her, as if something is missing. She has never been in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, in the darkness of the theater wings, a strangely affecting man enters her life. Matthew Norris, rich, handsome patron of the dance company, has decided that he wants Lucy for his own. He makes her an offer that both frightens and compels her, and they soon begin an affair characterized by only two requirements: beauty and truth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how truthful are Matthew and Lucy? How much of Matthew's strenuous brand of love can Lucy endure? And how long can their rigid Dom/sub relationship stay frozen in time, never growing, never moving forward?</description>

  <description>It's all about family ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sookie Stackhouse is dealing with a whole host of family problems, ranging from her own kin (a non-human fairy and a telepathic second cousin) demanding a place in her life, to her lover Eric's vampire sire, an ancient being who arrives with Eric's 'brother' in tow at a most inopportune moment. And Sookie's tracking down a distant relation of her ailing neighbour (and ex), Vampire Bill Compton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the multitude of family issues complicating her life, the werewolf pack of Shreveport has asked Sookie for a special favour, and since Sookie is an obliging young woman, she agrees. But this favour for the wolves has dire results for Sookie, who is still recovering from the trauma of her abduction during the Fairy War.</description>

  <description>After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not. And Sookie, Friend to the Pack and blood-bonded to Eric Northman, leader of the local vampire community is caught up in the changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the ensuing battles, Sookie faces danger, death, and once more, betrayal by someone she loves. And when the fur has finished flying and the cold blood finished flowing, her world will be forever altered.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;She was his brother's wife...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arriving on the Fort Worth train, Miss Amelia Carson, mail-order bride, had never met Dallas Leigh, the Texan she promised to marry. The tall cowboy at the station wasn't Dallas. He was Houston, Dallas's brother, sent to escort her on the rugged three-week trek to the ranch where Dallas waited. Brought up in war-ravaged Georgia, Amelia thought Dallas's letters made Texas sound like heaven, a place for her dreams to grow with the right man beside her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And his only love...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By all appearances, Houston Leigh would hardly be considered the "right man." The war he survived had scarred him inside and out, and he was little competition for his handsome brother. But from the moment Houston met Amelia, he knew she possessed the courage this wild land needed. She had eyes that could see past his wounded face to his soul. And he would fight any man—except his brother—for her heart. Now he and Amelia were riding down dangerous trails, sleeping under the stars, and God help them, they were falling in love.</description>

  <description>Caleb is a man with a singular interest in revenge. Kidnapped as a young boy and sold into slavery by a power-hungry mobster, he has thought of nothing but vengeance. For twelve years he has immersed himself in the world of pleasure slaves searching for the one man he holds ultimately responsible. Finally, the architect of his suffering has emerged with a new identity, but not a new nature. If Caleb is to get close enough to strike, he must become the very thing he abhors and kidnap a beautiful girl to train her to be all that he once was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen-year-old Olivia Ruiz has just woken up in a strange place. Blindfolded and bound, there is only a calm male voice to welcome her. His name is Caleb, though he demands to be called Master. Olivia is young, beautiful, naïve and willful to a fault. She has a dark sensuality that cannot be hidden or denied, though she tries to accomplish both. Although she is frightened by the strong, sadistic, and arrogant man who holds her prisoner, what keeps Olivia awake in the dark is her unwelcome attraction to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: This book contains very disturbing situations, dubious consent, strong language, and graphic violence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Our journey began in fire...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness—beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other's most private wounds... and desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 March 1811.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Today I fell in love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of ten, Miss Miranda Cheever showed no signs of ever becoming a Great Beauty. Her hair was lamentably brown, her eyes the same muddy colour, and her legs, which were uncommonly long, refused to learn anything which might remotely be called grace. Only, in 1811, the nineteen-year-old Viscount Turner—elder brother of Miranda's closest friend—had kissed the hand of an awkward ten-year-old girl and promised her that one day she'd be as beautiful as she was smart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, eight years later, Miranda is a woman grown, and Turner an embittered widower. But she has never forgotten his kindness. Indeed it is only in her diary that she confides the truth: she has never stopped loving Turner, and she has never stopped hoping that one day he will see her as more than a naive girl.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton Series: Book 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir Phillip knew from his correspondence with his dead wife's distant cousin that Eloise Bridgerton was a spinster, and so he'd proposed, figuring that she'd be homely and unassuming, and more than a little desperate for an offer of marriage. Except . . . she wasn't. The beautiful woman on his doorstep was anything but quiet, and when she stopped talking long enough to close her mouth, all he wanted to do was kiss her...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eloise Bridgerton couldn't marry a man she had never met! But then she started thinking... and wondering... and before she knew it, she was in a hired carriage in the middle of the night, on her way to meet the man she hoped might be her perfect match. Except... he wasn't. Her perfect husband wouldn't be so moody and ill-mannered. And he certainly should have mentioned that he had two young - and decidedly unruly - children, as much in need of a mother as Phillip is in need of a wife.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;There are two things everyone knows about Alexander Ridgely.  One, he's the Duke of Ashbourne.  And two, he has no plans to marry anytime soon...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is until a redheaded American throws herself in front of a carriage to save his young nephew's life.  She's everything Alex never thought a woman could be—smart and funny, principled and brave.  But she's a servant, completely unsuitable for a highborn duke—unless, perhaps, she's not quite what she seems...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American heiress Emma Dunster might be surrounded by Englishmen, but that doesn't mean she intends to marry one—even if she has agreed to participate in one London Season.  When she slipped out of her cousins' home, dressed as a kitchen maid, all she wanted was one last taste of anonymity before her debut.  She never dreamed she'd find herself in the arms of a dangerously handsome duke... or that he'd be &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; so upset when he discovered her true identity.  But true love tends to blossom just when one least expects it, and passion can melt even the most stubborn of hearts.</description>

  <description>From the Design Book of Marcelline Noirot:&lt;br&gt;The allure of the perfect gown should be twofold:&lt;br&gt;ladies would die to wear it . . .&lt;br&gt;and gentlemen would kill to remove it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brilliant and ambitious dressmaker Marcelline Noirot is London's rising star. And who better to benefit from her talent than the worst-dressed lady in the ton, the Duke of Clevedon's intended bride? Winning the future duchess's patronage means prestige and fortune for Marcelline and her sisters. To get to the lady, though, Marcelline must win over Clevedon, whose standards are as high as his morals are . . . not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prize seems well worth the risk—but this time, Marcelline's met her match. Clevedon can design a seduction as irresistible as her dresses; and what begins as a flicker of desire between two of the most passionately stubborn charmers in London soon ignites into a delicious inferno . . .and a blazing scandal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now both their futures hang by an exquisite thread of silk . . .</description>

The authors of &lt;em&gt;Unlaced&lt;/em&gt; returns in an all-new anthology of stories about corsets, and un-corseted desires. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Rough hands rounding the curves of a soft warm body-caressing, stroking, edging her toward exquisite pleasure. Seduction is a cinch in these four sizzling stories from the hot authors of &lt;em&gt;Unlaced&lt;/em&gt;. And that's not just talk. These women deliver...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaci Burton&lt;/strong&gt; breaks the rule about mixing business with pleasure...&lt;strong&gt;Jasmine Haynes&lt;/strong&gt; explores the lust of a former supermodel who needs to finally fulfill a no-holds-barred sexual fantasy...&lt;strong&gt;Joey W. Hill&lt;/strong&gt; reveals the erotic bond between a master and the beautiful submissive who stole his heart...And &lt;strong&gt;Denise Rossetti&lt;/strong&gt; goes beyond the limits of desire when she pairs a battle-scarred veteran of love and war with a woman who's just as fearless and twice as dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Part of the Knights of the Board Room series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel gave up seeking a Master years ago. After a failed marriage and terrible tragedy, she’s walled her soul against going down that dangerous path again. Then Jon joins her yoga class. He’s thirteen years younger than she, but his Dominant nature threatens her shields from the moment she recognizes it. Not only does he understand what her body wants—he knows what her soul craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of the five-man executive team of Kensington &amp;amp; Associates, Jon uses his calm, philosophical nature to defuse volatile acquisition negotiations. He can compel opponents to willingly surrender when he draws the sword that closes the deal. As a sexual Dominant, he employs that same expertise. A spiritually-driven Master who enjoys connecting with a woman’s soul, he wins her utter submission with his skills. But with Rachel, it goes beyond that. She’s the submissive his own soul has always hungered to have, and he won’t hesitate to use his talents, as well as that of the other four K&amp;amp;A men, to claim her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher’s Note: Rachel’s sensual journey to healing contains light female/female exploration and group sex.</description>

  <description>Savannah was groomed from birth to take the reins of her father’s manufacturing empire. Her emotional armor is as tough as the steel used in her factories, and nobody is allowed past it. Business partner Matt realizes that the key to entry is to command her submission. Calling on the unique sensual talents of his four-man management team, he engineers an aggressive and erotic takeover, determined to rescue the woman he loves from the steel cage she’s manufactured around her heart. Masked and lost to the sensations the team arouses in her, Savannah is theirs, at least for this one night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher’s Note:  Originally published in the Behind the Mask anthology.</description>

  <description>Tired of being walked all over and ignored, Jamie decided that it was time to make something out of her life. She sold her company, signed a contract and was determined to live it up. Only problem, she was a bit of a recluse, painfully shy, kind of clumsy and didn't know the first thing about living it up. Thankfully she has a very sexy, very determined editor to help her along the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was everything he could ever want, popular and in demand, but unfortunately for him the author that he needed to make a name for himself was also a little recluse who wasn't doing what he needed her to do. In order to get her to do what he wants he decides to help her in her little quest for a life and ends up with more than he bargained for.</description>

  <description>Zoe is used to taking care of herself and has long ago accepted that if anything bad was going to happen, it was going to happen to her. So when she loses her job over something most bosses would probably be happy with and her life starts going down hill from there she doesn't expect it to get any better. She certainly didn't expect any help from the loud jerk next door, but then again she has nothing to lose so puts her trust in him and hopes for the best. What she didn't expect was the once in a lifetime opportunity that he offers her through an arrangement where they both benefit and no one is supposed to get hurt, but she should have known better because her luck has never been that good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most Bradfords, Trevor has a soft spot for food, but that's about all. He leads a pretty straightforward life and likes to keep things simple and that includes his relationships. He wants the perfect woman and knows exactly what she'll be like. So when he discovers much to his horror that he's thinking about his frumpy little neighbor he decides the best way to get his head straight is by working her out of his system. He'll keep her around, but only until he finds perfection.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Three determined young ladies vow to give three of London's worst rakes their comeuppance -- but when these rogues turn the tables, who truly learns a lesson in love?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, the notorious Viscount Dare charmed Lady Georgiana Halley out of her innocence -- to win a wager, no less! -- and now he must pay dearly. The, plan is simple: She will use every seductive wile she knows to win Dare's heart...and then break it. But his smoldering gaze once again tempts Georgiana to give in to desire -- and when he astonishes her with a marriage proposal, she wonders: Is he playing yet another game...or could it truly be love this time?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>DETERMINED LADY &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tough-minded Jessica Trent's sole intention is to free her nitwit brother from the destructive influence of Sebastian Ballister, the notorious Marquess of Dain. She never expects to desire the arrogant, amoral cad. And when Dain's reciprocal passion places them in a scandalously compromising, and public, position, Jessica is left with no choice but to seek satisfaction ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LORD OF SCOUNDRELS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damn the minx for tempting him, kissing him ... and then forcing him to salvage her reputation! Lord Dain can't wait to put the infuriating bluestocking in her place --- and in some amorous position, And if that means marriage, so be it! --- though Sebastian is less than certain he can continue to remain aloof ... and steel his heart to the sensuous, headstrong lady's considerable charms.</description>

  <description>A ferocious conflict of wills...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vere Mallory, the Duke of Ainswood, has everything--he's titled, he's rich, he's devastatingly good looking--and he seems determined to throw it all away. Disreputable, reckless, and wild, the last of the Mallory hellions is racing headlong to self-destruction...until a mind numbingly beautiful blonde Amazon knocks him off his feet--literally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An incendiary passion...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lydia Grenville is dedicated to protecting London's downtrodden. Dissolute noblemen like Ainswood are part of the problem, not the solution. She would like him to get his big, gorgeous carcass out of her way so that she can carry on with her work. The problem is, Ainswood can no more resist a challenge, especially in female form, than he can resist the trouble she seems to attract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they can only weather their personal firestorm...they might survive the real danger that threatens all they hold dear.</description>

  <description>Four young ladies enter London society with one common goal: they must use their feminine wit and wiles to find a husband. So a daring husband-hunting scheme is born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Annabelle Peyton, determined to save her family from disaster, decides to use her beauty and wit to tempt a suitable nobleman into making an offer of marriage. But Annabelle's most intriguing--and persistent--admirer, wealthy, powerful Simon Hunt, has made it clear that while he will introduce her to irresistible pleasure he will not offer marriage. Annabelle is determined to resist his unthinkable proposition . . . but it is impossible in the face of such skillful seduction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her friends, looking to help, conspire to entice a more suitable gentleman to offer for Annabelle, for only then will she be safe from Simon--and her own longings. But on one summer night, Annabelle succumbs to Simon's passionate embrace and tempting kisses . . . and she discovers that love is the most dangerous game of all.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“Lord Nicholas is a paragon of manhood. And his eyes, Dear Reader! So blue!” Pearls &amp;amp; Pelisses, June 1823&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since being named on of London’s “Lords to Land” by a popular ladies’ magazine, Nicholas St. John has been relentlessly pursued by every matrimony-minded female in the ton. So when an opportunity to escape fashionable society presents itself, he eagerly jumps—only to land in the path of the most determined, damnably delicious woman he’s ever met!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The daughter of a titled wastrel, Lady Isabel Townsend has too many secrets and too little money. Though used to taking care of herself quite handily, her father’s recent passing has left Isabel at sea and in need of outside help to protect her young brother’s birthright. The sinfully handsome, eminently eligible Lord Nicholas could be the very salvation she seeks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the lady must be wary and not do anything reckless…like falling madly, passionately in love.</description>

  <description>There is no telling where a scandal might lead...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She lives for passion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bold, impulsive, and a magnet for trouble, Juliana Fiori is no simpering English miss. She refuses to play by society’s rules: she speaks her mind, cares nothing for the approval of the ton, and can throw a punch with remarkable accuracy. Her scandalous nature makes her a favorite subject of London’s most practiced gossips…and precisely the kind of woman the Duke of Leighton wants far far away from him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He swears by reputation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scandal is the last thing Simon Pearson has room for in his well-ordered world. The Duke of Disdain is too focused on keeping his title untainted and his secrets unknown. But when he discovers Juliana hiding in his carriage late one evening–risking everything he holds dear–he swears to teach the reckless beauty a lesson in propriety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has other plans, however; she wants two weeks to prove that even an unflappable duke is not above passion.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A lady does not smoke cheroot. She does not ride astride. She does not fence or attend duels. She does not fire a pistol, and she never gambles at a gentlemen's club.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lady Calpurnia Hartwell has always followed the rules, rules that have left her unmarried—and more than a little unsatisfied. And so she's vowed to break the rules and live the life of pleasure she's been missing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to dance every dance, to steal a midnight kiss—to do those things, Callie will need a willing partner. Someone who knows everything about rule-breaking. Someone like Gabriel St. John, the Marquess of Ralston—charming and devastatingly handsome, his wicked reputation matched only by his sinful smile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she's not careful, she'll break the most important rule of all—the one that says that pleasure-seekers should never fall hopelessly, desperately in love.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Four young ladies enter London society and band together to each find a husband. Has the third "Wallflower" now met her match?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Devil's Bargain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easily the shyest Wallflower, Evangeline Jenner stands to become the wealthiest, once her inheritance comes due. Because she must first escape the clutches of her unscrupulous relatives, Evie has approached the rake Viscount St. Vincent with a most outrageous proposition: &lt;em&gt;marriage!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sebastian's reputation is so dangerous that thirty seconds alone with him will ruin any maiden's good name. Still, this bewitching chit appeared, &lt;em&gt;unchaperoned&lt;/em&gt;, on his doorstep to offer her hand. Certainly an aristocrat with a fine eye for beauty could do far worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Evie's proposal comes with a condition: no lovemaking after their wedding night. She will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; become just another of the dashing libertine's callously discarded broken hearts --- which means Sebastian will simply have to work harder at his seductions ... or perhaps surrender his own heart for the very first time in the name of true love.</description>

  <description>Before an estranged couple is killed in an unthinkable tragedy, they designate two guardians for their children--a man and a woman who are essentially strangers and who have nothing in common except their compassion for the couple's three orphaned children. Thrown into this strange semblance of family, Sean McGuire and Lily Robinson work together to establish some kind of normalcy for the grief-stricken children--and in the process discover the possibilities that make everything seem worthwhile.</description>

  <description>It isn't easy to be a female physician in 1894, but Leah Mundy is fiercely committed to healing her fellow humans. Being awakened in the dark of night to heal the sick is a common occurrence, but never before has she woke to a threatening gun barrel and a dangerous stranger demanding her services. Outlaw Jackson Underhill is grimly determined that the doctor will save his childhood friend, but nothing about his difficult and dark past has prepared him for the changes the beautiful doctor will bring to his life. When Leah manages to disable his sailboat and force him to bring his "wife" to her boarding home to be cared for, Jackson has no option but to comply, setting forces in motion that will change both of their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Leah Mundy is a strong but emotionally vulnerable woman who has struggled her entire life to win the approval of her difficult, indifferent father. Now that he is dead, she is determined to build a life on Puget Sound's beautiful Whidbey Island. Accused of committing a murder he can't deny, outlaw Jackson Underhill is a man on the run, committed to saving his childhood friend while eluding the law. Leah is a woman who cannot leave the island that has become her sanctuary and Jackson Underhill is a man who cannot stay. Reason and logic tell them that they should never have fallen in love, but their hearts ignore all warnings. Inexorably drawn together by circumstance and fate, what possible resolution can bring them happiness and not disaster? Thrown together by chance, they find a love that neither of them had ever dared hope for - but darker forces and old alliances threaten their chance at happiness. With crisp, clean writing, Ms. Wiggs deftly weaves a seamless tale set against the background of the sea and sky of the Pacific Northwest. The beauty of Puget Sound pulses from every page, elevating the land and elements of nature to the level of a living character that is essential to the healing of Jackson and Leah's inner scars. Emotionally intense and well-plotted, The Drifter has all the components of a great summer read and is a jewel of a novel.</description>

  <description>Dear Reader,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly a decade ago, I published my fist novel with Avon Books, Only in Your Arms.  Since then, romance has changed-and so have I—so I decided to give the book a makeover—and a new title, When Strangers Marry.  I have two reasons for changing the title.  First, it is in keeping with the new spirit of the book; second, no one—including my own mother—found the original one memorable!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In When Strangers Marry, I had a great time rediscovering the story of Maximilien Vallerand and his stolen bride, Lysette.  The promise of this handsome, though mysterious, man's love proves irresistable to her, but she doesn't know the secrets he hides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I hope you will enjoy revisiting the Vallerand family, or perhaps meeting them for the first time.  And, as always thank you for your support and encouragement, as we escape together into the magical world of romance novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wishing you love and happiness,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lisa</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The first in a sensational new series, Jill Shalvis introduces Cameron, Stone, and T.J. Wilder—three bad-boy heroes who effortlessly mix breathtaking adventure and scorching sex appeal...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Wild... And Then Get Wilder...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accountant Katie Kramer is a quintessential good girl—working hard, recycling diligently, all the while trying to ignore the feeling that she doesn't fit in anywhere. That's all she wants. Well, that—and amazing sex, and the kind of daredevil escapade she can look back on when she's crunching numbers in a dusty cubicle. Which explains why she just took a job in Wishful, California, working for Wilder Adventures and Expeditions. Waking up to find a magnificently built stranger towering over her bed—that part defies explanation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After wandering the planet for months following a life-changing accident, Cameron Wilder has come back to the only home he knows. Under other circumstances, he might be thrilled to find a gorgeous woman sleeping in his cabin, but now, while he'll risk his body taking clients on adrenaline-drenched excursions, his heart is off limits. Still, Katie's killer smile triggers something deep in his gut... among other places. Showing her how exhilarating it can be to stop balancing her life as if it was a checkbook is the biggest rush he's ever felt—and an adventure Katie's wishing would never end...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling author Lisa Kleypas creates a beguiling story, set in a world where appearance means everything, passion simmers just below the surface, and a respectable Englishwoman is willing to risk scandal for one night of love.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was unmarried, untouched and almost thirty, but novelist Amanda Briars wasn't about to greet her next birthday without making love to a man. When he appeared at her door, she believed he was her gift to herself, hired for one night of passion. Unforgettably handsome, irresistibly virile, he tempted her in ways she never thought possible, but something stopped him from completely fulfilling her dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Devlin's determination to possess Amanda became greater when she discovered his true identity. But gently bred Amanda craved respectability more than she admitted, while Jack, the cast-off son of a nobleman and London's most notorious businessman, refused to live by society's rules. Yet when fate conspired for them to marry, their worlds collided with a passionate force neither had expected. . . but both soon craved.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Their lives defy convention.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an unexpected inheritance elevates her family to the ranks of the aristocracy, Amelia Hathaway discovers that tending to her younger sisters and wayward brother was easy compared to navigating the intricacies of the &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt;. Even more challenging: the attraction she feels for the tall, dark, and dangerously handsome Cam Rohan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Their desire consumes them both.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wealthy beyond most men’s dreams, Cam has tired of society’s petty restrictions and longs to return to his “uncivilized” Gypsy roots. When the delectable Amelia appeals to him for help, he intends to offer only friendship—but intentions are no match for the desire that blindsides them both. But can a man who spurns tradition be tempted into that most time-honored arrangement: marriage? Life in London society is about to get a whole lot hotter…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;It's the beginning of another season in the seaside resort town of Winslow, Rhode Island, and Rosa Capoletti is given the chance to rediscover the pleasures of love and laughter, food and wine, friendship and romance ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a little determination and a lot of charm, Rosa Capoletti took a run-down pizza joint and turned it into an award-winning restaurant that has been voted "best place to propose" three years in a row. For Rosa, though, there has been no real romance since her love affair with Alexander Montgomery ended suddenly and without explanation a decade ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Rosa's life takes an unexpected turn when Alexander arrives back in town and asks for her help sorting through his late mother's affairs. Reunited at the beach house where they first met and fell in love, Rosa and Alexander discover that the secrets of the past are not what they seem. Now, with all that she wants right in front of her, Rosa searches for happiness with the man who once broke her heart --- and learns that in love, as in life, there are second chances.</description>

  <description>Unexpected change can be like a breath of fresh air-a little brisk at first, but magic for the body and soul.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarah Moon tackles life's issues with a sharp wit in her syndicated comic strip Just Breathe. With both Sarah and her cartoon heroine undergoing fertility treatments, her fiction often reflects her reality. However, she hadn't scripted her husband's infidelity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the wake of her shattered marriage, Sarah flees to the coastal town in Northern California where she grew up. There, she revisits her troubling past: an emotionally distant father, the loss of her mother and an unexpected connection with Will Bonner, the high school heartthrob skewered mercilessly in her comics. But he's been through some changes himself. And just as her heart is about to reawaken, Sarah makes a most startling discovery. She's pregnant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The winds of change have led Sarah to this surprising new beginning. All she can do is just close her eyes...and breathe.</description>

  <description>Posey Osterhagen can't complain. She owns a successful architectural salvaging company, she's surrounded by her lovable, if off-center, family and she has a boyfriend—sort of. Still, something's missing. Something tall, brooding and criminally good-looking—something like Liam Murphy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Posey was sixteen, the bad boy of Bellsford, New Hampshire, broke her heart. But now he's back, sending Posey's traitorous schoolgirl heart into overdrive once again. She should be giving him a wide berth, but it seems fate has other ideas….</description>

  <description>Olivia Lockhart&lt;br&gt;Cedar Cove, Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Reader, You don't know me yet, but in a few hours that's going to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see, I'm inviting you to my home and my town of Cedar Cove because I want you to meet my family, friends and neighbors. Come and hear their stories—maybe even their secrets!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have to admit that my own secrets are pretty open. My marriage failed some years ago, and I have a rather…difficult relationship with my daughter, Justine. Then there's my mother, Charlotte, who has plenty of opinions and is always willing to share them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's an example. I'm a family court judge and she likes to drop in on my courtroom. Recently I was hearing a divorce petition. In my mother's view, young Cecilia and Ian Randall hadn't tried hard enough to make their marriage work—and I actually agreed. So I rendered my judgment: Divorce Denied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, you wouldn't believe the reaction! Thanks to an article by Jack Griffin, the editor of our local paper (and a man I wouldn't mind seeing more of), everyone's talking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cedar Cove—people love it and sometimes they leave it, but they never forget it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See you soon…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Olivia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Book club-published hardcover edition of the bestselling romance novel.</description>

  <description>Who knew a rose could hurt so good?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Valentine's Day is the busiest day of the year for Harper Allison and her cupcake bakery. She's not personally interested in the trumped up holiday until she receives an anonymous gift with explicit instructions that include a rendezvous at the most upscale BDSM club in the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment Alex lays eyes on Harper at the Glass Kat Club he wants her. And what Alex wants Alex gets. He formulates a plan with his best friend, one guaranteed to fulfill Harper’s unspoken desires and hidden fantasies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for Alex, one night is all Harper is prepared to give. Her life is complicated enough without having two Doms pushing her to submit, no matter how incredibly sexy they are. Until the familiar voice of a stranger reminds her…Maybe she doesn’t know Alex at all.</description>

  <description>Eva's desperate denial only means one thing...she has a lot to learn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eve Blake has been working at Altered Ego, a studio specializing in fetish photography, for three months when a custom order comes in for a plus-sized redhead. Ready for an adventure, she volunteers for the job. Chase, her boss, reluctantly accepts. Maybe pretending to be a sexual slave for Chase’s camera will get her one step closer to the two men she thinks can satisfy even her darkest needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase can’t believe he’s agreed to this deal. The cardinal rule in any business is not to get involved with your employees and that includes your sexy receptionist. He and his partner Murphy learned that lesson the hard way. Now Chase has a hunch the first time they touch their rope to Eve’s creamy flesh, there will be no turning back. They’ll have to have her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One shoot leads to another and Eve finds herself at a playground at midnight. When the scene takes a dark turn, Eve sinks deeper into sensation at the hands of two masters who push for her ultimate surrender. Will she reach the limit of how far she can go, or will the ties that bind form bonds of love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: anal play/intercourse, strong BDSM elements, menage (m/f/m), brief knife play, mild choking.</description>

  <description>Eager to understand her secret desires, Gabrielle enters “The Sanctuary.” Inside she’s immediately torn between fear of the unknown and a craving to learn more, until the lights dim. From the first sound of Thomas’ calm and controlled voice, she is mesmerized. With an underlying need in her emotional spirit that requires more than sex, she is easily seduced into a world of dominance and submission under false pretenses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Thomas, an experienced Master, Gabrielle is an interesting mix of defiant, naive and submissive. Her sharp mind and wit appeal to him as much as the curves of her lush figure. He accepts the challenge to help train her despite the danger she represents. Long term anything for him is out of the question. If he does his job right, his protégé David will end up the perfect Dom for her and Thomas will move on with his armor intact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their journey puts Gabrielle at the mercy of two men who teach her how to embrace her darkest needs within a tight bond of trust. Unfortunately, betrayal lurks on the path to total surrender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CATEGORY: Contemporary Romance, BDSM, Ménage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ELEMENTS: Spanking, Toys/BDSM Tools, Bondage, Ménage, 24/7 D/s Lifestyle, Training, Anal Play, Adult situations, Exhibitionism, Strong Sexual Content, Domination/submission.</description>

  <description>Savannah Gentry, now Savi Baker, escaped the torture and degradation forced upon her by a sadistic father for eleven years and has made a safe life for herself and her daughter. When her father threatens her peace of mind—and her daughter's safety—Savi runs to Damián Orlando for protection. Their one day together eight years earlier changed both their lives and resulted in a secret she can no longer hide. But being with Damián reawakens feelings she wants buried—and stirs up an onslaught of disturbing flashbacks that leave her shaken to the core with little hope of ever being a sexual being again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damián has his own dragons to fight, but has never forgotten the one perfect day he spent with Savannah in a cave at the beach. He will go to the ends of the earth to protect Savi and her daughter, but can never be the whole man she deserves after a firefight in Iraq. Besides, the trauma of war and resulting PTSD has led him to find his place as the Masters at Arms Club's favorite sadist. Savi needs someone gentle and loving, not the broken man he has become. But he sees that the lifestyle he's come to embrace also can help Savi regain control of her life and sexuality. How can he not help redirect her negative thoughts and actions if she needs him?</description>

  <description>One day while watching the Interstate exit for her dad’s long awaited return, Libby’s life is rocked when Peter Jamieson steps off his tour bus and into her life. After a couple chance meetings with Peter, Libby breaks away from her rule abiding behavior and her life changes course. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peter longs for normalcy away from the screaming fans who know nothing about the real him. He is amazed to discover Libby has never heard of him or his band. Soon their friendship turns to love. While Peter battles his family's growing interference so he can spend time with Libby, she struggles with her eccentric aunt who turns more bizarre each day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their lives are torn apart when Peter's family intrudes and Libby disappears. Peter’s desperate search for her comes up empty. Can they find their way back to each other while the world plots against them?</description>

  <description>Helen Decatur spent a lifetime setting goals--getting through college and law school, opening her own practice, becoming financially secure and establishing herself as one of the most highly respected matrimonial attorneys in the state of South Carolina. Achieving those goals was a breeze compared to the one she's faced with now. The most driven--and cynical--of the Sweet Magnolias, Helen is forty-two, single and suddenly ready for the family she's put on the back burner for all these years. Unfortunately, having a child at her age comes with lots of complications, not the least of which is the absence of a serious relationship in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Helen's not the type of woman to wait around for fate to step in. Taking charge of her own destiny puts her at odds with her two best friends, sets sparks flying with a man who doesn't want a family, and leads her straight into the most unexpected complication of all...love.</description>

  <description>Dana Sue might run the best little restaurant in Serenity, but when you're feeding a small town of neighbors, busybodies and best friends, things can get a bit hot in the kitchen. Never mind that she's putting on too many pounds (an occupational hazard for a chef)—she's worried about her too-skinny teenage daughter, Annie, who has been slowly starving herself since the loud, suitcase-tossing, name-calling fit on her front lawn that left Dana Sue minus one cheating husband.   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes life picks strange ways to mend fences. When Annie lands in the hospital, Dana Sue reaches out to the man she loves to hate: Ron, the husband who took her heart when she tossed him out. Ron is still Annie's white knight, even if he's decidedly more tarnished in Dana Sue's eyes. But he still looks good enough to eat, and maybe, just maybe, to forgive. Once, Ron made the mistake of letting go without a proper fight. But now Dana Sue is about to get another taste of sweet devotion from a man tired of feeling like a fool, hungry for that slice of heaven he found with her.—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>One in a million—that's what widow Stephanie Wynne figured her chances were of finding a man who could help her raise her kids instead of acting like one himself. After experiencing that with her late husband, she was happy to finally be in control of her own life. Sure, it could get a little lonely, but there were ways around that….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FBI negotiator Nash Harmon was trained to be cool and detached in every situation. But when he came to Stephanie's B&amp;amp;B, there was something about her lively family that drew him in, and for the first time in his life he understood why people had ties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only Stephanie didn't want ties…at least, not to him. It would be his toughest negotiation, the odds were against him, but somehow Nash would convince her that she had, indeed, found the one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BONUS BOOK INCLUDED IN THIS VOLUME!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Dad for Her Twins by Tanya Michaels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kenzie Green wasn’t looking for a man to complete her family. Yet her enigmatic neighbor, Jonathan Trelauney, seemed to know just how to handle her children. Can JT make Kenzie see he’s the right man for her twins…and for her?</description>

  <description>Wedding bells are ringing in Fool&amp;amp;#39;s Gold, but not for Nevada Hendrix. Her triplet sisters are engaged, and even her mother has a more active love life than she does. Determined to make a fresh start, she applies for her dream job, only to discover that her new boss is her first love. Maybe she could overlook the fact that they&amp;amp;#39;ve seen each other naked, but she&amp;amp;#39;ll never forget the way he broke her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tucker Janack agrees to Nevada&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;#34;business only&amp;amp;#34; ground rules. After all, love is a trap that the construction millionaire has avoided his whole life. But when great business partners turn out to be so much more, every rule gets broken. Will either of them be willing to try again&amp;amp;#133;or will their past get in the way?</description>

  <description>Beloved bestselling author Mallery is back with the first title in a brand-new trilogy in her popular and emotional Fool's Gold series. Original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t win if you don’t play…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her town’s lack of men may make headlines, but it isn’t news to Dakota Hendrix. The beautiful blonde has bigger problems to deal with, such as overseeing the romance reality competition filming in Fool’s Gold. Screening eligible bachelors is a difficult enough task, but Dakota hits an unexpected snag when a sexy stranger comes to town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finn Anderssen will do anything to keep his twin brothers—the perfect contestants—off the show. Despite Dakota’s better judgment, she finds herself drawn to the mysterious outsider. Like her, Finn knows about heartbreak and how a family can fall apart, so she doesn’t dare to hope for anything more than a fling. After all, even in the Land of Happy Endings, finding true love is never as easy as it looks on TV.</description>

  <description>Montana Hendrix has found her calling&amp;amp;#151;working with therapy dogs. With a career she loves in a hometown she adores, she&amp;amp;#39;s finally ready to look for her own happily ever after. Could one of her dogs help her find Mr. Right&amp;amp;#133;or maybe Dr. Right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surgeon Simon Bradley prefers the sterility of the hospital to the messiness of real life, especially when real life includes an accident-prone mutt and a woman whose kisses make him want what he knows he can&amp;amp;#39;t have. Scarred since childhood, he avoids emotional entanglement by moving from place to place to heal children who need his skillful touch. Can his growing feelings for Montana lead him to find a home in Fool&amp;amp;#39;s Gold, or will he walk away, taking her broken heart with him?</description>

  <description>"New York Times"-bestselling author of the Sweet Magnolia series welcomes readers to Chesapeake Shores, a Maryland town built by the father of Abby O'Brien Winters, who returns after years away to renovate the charming Inn at Eagle Point with her younger sister. Original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's been years since Abby O'Brien Winters set foot in Chesapeake Shores. The Maryland town her father built has too many sad memories and Abby too few spare moments, thanks to her demanding Wall Street career, the crumbling of her marriage and energetic twin daughters. Then one panicked phone call from her youngest sister brings her racing back home to protect Jess's dream of renovating the charming Inn at Eagle Point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But saving the inn from foreclosure means dealing not only with her own fractured family, but also with Trace Riley, the man Abby left ten years ago. Trace can be a roadblock to her plans...or proof that second chances happen in the most unexpected ways.</description>

  <description>Welcome to Fool's Gold, California, a charming community in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. There's lots to do and plenty of people to meet, especially women. Because there's just one tiny problem in Fool's Gold: the men don't seem to stick around. Maybe it's the lure of big-city life, or maybe it's plain old bad luck, but regardless of the reason, the problem has to be fixed, fast. And Charity Jones may be just the city planner to do it. Charity's nomadic childhood has left her itching to settle down, and she immediately falls in love with all the storybook town has to offer ? Everything, that is, except its sexiest and most famous resident, former world-class cyclist Josh Golden. With her long list of romantic disasters, she's not about to take a chance on another bad boy, even if everyone else thinks he's perfect just the way he is. But maybe that's just what he needs ? Someone who knows the value of his flaws. Someone who knows that he's just chasing perfect.</description>

  <description>When Keri Daniels' editor finds out she has previous carnal knowledge of reclusive bestselling author Joe Kowalski, she gives Keri a choice: get an interview or get a new job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe's never forgotten the first girl to break his heart, so he's intrigued to hear Keri's back in town--and looking for him. Despite his intense need for privacy, he'll grant Keri an interview if it means a chance to finish what they started in high school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He proposes an outrageous plan--for every day she survives with his family on their annual camping and four-wheeling trip, Keri can ask one question. Keri agrees; she's worked too hard to walk away from her career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the chemistry between them is still as potent as the bug spray, Joe's sister is out to avenge his broken heart and Keri hasn't ridden an ATV since she was ten. Who knew a little blackmail, a whole lot of family and some sizzling romantic interludes could make Keri reconsider the old dream of Keri &amp;amp; Joe 2gether 4ever.</description>

  <description>Carly Holbrook and Brian Westbury are weeks away from their high school graduation. The young couple plans to marry before they head to college, and their future seems bright with promise. Everything changes one spring night when their six closest friends, including Brian's younger brother, are killed in a fiery car accident that Carly and Brian witness. The trauma leaves Carly unable to speak, and Brian is forced to make unimaginable decisions about a future that once seemed so certain. With Carly incapable of going forward with their plans, Brian leaves home—and Carly—for good. Fifteen years later, disturbing new clues indicate the accident that wrecked so many lives wasn't an accident at all, bringing Brian home to face a past—and a love—he's never forgotten.</description>

  <description>Maddie Townsend might live in a town called Serenity, but there's been nothing calm or peaceful about her life since her marriage broke up. This stay-at-home mom has no job skills, an out-of-control sixteen-year-old son, a talkative fourteen-year-old who's suddenly gone silent, a six-year-old daughter whose heart is broken, an ex-husband whose younger girlfriend is expecting their baby and two best friends who think she's somehow qualified to help them open a fitness spa for women. But if Maddie is a tad on edge with all that on her plate, it's nothing compared to the chaos that ensues when she discovers that her son's baseball coach has feelings for her and the whole town disapproves. Maddie's faced a lot of challenges lately with strength and resolve, but Cal Maddox may turn out to be more than she can handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then again, he could just be the one man in all of South Carolina who can help her find serenity.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Too much of a good thing…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her long ponytail and sparkling green eyes, Tessa Donovan looks more like the girl next door than a businesswoman—or a heartbreaker. Which may explain why Detective Luke Asher barely notices her when he arrives to investigate a break–in at her family's brewery. He's got his own problems—starting with the fact that his partner, Simone, is pregnant and everyone thinks he's the father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tessa has her hands full, too. Her brother's playboy ways may be threatening the business, and the tension could tear her tight–knit family apart. In fact, the only thing that could unite the Donovan boys is seeing a man come after their "baby" sister. Especially a man like Luke Asher. But Tessa sees past the rumors to the man beneath. He's not who people think he is—and neither is she.</description>

  <description>Sick of running into her cheery ex-husband and his new wife, Leslie Petruso accepts a job at the Virgin River branch of Haggerty Construction and takes the high road right out of town. Now she's got Paul Haggerty's business running like a well-oiled machine. In fact, things are so busy Paul jumps at the chance to hire an extra set of hands. Just like Leslie, Conner Danson has been burned by love. But if Leslie was disappointed by her relationship going bad, Conner was decimated. He's got no time for women; although he spends an awful lot of time pretending not to notice Leslie. And she's pretty busy ignoring the chemistry between them. According to Conner and Leslie, they have only one thing in common; they're done with love. But everyone in Virgin River can see that things are heating up at Haggerty Construction. And as far as Paul Haggerty can tell, the best thing he can do is hang on to his hard hat and watch the sparks fly!</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Virgin River, you never know what you might find around the bend in the road...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former actor Dylan Childress left the L.A. scene behind years ago for a quiet life running an aviation company in Montana. But with business slowing down, Dylan is starting to wonder whether he should take one of the offers Hollywood keeps sending his way. He figures a motorcycle trip to Virgin River with his buddies might help him decide what path to take. But his own troubles are left at the side of the road when he spots a woman stranded on the way into town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katie Malone and her twin boys' trip to Virgin River is stopped short by a tire as flat as her failed romance. To make matters worse, it's raining, the boys are hungry and Katie is having trouble putting on the spare. So when some bikers pull up beside them, offering to help, all Katie feels is relief. Then she sees sexy, leather-clad Dylan Childress, and in one brief moment the world turns on its axis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katie's a sensible single mother and Dylan's a die-hard commitment-phobe. Neither one is looking for long-term romance. But sometimes it takes only a moment to know you've found something that could change your life forever.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS: MAKING IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rising sous-chef Kelly Matlock's sudden collapse at work is a wake-up call. Disillusioned and burned out, she's retreated to her sister Jillian's house in Virgin River to rest and reevaluate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puttering in Jill's garden and cooking with her heirloom vegetables is wonderful, but Virgin River is a far cry from San Francisco. Kelly's starting to feel a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; unmotivated...until she meets Lief Holbrook. The handsome widower looks more like a lumberjack than a sophisticated screenwriter - a combination Kelly finds irresistible. But less appealing is Lief's rebellious stepdaughter, Courtney. She's the reason they moved from L.A., but Courtney's finding plenty of trouble even in Virgin River.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kelly's never fallen for a guy with such serious baggage, but some things are worth fighting for. Besides, a bratty teenager can't be any worse than a histrionic chef...right?</description>

  <description>Colin Riordan came to Virgin River to recuperate from a horrific helicopter crash, the scars of which he bears inside and out. His family is wonderfully supportive, but it's his art that truly soothes his troubled soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stung personally and professionally by an ill-advised affair, PR guru Jillian Matlock has rented an old Victorian with a promising garden in Virgin River. She's looking forward to cultivating something other than a corporate brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both are looking to simplify, not complicate, their lives, but when Jillian finds Colin at his easel in her yard, there's an instant connection. And in Virgin River, sometimes love is the simplest choice of all&amp;amp;#133;.</description>

  <description>After years spent on ranches around Los Angeles, Clay Tahoma is delighted to be Virgin River's new veterinary assistant. The secluded community's wild beauty tugs at his Navajo roots, and he's been welcomed with open arms by everyone in town&amp;amp;#151;everyone &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; Lilly Yazhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lilly has encountered her share of strong, silent, &lt;em&gt;traditional&lt;/em&gt; men within her own aboriginal community, and she's not interested in coming back for more. In her eyes, Clay's earthy, sexy appeal is just an act used to charm wealthy women like his ex-wife. She can't deny his gift for gentling horses, but she's not about to let him control her. There's just one small problem&amp;amp;#151;&lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; can't control her attraction to Clay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in Virgin River, faith in new beginnings and the power of love has doors opening everywhere.&amp;amp;#133;</description>

  <description>WITH HER BELOVED YOUNGER SIBLINGS SETTLED AND HAPPY, ERIN FOLEY HAS EMPTY NEST SYNDROME. AT AGE THIRTY-FIVE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she's hitting the pause button on her life and holing up in a secluded (but totally upgraded --- she's not into roughing it!) cabin near Virgin River. Erin is planning on getting to know herself ... not the shaggy-haired mountain man she meets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, beneath his faded fatigues and bushy beard, Aiden Riordan is a doctor, recharging for a summer after leaving the navy. He's intrigued by the pretty, slightly snooty refugee from the rat race --- her meditating and journaling are definitely keeping him at arm's length. He'd love to get closer ... if his scruffy exterior and crazy ex-wife don't hold him back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But maybe it's something in the water --- unlikely romances seem to take root in Virgin River ... helped along by some well-intentioned meddling, of course.</description>

  <description>FOUR YEARS AGO, AIR FORCE SWEETHEARTS FRANCI DUNCAN AND SEAN RIORDAN REACHED AN IMPASSE. SHE WANTED MARRIAGE AND A FAMILY. HE DIDN'T. BUT A CHANCE MEETING PROVES THAT THE BITTER BREAKUP HASN'T COOLED THEIR SIZZLING CHEMISTRY.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sean has settled down in spite of himself --- he's not the cocky young fighter pilot he was when Franci left, and he wants them to try again. After all, they have a history ... but that's not all they share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Franci's secret reason for walking away when Sean refused to commit is now three and a half: a redheaded cherub named Rosie who shares her daddy's emerald-green eyes. Sean is stunned --- and furious with Franci for the deception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;News travels fast in Virgin River, and soon the whole town is taking sides. Rebuilding their trust could take a small miracle --- and the kind of love that can move mountains.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIRGIN RIVER IS ABUZZ WITH THE NEWS THAT A STRANGER BOUGHT THE TOWN'S ABANDONED CHURCH ON EBAY. THE BUYER, A YOUNG WIDOWED REVEREND, IS A LITTLE LIKE THE BUILDING ITSELF: IN NEED OF SOME TENDER LOVING CARE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Noah Kincaid arrives ready to roll up his sleeves and revitalize his new purchase, but he's going to need some help. An ad in the local paper brings and improbably candidate his way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Pastor's assistant" is not a phrase that springs to mind when Noah meets brassy, beautiful Ellie Baldwin. With her colorful clothes and even more colorful past, Ellie needs a respectable job so she can regain custody of her children. Noah can't help but admire her spunk and determination, and she may just be the breath of fresh air he needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unlikely duo may come from two different worlds, but they have more in common than anyone would have expected. And in Virgin River lasting happiness is never out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Marine corporal Rick Sudder is home early from Iraq--his tour ended abruptly on the battlefield. The carefree boy is gone, replaced by a man who believes his future is as bleak as his mirror image. But can the passion and commitment of a young woman who has never given up on him mend his broken body and shattered heart?As the people of Virgin River rally around Rick, another recent arrival tests the tightly knit mountain town's famous welcoming spirit. Dan Brady has a questionable past, and he's looking for a place to start over. He'd like it to be Virgin River...if he can find a way in. But he never expects to find it in the arms of a woman who was as much an outcast as himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a favorite son returned from war and an outsider looking for a home, Virgin River offers them a chance to make peace with the men they once were...and to find the dreams they thought they'd lost.</description>

  <description>In the space of a few months Vanessa buried her husband, Matt, and gave birth to their son--breaking her heart while filling it with a whole new kind of love. But the one man she longs to share this love with now acts as if she doesn't exist. Paul Haggerty lives by the marine motto: Semper Fi. Ever faithful to his best friend, he's done right by Matt's widow as best he can...considering he's been secretly in love with her for years. Now, just as he's about to make his move, another woman has staked her claim on him--a claim that will be tough to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With courage, humility and not a little meddling from the good folks of Virgin River, Vanni and Paul might just get a second chance to have the love they both desire and deserve.</description>

  <description>Last Christmas Marcie Sullivan said a final goodbye to her husband, Bobby. This Christmas she's come to Virgin River to find the man who saved his life and gave her three more years to love him.Fellow marine Ian Buchanan dragged Bobby's shattered body onto a medical transport in Fallujah four years ago, then disappeared as soon as their unit arrived stateside. Since then, Marcie's letters to Ian have gone unanswered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcie tracks Ian to the tiny mountain town of Virgin River and finds a man as wounded emotionally as Bobby was physically. But she is not easily scared off. As Marcie pushes her way into his rugged and reclusive life, she discovers a sweet but damaged soul beneath a rough exterior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ian doesn't know what to make of the determined young widow who forces him to look into the painful past and, what's worse, the uncertain future. But it is, after all, a season of miracles and maybe, just maybe, it's time to banish the ghosts and open his heart.</description>

  <description>At twenty-five, after five years as her mother's caregiver, it's time for Shelby to experience freedom and adventure. Time for travel, college and romance. But when she visits Virgin River, she runs into Luke Riordan, decidedly "not" whom she has in mind. A handsome Blackhawk pilot, Luke exited the army after twenty years, four wars and having been shot out of the sky three times. At thirty-eight he's tough and jaded. His major was in one-night stands, with a minor in commitment avoidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technically, these two are all wrong for one another. But sometimes what you want and what you need are two different things...two very "good" things.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For the second time in a year a woman arrives in the small town of Virgin River trying to escape the past.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John “Preacher” Middleton is about to close the bar when a young woman and her three-year-old son come in out of a wet October night. A marine who has seen his share of pain, Preacher knows a crisis when he sees one—the woman is covered in bruises. He wants to protect them, and he wants to punish whoever did this to her, but he knows immediately that this inclination to protect is something much more. Paige Lassiter has stirred up emotions in this gentle giant of a man—emotions that he has never allowed himself to feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Paige’s ex-husband turns up in Virgin River, Preacher knows his own future hangs in the balance. And if there’s one thing in the marines’ motto of Semper Fidelis—always faithful—has taught him, it’s that some things are worth fighting for.</description>

Twice divorced and the lover of too many women, he secretly longs for the kind of commitment and happiness his marine buddies have found--a woman who can tie up his heart forever. He finds that woman in Brie Sheridan, a Sacramento prosecutor who understands his drive to protect and serve. Virgin River becomes a safe haven for Brie after nearly losing her life at the hands of a crazed criminal. Though tough and courageous, she's got some fears she can't escape--but now she has someone who will show her just what it means to trust again. Mike will do anything to help Brie free herself from painful memories. Passionate, strong and gentle, he vows to give back to her what she's so selflessly given him--her heart, and with it, a new beginning.</description>

  <description>Molly Jennings has one naughty little secret: her job as a bestselling erotic fiction author. Until her inspiration runs dry—thanks to a creepy ex—and it's time to skip town and move back to tiny Tumble Creek, Colorado.&lt;p&gt;One look at former high school hunk chief of police Ben Lawson and Molly is back in business. The town gossip is buzzing at her door and, worse still, a stalker seems to be watching her every move. Thankfully, her very own lawman has taken to coming over, often. The only problem now is that Molly may have to let the cat out of the bag about her chosen profession, and straitlaced Ben will definitely not approve.…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>"Wanted: Midwife/nurse practitioner in Virgin River, population six hundred. Make a difference against the backdrop of towering California redwoods and crystal-clear rivers. Rent-free cabin included." When the recently widowed Melinda Monroe sees this ad she quickly decides that the remote mountain town of Virgin River might be the perfect place to escape her heartache, and to reenergize the nursing career she loves. But her high hopes are dashed within an hour of arriving: the cabin is a dump, the roads are treacherous and the local doctor wants nothing to do with her. Realizing she's made a huge mistake, Mel decides to leave town the following morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a tiny baby, abandoned on a front porch, changes her plans...and a former marine cements them into place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melinda Monroe may have come to Virgin River looking for escape, but instead she finds her home.</description>

  <description>After a move out of the big city to escape heartbreak, photographer Katherine Thomas embraces life in a new town. With her two best friends by her side, she's ready to start over and not look back.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During her first major exhibition at a legitimate art gallery, Kate expects the inevitable nerves, but what she doesn't anticipate is meeting someone who -- with one glance -- leaves her breathless.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens when the charming mystery man disappears, leaving Kate wanting more?  Without even knowing his name, the odds of finding him again are stacked against her.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will fate intervene, and if it does, will her old wounds prevent her from acting on the undeniable connection she feels?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Where there's a will. . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When pretty hairdresser Delaney Shaw returned home to Truly, Idaho, for the reading of her stepfather's will, she planned on paying her respects and getting out of town. But it seems the will has some unexpected stipulations-like the one that says if Delaney wants her inheritance she needs to stay put and have nothing to do with sexy Nick Allegrezza. . .for an entire year!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's no way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, Nick had swept Delaney off her feet and onto his Harley, and that's when she really let her down her Hair! Back then, he was a love-'em-and-leave-'em man, and Delaney learned the hard way that she was just a fling. But Nick is as irresistible as ever. And when the ladies at Tuesday night Bingo see Nick and Delaney making after-hours whoopee through the window of a local beauty parlor, Delaney knows it's time to decide if Nick I truly, madly the man of her heart.</description>

Now her revenge will be oh-so-sweet . . . and hot!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trish Henderson has returned home to Eden to take care of some family business . . . and some personal business, as well. Though she's achieved remarkable success as a high-powered Chicago attorney, Trish has never forgotten her small-town high school sweetheart, Joe Ramsey, or the devastation of heartbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she's come face-to-face with the gorgeous sex god Joe has grown into, and she's determined to get him out of her system once and for all—and maybe take a little revenge, too. And this time, &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; has all the power. After all, where is it written that only &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt; can explore and enjoy a physical relationship without commitment? Her plan: seduce him for just one night, then walk away . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there's just one problem. Trish is about to find out that one night with Joe may never be enough . . .</description>

  <description>Minerva Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man who asked her to dinner to win a bet. Even if he is gorgeous and successful Calvin Morrisey. Cal knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. Even if she does wear great shoes and keeps him on his toes. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Fate has other plans, and it's not long before Min and Cal meet again. Soon, they're dealing with a jealous ex-boyfriend, Krispy Kreme donuts, a determined psychologist, chaos theory, a freakishly intelligent cat, Chicken Marsala, and more risky propositions than either of them ever dreamed of. Including the biggest gamble of all--true love.</description>

  <description>Breaking rules and breaking hearts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free-spirited Chloe lives life on the edge. Unlike her soon-to-be married sisters, she isn't ready to settle into a quiet life running their family's newly renovated inn. But soon her love of trouble--and trouble with love-draws the attention of the very stern, very sexy sheriff who'd like nothing better than to tame her wild ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly Chloe can't take a misstep without the sheriff hot on her heels. His rugged swagger and his enigmatic smile are enough to make a girl beg to be handcuffed. For the first time, instead of avoiding the law, Chloe dreams of surrender. Can this rebel find a way to keep the peace with the straitlaced sheriff? Or will Chloe's colorful past keep her from a love that lasts . . . and the safe haven she truly wants in a town called Lucky Harbor?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Two Men Are One Too Many . . . &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tara has a thousand good reasons not to return to the little coastal town of Lucky Harbor, Washington. Yet with her life doing a major crash-and-burn, &lt;em&gt;anywhere &lt;/em&gt;away from her unfulfilled dreams and sexy ex-husband will do. As Tara helps her two sisters get their newly renovated inn up and running, she finally has a chance to get things under control and come up with a new plan for her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a certain tanned, green-eyed sailor has his own ideas, such as keeping Tara hot, bothered . . . and in his bed. And when her ex wants Tara back, three is a crowd she &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; control-especially when her deepest secret reappears out of the blue. Now Tara must confront her past and discover what she really wants. If she's lucky, she might just find that everything her heart desires is right here in Lucky Harbor.</description>

  <description>Georgeanne Howard, charm school graduate and Southern belle extraordinaire, leaves her fiancé at the altar when she realizes she just can't marry a man old enough to be her grandfather, no matter how rich he is. John Kowalsky unknowingly helps her escape, and only when it's too late does he realize that he's absconded with his boss's bride. At the height of his hockey career, this bad boy isn't looking to be anybody's savior but his own, no matter how beautiful this angel may be. But a long night stretches ahead of them--a night too sultry to resist temptation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Georgeanne and John meet again, she is on her way to becoming Seattle's domestic darling and he is past his hellraising days. But he is shocked to learn that their single unforgettable night in paradise produced a daughter, and he is determined to be part of her life. Georgeanne has loved John since the moment she jumped into his little red Corvette seven years ago, but she doesn't want to risk her heart again. Is he really a changed man? And will he risk the wrath of his boss, and one final chance at glory, to prove that this time his love will be everlasting?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Maddie Moore's whole life needs a makeover.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one fell swoop, Maddie loses her boyfriend (her decision) and her job (so &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; her decision). But rather than drowning her sorrows in bags of potato chips, Maddie leaves L.A. to claim the inheritance left by her free-spirited mother—a ramshackle inn nestled in the little coastal town of Lucky Harbor, Washington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting over won't be easy. Yet Maddie sees the potential for a new home and a new career—if only she can convince her two half-sisters to join her in the adventure. But convincing Tara and Chloe will be difficult because the inn needs a big makeover too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The contractor Maddie hires is a tall, dark-haired hottie whose eyes—and mouth—are making it hard for her to remember that she's sworn off men. Even harder will be Maddie's struggles to overcome the past, though she's about to discover that there's no better place to call home than Lucky Harbor.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;It's tough to play it cool on a sultry summer night...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The perfect daughter. The perfect prom queen. The perfect wife. Jenny Tolliver's been the good girl all her life, and it's gotten her nowhere. Now that her marriage has been busted up by her cheating ex, she's decided it's time to regroup and rediscover herself. This summer she's headed back to her hometown of Destiny, Ohio, to the very lakeshore cottage where she grew up, to figure out what life holds in store for her next. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She never dreamed the answer would be Mick Brody, Destiny's #1 hellraiser. He comes from the wrong side of the tracks (or in his case, the lake), and he's landed in hot water more times than he can count. He's exactly the kind of guy Jenny's always kept her distance from . . . but soon the good girl and the bad boy are caught in a raw heat that's out of control. Too bad Mick's got a secret that threatens to tear them apart and ruin Jenny's perfectly, passionately reckless summer . . .</description>

  <description>Violet Winters once had it all but lost it when her husband was murdered by a criminal madman. During a cold winter night Violet has to leave her warm bed to tell her neighbor to turn the music down. And that’s when she meets sinister, scarred, scarily attractive security specialist, Joe Callahan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wants to deny it, but Violet can’t beat back the hunger she feels for Joe so she gives in again and again. Feeling it himself, Joe feeds Vi’s hunger, breaking his own rules to keep her in his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Violet had only one man in her life, she’s sure Joe is giving her the signals and Vi decides she’s ready to take a second chance at life and, maybe, love. But Violet doesn’t know the dark secrets in Joe’s past, secrets so soul-wrenching, they’ve drained him dry. With nothing left to give, Joe’s determined to live his life alone and he breaks Violet’s heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crushed by Joe’s betrayal, Violet comes to terms with the fact that, no matter what signals he gave, Joe was not theirs to win. But Violet’s husband’s murderer is obsessed with her and heartbreak again haunts the door of the Winters home. When it does Joe is forced to face the knowledge that he can’t fight Violet’s pull, she’s under his skin and filled him full to bursting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe needs to win her back and put his life on the line to keep Violet safe. But, having had it all once, can Violet endure losing Joe?</description>

  <description>Cass Pendleton and Jaime Dalton have been mortal enemies since the first day of kindergarten when Jaime pulled her hair and Cass knocked him flat on his ass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaime is on the verge of superstardom in the NFL; all that’s missing is a Super Bowl ring and a personal assistant who can handle his business without handling his business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cass seems to be the best person for the job. She’s smart, mouthy, dependable, pig-headed, loyal, and completely not his type. So why can’t Jaime think of anything except Cass?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows one thing for dead certain. If the game doesn’t kill him, sex with Cass Pendleton most definitely will.</description>

After several rebellious teenage years, it gave him the stability and control he had been seeking after his parent’s death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As president of a not-for-profit foundation, he knows what his future holds and what he wants out of life. All that changes when a simple lunch with his college friend and Mentor, Darren, leads him to buying a slave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrust into a situation he never thought he’d be in, Stephan can’t walk away. He is compelled to help this girl in the only way he knows how.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brianna knows only one thing, she is a slave. She has nothing. She is nothing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Stephan help Brianna realize that she is much more than just a Slave?</description>

  <description>Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old. No matter what ingenious schemes Indy used to capture his attention, Lee never showed an interest and Indy finally gave up. Now Indy's employee, Rosie, has lost a bag of diamonds and bad guys are shooting at him. When Indy gets involved, Lee is forced to help. Complicating matters, Lee has decided he's interested, Indy's decided she's not. But she can't seem to keep Lee out of her life when she's repeatedly stun gunned, kidnapped and there are car bombs exploding (not to mention she's finding dead bodies).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indy's best bet is to solve the mystery of the diamonds before Lee. Lee's challenge is to keep Indy alive and, at the same time, win back her heart.</description>

  <description>While drinking cosmopolitans, Gwendolyn Kidd meets the man of her dreams. Then she takes him home. Then she wakes up alone. But her fear that she lost her dream man turns into a relationship with a mystery man when, night after night in the dead of night, he comes back for more. Hoping it will blossom into something real, she lets him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she doesn’t even know his name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwen’s struggling with the decision to end their crazy non-relationship when her sister-from-hell, Ginger’s best friend pays a visit and warns Gwen that if she and her sister don't get smart, they'll both get d-e-a-d, dead. Gwen has no clue what’s going on but she’s used to Ginger’s antics and decides to lay the problem on her sister’s biker boyfriend's doorstep. Bad choice. She hits the Denver Underground radar with a big, loud ping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means Gwen’s Mystery Man, Cabe “Hawk” Delgado has to step in to keep her safe. But when Hawk gets a dose of Gwen in the daylight, he makes the decision that he finally wants real with Gwen. However when Gwen gets a dose of badass, bossy, straight-talker Hawk in the daylight, she decides she’s done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus begins the head-to-head of the Commando vs. Cosmo Girl as Hawk woos Gwen in his own unique way, Gwen survives firebombs, drive-bys, kidnappings, hot pursuits by biker hotties and gorgeous police detectives and discovers the heartbreaking reason why Hawk kept her at arm’s length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as all this happens, Gwen finds that her sister’s troubles are serious trouble and she must decide who to keep alive: her sister-from-hell or the man of her dreams.</description>

  <description>He was a by-the-book cop who broke the rules in the bedroom... &lt;br&gt; Micah Hudson has painful secrets he's run hard from. He has new friends, a new life, but he's about to be confronted with the one person who reminds him of all he's tried to forget--Angelina, the sister of his oldest friend David. She knows everything about his past, including how he and David fell in love with the same woman, and how they decided the best way to prevent her from tearing them apart was to share her between them. But then a terrible accident left Micah alone... &lt;br&gt; She was willing to do anything to make him see the woman she'd become... &lt;br&gt; Micah lost the two people who meant the most in the world to him. Angelina lost her only family. And she kept her deepest secret close to her heart. Her love for Micah. No longer willing to wait, she decides it's time to go after him and bring him to his knees. She knows his secrets, his desires, his kinks and fetishes, and she'll use whatever it takes to reel him in. Behind the easygoing, loves women exterior lies a man with dark needs and passions. She can give him what he wants. But will he decide she's what he needs?</description>

  <description>He counts her smiles every day and night at the train station. And morning and evening, the beautiful commuter acknowledges him—just like she does everyone else on the platform. But Blake Hartt is not like the others . . . he’s homeless. Memories of a broken childhood have robbed him of peace and twisted delusions into his soul. He stays secluded from the sun, sure the world would run from him in the harsh light of day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each day, Livia McHugh smiles politely and acknowledges her fellow commuters as she waits for the train to the city. She dismisses this kindness as nothing special, just like her. She’s the same as a million other girls—certainly no one to be cherished. But special or not, she smiles every day, never imagining that someone would rely on the simple gesture as if it were air to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the moment comes that Livia must do more than smile, without hesitation she steps into the fray to defend the homeless man. And she's surprised to discover an inexplicable connection with her new friend. After danger subsides, their smiles become conversation. Their words usher in a friendship, which awakens something in each of them. But it’s not long before their bond must prove its strength. Entanglements from the past challenge both their love and their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blake’s heart beats for Livia’s, even if her hands have to keep its rhythm. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love never fails. Love never fails, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interwoven tale of unlikely loves and relationships forged by fire, Debra Anastasia takes readers into the darkest corners of human existence, only to show them the radiant power of pure adoration and true sacrifice. Complicated families and confused souls find their way to light in this novel, which manages to be racy, profane, funny, and reverent all at once.</description>

  <description>Autumn Adams never planned to follow in her mother's footsteps as Chicago's answer to Martha Stewart--she can't cook, doesn't clean, and would rather play soccer than discuss the joys of white bathtub grout. Then some lunatic starts sending her threats in the mail and Audie finds herself under the protection of simmering, sexy Detective Stacey Quinn, a man determined to examine her every nook, cranny, and ex-boyfriend in his effort to find the stalker. A disarming combination of macho cop and sweet charmer, Quinn is hard to resist. But with Audie's bad luck at finding and holding on to Mr. Right, she think it's best to keep her distance...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinn soon discovers that the real Audie is an alluring blend of fantasy babe and tender-hearted female all wrapped up in what he can only hope is leopard-print underwear. She's not what he's always pictured for himself, but could she be everything he'll ever need?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digging through Audie's many layers could turn out to be the hottest, craziest, &lt;em&gt;sexiest&lt;/em&gt; bit of detective work Quinn has ever attempted...if it doesn't kill him first.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>The epic conclusion to the amazing Sabina Kane urban fantasy series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sabina Kane is on the hunt. Her prey: Cain, the father of the vampire race and the one who murdered her family and her friends. Unfortunately, Cain is hunting Sabina, too. The one man who holds the key to defeating Cain is, of course, Abel. A mage with secrets to spare and, hopefully, the power to match it. Unfortunately, for Sabina, he's in Rome and may not want to be found. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sabina sets out for Italy with her friends, Giguhl and Adam Lazarus, to track down the only man who can get her the revenge she hungers for. But will he help her or oppose her? And just who is Abel, really? Worst of all, when Sabina figures out the goddess Lilith has a plan for her-she realizes this trip is getting deadlier by the minute. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they say: when in Rome-SURVIVE.</description>

  <description>They've Got Nothing In Common... &lt;br&gt;For animal behaviorist Emma Jenkins, romance has been at the bottom of her daily "to do" list since making it through a messy divorce. But everything changes the day six-feet-of-gorgeous Thomas Tobin walks into her office with a quivering Chinese Crested named Hairy, a canine that looks more like an underfed rodent than a dog. Sure Thomas is sending her mixed signals-but that charming smile just sent Emma's dormant sex drive through the roof... &lt;br&gt; But Animal Attraction-&lt;br&gt;Thomas isn't looking for a fling. In fact, he wants nothing to do with women. He just wants to know if Hairy witnessed his owner's murder. But something tells him that asking Emma to help him with the case will spell nothing but trouble-trouble in the form of serious temptation. &lt;br&gt; And the Willingness To Take A Chance On Love&lt;br&gt;Thomas knows that relying on Emma's expertise-and her soft touch with a weird dog that has somehow become his-may be a crazy way to track a killer. Especially when Emma's down-home warmth makes him want to believe that anything is possible-even true love. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One week in paradise will make or break them…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not enough that Kelsey’s husband left her for another woman. Oh, no. The “other woman” had to be her best friend Evan’s fiancée. Not only has she lost her marriage, she fears losing Evan to the lingering awkwardness and humiliation that hangs between them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan has no intention of letting that happen. He’s got plans…namely, an extra plane ticket to Hawaii now his future wife is out of the picture. There’s only one person he wants on the trip with him, the one who’s always been there for him. The one he should never have let slip away into the arms of a traitorous friend who shattered her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelsey is anticipating a week of fun in the sun with the man who’s always treated her like a little sister. No one’s more surprised when she discovers that Evan has seduction on his mind—and that she’s more than ready for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is the most powerful healing force of all. But past demons have a way of ripping open old wounds, and threatening the survival of even the strongest friendship… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This title contains explicit sex between best friends, graphic language…and a hero who knows how to put the hot in “hot tub”.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Half-human and half-Wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the Wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their Dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful—and passionate—of the Elder Races.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the most feared and respected of the Wyrkind, Dragos Cuelebre cannot believe someone had the audacity to steal from him, much less succeed. And when he catches the thief, Dragos spares her life, claiming her as his own to further explore the desire they've ignited in each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pia knows she must repay Dragos for her trespass, but refuses to become his slave—although she cannot deny wanting him, body and soul.</description>

  <description>Lady Elyssa Yamato Amaterasu Wentworth is a centuries-old vampire who's been given a new servant - Jacob, a total alpha male unaccustomed to submitting to any woman's wishes. What really binds Jacob to her are not her sensual midnight hungers, but something far more provocative. It stirs her blood, renews her life, and awakens her soul like only true love can. The passion between Elyssa and Jacob yields something else unexpected - a shared history that reaches back through the centuries and is fated to challenge their destiny like nothing ever will again.</description>

  <description>When a fifteen-year-old girl is abducted by vampires, it’s up to U.S. Marshal Anita Blake to find her. And when she does, she’s faced with something she’s never seen before: a terrifyingly ordinary group of people—kids, grandparents, soccer moms—all recently turned and willing to die to avoid serving a master. And where there’s one martyr, there will be more…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But even vampires have monsters that they’re afraid of. And Anita is one of them…</description>

  <description>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Cheyenne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; McCray's paranormal romances seduce with an award-winning combination of heat and fantasy. Now, she weaves the first tale in an enthralling new series sizzling with dark magic and dangerous desires. Prepare to be spellbound by &lt;/em&gt;Forbidden Magic...&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;D'Anu witch Silver Ashcroft knows she walks a perilous line by practicing gray magic. But it's the only way to protect herself from the evil that surrounds her. After the horrors she has witnessed, Silver thinks she is ready for anything...until the most intensely arousing being she has ever encountered swiftly--and sensuously--proves her wrong...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hawk is a Tuatha D'Danann warrior--powerful beings descended from the Fae. And for him duty has always come before pleasure. Then, clad only in moonlight, Silver Ashcroft welcomes him to her city of San Francisco and makes his blood sing with a passion beyond compare. She is the embodiment of fantasies he never knew he had, but the terrifying reality of his mission lurks in every shadow...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the strongest will survive the upcoming battle, and the forces of darkness are more powerful than ever. Now, warrior and witch must trust in their hearts above all else--for to claim victory, they first must claim each other...&lt;br&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She yearned to go beyond... but some curtains should never be opened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rae broached the idea of visiting an underground sex club, Mark didn't blink. He should have. Because NightWhere is not your usual swingers club. &lt;em&gt;Where&lt;/em&gt; it’s held on a given &lt;em&gt;night&lt;/em&gt;… only those who receive the red invitations know. Soon Rae is indulging in her lust for pain. And Mark is warned by a beautiful stranger to take his wife away before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s already too late.

  <description>For Lacey Callihan, things couldn’t get much worse. She’s working a dead-end job, living with a dead-end boyfriend and stuck in a dead-end town. When Lacey’s boyfriend steals her life savings and hits her for questioning him, it’s the last straw. She skips town in her rust-heap of a car – which she can only pray will get her as far as Texas. And it does. Spluttering to a final stop just as she crosses the border. But when two ultra-hot cowboys pull up in their convertible red Mustang and offer her a ride, Lacey has a feeling her luck is about to change …</description>

  <description>Everyone has a lot to say about Alice Franklin, and it’s stopped mattering whether it’s true. The rumors started at a party when Alice supposedly had sex with two guys in one night. When school starts everyone almost forgets about Alice until one of those guys, super-popular Brandon, dies in a car wreck that was allegedly all Alice’s fault. Now the only friend she has is a boy who may be the only other person who knows the truth, but is too afraid to admit it. Told from the perspectives of popular girl Elaine, football star Josh, former outcast Kelsie, and shy genius Kurt, we see how everyone has a motive to bring – and keep – Alice down.</description>

  <description>*THIS IS A STAND ALONE WITH NO CLIFFHANGER!*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bully and victim. &lt;br&gt;Tormenter and tormented. &lt;br&gt;Villain and hero. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellie McCallum was a bully. No connection to anyone or anything. A sad and lonely existence for a young woman who had come to expect nothing more for herself. Her only happiness coming from making others miserable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Particularly Freaky Flynn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flynn Hendrick lived a life completely disconnected even as he struggled to become something more than that boy with Asperger's. He was taunted and teased, bearing the brunt of systematic and calculated cruelty, ultimately culminating in a catastrophic turn of events that brought Ellie and Flynn’s worlds crashing down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Flynn and Ellie grew up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until years later when their paths unexpectedly cross again and the bully and the freak are face to face once more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When labels come to define you, finding yourself feels impossible. Particularly for two people disconnected from the world who inexplicably find a connection in each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And out of the wreckage of their tragic beginnings, an unlikely love story unfolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a painful past doesn’t always want to let go. And old wounds are never truly healed…and sometimes the further you try to run from yourself the closer you come to who you really are.</description>

  <description>You get hurt once; you assume that’s the norm. You see others suffer; you assume that’s the norm, too. At least, that’s what Livana once did. One rough go-around was enough for her. After that, she kept it simple, no strings attached. It was just easier, even necessary. Until she went out one night and met Calum Alexander, a man whose intensity broke through each of her defenses, leaving her vulnerable. Afraid to fall in love, she tries to keep some of her walls up around herself, even as Calum seems determined not to let her. Faced with a man that seems intent on possessing her, Liv knows it’s a mere matter of time before she no longer has a choice.</description>

  <description>[THE FIRST INSTALLMENT IN THE PROJECT SAPPHIRE SCI-FI/ EROTICA SERIES]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Sapphire: The World’s first AI.  A top-secret project exposed to a select group of scientists. Lei Heaton, a man desperate to save his daughter, is at the top of the bionics empire. He not only hired the team to repair his daughter’s damaged body, he plans to reanimate her dead mind using the Sapphire AI.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A dangerous man—a killer that is no regular human…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maxwell Landon—codename: Deimos—is the Adelphi Organization’s top agent. His M.O is simple: Never fail. He's used to annihilating anyone that gets in his way. But this time, he's being called to protect and deliver. Deimos is aware that this mission won't be like any other. Then he lays eyes on the resurrected Ms. Heaton, and instantly he knows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Magdalena Heaton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he will never be the same again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Control, his most prized possession, is ripped from him with a single glance...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The violent attraction he feels for the girl complicates matters immediately. But what Deimos doesn't know is that things are about to get much worse. Sapphire isn't just a completely different person than the dead Ms. Heaton—she's the AI miracle of the century. An advancement that many would kill to own. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Including himself, no matter how hard he fights against it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;A girl determined to protect her creator. A man determined to protect her...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the fact that she is not Magdalena, Sapphire is bent on taking her place as Mr. Heaton's daughter in order to keep her creator safe. Deimos knows that he has to honor her wish. But the thing inside him is demanding more. More than a touch. A lot more than a taste. It responds to everything about her...every stuttered breath that lets him know she wants him as much as he wants her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How does he walk away when he knows that no matter how far he is from her, she’ll always be in danger and he'll always hunger for her?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The wheels of destiny are spiraling out of control quicker than even the gods can keep up. They all thought they knew what war was like—but have no idea how bad things are about to get. In the continuation of the Szolite series, two of the most dangerous powers in the Universe will be unleashed, threatening to push two fated beings apart.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A normal human girl. . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evesse Salazar never imagined that a violent end to her already difficult life would be just the beginning. After being thrown into a vortex, shredded apart, and killed, she is reborn as something more. Something she might not be able to manage. If that weren’t enough, she awakes newly mated to the last being in the Universe she ever would have chosen.&lt;br&gt;Now, with no other option, Eve must come to terms with her powers, her past, and her mate before he loses control of what might just be uncontrollable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A god with a monster locked inside. . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For over eleven thousand years, Zeniel, God of Tranquility, has done everything in his power to keep his other half, the God of Vengeance, from breaking free. A single glance from Mavrak is all it takes to kill those deemed guilty. The wraiths under his command can tear thousands to shreds in an instant, no matter how small their crimes. Zeniel knows he must remain at peace to keep Mavrak at bay, but he’s rendered helpless with one look into the eyes of his mate.&lt;br&gt;The longing for Evesse is enough to rip the demon out of its cage, and with the Gods on the verge of a cataclysmic war, Mavrak has every intention of gorging on both his mate, and the vengeance he so desperately needs.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lex Talionis (n.)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- The law of retaliation, whereby a punishment resembles the offense committed in kind and degree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Two wrongs. One right. He met her under the worst circumstances. She was still married. To the man who'd stolen from his company. But none of that would matter, because Chase would have her. At any cost.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Chase Blaine, it really was that simple. Douglas Colton had stolen millions from Chase’s company. He had to pay. Chase had every intention of cornering the bastard and making sure he ended up in jail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he came face-to-face with Douglas’s wife, Aria. One look at her changed all his plans, warping them into a much darker and perverse plot to get his revenge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He would offer Douglas his freedom...in exchange for a single date with his wife. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a man like Chase, a man that hadn’t truly felt emotions in a long time, Aria’s presence soon became more addicting than a drug. A problem considering that she might never forgive him for blackmailing her, despite the fact that at times she seems just as unwillingly fascinated by him as he is by her.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B009BXNP40.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calum Alexander lived his life one way. With purpose and moderation. Everything was set in place and everything happened according to a plan. That is, until his picture perfect engagement falls apart and his crazy brother Lucas gets him to agree to a night out. Calum is left to fend for himself when Lucas decides to bail and ‘fend for himself’ he will need to. A vivacious and obviously young Livana Payne catches his attention and before he knows what's going on, they end up talking. By the end of the night, Calum is on fire for the impish girl who's managed to ignite an inferno within him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, she’s twelve years younger and the complete opposite of what he’d imagined in his life, but he hungers for her in a way that’s frightening. Drunk and surprisingly out of control, he's dead set on his need to have her. But the moment he accidentally lets it be known that he's recently single, Livana is having none of it. There is no way she's getting involved with a man who just broke up with his fiance. No, they were going to have to wait. Calum’s need for her somehow kept growing. As the days went by and he got to know her more, Livana seemed to be stealing all of his sanity. As much as she wants to wait it quickly becomes obvious to Calum that he’s losing his grip to the monster she’d awakened within him. He’s about to lose control and when he does, he knows there’s going to be nothing gentle about what he’ll end up doing to her.</description>

  <description>Dyletri, God of Fertility, has locked away his powers. No woman is allowed to touch him, not until he can return his long-dead lover back to life. All he has to do is sacrifice one human girl, a girl who unlocks his powers and rips his dormant lust right out of his body. Trapped by his promise, Dyletri has no choice but to watch Ismini die, no matter how much he wants her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet the darkness of his calling is spiraling within him, demanding he claim the human as his. If he goes back on his promise, the energy of the Fates will cause untold destruction in the Universe. That doesn’t change how Dyletri’s begun exhibiting symptoms that point to more than just lust. How does he allow Ismini to die when she’s come to own him from the inside out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desire and torment spiral into something much darker than obsession, more turbulent than an addiction, and something much more brutal than a mere soul-mating. As a war is being rekindled right under his nose, Dyletri will have to come to terms with a destiny eleven thousand years in the making. He thought he’d known what path his future would take, but he’d been wrong. Now the one woman he truly loves might pay the price for his decision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Flows Deep in the Empire&lt;/em&gt; is the first in a series that will pit free-will against Destiny, Destiny against Fate, and love  against brutal desire. Everyone likes to think they have a choice as to who they end up with, but as they rise to face the greatest threat they’ve ever known, even the Gods will learn they have to bend to Destiny’s whim to survive.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00ATJSJYQ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been four months since Demitra Davis ended up entangled in the most complicated –albeit gratifying- situation she’d ever thought to find herself in. A situation she isn’t keen to get herself out of. Her now ex-boss, Dorian Sorrenson, is too delicious for her to want to pull herself away from. Yes, he’s the son of her father’s dead best friend. Yes, he was her boss for a few months of her life. Yes, he’s also almost eleven years older, but there was no way Demitra could stop herself from being attracted to him. And that was all before that one night in which Dorian carried her away from the arms of another man and branded her as his.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorian has just returned from a month long business trip, and thoughts of telling her father are the farthest from Demitra’s mind. No, she’s missed her man and has to get her hands on him. Their passion continues to escalate as well as the feelings they both have for each other. What neither of them planned on was the spite of Dorian’s ex-lover and how far she’d be willing to go to stir up problems for the two of them. Demitra is worried that their burgeoning relationship won’t be able to hold up under the stress. What she doesn’t count on is Dorian’s feelings for her and how far he is willing to go in order to keep her as his.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B008QQARIK.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorian Sorenson agreed to take on his longtime family friend’s daughter, Demitra, as an intern. Hell, Stephen Davis had been his father’s friend for years up to his father’s death and he had continued to be close to Dorian. Why not do him the favor? Except, from the moment he sees the girl, now nineteen and definitely ‘growing up’ he’s faced with a huge problem. Huge. The girl might be eleven years his junior but just looking at her shy sexiness has him trapped in an agonizing need that won’t even let him seek relief elsewhere. His body wants her and no one else. And it’s going to have her, whether Dorian likes it or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a torrid but brief kiss in his office, three months into Demitra’s internship, Dorian is left fighting feelings of extreme guilt. It’s very clear that they’re attracted to each other and that Demitra needs him as badly as he needs her but she’s still a young girl working for him. A young girl who happens to be his friend’s daughter. Dorian is determined to fight this need for her, whatever the cost. What he doesn’t count on is one night, one benefit, and Demitra looking unbelievably tempting on the arm of another man. The bets are off when possessiveness strikes hard within Dorian and only a higher power can help them both because now he plans to claim her. Thoroughly.</description>

  <description>Blair thought she would never get over her broken past. She'd all but given up. That's until West fell into her life with a bang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;West thought no one could ever see past his epic mistakes. He'd all but given up. That's until Blair walked into his life and blew it to pieces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time Blair's given a piece of herself away, picks herself off the ground and moves forward. There's a light at the end of the tunnel and it has bad boy rockstar written all over it. That's something she can work for. Something that makes her believe again.&lt;br&gt;But West is a part of rock'n'roll band, Affliction. Taking Blair on tour was his idea of heaven, but his time is in high demand and trying to be with her isn't working out as well as he'd hoped.&lt;br&gt;For Blair, being on the road with one of the most notorious bands in rock is a new kind of messed up. One she's not sure is for her…even with West in her bed.&lt;br&gt;Jake West has kickstarted her heart, but who will be the one to smash it apart?&lt;br&gt;Or will their unexplainable attraction be strong enough to save them both?</description>

  <description>My name is Jade Lennon and I stand still for money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The night I saw Shane Arthur watching me everything changed. A man in a suit always catches my eye, but it was the way he looked at me that was different. Like he knew me or something. He didn’t know me, especially not in my costume. My sobriety rests on staying away from men, but there was something about him that made me throw caution to the wind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, I was never going to see him again, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Standing still isn’t the only way I make my money. I also bartend at a concert hall. Never in my wildest dreams did I think Shane was going to show up there. Not only that, but he’s the most recent addition to the orchestra. So now on a daily basis I have to resist one of the most beautiful men I’ve ever met &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he plays the violin. For me that’s one hell of a deadly cocktail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wants me to teach him how to live. I’m not sure how much a twenty-six year old recovering alcoholic who works in a bar and moonlights as a living statue can teach a world class concert violinist, but I’m sure going to try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Life with Strings&lt;/em&gt; is a story of music, art, sex, magical realism, and romance that you will never forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expected date of publication: March 24th 2014.</description>

  <description>A woman hiding from her past, a man lost in his own…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiona was desperate to find a life in Jackson, Wyoming, but when a job interview that was supposed to be a sure thing turns ugly, she doubts there’s much hope of it. Eli sees through her lies, and regardless of the favor his father has asked of him, he’s just too stubborn to hire a woman who refuses to even give him her real name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is a reason for everything, and he finds out soon enough her deceptions have a purpose too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secrets and lies are nothing to build a relationship on, but their attraction to one another is too intense to ignore. They’re simply magnets pulled together in a situation that should be driving them apart, but Eli has his own ghosts to contend with, and his past leaves him incapable of trusting a woman he can never fully know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can they move beyond her lies when the truth is what Eli really needs, and when her past threatens to destroy her, can he rise above his own needs to protect her — his innocent liar?</description>

  <description>When Isaiah moves his teenage daughter Natalie to a new town, there is little doubt he’s running away from the past. But what should have been a fresh start for them ends up fraught with pain and heartache when Natalie becomes the victim of intense bullying at her new school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Joss is called to a meeting with the high school principal to discuss her daughter Harper’s involvement in the bullying of a new student, she’s shocked to say the least. Her daughter can’t possibly be that child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a rocky start for Joss and Isaiah as they try to set their daughters on the right path. But there is more to Joss’s and Isaiah’s connection than just two teenage girls. Joss’s and Isaiah’s attraction to one another is undeniable, regardless of their fractious start. But his soul is broken, and as much as he’s drawn to her, he’s equally terrified of what that means.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Isaiah strong enough to let her get close to him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life sometimes forces you to make those choices whether you’re ready to or not. And when Joss’s life is turned upside down, Isaiah has to decide if he’s ready to leave his past behind and live again, or if he’s going to watch what he’s come to care so much for slip away. Isaiah’s fight is profound. Joss’s is too. And their strength to withstand it all is brutally tested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes the willingness to fight for another is all a person has left to give. And sometimes the fight is the most important gift of all.</description>

  <description>Lanie Heron isn’t looking for love—no surprise, considering her last serious relationship nearly got her killed. So when Lanie propositions Hop Kincaid, all she wants is one wild night with the hot-as-hell biker who patrols with the Chaos Motorcycle Club...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Hop, Lanie has always been untouchable. She’s too polished and too classy for his tastes. But when she gives Hop the once-over with her bedroom eyes and offers him a night in paradise, he can’t say no. And he doesn’t regret it when he finds that Lanie is the best thing that’s ever happened to him—in or out of bed. Now the trick will be to convince her of that.</description>

  <description>War veteran Kennedy O’Brien is in the business of sticking it to the man—or at least any man who tries to cross a woman. After she returned home from Afghanistan and caught her husband in bed with the nanny, Kennedy lost her faith in men and started Fool Me Once Investigations with her two best friends. After all, there’s no better bounty hunter than a woman scorned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kennedy takes a case to slap cuffs on a bail jumper turned dog-napper, she figures it’ll be an easy paycheck. But trouble has a way of finding Kennedy. Enter the last man on the planet she’d willingly choose as a partner: her cheating ex-husband’s best friend, Griffin Crawford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As gorgeous as he is unwelcome, Griffin has always had a thing for Kennedy, and after keeping quiet about her ex’s cheating, he’ll do anything to earn back her trust. Whether or not she wants to admit it, Kennedy will need help as the case of the Chihuahua thief spirals out of control. Griffin may be just her man—in more ways than one.</description>

  <description>I’m not sure what I was thinking that day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a normal Thursday, nothing new or exciting had occurred in the morning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’d risen from bed, taken a shower and brushed my teeth. I’d then jumped on the 8:05 bus that ran a short distance between my house and the county library where I worked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ride took its usual 15 minutes before it left me standing fresh faced in front of a building of gothic construction that was my favorite place in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After straightening my knee length skirt, I pushed open the door that led into the interior of the library.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was at that moment that my world would change – impossibly and forever. It was a fateful movement of wood that collided with the shoulder of a man that would alter my very existence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t fear that I felt at that moment – more like the feeling of being watched. It was the feeling of knowing that danger lurks - the sensation of the hair standing on end at the back of your neck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking back on a moment that happened so many months ago, I now realize that I should have listened to that feeling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I would later find out, the man standing in front of me referred to himself as Master Lucas…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…and I was his next target.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Willow Parsons’s two new best friends are getting married, putting her squarely on the sidelines of romance—which suits her just fine. After the nightmarish situation she escaped from, featuring the ultimate Mr. Wrong, she is more than happy to spend her days slinging drinks in Dempsey’s Bar &amp;amp; Grill, and her nights alone. But her Anchor Island refuge has just one catch: muscle-bound charmer Randy Navarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in town knows that Randy, owner of the local fitness club, is a giant teddy bear. Everyone, it seems, except for Willow. He’s convinced that her avoidance is more than just playing hard to get, and is determined to uncover the secrets that shadow her lovely eyes. But when old fears are dragged into the light, can Randy get Willow to stay and fight for their love…or will she take flight, leaving him and Anchor Island behind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Home to Stay&lt;/em&gt; is a charming, romantic tale about following your heart to find where you belong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Day of Employment: 359&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11:05 a.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location: Cubicles outside Canon’s office.&lt;br&gt;Co-workers: Betting on how long Canon’s new PA will last.&lt;br&gt;Me: No doubts. Ms. Gum-smacker won’t last the day. I need to place my bet.&lt;br&gt;Manolo Blahnik’s New Fall Shoes: Mine. As soon as Madeline hands over my winnings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma Baker has never spoken a word to Alaric Canon, nor has he to her. But she’s studied him every day across the office tundra for almost a year. Canon is hard and fierce, terrifying and beautiful. He’s also the most stern, unforgiving person Emma has ever seen. Emma’s co-workers run a betting pool for Personal Assistant terminations. There’s a separate pot for the day one leaves without crying. Not likely…Canon made a former Navy SEAL cry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has high standards and low tolerance. Everyone knows it. Everyone stays away. Everyone who can, that is. Except Emma. She can’t look away. Alaric Canon is the single most attractive man she’s ever seen. Bar none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Canon has never noticed her. Not once in almost a year. She’s not even a blip on his radar. But she will be. His radar will be blipless no more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a goal. Emma has a plan.</description>

  &lt;strong&gt;It isn't just a few flames; it's an especially large and destructive fire that causes devastation.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Branson Wellington? The name, my name, is usually followed by &lt;em&gt;fucking prick&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;self-serving bastard&lt;/em&gt;, and I can't say I haven't earned those titles. It's true. I'm not the good guy. I'm not the boy next door. I'm definitely not your Prince fucking Charming. Not even close. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I never wanted to be. &lt;em&gt;Until her. &lt;/em&gt; The day I pulled her from the wreckage is the day that my life changed. I wasn't a hero, and I'm certainly not a savior, but that's how she saw me and I didn't have the heart to tell her she was wrong. Completely and utterly wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One car wreck. A single explosion. Two connecting scars. Two lives about to be turned upside down.</description>

  <description>When I met Kiersten, time stood still. It was as if every cell in my body screamed HER. I couldn't look away, I couldn't walk away, I couldn't even move. My other half, my soul mate, was staring right at me. I had to have her. I had to make her mine. But I felt selfish doing that--knowing that I may not have endless amounts of time to give her...and even now that every things' over with and I've been given that time back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is ever certain in this life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is why I'm about to do something crazy, impulsive, daring. &lt;br&gt;After all, what type of person would I be if I didn't take my own advice?&lt;br&gt;I'm jumping off the cliff, I'm living fearlessly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the continuation of Wes and Kiersten's story.</description>

  <description>32 year old Sebastian Vanwell, was a very successful yacht broker, who always loved the design and architecture of a luxurious boat. His only addiction was being on the water. He loved it, he thrived on it, and he needed it in his life. After a very stable, loving childhood with only a few bumps, Sebastian married the love of his life. The one person that he knew would always be there. Julia was his rock, and he loved her more than life itself. Sebastian kept his addiction to the water under control, wanting to keep his time with his wife and son his number one obsession, that was until he saw her. This new addiction haunted him, the one compulsion that he couldn't control no matter how hard he tried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ysabelle Telle hit him hard, knocking the wind from his lungs. Coming from worlds apart, beautiful, dark complexion Ysabelle Telle didn't have the rich, protected background that Sebastian Vanwell had. Ysabelle lived a life of hell, in poverty, growing up with a drug addict mother that never cared, and horrific living conditions. Ysabelle lived for one person and one person only; herself. She was pure perfection, her beauty along with a flawless body had men lined up, driveling over her ensuring her success as a VIP.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are too many words that describe the effects when two diverse worlds like theirs collide. They both have too much to lose to get caught in the forceful pull, which could destroy them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning sex/drugs/language. Mature readers only.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Elle was never broken. &lt;br&gt;She wasn't shattered.&lt;br&gt;And she sure as hell never needed to be saved. &lt;br&gt;That is, &lt;br&gt;until she found out what the aftermath of love was capable of causing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing her best to stay afloat amidst the sh!t storm that has become her life, Elle is hanging on by a thread. Between worrying about Fernie’s precarious future, an incident with a Shemar Moore look-alike gone terribly wrong, and an inability to let go of her feelings for J, Elle just can’t seem to get her head straight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deciding a change of atmosphere is what she needs, Elle heads to Mexico to study abroad for a semester. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has no idea that she is walking into an even worse storm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One that involves a pissed off MC President, a ruthless drug cartel, and a man willing to die to have her light.</description>

  <description>She caught my attention the first day I was seated in her class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her dark red hair fell in waves down her back and her alabaster skin appeared to sparkle under the lights of the lecture hall&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd admired her from a distance, never speaking or doing anything to draw attention to myself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each day that I spent watching her in this room, I noticed how her eyes would flick up to me. She was wary of me - frightened - and she had reason to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allow me to introduce myself…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Holland Strong and at 21 years old, I'm the youngest Master within a society of wealthy and influential men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clair Elliot is my psychology professor in college - that is, at least, until I make her my first courtesan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She believes she knows everything about how the mind works…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…and I believe I can prove her wrong.</description>

  <description>No one billionaire is alike. Some are cruel, others twisted. There are even a few that drip with sex, yet love to break a woman's heart. Dawn has had her fair share of billionaires, but it seems they haven't finished with her just yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she met brothers, Max and Freddy, she played their game for a while and finished it stronger than when she started. Now there's a new game threatening to consume her, and even more players begging for a taste. Dawn can't run from these men anymore. It's time to deal with them one by one, and decide if she's truly theirs to crave.</description>

  <description>Mike Haddican is a proud small-town gym owner, a renowned karate instructor, and all-around good guy. He’s never needed much to be happy: his family, his friends, his girl. Especially his girl. But when Kyra left him seven years ago to chase her dreams, she all but destroyed him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contemporary dancer Kyra Brims made it big, but it cost her dearly. With her life and career in shambles, she doesn’t need a do-over, she needs a friggin’ miracle. Injured, broke, and out of options after going through hell, she’s come back to Alden, the town she swore she’d never return to and home of Mike Haddican, the man who ripped her soul to pieces, to lick her wounds and recover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forgetting and letting go proved impossible when they were worlds apart; now that they’re stuck together they don’t stand a chance, especially with Mike’s grandma and her partners in crime plotting, meddling and refusing to give up on them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the passion that never died burns out of control, so do old hurts and unresolved issues. Both have reasons to be angry and feel betrayed, but now that they’re older, are they wise enough to make things work?</description>

  <description>Ava Gilmore has the perfect life.  She’s surrounded by people who love her, she’s having sex on a regular basis and her Coach bag collection just grew by three. The problem? She’s expected to follow in her family’s footsteps at Seduction and Snacks, working with sex toys and baked goods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ava loves vibrators and cupcakes as much as the next person, she’d just rather play with them than sell them. With her shopping addiction reaching an all time high and her credit card bills piling up, Ava decides to put her obsession to good use and start a fashion blog. But she has one other problem - the guy she’s having sex with has a My Little Pony addiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While dealing with her family’s disappointment and confusion over her choices, she finds support in the unlikeliest of places – Tyler Branson. Tyler has slowly wormed his way into her bed, her a$$ and her heart and he refuses to leave. Tyler has his own family problems to deal with and for the first time ever, Ava finds herself feeling bad for the annoying, immature guy and chanting “Friendship is magic!” during the sex she’d swore to stop having with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ava needs to get her life in order once and for all before she finds herself doing something she never wanted to do – fall in love with a Brony.</description>

  <description>WARNING: This novel contains disturbingly explicit sexual and deviant content that may be considered offensive to some readers, including rape, torture and cannibalism.&lt;br&gt;_________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen-year-old Hillary Greyson awakens from a horrific nightmare only to discover that she faces an even grimmer reality.  Naked on a bed in an unfamiliar, empty room, she is unable to move her limbs.  Worse, she cannot remember who she is.  Panic-stricken, Hillary desperately searches her mind for answers, but finds nothing more than fear and confusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man enters the room—a stranger to Hillary.  He introduces himself as Dr. Morrison.  Seemingly benign, he informs Hillary that she is there for her own good…that she is under his care until she regains her memory.  Hillary cannot remember anything, but her instincts warn her not to trust this man who claims to be her doctor.  She can only hope that someone will come looking for her…that someone will find her before it is too late.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several weeks later, Hillary’s situation has grown even more dismal.  Still unclothed, coarse ropes bind her limbs to the bed while she is fed intravenously.  Two new strangers have entered her life—Monica, Dr. Morrison’s wife, and Dr. Bentley, who claims to be her psychiatrist.  Yet they are more evasive than forthcoming.  Her questions remain unanswered.  She is trapped, with no hope of escaping…left to piece together the mystery of her miserable existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abused and neglected, Hillary knows that with each passing day, her chance of survival diminishes.  She spends her long days wasting away, growing depressed…growing angry.  When all hope seems lost, a cruel twist of fate provides the opportunity she has been waiting for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With renewed hope and an unrelenting will to survive, Hillary does whatever it takes to escape.  She yearns for her freedom more than anything in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hillary just wants to go home….</description>

  <description>‘Good pussy bad pussy. I knew something had awakened in me, something I’d never experienced before. A force, a power, a drive, an energy. Call it good pussy, call it bad pussy, call it whatever you will, but a life force had been awakened in me and I couldn’t put it (her) back to sleep again. Right or wrong, she was awake! She was alive! And she wanted more.’ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good Pussy Bad Pussy is a sexual thriller and erotic romance &lt;br&gt;about a woman caught in the crosscurrents between love and abuse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this fascinating tale of forbidden sex and guilty pleasures, readers can follow the beautiful and naïve Rachel in her dangerous attempt to be free, follow her heart and satisfy her pussy – all at the same time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Amsterdam to the French Riviera to New York City… from her blond lover Stefan, to the aristocratic Albert, and mad doctor Howard, Rachel tastes the forbidden fruit – and likes it. That is until life takes a very surprising turn! And yet another…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Good Pussy Bad Pussy” is a very modern love story and an addictive, erotic page-turner.</description>

  <description>Hallen Jansen has it all. At 28, he has a flashy car, a great apartment, and a job he’s good at and that he loves – as an escort – working at your beck and call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His life is easy, with no emotions or attachments slowing him down – choosing to keep moving, always running from the past.&lt;br&gt;But when a new client awakens unfamiliar feelings, all bets are off. Can he convince a recently divorced woman twenty years older to trust men again – to trust him? Can Hallen trust himself not to screw things up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surrounded by people who choose to judge them, will they make their relationship a reality, or is it heartbreak for both?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not all services are professional.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Fed up with her comfortable and dull-to-boredom life, Liv takes the bravest leap, leaving it all behind. Unfortunately the crux of her issues – her entrenched, well-kept emotional guard – tags along for the ride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the spirit of change burning from every pore and a determined plan to break free from her self-oppressed lifestyle to enjoy life’s simplest pleasures, she moves half way across the globe to a peaceful Spanish coastal town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With an aim to feel whole again, liberated and happy by herself, Liv begins her journey while maintaining weekly-cyber therapy sessions with her long time, questionable shrink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Liv finally begins to enjoy her new life and experience the varied goods the exotic country has to offer, a sudden major turn leads Liv to be swept into the most tantalizing roller coaster of her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A turn that leaves her questioning everything she thought was right.</description>

  <description>From the author of &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;, the classic portrait of the damaged contemporary male psyche, now comes this novel about the apocalyptic marketing possibilities of female pleasure. Sisters will be doing it for themselves. And doing it. And doing it. And doing it some more. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Penny Harrigan is a low level associate in a big Manhattan law firm with an apartment in Queens and no love life at all. So it comes as a great shock when she finds herself invited to dinner by one C. Linus Maxwell, aka "Climax-Well," a software mega-billionaire and lover of the most gorgeous and accomplished women on earth. After dining at Manhattan's most exclusive restaurant, he whisks Penny of to a hotel suite in Paris, where he proceeds, notebook in hand, to bring her to previously undreamed of heights of orgasmic pleasure for days on end. What's not to like?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This: Penny discovers that she is a test subject for the final development of a line of sex toys to be marketed in a nationwide chain of boutiques called "Beautiful You." So potent and effective are these devices that women by the millions line up outside the stores on opening day and then lock themselves in their room with them and stop coming out. Except for batteries. Maxwell's plan for erotically enabled world domination must be stopped. But how?</description>

  <description>After Kylie narrowly escaped her abusive boyfriend, she moved to Florida to seek comfort in the arms of her first love, the sexy racecar driver Cameron.  Their feelings for one another were quickly rekindled and their relationship fueled by desire, as things heated up and she fell right back in love with him.&lt;br&gt;     However, it was not long before her past caught up with her, which leaves Kylie lying on a gurney in the back on an ambulance, fighting for her life.  Cameron feels powerless as he watches the love of his life slipping away from him.  Cameron blames himself and is overcome with guilt for failing to keep his promise to protect her.&lt;br&gt;     Kylie’s love for Cameron gives her newfound strength to survive making her more determined than ever to defy the bastard that put her in this situation, but most of all she wants to start over with the man she loves.  Will she survive and seek justice, finally being able to put her past behind her?  Or will her past keep catching up to haunt her?&lt;br&gt;      “I would give anything just to have Kylie open her eyes for a second so she knows we are here for her and I can tell her that I love her.”  ~~Cameron&lt;br&gt;     I can hear Cameron and Courtney’s voices over the machines as they talk, but as hard as I try I still cannot open my eyes.  I feel like I am in the twilight zone, my limbs are still too heavy to move but my mind is aware of what people are saying.  ~~Kylie</description>

  <description>A murderer’s child…A foster child…A troubled teen…Gabriel ‘The Saint’ Vega has never had an easy life. Being shuffled from one foster home to another after his father murdered his mother, he found himself in and out of trouble with the law. Never giving a damn about himself, let alone anyone else, his life was spiraling out of control; fast. Until one man and one sport changed everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frankie Carbone taught Saint how to handle his anger and rejection; by fighting it out in the ring. On his way to stardom, Saint finds himself pushed into the spotlight and into the arms of more women than he can ever imagine; he’s completely content with one night stands and random sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Salem Harris comes walking into his life and changes his game plan. Saint finds himself wanting Salem in all the ways that scare him. She is off limits; taken. But that doesn’t stop Saint from going after what he wants, and he wants her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Frankie showed Saint a new way of life with Boxing, but will Salem give him the one thing he's never known – love? Will Saint find himself fighting for the one thing he thinks he doesn't deserve or will Salem end up breaking his heart? Gabriel ‘The Saint’ Vega has had to fight for every good thing he's gotten in his life. Can he go the distance?</description>

  <description>"This epic tale spanning past and present will have you on the edge of your seat.  Set in a world of Voodoo, spirits, and the historic locale of New Orleans, Villere House is deliciously spooky and romantic." ~ Tracey Garvis Graves, author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller, On The Island and Covet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;College senior, Lottie Boyd, expects to drink too much while on spring break in New Orleans. What she doesn't expect is to be haunted. Or fall in love. But that's exactly what happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It starts with strange, vivid dreams about a 19th century widow so desperate to save her sick little girl, she's willing to do anything--even if it involves the black magic of Voodoo. It doesn't end there. Voices, ghost sightings, familiarity with things and places she couldn't possibly know. All leading her to the Villere House of Voodoo and the young Creole owner, Xavier Villere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xavier is compelled to help and is drawn to Lottie in a way he's never known, but skepticism of his family's century-old link to Voodoo and the occult keep her at arms length. If he can only come to terms with his heritage, he might be able to help solve the mystery of the widow plaguing Lottie's dreams. And maybe even find love in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Villere House is an adult romance and not suitable for readers under 18.</description>

  <description>He’s thirty-eight. I’m twenty-three.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He speaks Spanish. I speak English.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He lives in Spain. I live in Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He dresses in thousand-dollar suits. I’m covered in tattoos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s married and has a five-year old daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m single and can’t commit to anyone or anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until now.Because when they say you can’t choose who you fall in love with, boy ain’t that the f*#king truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                            ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a restless dreamer like Vera Miles, it sounded like the experience of a lifetime. Instead of spending her summer interning for her astronomy major, she would fly to Spain where she’d spend a few weeks teaching conversational English to businessmen and women, all while enjoying free room and board at an isolated resort. But while Vera expected to get a tan, meet new people and stuff herself with wine and paella, she never expected to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mateo Casalles is unlike anyone Vera has ever known, let alone anyone she’s usually attracted to. While Vera is a pierced and tatted free spirit with a love for music and freedom, Mateo is a successful businessman from Madrid, all sharp suits and cocky Latino charm. Yet, as the weeks go on, the two grow increasingly close and their relationship changes from purely platonic to something…more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that makes Vera feel alive for the first time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something that can never, ever be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so she thinks.</description>

  <description>A man driven by his desires. &lt;br&gt;Tyler Moore is considered cold, ruthless, and determined to get everything he wants. CEO of a flourishing oil company, he thrives on order and never gives up control to anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woman from his past.  &lt;br&gt;Monique Delome has left her unhappy past behind to pursue her dream of becoming a writer. Love is something she believes is better suited to the pages of her novels and not meant for real life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether in the boardroom or the bedroom, Tyler Moore is always in charge. But when Monique Delome walks back into his life, everything changes. A successful romance author, all the sexy leading men Monique writes about strangely remind everyone of Tyler. Intrigued, Tyler sets out to seduce the one woman he could never forget. Soon Tyler gets more than he bargained for, and his grip on his well-ordered life is turned upside down. &lt;br&gt;     Tyler Moore is about to find out what happens when a romantic tale jumps from the pages and comes to life between the sheets.</description>

  <description>"For every action there is an equal or opposite reaction."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For every choice you make there are rewards, &lt;br&gt;or there are consequences.&lt;br&gt;It was my choice to walk away the first time.&lt;br&gt;And my choice to chase her the second.&lt;br&gt;But sometimes you don't get a choice, &lt;br&gt;and all you get are the consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, &lt;br&gt;while loving someone deeply gives you courage.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless that someone is Logan Matthews. &lt;br&gt;Because loving him didn't give me &lt;br&gt;the strength to walk away.&lt;br&gt;It didn't give me &lt;br&gt;the courage to fight for him.&lt;br&gt;And when it was over, &lt;br&gt;all it gave me was a broken heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Sawyer's story from The Art of D/s trilogy.&lt;/em&gt; Can be read as a stand alone novel or as a companion to The Art of D/s Trilogy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Contains detailed sexual encounters, BDSM themes, oral, anal, ménage, F/F and profanity.&lt;/strong&gt; Not for the closed-minded, prudish, sexually inhibited, easily offended, or faint-hearted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reliable, trustworthy, loyal to a fault - Sawyer is the kind of man other men want to be; a real man's man. But behind the facade of a his tough exterior and deadly silence hides a strong, tortured man with dark secrets. Always content to be in the shadows, now is the time of his sexual awakening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Sawyer realized that there were women who unabashedly wanted to be dominated and controlled, and there was a world that embraced such things as domination and submission - everything seemed to fall into place. Tired of pretending to be someone he wasn't and suppressing his dominant tendencies, he takes the leap into the world of BDSM under the guidance of his friend and mentor, never to look back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the dark past and his heinous actions are hard to forget and even more difficult to leave behind. Will he be able to move forward and become the man he yearns to be? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Sawyer's journey into becoming Dominant, Master, &lt;em&gt;Sir&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

For her, the family cabin she spent her youthful summers in, now holds a dark memory that has haunted her every day for the last year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While struggling to forget her past, Allie runs into Damien, a local rebel with secrets of his own. He's dark, dangerous and he keeps showing up when Allie least expects him to. She has every reason not to trust him. So why does she find herself opening up to him in a way she hasn't been able to with anyone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As pieces of Damien’s identity emerge, answers to a rumored mystery begin to unfold. By the time Allie unearths the secrets of Damien’s past, she realizes just how intricately they are connected. Now she is caught in a dangerous battle that threatens her life and those she loves.</description>

  <description>Lauren has decided her marriage is over, but has yet to tell Jay, her abusive husband of the past twenty five years. On a night out with girlfriends, she has a few drinks and musters the courage to shamefully come clean over the abuse she has suffered over the years.&lt;br&gt;Gabriel joins his brothers for a friday night drink at a local bar, thirty five, good looking and single after a very brief, failed marriage, all he is ever on the lookout for is a hook up....Even names aren't important to him...Straight sex, no complications.&lt;br&gt;Watch as their worlds collide, neither of them prepared for the effect each will have on the other. The chemistry is instant and overwhelming and has the possibility to destroy them but will the mind blowing sex be enough to keep them together and overcome each of their pasts?&lt;br&gt;Their story is sometimes harrowing and heartbreaking and touches on subjects all too often avoided. Don't expect a hearts and flowers romance read, although that is there too, along with some very funny moments</description>

  <description>He’s a young, up and coming businessman with the keys to his family’s Italian wine enterprise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m a fine arts student, navigating life in the Big Apple, my pencil and sketchpad in hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We meet. We fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, by a rare gift of fate, two lives cross paths. And hey, if that happens to occur when staring at Michelangelo’s naked masterpiece, even better. We can tell our future children how a seventeen-foot tall marble guy named David brought us together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there’s always more to a relationship than its beginning and ever after. In life, there’s a whole lot of backstory. There are ex-fiancés and hot roommates and family members whose advice continues, even beyond the grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you say you love someone, it’s never just that one person you’re saying it to. And it’s never just that one moment that sets everything in motion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is always more that draws you in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Draw Me In is a non-explicit New Adult romance, meaning no graphic sex scenes. But if you are in the mood for a little bit of laughter, a little bit of tears, and a whole lot of tears from all of that laughter, then this is the novel for you.)</description>

  <description>My father was most certainly NOT an innocent man. As the leader of the Gypsy Brothers MC, he was guilty of many things. But he died for a crime that he didn’t commit, framed by an enemy within who then stole his club and everything he had ever worked to protect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Including my innocence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dornan Ross framed my father, he set into motion a series of events that could never be undone. My father was murdered by Dornan Ross and his sons when I was fifteen years old.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before my father died, Dornan Ross and his seven sons stole my innocence, branded my skin and in doing so, ensured that their lives would be prematurely cut short. That they would suffer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve just turned twenty-one, and I’m out for blood. I'm out for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I didn't expect to fall for Jase, the youngest brother in the club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't expect that he would turn my world upside down, yank my heart out of my chest and ride away into the sunset with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, I'm faced with an impossible choice - Jase, or avenging my fathers death?</description>

  <description>I have lied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have cheated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have given my body and my life to the man who destroyed my family and left me for dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have killed, I have sinned, and worst of all, I have enjoyed the misery of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have licked the salty tears of a father mourning his firstborn son, and nothing has ever tasted so sweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have died, and I have been resurrected, a phoenix from the ashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know I’m going to hell. I’ll burn in the fiery pits alongside Dornan and his sons for the things I’ve done, and for the things I’m about to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I don’t care. It will be worth every lick of the devils flames on my guilty flesh to destroy Dornan Ross.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One down, six to go.</description>

It's only when she’s ambushed by al Qaeda that Dorian is knocked unconscious and awakens to find herself bound and gagged in a stranger's bed. She desperately tries to escape, but quickly finds herself enamored with her captor's alarming handsomeness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rob Hutcherson is a former Sergeant of the United States Marine Corps, who stumbled upon an al Qaeda ambush.

  <description>Raven Blake didn’t butcher her husband. Or at least, she doesn’t think she did. That’s the problem…she doesn’t remember. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deemed “Lady Butcher” by the media, Raven sits in the county jail awaiting her trial. If convicted of the brutal crime she’ll face the death penalty. But everything changes when Cayden Dillon becomes her lawyer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cayden doesn’t want to represent the deadly female, but he doesn’t have a choice. She evokes a darkness in him that he didn’t know was there. He wants to be disgusted with her, but with each meeting he finds himself drawn to her…desperate to&lt;em&gt; own&lt;/em&gt; her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The forbidden pair fall into something dark and twisted that tests the bounds of who they are. While Raven toggles with reality, Cayden struggles with his inner demons that beg for complete control. Together they will search for the truth…but some things are better left forgotten…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Butchered Love is a New Adult Dark Erotic Romance intended for those who like damaged characters and borderline non-consensual sex. Read at your own risk.</description>

  <description>A deadly game of hide and seek. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With blood still on her hands, Samantha Matthews is on the run, running from dark secrets and a man she prays to God will never find her. Running and hiding, just to stay alive. She had no choice but to run, to leave, to hide and forget about her life before. When Samantha believes she's gained enough distance from her past and her demons, she stops running, hoping to find her future in the heavily wooded area of the Adirondack Mountains, a place she never expected to encounter a man with secrets as dark and as sordid as hers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kade Grayson is hiding, not from the demons after him, but from himself and from the entire outside world, wishing every day he could have just died. Arrogant and domineering, he’s tormented and terrorized by his past, seeing nothing good for his future. With the ghosts of his past still haunting him, he has exiled himself to a life of solitude, only living for his words and through his stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An undeniable attraction, turns into hate and then ultimately obsession, an obsession that grows into a powerful story of love and redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will the bond they have begun to build between them grow stronger than the tragedies that have scarred both of their lives? Or will they allow their demons to consume them?</description>

  <description>Ryan Kendall is broken. He understands pain. He knows the hand of violence and the ache of loss. He knows what it means to fail those who need you. Being broken doesn’t stop him wanting the one thing he can’t have; Finlay Tanner. Her smile is sweet and her future bright. She’s the girl he grew up with, the girl he loves, the girl he protects from the world, and from himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At nineteen, Ryan leaves to join the Australian Army. After years of training he becomes an elite SAS soldier and deploys to the Afghanistan war. His patrol undertakes the most dangerous missions a soldier can face. But no matter how far he runs, or how hard he fights, his need for Finlay won’t let go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning home after six years, one look is all it takes to know he can’t live without her. But sometimes love isn’t enough to heal what hurts. Sometimes people like him can’t be fixed, and sometimes people like Finlay deserve more than what’s left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story about war and the cost of sacrifice. Where bonds are formed, and friendships found. Where those who are strong, fall hard. Where love is let go, heartache is born, and heroes are made. Where one man learns that the hardest fight of all, is the fight to save himself.</description>

  <description>Twenty-five-year-old Tommy Costello has been going out on the road with his best friend Jim Reilly since they were kids. They've pulled cons together, picked up dates together, and have always had each other's back. They're as close as brothers, and Tommy's sure their bond will never be broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until Maggie Downey shows up. She's an enigma: smart, bold, and charming. From the moment they meet, sparks fly. But there's a huge problem. She's arranged to be married to Jim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tommy tries to keep his feelings for Maggie in check, but it's not easy, especially when he's also hiding a dark secret for his best friend. Jim is gay, and that reality will not only make him an outcast among the Travelers, but could mean a life of misery for Maggie as well. Tommy does his best to protect both his friendship and his own heart, but it's soon clear that falling in love with his best friend's wife is the least dangerous thing happening in the Village.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Waiting Game is a prequel to The Long Game, and the second book in J.L. Fynn’s American Gypsy series.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From the&lt;/em&gt; New York Times &amp;amp; USA Today &lt;em&gt;Bestselling Author who brought you WAIT FOR ME comes the next emotional love story in Elisabeth Naughton's bestselling Against All Odds Series:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;He thinks he’s finally found the one.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitch Mathews never believed in love—at least not the happily ever after kind. Then he met Simone Conners. Just one night with the sexy lawyer made him reevaluate his priorities and look toward a future he never planned. The only hang up is making her see it too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;She’s almost ready for a second chance.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;What started out as a casual hookup with a rugged geologist has turned into something a whole lot more. Simone’s on the verge of handing over her heart, but fear over what Mitch will say and do when he learns who she used to be holds her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The past could destroy their future...&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when Simone is about to take a chance on forever with Mitch, the mistakes of her past catch up with her. Suddenly it’s not just her safety on the line anymore, it’s his too. Forced into hiding, Mitch demands answers, and Simone realizes the only way to protect everything she holds dear is to delve into a past she’s spent fourteen years trying to forget. As they search for the truth, they discover secrets, lies and a rekindled passion that burns hotter than before. But they also uncover a conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of society. One that could cost them more than just their future…it could cost them their lives.</description>

  <description>Loving Chris Henderson would be wrong. Diabolically disastrous. I mean, what is there about him to love? He’s moody, bossy, brooding, a control freak, and that’s on a good day … but there was one achingly obvious fact that haunted my every thought, every minute of every day …&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sure could kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the countdown to the new millennium begins, there is one thing everyone agrees on: no one wants to be in Onslow for New Year’s Eve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that can only mean one thing: road trip!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No longer the mousey, invisible, shy girl from years ago, Tammy Maskala is finally making up for all those lost summers. A new year with new friends, which astoundingly includes the bossy boy behind the bar, Chris Henderson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She likes her new friends (at least most of them), so why does she secretly feel so out of place?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After chickening out on the trip, a last-minute change of heart sees Tammy racing to the Onslow Hotel, fearing she’s missed her chance for a ride. The last thing she expected to meet was a less-than-happy Onslow Boy leaning against his black panel van.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the countdown begins to reach the others at Point Shank before the party is over and the new year has begun. Alone in a car with only the infuriating Chris Henderson, Tammy can’t help but feel this is a disastrous start to what could have been a great adventure. But when the awkward road trip takes an unexpected turn, Tammy soon discovers that the way her traitorous heart feels about Chris is the biggest disaster of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fogged up windows, moonlight swimming, bad karaoke and unearthed secrets; after this one summer nothing will ever be the same again.</description>

Since then, she has worked hard to give herself the life, and career, that she always dreamed of. As the Publishing Assistant at Knight Media, her dreams are slowly but surely coming true…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But something is missing…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyler Knight is young, rich and the heir to the multi-million dollar fortune that is known as ‘Knight Media’ – the biggest and most successful media company in Chicago.

He can’t give her what she wants, but that doesn’t stop him from pursuing her. When one passionate night changes everything, Cassey must decide whether or not she can accept what Kyler is offering, or walk away from how he makes her feel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, things change, lines are blurred, hearts are broken and Cassey is left to pick up the pieces after her hot, steamy relationship with Kyler becomes so much more… &lt;br&gt;Can she move forward or was she always destined to fall?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This is an Adult Contemporary Romance Novel.

  <description>I am a slut. No worries. I've come to terms with it, and you will too. I’m not one of those girls who thinks she’s too plain, too fat, too skinny, too shy … no, I don’t have that kind of luck. I’m the girl who knows she’s just right for everyone.  — Denver&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A reputation as a manwhore–with–a–heart–of–gold tends to precede me. But, I don’t do girls with issues, that is until this girl. It's this girl I want to fix. This girl I want to protect. And maybe … more. — Ransom&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being in love with the same girl your entire life isn't all it's cracked up to be. She uses me in every way imaginable. How does she see me? I am her perpetual one-night stand. No strings, no attachments. Just mind-numbing sex ... for her anyway. — Greer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeling like the life is being choked out of her in the small town of Anaconda, Montana, Denver Dempsey craves the escape that college offers … even if that means leaving her “best friend with benefits” and looking for a new way to forget. Thinking she's found the perfect hookup in Ransom, Denver's outlook on college is bright. That is, until Greer shows up looking for a second chance, and Ransom's interest turns to hatred.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love. Hate. Triangle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who's using who?</description>

  <description>Angel Mabbot is the perfect daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perfection has always been an expectation set forth by her adoring father and her overbearing, neglectful mother. Knowing she can never live up to their standards, Angel falls into a life of partying, drinking and pills in an effort to dull the pain of her insecurities and perceived failures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kevin Hawken, a former business partner of Angel’s father, has always loved Angel, although she has no idea who he is. Angel's substance induced state of mind forces her to question what is real. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Kevin is too good to be real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caught in the clutches of Roman Conti, a notorious and dangerous Mob boss from Italy, Angel slips under Roman’s control. A control she can't escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the only man who can rescue her...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is a man she believes existed only in her dreams.</description>

  <description>He needs her to save a friend.&lt;br&gt;She needs him to plan her revenge.&lt;br&gt;Their pasts scar them Layers Deep.&lt;br&gt;Their passion distracts them...&lt;br&gt;...and distractions can be fatal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tristan Cross is battling emotional demons from the past. He lives in a world where trust is earned, loyalties are tested, and love is impossible. That is, until he meets Allie Green.  She’s the only woman who can help him find a kidnapped friend and to top it off, she captivates him. All he has to do now is persuade her to work for Cross Enterprises, his top investigations firm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Allie Green is a rookie cop seeking revenge and she’s willing to sell her soul to get it. With an opportunity to use Tristan Cross's resources Allie calculates her time for payback. As vengeance boils her blood she can’t keep her mind off her new boss and Allie finds it difficult to keep her employment professional. With the mouth watering Tristan Cross distracting her, she struggles to prioritize an undercover job she’s been assigned and her hunger for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when you’re ready to give up your life to save someone else, distractions can be fatal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: This book is the first part of a Trilogy that is designed to be read in order. Tristan and Allie will get their happy ending but not until book 2 and 3. This book contains a cliff hanger ending you will not expect. A prequel to the series which can be read alone is Dazzled by Silver.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This title contains erotic situations, and graphic language. Intended for adult audience 18+.</description>

  <description>I've stopped panicking now. Not because I'm not scared. I just know panicking won't help the situation. It'll only serve to make it worse. Need to try and remain calm for as long as possible. Control my breathing. Save my oxygen. I breathed in and coughed. The air in here is stale. I hope I'm not in here for long. Please, dad. Don't let me be here for long. Please. I started to cry. Helpless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * * * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day after his 21st Birthday Party, Todd woke to find himself trapped in a box with nothing but broken memories for company. Told through his eyes, live his fear and feel his claustrophobia as he frantically tries to peace together what happened, who buried him and why in Matt Shaw's new horror novella.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover Design: Yaryshev Evgeny (&lt;a href="http://www.yd84.deviantart.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.yd84.deviantart.com&lt;/a&gt;)</description>

  <description>*** Sequel of Crashing Back Down ***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I don't know if it’s fate, coincidence, or my curse, but I'm still breathing, and my breaths are for you.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mags McManus is far from a normal woman in her mid twenties. Being a war widow, a business professional, and a brokenhearted train wreck only skims the surface of the layers of who Margret McManus truly is. Waking up in a hospital bed, alone and confused, Mags once again has to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart. With her best friends by her side, Mags slowly starts to learn the answers she so desperately longs for. But is everything going to continue to spiral out of control? Or is there a light at the end of this dark, twisting tunnel where all the broken pieces can finally fall back together?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A portion of all royalties from Falling Back Together are donated by the author to The Marcie Mazzola Foundation.&lt;br&gt;**18+ for sexual situations, cursing, and adult content.***</description>

  <description>Savannah Marshall is a gifted flutist and daughter of musical royalty when she enrolls in the elite New England Conservatory of Music. Brilliant, eclectic and passionate, she lives music, but struggles with her plans for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gregory Fitzgerald is one of the most renowned cellists of his generation. A member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and professor at the Conservatory, he is laser focused on his career to the exclusion of friends, family and especially romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gregory and Savannah’s paths cross in the classroom, it threatens to challenge more than their wildly differing beliefs on music. Friendships, ethics, and careers are put on the line as Gregory and Savannah play a symphony of passion and heartbreak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the final movement, Gregory and Savannah are handed their greatest challenge, as the loss of absolutely everything they’ve held as truths hangs in the balance.</description>

  <description>I was happy with my life. And who wouldn’t be? Beautiful women, money, a job that I could sleep through and still make bank. But I was bored. And I never could walk away from a challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This challenge turned out to be brunette. Feisty. Just the way I like them. But innocent. Too innocent for me. Too innocent to do anything other than sample and then toss back.  Anything more would be too risky, too much work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was unprepared for Julia Campbell. I should have done my homework, should have looked before jumping off that cliff. Ditching her proved to be problematic, my sexual needs greater than my common sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was different. She became more than a challenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She may just bring my world crashing down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This novella is meant to complement, and be read after, Blindfolded Innocence, a #1 Erotica Bestseller.</description>

  <description>The man was sinful. It wasn't just the looks that made him dangerous, it was the cocky confidence that dominated every move, every touch. And the frustrating yet ecstatic fact about the whole package was that he could back it all up… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia Campbell never knows what to expect with win-at-all-costs Brad De Luca. And she's starting to like it that way. She gave up safe, conventional relationships when she let the elite divorce attorney seduce her into his world. Now that he's determined to strip her naked of every inhibition, she's in danger of falling too deep and too fast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But their affair begins to feel even more dangerous when a murder leaves a trail of suspicion that points straight to the mob…and Brad. Trusting a man with a bad reputation and a past full of secrets seems like a mistake. But when she's forced to make a choice, the consequences will take her further than she could ever have imagined.</description>

  <description>Ani Forrest has spent most of her life trying to find the right path. She’s spent the last five years attempting to experience the world. But no matter how hard she tries, nothing ever feels right. With her father’s health failing, she finds herself back in the sleepy Tennessee town where she grew up. &lt;br&gt;However, fate has a choice for Ani to make, does she resume the life she once had or does she take the opportunity for something different? Cash Roberts, the man who once held her heart, is vowing to win Ani back. But the temptation of something new is too strong to resist when a handsome stranger shows up in town. Knox O’Connell has brought his M.C. to Coker Creek in an attempt to get away from the anarchy and chaos of Ireland. The last thing he needs is the enticement of a free spirited woman. That is until she turns his world upside down.&lt;br&gt;Will Knox be able to win Ani over? In the midst of rival M.C. retaliation, will she be able to put her worries aside and follow the path that fate has given her or will she stay on the road that has always been familiar? What would you do if your past and present collided together, leaving you standing at a crossroad unsure of which path to take.</description>

  <description>“You've owned me from the moment I walked into that music room. You've wrapped yourself in my heart and mind. I can’t get you out. I don’t want to.” ~ Rafael Van Rees&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sophie Fisher’s life is on fire. If she’s not ducking around corners or slipping out of windows to escape the debt collectors her father's death has left knocking on her door, she’s dealing with her rebellious, fifteen-year-old sister, Lilli. And, as if that’s not enough, Rafael Van Rees crashes into her life—literally—bringing with him a past the public has no idea of. Can she unravel his mysteries before he unravels her, or will his presence finally force her to face the demons she's trying to outrun?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rafael Van Rees prides himself on being in control of his destiny, music and women. As far as he is concerned, his past is a black cloud in the distance--until he meets Sophie, that is, and his world spins out of control in more ways than one. He knows the darkest sins and secrets eventually reveal themselves, but when it comes to Sophie, he'll stop at nothing to protect her from his past. Even if it kills him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Mature Content Warning** 17+ for language and sexual content</description>

  <description>Ivy’s revenge on the people behind her family’s downward spiral is simple and it’s working. There’s no need to long for help from the wealthy business owners who turned their backs on her father. Ivy may be worn out, but she’s finding herself again after joining the local BDSM club.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth has it all. He has homes around the world and the little red speedster he dreamed of as a little boy, but none of the things he can buy satisfy him, not the socialites hanging on his arm or the submissives falling at his feet. Then, he hires Ivy to plan his next event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth and Ivy enjoy each other’s company in and out of the planning stages for Seth’s charity event. Their playful bets lead them to a first date. When their secret kinks are revealed, the pair fall deep, but it’s not meant to last. Past hurts come back to haunt Ivy. Now, it’s time for Seth to use all he’s learned, regardless if he can win back the girl.</description>

  <description>All families have secrets, and Jules Stone’s is no exception. Deciding not to follow in her family's Oscar-winning footsteps, Jules chooses to take a more behind-the-scenes career in one of the Top 10 Talent Agencies in Chicago. After being dumped five hours before spending Christmas with her dysfunctional family, she needs a plan to avoid their judgmental eyes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter: Kayden Reece.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayden is the black sheep of his family, being the one actor drowning in a world of doctors and lawyers. Never really getting a jumpstart at his acting career or landing a big time role, he can feel his dad’s disappointment soaking into his spirit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kayden gets a chance to meet and sign with a big name agent at Walter and Jacks Talent Agency, he’s ready to prove everyone wrong. Jules stumbles into the building in shambles, ugly crying, and begging to pay an actor a big sum of money to be her made-up boyfriend for five days, Kayden jumps at the opportunity—finally able to say he landed a role. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When secrets start to unravel, Kayden and Jules must learn that all families have their baggage, sometimes co-stars fall in lust, and it’s important to always have invisible mistletoe hanging around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This holiday season join the two fake lovebirds as they partake in the role of a lifetime.</description>

  <description>It’s funny how the tiniest of things can change your life… an invitation, a simple kiss goodnight, a matchbook…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Auden Kelly is in need of a change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s trading in her nine-to-five sales job for the adventure of a lifetime: a one year contract with a European tour company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one full year, Auden will get paid to see the world. What could be better? Her brother gives her a journal, instructing her to document all of her adventures as she travels from country to country.

  <description>At the tender age of fourteen, Sarah Clark is seduced by her thirty-eight-year-old English teacher, Daniel Carr, and becomes entangled in an illegal, erotic, passionate, and dangerous affair—a vicious meeting of minds and bodies that ends badly. Devastated by grief and longing, Sarah embarks upon a series of meaningless self-abasing sexual encounters, hoping to reclaim the intensity of that first relationship. Then, seven years later, Carr unexpectedly returns and Sarah is drawn again into a destructive coupling. Now that she is no longer an innocent young girl, is she strong enough to finally tame the beast within her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A modern Lolita, &lt;em&gt;Taming the Beast&lt;/em&gt; is an emotionally unflinching and alluring tale that introduces a powerful new writer.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;From the author of the New York Times, USA Today &amp;amp; Wall Street Journal bestselling novel, THE EDGE OF NEVER, comes a story of passion and survival…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things don’t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victor’s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is their story…</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year old Ada Palomino tries her best to be a normal teenager. Partying with boys on the weekend, updating her fashion blog and trying to get into the design school of her choice should be the only things in her life right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they aren't.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since she was fifteen, Ada has had this uncanny ability to communicate with the dead, much like her older sister Perry. But while Perry has learned to tame this gift, Ada's is just getting started. When she meets a mysterious young man called Jacob at a wedding, she finds herself falling for him, despite the warnings from her family and those on the other side of the thin veil.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Ada is no ordinary woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Jacob is no ordinary man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the results of them together could be catastrophic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This is a spin-off of the Experiment in Terror Series*</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;No one creates realms like &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Anne Bishop. Now in a thrilling new fantasy series, enter a world inhabited by the Others, unearthly entities—vampires and shape-shifters among them—who rule the Earth and whose prey are humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As a &lt;em&gt;cassandra sangue&lt;/em&gt;, or blood prophet, Meg Corbyn can see the future when her skin is cut—a gift that feels more like a curse. Meg’s Controller keeps her enslaved so he can have full access to her visions. But when she escapes, the only safe place Meg can hide is at the Lakeside Courtyard—a business district operated by the Others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Shape-shifter Simon Wolfgard is reluctant to hire the stranger who inquires about the Human Liaison job. First, he senses she’s keeping a secret, and second, she doesn’t smell like human prey. Yet a stronger instinct propels him to give Meg the job. And when he learns the truth about Meg and that she’s wanted by the government, he’ll have to decide if she’s worth the fight between humans and the Others that will surely follow.</description>

  <description>A razor-sharp portrait of a morally bankrupt and gleefully wicked modern man, &lt;em&gt;Worst. Person. Ever.&lt;/em&gt; is Douglas Coupland's gloriously filthy, side-splittingly funny and unforgettable novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Raymond Gunt. A decent chap who tries to do the right thing. Or, to put it another way, the worst person ever: a foul-mouthed, misanthropic cameraman, trailing creditors, ex-wives and unhappy homeless people in his wake. Men dislike him, women flee from him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worst. Person. Ever.&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply unworthy book about a dreadful human being with absolutely no redeeming social value. Gunt, in the words of the author, "is a living, walking, talking, hot steaming pile of pure id." He's a B-unit cameraman who enters an amusing downward failure spiral that takes him from London to Los Angeles and then on to an obscure island in the Pacific where a major American TV network is shooting a &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt;-style reality show. Along the way, Gunt suffers multiple comas and unjust imprisonment, is forced to re-enact the 'Angry Dance' from the movie &lt;em&gt;Billy Elliot&lt;/em&gt; and finds himself at the centre of a nuclear war. We also meet Raymond's upwardly failing sidekick, Neal, as well as Raymond's ex-wife, Fiona, herself 'an atomic bomb of pain'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though he really puts the 'anti' in anti-hero, you may find Raymond Gunt an oddly likeable character.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Love is ugly and secrets will destroy you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KAT&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I don’t beg.&lt;br&gt;  I don’t cry.&lt;br&gt;  And I don’t give second chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ream, the lead guitarist of the rock band Tear Asunder, deserves a gold medal for best dick move ever when he ran the moment he discovered my secret after two days of hot sex. Then he brings some chick to my coming home party from the hospital—after being shot. &lt;br&gt;I hate him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Until … &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ream’s six foot two frame unfolds out of the car after being gone on tour for eight months. I stared. And in my defense, any girl would stare. It would almost be rude not to because Ream was the type of guy who stood out. Not because he was loud and obnoxious. No, it was because he was the complete opposite. Subtle and dangerously quiet. If he spoke, you’d better hope he liked you because otherwise you’d be falling at his feet begging for mercy. Except me … I don’t beg—ever. &lt;br&gt;But when our eyes locked, it was Ream’s steady confidence that had my nerves shooting off like jet sprinklers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Then…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ream told me he didn’t need a second chance because he was still working on his first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sex is ugly. It’s using someone for your own narcissistic pleasure. I did it, but hated it—until her. She was unfuckinexpected. Then I had to wreck our beginning with my screwed up past. I don’t deserve her, but I’m selfish and I’m taking her anyway. This is who I am and it’s too late to change me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Warning contains violence, sexual content, and coarse language. Some scenes may be triggers. Mature audiences 18+ &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A contemporary romance with lots of angst.</description>

  <description>Coming spring 2014&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Archer Riddick isn’t who you think he is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you thought he was a hot beta hero with a bruised heart, you’d be right. But he’s also other things. Things that are secret. Things you’ll never guess, not in a million years, oh no, ahahaha ahahaha ahahahahahahaaaa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His secrets were always buried beneath a heap of well-adjusted spunky man beast, but now that he’s trying to woo Enid, his lifelong friend, the darned things are just getting in the way. Plus Enid’s a whore and Archer’s a virgin, and he can’t shake the horny but disturbing idea that he’s an untried young knight and she’s a wizened pagan prostitute, or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then comes the opportunity he’s been waiting for: an invitation to the world’s best re-enactment fayre at a clichéd castle in England. Archer knows there’s no better place to seduce a girl, and before they know it, the gang are off to stay at Hunter von Styles’ country pile in Salisbury. But will Archer win Enid’s heart? Will Enid tolerate the rehashed storylines? And will Sparkles von Fancypants the unicorn survive an eight hour flight with no internet?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Joey W. Hill—author of the Knights of the Boardroom series—comes a novel of erotic games and power plays, in which an adventurous woman attempts to break down her own barriers…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Athena is an accomplished businesswoman in control of every aspect of her life. But since the death of her husband, she’s had the desire to explore submissive cravings she’s had for some time. Unfortunately, Athena is known as a Mistress, because that’s the role she’s always played.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Her type A personality was strong enough to serve her husband as a Domme because that’s what he needed. It’s not until she meets Dale, a retired Navy SEAL, that she attempts to discover what her own submissive desires are. But letting go of her control is not so easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Fortunately, Dale is an accomplished Master who can help Athena live out her fantasies. And as she slowly surrenders to his touch, both of them will learn more about the nature of love between Dominant and submissive, and how it defies all expectations.</description>

  <description>** CAN BE READ AS A STAND ALONE NOVEL**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayden Michaels has a past filled with sex, addiction, and heartache. A past that he’s avoided sharing with the love of his life, Sophia, and held close to his core not risking rejection. Needing to get his addictions in check and gain control of his life for the sake of his family, Kayden is forced to confront his past and make amends for the path he’s walked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kayden must recount every carnal act and the betrayal from those he’s loved to identify the triggers that spur his addictions and overcome it all to be worthy of Sophia’s love – his sole reason to exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is NOT a novella.</description>

  <description>It seems a perfect match: Sarah Abadhi, an infertile workaholic attorney with no hope or expectation of marriage and babies, and Rick Smith, a driven PICU doctor who’s allergic to commitment. After meeting on a high-profile malpractice case, they spend five perfect months together, but things are brought to a screeching halt when Sarah inexplicably becomes pregnant. After they part company, the unexpected pregnancy drives them to cultivate the barren landscapes of their interior lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in contemporary New York City, Fertility will appeal to readers who enjoy curling up with a complex love story — one where the two protagonists have to dig deep within themselves to overcome the hand they’ve been dealt. An excellent choice for women’s book groups.</description>

  <description>Reaper's Legacy is a raw and intensely erotic tale in Joanna Wylde's Reapers Motorcycle Club series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight years ago, Sophie gave her heart-and her virginity-to Zach Barrett on a night that couldn't have been less romantic or more embarrassing. Zach's step-brother, a steely-muscled, tattooed biker named Ruger, caught them in the act, getting a peep show of Sophie he's never forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She may have lost her dignity that fateful night, but Sophie also gained something precious-her son Noah. Unfortunately, Zach's a deadbeat dad, leaving Ruger to be Noah's only male role model. When he discovers Sophie and his nephew living in near poverty, Ruger takes matters into his own hands-with the help of the Reapers Motorcycle Club-to give them a better life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living with outlaw bikers wasn't Sophie's plan for her son, but Ruger isn't giving her a choice. He'll be there for Noah, whether she wants him or not. But Sophie does want him, has always wanted him. Now she'll learn that taking a biker to bed can get a girl dirty in every way.</description>

  <description>A decade ago, she walked away from everyone and everything that had ever mattered to her.  Now, she has to face her past to find her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever Colleen Bradley Berkowitz had imagined her homecoming—which hadn't been often—she’d imagined sweeping into town on a wave of triumph. Never had she pictured herself limping in with empty dreams and emptier pockets, behind the wheel of a car that should have long since met its destiny in the crusher. Forced to depend on the goodwill of the sister who's a virtual stranger to her, Colleen has just two goals: to avoid all family entanglements, and to escape from Jackson Falls the minute she has enough money socked away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life is what happens while we're making other plans. Her sister is determined to rebuild their precarious relationship. Devastatingly attractive single dad Harley Atkins and his twelve-year-old daughter, Annabel, start worming their way into her heart. And when a surprise visitor shows up at her door, the stakes are raised, forcing Colleen to reevaluate all those bridges she burned years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;REDEMPTION ROAD is a heartwarming book about love, about sisterhood, and about second chances.</description>

  <description>Curt has been beaten, betrayed and brutalized by just about everyone he's known. And his mother - once a prostitute, now "born-again" and married - has banned him from the family. But six years in prison taught him a lot - including how to force straight cons to ejaculate as he rapes them, and how that can be a very satisfying method of revenge. Now he's out and trying to stay straight, but problems with his marriage and zero prospects of earning money enough to live on make that almost impossible. It's while he's hustling two gay men in a bar one afternoon that he mentions what he's done in prison...and the bet comes up. It seems the men, Wayne and Lenny, want a little revenge of their own against someone who's caused them trouble. If Curt can make this one "straight" guy "get off" while being assaulted, they'll give him a car, cash and a chance at a new life. Being in the mood to do some damage, Curt agrees and they start laying their plans. But step-by-step, Curt realizes things are getting out of control, and he has no one to pull him back from the abyss. And a stupid little bet is threatening to plunge him headlong into disaster.</description>

  <description>Port Fare, New York, has fallen into the clutches of true evil. The Dreser brothers have arrived with a scheme to increase drug sales in the area by whatever means possible. Seth Prescott is part of MET (Mobile Enforcement Teams) a branch of the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration). He's been assigned to work undercover at Port Fare High, and things aren't going very well, until senior Maggie Brown enters the equation. He's harbored a secret crush on her from day one, and now that she is in the center of the case, he's trying to stay clear and objective while walking the line between business and unrequited love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie is truly the poster child for Heroin Chic, complete with jutting bones and dark-ringed eyes, but is she an addict, or is there another reason for her appearance? She struggles with her feelings for Seth, fearing he is just another person who will eventually let her down, as everyone in her life has done thus far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie has spent her life caring for her alcoholic mother. A task that has left her heavily burdened and alone. Before long, her mother's health takes a turn for the worst, sending Maggie's life into a tale-spin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Seth works relentlessly to inject fear into the dealers and flush them out into the open, Maggie fights to stay alive as the hunt turns deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth and Maggie's romantic journey is one of humor, heartbreak, and self-discovery.</description>

  <description>A mother is murdered in an apparent robbery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young woman is raped and beaten in a home invasion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chicago Detective Alicia “Berg” Raymond doesn’t believe in random crime and is certain both cases are more than they seem—but can she trust her instincts, or is she too distracted by the feelings she has for former partner and new boss? For Berg, the need for justice burns deep and fills the emptiness where therapy and relationships fall short.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s certain the husband knows more than he’s willing to admit, but the trap to catch the killer is the loophole that sets him free.&lt;br&gt;The rapist is caught and sent to prison, but when Berg gets closer to the family devastated by his depravity, their behavior doesn’t add up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Berg fights to prevent another murder, she crosses the line between hero and villain—and there’s no turning back.</description>

  <description>"I'm not sure what you have been told about me, but I'm not nearly as bad as they make me out to be." His deliciously deep voice carried a little bit of ego. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm sure you are exactly as bad as they make you out to be…. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brad De Luca is used to getting whatever and whomever he wants. The premier divorce attorney in town, he's a playboy who's bedded half the city—including his own clients. And when the newest intern at his firm poses a challenge, his seductive prowess goes into overdrive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pre-law student Julia Campbell is fresh off a failed engagement and happy with her new independence. Even if she weren't warned away from Brad at every turn, she'd know he was bad news. The last thing she needs is a man who could destroy her job prospects, not to mention her innocence. But before she knows it, the incorrigible charmer has her under his spell. His deviant tastes plunge her deep into a forbidden world of sexual exploration…but her heart may not survive the fall.</description>

  <description>The List of Possibilities used to be the back-up list- that is until Calvin Hunt ‘borrowed’ it from Kinley Brooke’s wallet. He’s taken it upon himself to be her matchmaker now that her divorce is final. She has celebrity crushes like anyone else, and in his position as a rock star, he can make her dreams come true. When he sets her up with a handsome television star, Cal is ready to pat himself on the back. The trouble is she wants someone else, someone she can’t have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rory Hunt has been living in marital misery for years now. He’s separated but still legally wedded to Satan incarnate. In his grief, he’s accidentally bonded with and become best friends with another woman, Kinley Brooke. He didn't mean for it to happen, but he wants to be more than friends. This is so not like him; he’s never been unfaithful in any way. Kinley’s been hurt by her cheating ex-husband and is not about to enter into a relationship with a married man. He’s trying to push his divorce through, but it doesn't seem to be fast enough. She’s dating- a lot, even her ex. The only thing he can do is ‘act’ like her closest friend, when in reality she is the love of his life. Can he, as her friend, protect her from an unwanted stalker and a vicious scorned woman who will stop at nothing to destroy her?</description>

  <description>Six year old Jenny Barnes wakes up from night terrors only to find out that ghosts are real and there’s no such thing as safe. &lt;br&gt;She lives in a two hundred year old farmhouse with her large family, but they’re not alone. There’s a malevolent presence up in the attic and the forest surrounding the farm is alive with folks who just won’t stay dead. Worse is the fact that the cattle have developed a taste for murder and are killing everything in sight. Well…that and the fact that her own father is trying to kill her. &lt;br&gt;All Jenny wants is a childhood--a few moments playing in the sunny yard with her sisters. All she'll have to do to get one is survive. &lt;br&gt;And as Eddie, the one farmhand who’s on her side notes, “this old place is going over.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will anyone get out of there alive?</description>

  <description>IT HAPPENED IN VEGAS.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't be held responsible.  Things that happen there are supposed to stay there, right?  Right?  Yeeeah.  Not so much.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andie's just days away from tying the knot, but there's just ooooone little glitch.  Apparently, she's already married.  Or someone with her name is married to a guy out in Oregon of all places, and the courthouse won't issue her a marriage license until it's all cleared up.  Tripping her way through cow pies and country songs to meet up with a man who gets around places on horseback is her very last idea of how to have a good time, but if she's going to get married, make partner at the firm, and have two point five kids before she's thirty-five, she needs to get to the bottom of this snafu and fix it quick ... before her fiance finds out and everything she's been working toward goes up in flames.</description>

  <description>Alissa Benson used to have plans. Big ones. Important ones. But all those plans went down the drain on her twenty-first birthday, and now she's just trying to pick up the pieces and manage the fallout. Sure, there are people wanting to help. But they're pushy and suffocating and none of them can say more than ten words without cussing. And then of course there's Colin. As if life isn't complicated enough. He's the guy who couldn't stand to even look at her last week but now seems to keep popping up every time she turns around. She'd like to say she can't stand the sight of him, but that would be a lie. It doesn't matter, though. Life is too complicated for dreaming about guys like him. Alissa has a baby almost due, no job, no money, and there's nothing she hates more than being a burden. But when her past moves into her present, threatening to take away her very last shred of dignity, she's forced to reconsider everything she ever thought she knew about the world and herself.</description>

  <description>Will their past determine their future?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saint Ford has worked hard to achieve her childhood dream of becoming of nurse. Focused on her work and devoted to her patients, there’s no room for love. She doesn’t need a guy making waves in her calm, serene life—especially when he’s the unforgettable hottie who nearly destroyed her in high school. Dark, brooding Nash Donovan might not remember her or the terrible pain he caused. But he turned her world upside down . . . and now he’s trying to do it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saint has no idea that Nash isn’t the cocky player he once was. Uncovering a devastating family secret has rocked his world, and now he’s struggling to figure out his future. He can’t be distracted by the pretty nurse he seems to meet everywhere. Still, he can’t ignore the sparks that fly between them —or how she seems so desperate to get away from him. But the funny, sweet, and drop-dead gorgeous Saint is far too amazing to give up on—especially since she’s the only thing in his life that seems to make sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Nash discovers the truth about their past, he realizes he may have lost her heart before he could even fight for it. Now, Saint has to decide: is Nash worth risking herself for all over again?</description>

  <description>First Harvard, and now the national expansion of East Park Exposed. Evan Cosette will have to choose one or the other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not yet. E.P.E.’s new owner, A.J. Harrison, wants the fall launch issue shot in Boston. It will be Evan’s last go as Rylan Willow—sensual starlet of the underground magazine that made her famous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she’ll have to shoot without Dallas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finishing up his Master’s, Dallas needs to spend a semester in Costa Rica working on research. And that’s not the only thing separating him from Evan. With lingering thoughts about her relationship with Dallas being based on nothing more than lust and lies, Evan calls it quits with the gorgeous grad student from East Park University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The breakup doesn’t make the Boston shoot easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under A.J.’s reign, Britain’s artistic liberty is gone, and the issue becomes less of a clever erotic read and more of a Halloween-themed smutfest. Much like Evan’s modeling, Britain’s photos grow sloppy and uninspired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a reminder of the pleasures of sex and art is around the corner for both girls. Someone is leaving a trail of seductive clues for Britain on the set of the cover shoot--a historic manor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Dallas makes his return to steal Evan’s heart for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a familiar narrator from EXPOSURE and a fresh, new point-of-view character, this is the blazing-hot sequel you’ve been waiting for.</description>

  <description>Ryder Crawford is going places. His band ‘Morning Alliance,’ has just gotten signed, and are now touring with one of the most popular bands in the world. When he meets Lexi Raine, the timing couldn’t have been worse. But like they say, love finds you when you aren’t looking for it. The stunning blonde manages to turn his world upside down, through the fierce connection they share. When Ryder is given the choice between the past and present, he is forced to choose between his career, and a woman he has felt something for like no other. Will he make the right choice? Or spend the rest of his life living with regret? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lexi is all alone in the world, besides her best friend and partner in crime Tee. After traveling around the world, drifting from place to place, she tries to settle down in Perth, the place she grew up in. When she meets Ryder, he seems almost too good to be true. What happens when she finds out that when things seem too good to be true, they usually are?</description>

  <description>Nicole Parsons had the perfect life, made complete with the suburban home and the proverbial white picket fence. When tragedy struck and she lost the most important people in her life, she turned away from everything she loved before; shutting out every reminder of the perfect life she lost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been one year, three months, one week and six days since the accident; and Nicole is ready to stop counting the days she’s survived, and begin living again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a dare from her best friend, Nicole encounters Zack Walters - the popular alternative rock star and man who signifies so much of her past – and suddenly everything in Nicole’s safe and quiet life changes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she’s forced to face the pain she’s carried for so long, will she truly be able to heal from her past and begin to live again? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or will her new adventure ruin her completely?</description>

  <description>The only things Natalie Bouchard wants to change are the weekly specials in her Gram's diner. So when her high school sweetheart strolls back into Dearling, Texas, she allows herself to indulge in a little flirtation, but that's as far as it goes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Navy SEAL Sawyer Nolan has returned to sell his father's land and get the hell out, no matter how enticing he still finds Natalie. Until a storm rolls over the Texas hills, stranding them together at the farm…and the memories of their steamy past lead to a reunion filled with hot days and long nights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Natalie's so far under Sawyer's skin he can't imagine being without her. But he has a lot of history in Dearling he'd like to leave behind, and Natalie is practically married to this town. If Sawyer wants to be more than just another person who leaves Natalie, he'll have to give his hometown—and himself—one more chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;48,000 words</description>

  <description>At 25, Jax Wynter lost his life.&lt;br&gt;As the youngest member of America's number one rock band, Wynter's Vicious, Jax  lived a life with no rules or responsibilities.  At least until his older brother, founding member and vocalist, died in a fiery car crash.  Jobless, clueless and deemed unfit to handle his own affairs, Jax must sober up, man up and adjust to living as a 'normal person' in the 'real world'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 24, Lacey Emerson found hers.&lt;br&gt;Shuffled between her bi-polar mom and her former hippie grandmother, Lacey had no choice but to become responsible at a young age.  Her chaotic childhood, though, gave her the skills and determination to succeed when she inherited her grandmother's bakery.  Her life was finally normal, real but very, very boring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All it took was a five-point face plant to turn both their lives upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the author of Pole Dance, Human Hieroglyphix I &amp;amp; II and Tap Dance, comes the new novel, "Everybody Falls", Book One of Wynter's Vicious Series.  Set in the beautiful town of Auburn, California and filled with a cast of quirky characters, it’s a story about learning to live, learning to love and learning to hold on when your brand of 'normal' comes undone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes you have to fall from grace before you can fall in love.</description>

  <description>Izzy Castle's life is anything but exciting. Her only entertainment is working at an adult store, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. But when her roommate of only six months, Brock Larson, makes a move on her, Izzy decides that a little harmless sex with the cage fighter might be just what she needs to feel alive. But she has seen his other one-night stands do the walk of shame, and Izzy doesn't know if her heart can withstand that humiliation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brock fights for the underground circuit. He takes what he wants, when he wants it, and makes no apologies for it. He wants Izzy, but it isn't for just one night—what he's used to. Izzy's his, and he will get his knuckles bloody proving that he may be roughened, but when he wants something as badly as he wants her, he won't give up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be Warned: rimming, spanking, anal sex</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A cold case reopened. A murderer re-emerging more deadly than ever before…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Baltimore Homicide Detective Stevie Mazzetti has suffered losses no woman should have to endure. And, despite it all, she’s still a fighter. When she learns that her ex-partner might have miscarried justice, she’s determined to put the past to rights, even when she becomes a target.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; It’s former Marine Clay Maynard’s job to see the risk in every situation, but he doesn’t have to look hard to find the danger surrounding Stevie.

  <description>One text can change everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honor Calhoun never thought her life would ever be like the books she writes for a living. One morning while out for a run, she learns not all bad things are plots in novels. Some horrors can actually come true. She faces off with a persistent attacker, holds her own, but in the end is taken hostage and thrown into a hole. In the middle of the woods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Honor didn't go down there alone. She took her kidnapper's phone with her. With a spotty signal and a dying battery, her hope is slim. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Reed is an active duty Marine stationed at a small reserve base in Pennsylvania. All he wants is a calm and uneventful duty station where he can forget the memories of his time in a war-torn country. But a single text changes everything. Nathan becomes Honor's only hope for survival, and he has to go against the clock, push aside his past, and take on a mission for a girl he's never met. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of them want freedom... but they have to survive long enough to obtain it.</description>

  <description>The Surrender series has kept readers engaged since the first book hit the shelves. In this final installment to the series, you will finish the journey that Rafe and Ari started, as well as read the stories of Shane and Lia, and Rachel and Ian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love and desire run rampant throughout this series, but romance is about more than that. It’s about the small battles that lead to the greatest victories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Ari and Rafe’s love powerful enough to withstand challenges beyond their control? Will Lia and Shane learn to compromise instead of careening between extremes of passion and loathing? Can Rachel give up her dream of living an ordinary life and learn to love King Adriane?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the conclusions of these three strong women’s stories, and learn what choices they make. Is love enough to conquer when the odds are stacked against them?</description>

  <description>He Was Taught How To Kill&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even behind bars, serial killer Harvey Day Smith exudes menace. Psychologist Jolene Granger has agreed to hear his dying confession, vowing not to let the monster inside her head. And Harvey has secrets to share—about bodies that were never found, and about the apprentice who is continuing his grisly work…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Now He’ll Teach Them&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He buries his victims alive the way his mentor Harvey did, relishing their final screams as the earth rains down. And as one last gift to the only father he knew, he’ll make the most perfect kill of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How To Die&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything about this investigation is unnerving Jo, from Harvey’s fascination with her to the fact that she’s working alongside Texas Ranger Brody Winchester, her ex-husband. Harvey’s protégé is growing bolder and more vicious every day. And soon the trail of shallow graves will lead them to the last place Jo expected, and to the most terrifying truth of all…</description>

It's intended to be read by mature audiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part one of a two part series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three things Lily Evans immediately notices about her new neighbor, Jay Lincoln. The first is his monstrous size, the second is the malicious way he glares at her, and thirdly, but most importantly, the three scars that mark his right eye. She knows the smart thing to do is stay away, but she has never met or seen anyone like him. The more time she spends with this frightening yet captivating man, the harder it becomes. He can make her hairs stand on end but he also has a sweetness to him that tugs at her heart. Soon she finds herself merged into his world full of murder, revenge, and deceit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Romance</description>

  <description>19-year-old Emily desperately wants a name for what she is. For what is consuming and torturing her. For what is changing her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she’s not crazy like her mother. She’s not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emily may not be as crazy as she thinks, because her body is no longer her own. Something is stirring inside her. It is soft, seductive, and tells her what to do to survive. As Emily learns that her world has been infected by demons that consume human souls and fit seamlessly into the bodies they empty, she must also accept that she is one of them. Yet, she is different from the rest, because her darkness didn’t inhabit her, it was awakened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Emily must choose a side.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When life's always been a mess, can you still turn it into something beautiful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Riley’s close connection with his identical twin brother, Jaxon, is put to the test when he tries to choose between keeping his promises and following his heart. Is this girl that still haunts his dreams, even after four years, really worth it? Jace can’t help but wonder if he made a huge mistake all that time ago when he let her walk into someone else’s arms, especially since that someone was his twin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Audrey Mills often wonders at what point she should throw her hands up in defeat and allow all of the horrible circumstances of her life to overtake her. Despite the demons she has faced, however, something inside her won’t give in. When she leaves her small town in Texas to attend college in California, Audrey runs into the one guy who could make her or break her. But is the past they share too painful for them to overcome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second book in the broken series. While each book can stand on its own, it's recommended you read Beautiful Broken Rules before Beautiful Broken Mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult/Adult Contemporary Romance - recommended for ages 18 and up. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;For fans of &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Bared to You&lt;/em&gt; comes a wickedly erotic new novel of innocence, desire, and unbridled pleasure.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Delaine Talbot has a secret. When a matter of life and death threatens to tear apart her family, Delaine makes the ultimate sacrifice. She auctions herself off at Chicago’s most exclusive erotic club. Now she belongs to Noah Crawford, a wealthy mogul who introduces her to a seductive feast of the senses, awakening desires she only dreamed about.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Noah doesn’t know why Delaine sold her body for a cool two mil. But it’s the perfect business arrangement. The inexperienced beauty will learn to satisfy his every sensual need, yet never touch his heart. Almost immediately their relationship generates heat—in more ways than one. When they fight, they take no prisoners. When they love, they show no mercy. When they’re together, they never want to leave each other’s arms. But soon, their intense, physical bond will take an unexpected turn—evolving into something neither has bargained for: the promise of a lasting love.</description>

  <description>Ana Belle never wanted anything more than to hang up her apron, jump on her Vespa and ride off into the sunset, leaving Sugartown in the dust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elijah Cade never wanted anything more than a hot meal, a side of hot arse and a soft place to lay his head at night where he could forget about his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But you know what they say about wanting: you always want what you can’t have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen year-old virgin Ana is about to discover that’s not quite true because a six foot three, hotter than hell, tattooed, Aussie sex god just rode into town. He’s had a taste of her pie and he wants more– no really, Ana bakes pies for a living, get your mind out of the gutter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’d be willing to hand over everything tied up in a big red bow, there’s just one problem; Elijah has secrets dirtier than last week’s underwear. Secrets that won't just break Ana’s heart, but put her life at risk, too. When those secrets come to light, their relationship is pushed to breaking point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add to that a psychotic nympho best friend, an overbearing father, a cuter than humanly possible kid brother, a wanton womanizing cousin, the ex from hell, and more pies than you could poke a ... err ... stick ... at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you thought small towns were boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Sugartown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Content Warning. Intended for a mature 18+ audience. Contains explicit sex, oodles of profanity and a crap-tonne of AWKWARD.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A decade in the future, humanity thrives in the absence of sickness and disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We owe our good health to a humble parasite - a genetically engineered tapeworm developed by the pioneering SymboGen Corporation. When implanted, the tapeworm protects us from illness, boosts our immune system - even secretes designer drugs. It's been successful beyond the scientists' wildest dreams. Now, years on, almost every human being has a SymboGen tapeworm living within them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these parasites are getting restless. They want their own lives...and will do anything to get them.</description>

  <description>It’s the summer of 1974 and 21-year old Dawn Emerson has only three things she wants to do: compete one last time in the Ellensburg Rodeo, win back her ex-boyfriend Ryan, and become the best damn music journalist at Central Washington University. But all her plans are left in the dust when she’s contacted by Creem magazine to go on the road with one of her favorite groups, the up-and-coming metal band, Hybrid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first the assignment reads like a dream come true. Not only will Dawn land some much-needed credibility as a female music journalist, but she’ll finally get to experience life from the other side of the stage, and maybe crack the drunken, enigmatic code that is guitarist Sage Knightly. Instead, Dawn finds herself on an aging tour bus filled with ego-maniacs, band politics and a whole lot of sex, drugs and rock n’ roll. When monsters start showing up in dressing rooms and some of Sage’s groupies become increasingly strange and dangerous, Dawn discovers the band is not only going places – they’re going straight to Hell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Dawn has a backstage pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Devil's Metal is the first book in a two-part New Adult Horror/Paranormal Romance and very (very!) loosely based on the author's exploits as a music journalist. Hell comes in different forms.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover for ASIN B00DE5EBZ8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’s addicted to sex. He’s addicted to booze…the only way out is rock bottom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one would suspect shy Lily Calloway’s biggest secret. While everyone is dancing at college bars, Lily stays in the bathroom. To get laid. Her compulsion leads her to one-night stands, steamy hookups and events she shamefully regrets. The only person who knows her secret happens to have one of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loren Hale’s best friend is his bottle of bourbon. Lily comes at a close second. For three years, they’ve pretended to be in a real relationship, hiding their addictions from their families. They’ve mastered the art of concealing flasks and random guys that filter in and out of their apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as they sink beneath the weight of their addictions, they cling harder to their destructive relationship and wonder if a life together, for real, is better than a lie. Strangers and family begin to infiltrate their guarded lives, and with new challenges, they realize they may not just be addicted to alcohol and sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their real vice may be each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Adult Romance recommended for readers 18+ for mature content&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Human Remains&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply disturbing and powerful psychological thriller that will have you checking the locks on your doors and windows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Annabel, a police analyst, discovers her neighbour’s decomposing body in the house next door, she’s appalled to think that no one, including herself, noticed that anything was wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back at work, she feels compelled to investigate, despite her colleagues' lack of interest, and finds data showing that such cases are common – too common – in her home town. As she’s drawn deeper into the mystery and becomes convinced she’s on the trail of a killer, she also must face her own demons and her own mortality. Would anyone notice if she just disappeared?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; This is the story before everything.. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth knows what’s expected of her, perfection. She’s the daughter of an Earl and expected to marry well, say and do the right things with a smile on her face when inside she’s dying for a chance to escape. Thanks to an inheritance her godmother left her years ago, her chance will come with her next birthday. Her hopes of escape abruptly end when Robert, her childhood nemesis that she hasn’t seen in over fourteen years, comes back into her life and does everything he can to drive her out of her mind even as he steals her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; He hated her. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least, he tried to hate her, but it was so damn difficult to hate someone that he couldn’t live without. He tried to ignore her, tried to focus on anything but her, but nothing worked. Somehow she made her way into his heart and started to make him want things that he never though possible, made him smile and laugh even while she drove him out of his mind and started a legacy by turning him into…..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Bradford.</description>

  <description>Kerri is dead-set on setting her best friend up. But Sasha is not interested, especially when she finds out the guy in question is a lead singer in a band. She has one rule for her dating life and that is no musicians. She knows relationships with them can only end badly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse is persistent in getting Sasha’s attention, always being charming, genuine and there for her to lean on – emotionally and physically after she breaks her foot. Sasha isn’t sure she can continue to deflect his advances, and isn’t sure she wants to.</description>

  <description>A young girl, born during the coldest winter people could remember in a remote German village shortly after WWII, tells the story of her childhood. Growing up under the care of her grandmother, she soon learns that by the end of war, bombs had destroyed countries and people but that it would take much longer to destroy a system of deceit. Like Lemmings, her people had followed false prophets to the edge of the abyss. While she struggles to come to terms with hatred and violence surrounding her, she develops a close and passionate love for her grandmother, an extraordinary and proud woman. At the end, it is her grandmother who nurtures her wounded soul and broken heart by showing and teaching her the ways of ancient heathen wisdom of her people. It is a journey of a young girl's soul-searching for love and understanding to survive a time of violence, hatred, and prejudice to learn that even wars cannot change the eternal rules of crime and retribution.</description>

  <description>A man with no name. &lt;br&gt;Mysterious. &lt;br&gt;Dangerous. &lt;br&gt;Brooding. &lt;br&gt;Sexy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a week he frequents the bar where Mackenzie works. He orders the same drink, scotch on the rocks, and he sits back on the same lounge chair, quietly watching… waiting… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has money - that much is obvious. He wears his tailored suits well. He smells divine, of expensive cologne, and orders his scotch from the top shelf. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He drinks alone, but he never leaves that way. With a snap of his fingers, a flick of his eyes, a glimmer of a smile, he gets the attention of the most attractive women in the bar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time his focus is on Mackenzie. Instead of feeling nervous Mackenzie is enthralled, intrigued… and aroused.</description>

  <description>Bereaved bride Abby Clark is tortured by visions of the fatal crash that took her fiancé on their wedding day.  She succumbs to a dark existence where loneliness, sadness and nightmares dwell; until handsome, brooding Bryce Holden walks through the door of her favorite coffee shop, wearing the same cloak of despair and grief.  Abby discovers in Bryce someone who understands love and loss, and soon their close friendship grows into a deep love.  But ghosts make strange bedfellows, and Abby is forced to battle the tormenting images that continue to haunt her, and confront the ethereal presence of a beloved wife to protect her future with Bryce.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Who is Sebastian Lock?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bar Sophia Pearce is in doesn’t look like much. The wine is bad and the decor worse. But when a sudden attack of curiosity leads her to sneak past security and into the back room, she discovers something unimaginable. The most lavish party she’s ever laid eyes on, in the most unlikely of places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that’s nothing compared to what comes next, to the man she meets back there. Sebastian Lock. Gorgeous, commanding, and radiating charm, he is exactly the sort of silver-tongued rake Sophia has sworn to avoid. Unfortunately, he doesn’t care much for her promises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every instinct tells her to run, but the chemistry between them is as inescapable as gravity. Soon, he’s opening her eyes to a whole new world of pleasures, pleasures she never thought she’d enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s just one problem. Sebastian is more than he seems. Between the famous company he keeps and the almost paranoid secrecy of his employers, he’s a puzzle Sophia can’t quite solve, and his insistence on keeping things casual forces her to confront the demons of her past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she learn to trust again? Or will Sebastian’s privacy tear them apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains light BDSM, including spanking, restraint, and anal play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: This book is the first part of a trilogy that is designed to be read together, much like The Blackstone Affair. Sebastian and Sophia will get their happily ever after, but not until the last book.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

Alison Tyler will push your boundaries to their limits—and have you begging for more.</description>

  <description>For Annie Phillips, there is a right way to do things and everything has a place. College and her flawless GPA are top priority, as is planning her perfect future. Anything less than perfection is unacceptable. So when she meets Loden Guiles, she believes she has finally found her perfect happily-ever-after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase Malloy is funny, loyal, and an all around nice guy. He’s also sloppy, tattooed, and undirected. All Chase wants to do is survive college, hang out with friends, and make music. Knowing his best friend’s step-sister since they were fourteen, Annie and he have always had a love-hate relationship.  The last thing Chase expects is to fall for Annie, but he knows he’ll never live up to her idea of the perfect man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the outside, Annie and Loden’s relationship appears picture perfect. But behind closed doors, Annie quickly realizes Loden isn’t the man he pretends to be.  Every time her not so well laid plans crumble, and Loden proves to be not so Mr. Right, Chase is there to pick her up and brush her off.  Will she realize the perfection she’s been searching for has been in front of her all this time?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Long After is a companion novel to Sometimes Never and Before Now. Many of the same characters appear in Chase and Annie's story. However, it can be read as a stand-alone book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This is a new adult novel. Due to harsh language, sexual situations, and violence, this book is recommended for 17+.</description>

  <description>Jane Black has written the breakup album of the century, earning her a Grammy, a huge legion of new fans, and the pressure to repeat her success. Sure, the heartbreak from her husband’s unconventional abandonment might have been her inspiration, but it hasn’t done her any favors in the dating department. So when Matthew Harrigan, the toughest music journalist out there, asks for an interview, Jane agrees—as long as her personal life is completely off-limits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;British, gorgeous, and way too tempting, Matthew’s the first guy Jane’s been attracted to since her husband. As she spends more time with him and their relationship heats up, though, so does her writer’s block. How can the queen of the break up pen the perfect follow-up when she’s seriously in love?</description>

  <description>Up and coming football hero, Colton Michaels, makes a Hail Mary pass one night in the college locker room that results in the hottest, sexiest five days of his young life. However, interference after the play has him hiding his past and burying his future in the bottom of a bottle. While Colt seems to have it all, looks can be deceiving, especially when you’re trapped so far in a closet that you can’t see your way out. When ten years of living his expected fast-lane lifestyle lands him engaged to his manipulative Russian supermodel girlfriend, he decides it’s time to call a new play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Montgomery single-handily built the largest all-star cheerleading gym in the world, driven by a need to forget a life-altering encounter with a handsome quarterback a decade ago. His reputation as an excellent coach, hard-nosed business man, and savvy entrepreneur earned him respect in the sometimes catty world of competitive cheerleading. When Jace learns of his ex-lover’s plans to marry, his heart executes a barrel roll and his carefully-placed resolve tumbles down without a mat to absorb the shock. Can his island escape help him to finally let go of the past and move his life forward?</description>

  <description>From the NYT &amp;amp; USA Today Bestselling romance author, a sizzling and addictive story of a woman with a broken past and the man who can’t fight his attraction to her…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-three year old rising theater star Jill McCormick has built a life out of pretending. Pretending she’s happy, pretending she’s not haunted by the dark secret that shattered her world six years ago. But then she comes face to face with her new director – sexy, sophisticated, possessive, all-alpha Davis Milo. He tries to resist the actress he’s cast, but the attraction between them is too powerful, and soon their private rehearsals spiral into new, forbidden territory. The passionate connection, the intense chemistry is undeniable, and it hits them anywhere, and everywhere – in the theater, on the piano, in the limo, in the restaurant…But the tragedy in Jill’s past stands between them. Davis has walls too, so they can either face their fears together, or risk the deepest love and greatest passion either has ever felt…</description>

  <description>He is seeking absolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flynn Caldwell has a hero complex and it’s one of the reasons he joined the New York City Fire Department. He has spent his entire professional career trying to atone for that one person he failed to save. Because, if he can do that, then perhaps he can be worthy of love again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is seeking escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowan Page’s life is nothing short of a disaster. Always immersed in trouble, she has only herself to depend on. She’s determined to pull herself out of this mess and make something of her life, despite the hard years she has lived on the streets of New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, they have the chance to become complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flynn and Rowan’s worlds exist miles apart, but when a chance meeting brings them together, neither of them can deny the instant pull that connects them to each other. What starts as a tiny spark eventually flares into a fire so hot, it refuses to be extinguished. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For it to work, both of them will need to jump feet first into the flames to see where it takes them, despite the risk of being burned.</description>

  <description>(This book includes mature content, including sex and language)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22-year-old Camryn Jacobs lost the love of her life once and vows to never kiss another guy unless she's in love with him. When she meets Teague, their attraction to one another is off the charts, and for the first time in two years, she wants to disregard her rule. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Camryn makes a bet that he can't go just one week without kissing her. She's protecting her own fragile heart, but her wit and smart mouth end up driving Teague crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Teague is equally skilled at her challenge, their friendship turns complicated. He's not at all what she assumed, and he makes her feel things she never expected to feel. But sharing her true reasons for the no-kiss bet hurts too much and she keeps him in the dark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teague has his own secrets to hide, starting with his last name. It's the reason he left town--to lick his wounds until he can piece his life back together. His time with Camryn proves that it might actually be possible, but with the threat of his family and his past ruining all that he's finally gained, can he really take that risk again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loving might be easy; learning to trust again could be too difficult to achieve...</description>

  <description>Singapore has stolen a piece of Ava Thompson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It took one life shattering moment, for her to realize, her EX is not the man she believed him to be. Returning home to Los Angeles was never going to be easy for Ava. Her heart has been shattered to smithereens and she’s convinced it’ll never heal. Or, so she thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Jasper White.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unbeknown to Ava, Jasper White will change her life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attraction is instantaneous which troubles Ava, who has sworn off men indefinitely. But, she is finding resisting Jasper, with his tousled bedroom hair and piercing cerulean eyes, harder than she ever imagined. And that’s because Jasper knows what he wants, and he wants Ava.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, can Ava surrender to her feelings for the one man who compels her to love again? Because, what happens if love does not triumph all? What happens if love isn’t enough?</description>

  <description>(This book contains mature content, including sex and language. For ages 18+)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire fourth floor of Donovan Kemp's apartment complex houses only MMA fighters, dubbing it "The Fighter's Block." Growing up in an abusive home put Van on the fast track to nowhere, but a caring fight club owner took him under his wing as a teen and shaped him into a fighter with integrity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now in his mid-twenties, his life changes dramatically when he steps in to help a beautiful girl in a scary situation with her boyfriend. Surprising to Van, she ends up going home with him. He's now on the fast track to something else: falling in love. He feels that Danielle is the type of girl men only dream about, but the two quickly fall hard for each other in equal measure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the ex boyfriend proves to be nothing but trouble, Van has a tough time deciding between protecting Dani with legal measures or just bashing the guy's face in himself. The harassment escalates, eventually pulling Dani and Van apart, and Van finds himself feeling desperate enough to do something drastic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If being thrown in jail isn't bad enough for Van, an undercover investigator seems to be getting a little too close to Dani, the fight club he grew up in could be turned upside down with scandal, and the friends that he trusts with his life might not be who they say they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So much for finally discovering the little morsel of happiness he'd been deprived of his entire life...</description>

  <description>When Cade Winslow and Merrick Sullivan find Elle hiding in the cabinet of a gun store, they know they can’t just walk away from the fragile woman with no memory of who she is or who tried to kill her. Merrick is training for the title shot in the heavyweight division as a mixed martial artist and can’t afford distractions, but neither can he turn his back on the woman who tugs at his heartstrings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elle feels safe with her two protectors, and the longer she spends with them, the more she realizes that she has no desire to remember her past. Not when it could compromise her future with Cade and Merrick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cade has his own set of concerns when it comes to Elle, and it quickly becomes clear to the two men that for the first time in their friendship, a woman is coming between them. But what if they just kept her there? Between them. Where she belongs.</description>

  <description>'Logan and Lauren' is a stand alone story with NO cliffhangers or anything like that , but it is SHORT!!! It's the perfect length for a quick read before bedtime or for waiting for a doctor's appointment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Logan Crenshaw comes home from work one day and finds out that his wife is keeping a secret from him, he goes a bit crazy. So he steals her off to the Caribbean where he finally figures out what's been troubling her. But unfortunately, not before he loses his cool and goes completely territorial.&lt;br&gt;Excerpt:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan tightened his hands in Lauren's hair and her eyes flew open. He could see it clearly, her arousal, the drugged look that had always fascinated him so much. He encircled her wrist in his hand, and locked it behind her back in a swift move that imprisoned her. "You like that, baby?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Yes." Her eyelids fluttered; he knew that she was barely able to hold them open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He rewarded her answer, stroking into her, in and out, and in again. He stayed there, deep within her, and when her eyes closed completely, he dropped his lips to her ear and sank his teeth around her lobe. "You're mine," he said in an uncontrollable hiss. "That hasn't changed." He took another slamming stroke and then stilled again inside of her. "That will never change." He bit down on her flesh. "You understand me? Never."</description>

  <description>A second chance at first love...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years ago, Kat Harper fell into a dizzying summer romance with her brother's best friend Bryan. It was a mad, crazy love full of kisses all through the night -- but he broke her heart and she had to move on. Five years later, Kat is finishing her graduate degree and building her business as a jewelry designer, when Bryan, head of his own successful company, walks back into her life. Bryan has been assigned to Kat as her new business mentor and the rules are clear. No hanky panky permitted. Kat can handle that because she's totally over him... right? Except, he still makes her laugh, and he remembers all the things she likes. Not to mention that he's even more handsome now than he was then. Then there's the spark between them -- the simply undeniable chemistry, and the tender ways he shows he still cares for her. Can they resist each other the second time around or will first love trump all?</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Kat Harper has always dreamed of silver-screen kisses, the kind of love you see in the movies. &lt;br&gt;That’s exactly what she gets the summer before college when she meets her brother’s best friend Bryan. &lt;br&gt;He’s five years older, but that doesn’t stop them from falling into a summer romance so perfect it could have been scripted by Hollywood. They kiss in the back row of the movie theater, on the beach at night, even on the quiet streets of her hometown when no one’s looking. &lt;br&gt;Surely, he’s falling as hard for her as she is for him, right? But Bryan breaks her heart and leaves with barely an explanation, forcing Kat to move on from her first love... until five years later, when he walks back into her life. Now she has to face the truth that she's never gotten over him. Is it possible he hasn’t stopped thinking about her too?</description>

Struggling with the loss of her missing friend, Shepard will find a way in and reawaken desires that she thought were forever lost. But Violet never forgets that if you are not careful, distractions will be your undoing.</description>

  <description>Growing up on the outskirts of Las Vegas as the daughter of notorious strip club owner, Stephen Knox, and a mother who abandoned her at birth, life was less than kind to a young Antoinette.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a failed teenage suicide attempt, Toni hit the road in search of a life free of undeserved cruelty and any resemblance to her past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years later, Toni is lost in a dead end marriage and makes a painful confession that sends her back to the one place she always wanted to escape. But can she really right the wrongs that haunt her? Toni soon finds that the only place where things stay the same is in your mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her path crosses with David Stark, childhood playmate turned one night stand, she cannot deny the spike in temperature she feels every time he's near or the scorching dreams that flood her at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digging through the years of heartache, Toni soon finds herself torn between the man she is committed to and the one who has always held her heart. As each layer unfolds before her, she discovers the root cause of her pain. Always believing the source was external, nothing could prepare her for the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book contains sexual content and adult language. Intended for readers 17+.</description>

  <description>After years of bad relationships and a cheating ex-fiancé, twenty-eight-year-old Mia Martinelli prefers healing her patients’ hearts on the Cardiac Care floor rather than risking having her heart broken again. But that all comes to a screeching halt when caring for the head roadie for Runaway Train puts her into the orbit of drummer and Latin Lover, AJ Resendiz. After a scorching weekend of steamy passion, Mia’s intention of getting out with her heart unscathed is challenged by the stud with the wicked sense of humor, especially when he wants to continue seeing her. But when the harsh reality of AJ’s hoard of female admirers sends her insecurities into overdrive, Mia bails, leaving him handcuffed to his bathroom shower. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AJ never imagined that after two weeks of the best sex and female companionship he’d ever experienced, he would need rescued by his band mates from his shower prison. Although he tries to forget the sensual brunette whose curves made his mouth water, AJ can’t get her out of his mind…or his heart. Months later when he finally seeks Mia for answers as to why she left, nothing could prepare him for their life-altering reunion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can AJ prove to Mia that regardless of the women after his body, his heart belongs only to her?</description>

  <description>Jamison Matthews has lusted after Ryder Montgomery since she was a preteen. But now that Ryder and her brother's band, Shaken Dirty, has made it huge, she's just one of many pining for the brooding lead singer. Too bad Ryder still sees her as a little sister. Not that it matters. Her brother would never allow it, and the last thing Jamison wants is to be another notch on a rock star's bed post. Even if it's Ryder's.&lt;br&gt;Ryder doesn't deserve happiness. After his fame destroyed his last girlfriend, he swore he'd never fall in love again. So when Jamison, the girl he's been in danger of loving for years, joins the band on the road, he'll do anything to deny the sparks between them--even after one hot night together. But Jamison is determined to show Ryder that he's worthy of love--her love--and that she's all grown up and ready to play.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Inspired by true events...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first day of college gives every girl a chance to reinvent herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I go and screw mine up by meeting the most gorgeous guy I've seen in five years while talking to my cat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Andrew Crowner is far from judgmental.  By the end of our interaction, he has me smitten by his easy manner and kind smile.  And from the way his eyes linger on me before he leaves, I start to think that maybe I’ve caught his attention, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I let myself believe that luck may finally be on my side.  That is, until I stumble on my roommate, and her overnight guest:  Spencer Ashford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lean, tattooed, and sexy as sin, Spencer is exactly the type I need to avoid.  I would have no trouble with that... were it not for his swift and inexplicable interest in me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, I go from a girl with next-to-no experience with boys to one caught in the crosshairs of two completely different men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrew's interest is wholesome and sweet. Spencer's is edgy and raw. My choice should be easy. But there are always complications, and sometimes, matters of the heart take the least expected turns.</description>

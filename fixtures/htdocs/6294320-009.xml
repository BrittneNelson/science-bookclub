  <description>&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Adult Contemporary Romance&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s his boss. He doesn’t care. This office isn’t big enough for the two of them…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rory Clarke ends up hiring the guy she spent one steamy night with to be her administrative assistant, she's determined to keep things professional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucas Blaine has other plans for her. He wants Rory, and it’s hard to resist his stunning blue eyes, chin dimple and the way he fills out a suit. Everywhere she looks, there he is, giving her a panty-melting smile and pulling her away for the most amazing (and satisfying) sex she’s ever had in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts off as one sexual encounter turns into multiple trysts in and out of the office and the lines she’d tried to draw so carefully are blurring. But the closer they get, the more Rory realizes that there are things about Lucas she doesn’t know, things he’s hiding from her. She’ll have to decide if she can surrender to her feelings or get out while she still can.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Two plus one equals scorching hot fun.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dumped by his boyfriend and reduced to living in a grotty bedsit, Josh Carpenter has gotten used to expecting the worst. Now he lives only for his job as a glassblower…and occasional glimpses of his sexy downstairs neighbors, Rai Nakamura and Evan Truman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every time he overhears the diminutive academic and the hunky plumber having loud and obviously kinky sex, Josh is overwhelmed with lust…and a longing for a fraction of what they have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To his amazement, Rai and Evan find his embarrassing tendency to blush utterly charming, and the three men grow closer over the course of the long, hot summer. Despite Rai’s charming flirtation and Evan’s smoldering gaze, Josh is determined never to break his new friends’ loving bonds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the night a naked Josh falls—quite literally—into the middle of one of Rai and Evan’s marathon sex sessions, the force of their mutual attraction takes control. But just as Josh dares to hope, he senses a change. Leaving him to wonder if the winds of love are about to blow his way at last…or if history is about to repeat itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Contains one well-endowed stud with a sexy accent, one improbably toppy bottom boy with an unfortunate owl obsession, and one blushing naïf who can’t believe his luck. Also, the occasional indulgence in mathematical spanking and some shameless armpit sex.</description>

  <description>When Dr. Alyssa Foster is taken hostage by a prison inmate, she knows she's in deep trouble. Not just because Teague Creek is desperate for freedom, but because the moment his fingers brush against her skin, Alyssa feels a razor-sharp pang of need...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man with a life sentence has nothing to lose. At least Teague doesn't, until his escape plan develops a fatal flaw: Alyssa.  On the run from both the law and deadly undercover operatives, he can only give her lies, but every heated kiss tells him the fire between them could be just as devastating as the flames that changed him forever...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;When his past destroys Eva's trust in her Master, can he win her back?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their turbulent, complex relationship deepens, Nathan Darke is increasingly aware that Eva Byrne has become much more to him than his submissive. She's in his home, in his family. And in his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva hasn't found it easy to trust, to believe in herself and in a relationship that can last. But happiness, once so elusive, is within her grasp. Nathan is her Master, her lover and her soulmate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, no sooner do they manage to find a fragile balance between them-a way of entwining both their worlds-and start to build a future, than their past comes crashing back to destroy their emerging love. Jealousy and hate brutally shatter Eva's and Nathan's delicate trust in each other, and their life together crumbles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they overcome the crushing pain of betrayal and deceit to regain some sort of future together, or are some wounds just too deep to heal? Are some risks too great? Some rewards just not enough?</description>

  <description>Book Two in the The Dark Side series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can she outrun the secrets of her past, or is surrender her only choice?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Byrne’s first encounter with the darker side of Nathan Darke’s sensuality ends in disaster. Frightened, hurt, betrayed, she struggles to regather her shattered confidence—in him, and in herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desperate to continue her journey of exploration and self-discovery, Eva has to convince a sceptical Nathan that she’s worth the trouble. And that she can learn to submit to him. When she is forced to reveal elements of her past she has preferred to keep hidden, both her brilliance and her vulnerability are laid bare. Will Nathan accept Eva as she is, and help her to become the woman she longs to be, or will she face yet another rejection?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terrified and intrigued in equal measure, Nathan has no idea how to deal with the exquisitely enigmatic Eva Byrne. Should he cut his losses and run, or allow their relationship to continue, and watch as Eva’s delicate beauty unfurls in his hands?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fascinated and ensnared by Nathan, Eva longs to taste what he offers and her erotic journey continues. But how much will she have to surrender to him in order to liberate her own desires?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains scenes of dominance and submission, including sex toys, pain play, anal play, nipple clamps, erotic waxing, restraints and caning. It is best read in sequence as part of a series.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Book One in the The Dark Side series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who knows where pain ends and pleasure begins?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chance of a new life out in the wilds of the Yorkshire moors sounds too good to be true to shy musician Eva Byrne. Stifled and smothered within the cocoon of her brilliant academic career, Eva yearns for something different. Something real and exciting. Something she can feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excitement. Passion. Pleasure. She finds that sexy, enigmatic Nathan Darke can provide all these and more when she moves into his home as violin tutor to his young daughter. But Eva’s sensual encounters with her demanding, domineering new employer quickly evoke her deepest fears, as he introduces her to the trauma of submission and marks her with his particularly dark brand of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But will Eva’s natural curiosity and thirst for new experiences be enough to withstand the sting of Nathan Darke’s exquisite touch? Will simple surrender be enough as he challenges her every inhibition, taking her on an erotic journey of self-discovery and liberation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reader Advisory: This book contains scenes of dominance and submission, including sex toys, pain play, anal play, nipple clamps, erotic waxing, paddling, restraints and caning. It also involves one scene where miscommunication leads to unintentional loss of consciousness. The book is best read in sequence as part of a serial story, and ends on a cliffhanger that some readers might find upsetting.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

On the anniversary of his death, her brother's best friend shows up unexpectedly - a man she hasn't seen since the funeral. He is no longer the boy Lexi once knew, but a dangerous-looking man with tattoos and dark secrets. He broke her trust and abandoned her family, yet what he reveals makes it impossible to stay angry. Lexi has been secretly infatuated with Austin since childhood, so finding out he's a Shifter just makes him sexier. Dammit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Austin Cole has returned to the city where he grew up, and just in time. He's lived a hard life these past seven years, and the shadows of his past are threatening to destroy Lexi's family. It's time that she learned the truth about her brother, but there is a shocking twist that Austin never saw coming. Now he must protect her family when her mother and sister wind up in mortal danger. Will Lexi learn to accept the truth about who he is, and can Austin salvage a relationship from the ruins of their past?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seven Years is not Shifter erotica, but puts a new spin on Shifter romance that's about family, second chances, and finding that person who completes you.&lt;br&gt;Cliffhanger-free&lt;br&gt;Mature content 17+&lt;br&gt;HEA&lt;br&gt;Part 1 of a series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What if Shifters really do exist, living in secret among humans?&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SIX MONTHS (BOOK 2) DUE MARCH 25, 2014</description>

  <description>In 1956, when divorced, working-mom Ava Lark rents a house with her twelve-year-old son, Lewis, in a Boston suburb, the neighborhood is less than welcoming. Lewis yearns for his absent father, befriending the only other fatherless kids: Jimmy and Rose. One afternoon, Jimmy goes missing. The neighborhood in the era of the Cold War, bomb scares, and paranoia seizes the opportunity to further ostracize Ava and her son. Lewis never recovers from the disappearance of his childhood friend. By the time he reaches his twenties, he's living a directionless life, a failure in love, estranged from his mother. Rose is now a schoolteacher in another city, watching over children as she was never able to watch over her own brother. Ava is building a new life for herself in a new decade. When the mystery of Jimmy's disappearance is unexpectedly solved, all three must try to reclaim what they have lost.</description>

  <description>Two women running away from their marriages collide on a foggy highway, killing one of them. The survivor is left to pick up the pieces, not only of her own life, but also must go back and deal with the devastated husband and fragile, asthmatic son the other woman left behind. Together, they try to solve the mystery of where April was running to, and why. By turns riveting and unsettling, &lt;em&gt;Pictures of You &lt;/em&gt;looks at the choices women make-the roads they choose-to be loved.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of the Ella and Micha series comes a gripping story of passion, pain, and the courage to love . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE TEMPTATION OF LILA AND ETHAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the surface, Lila Summers is flawless: good looks, expensive clothes, and a big, beautiful smile. But a dark past and even darker secrets are threatening to bubble over her perfect façade. She'll do anything to keep the emptiness inside hidden-which leads her into situations that always end badly. Whenever she hits bottom, there's only one person who's there to pull her out: Ethan Gregory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethan set the rules a long time ago: he and Lila are just &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt;. He doesn't do relationships. Although his tattooed, bad boy exterior is a far cry from Lila's pretty princess image, Ethan can't deny they have a deeper connection than he's used to. If he's not careful, he could be in serious danger of becoming attached-and he's learned the hard way that attachment only leads to heartbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lila falls farther than she ever has before, can Ethan continue to help as a friend? Or is he also getting close to falling . . . for her?</description>

  <description>Ex-Navy SEAL Stone Pressfield has a bad feeling about the proposed church missions trip to Manila, Philippines. The college-age church group plans to go to Manila and help victims of the sex-trafficking industry. Stone's lingering nightmare memories about the sex-trafficking industry have him warning church leaders that the trip is a bad idea. He knows all too well that it could end in violence, and those involved aren't to be trifled with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful Wren Morgan goes missing, he has a sick feeling that he knows exactly who took her, and for what purpose. The problem is, Wren isn't just any other student. She's someone he's close to, someone he cares about. Now she's in the hands of cruel, evil men, and Stone is the only one who can rescue her before the unthinkable happens.</description>

  <description>For Luisa Chavez, a twenty-three year old former beauty queen, a better life has always been just out of her reach. Sure, she’s had men at her feet since she was a young teenager but she’s never had the one thing she’s craved – security. Having grown up in near poverty, her waitressing job in Cabo San Lucas can barely let her take care of herself, let alone her ailing parents. Every day is another unwanted advance, every day is a struggle to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Salvador Reyes, the depraved leader of a major Mexican cartel, takes an interest in her, Luisa is presented with an opportunity she can’t afford to pass up. She’ll become Salvador’s wife and exchange her freedom and body for a life of riches – riches she can bestow upon her deserving parents. But Luisa quickly finds out that even the finest wines and jewels can’t undo the ugliness in her marriage, nor the never-ending violence that threatens her every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Luisa is looking for an escape, a way out of the carefully controlled life she’s leading. She finally gets her wish in the worst way possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it is, being the wife of Salvador makes her an ideal target for rival cartels and there’s one particular man who needs Luisa as part of his cartel’s expansion. One particular man whose quest for power has destroyed lives, slit throats and gotten him out of an American prison. One particular man who will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That man is Javier Bernal. And he wants Luisa. He wants to take her, keep her, ruin her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless she ruins him first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***WARNING*** This book deals with drug cartels and as such it contains a lot of sex and violence and some violent sex. It can get pretty ugly, pretty dark and pretty crazy. There is drug use, abuse, a bit of torture and dubious consent. The hero is not a hero and the villains...well, they're even worse. If this sort of thing bothers you, please do not read. This ain't no cupcake farting unicorn kind of book***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***While this is a spin-off of The Artists Trilogy, prior knowledge of the books is not needed. DIRTY ANGELS is the first in a trilogy, however each book can standalone and follows or introduces different characters***</description>

  <description>The Naked Way is the debut novel from author Chris Henry, available now from Blues Power Books and Amazon Kindle Direct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Naked Way is a dark, visionary story of love and loss in a Generation X world of sex, drugs and rock and roll.  It follows a group of bright, talented, damaged young people from different backgrounds as they come of age in the underground rock music scene of the early 1990s.  The Naked Way breathes new life into classic themes of youth rebellion and counter-culture for the next generation of readers. The story is driven by a cast of unforgettably vivid characters with big dreams. The Naked Way is full of sex and passion, but also deals with other intense issues: addiction, abusive relationships, rape, repressed memories, war, protest and suicide.   From the backstreet underworld of a decaying American city to the mystical cathedrals of Italy, The Naked Way takes readers on an exhilarating journey of sensuality and emotion, creation and destruction, pain and redemption.</description>

  <description>Rayna Brimm, hailing from an inner-city in New Jersey, survives a series of betrayal and loss only to forge forward in self-preservation and obtain an education in North Carolina. After receiving her degree, vowing never return home, she finds herself in California where she tries to build a self-contained life. She made a personal declaration to get through life without further dependence on others in order to avoid yet another heartbreak. Only, fate said otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Azmir Jacobs, a tall, dark, handsome and very wealthy man, who has street credibility and executive power in the corporate world. Azmir has money, power and beautiful women at his beckon call, BUT only one woman has caught his eye. The resilient Rayna Brimm, a woman whose dysfunctional upbringing contributes towards her tough skin, issues with trust and a deep-seated fear to love, turns out to be more than he bargained for when he discovered her in his boardroom presenting a leasing proposal.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rayna isn’t the only one with a checkered past. Can Azmir conceal his convoluted life long enough to prove that he can provide Rayna the stable and reliable love that she clearly needs and deserves? Or will his lofty lifestyle and endless resources scare her away?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when you thought you’d begun the read of an urban novel, you turn the pages and find this is by no means an urban novel, but the journey of a classic love tale and a story of redemption instead. The Love’s Improbable Possibility series is a slow weaving journey of love. Be prepared to progress into the world of Rayna Brimm. A story of love’s redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s all about growth in the first book of this wonderful series. Love Belvin’s character development alone is enough to draw you in all on its own. Making the main character, Ms. Rayna Brimm, super relatable is what I loved the most!  It’s fun to read fantasies or fairytales but nothing hits close to home like an excursion dealing with what we go through as people on a day to day basis when it comes to what we expect in a relationship.  After being taking on an unexpected courtship journey by, Azmir Jacobs a successful entrepreneur and business man, you will come across an amazing unforeseen ending that will only have you on the edge of your seat in extreme anticipation for the next book.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;~ Zakiya Walden (I've Got Something to Say, Inc)</description>

  <description>Detective Gabriel Ashby has never looked twice at another man, yet the criminal across from him, the man he’s interrogating, isn’t like any other. Gabe can’t deal with the sudden, intense need he has for one of NYPD’s Most Wanted. Everyone close to Angelo Pagan ends up dead, with the smug gang leader standing amid the rubble. Gabe would love nothing more than to bust Angelo’s ass and lock him up. So why is he seeing the bastard in his dreams at night?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angelo Pagan knows attraction to Gabe is suicide. He’s resolute to ignore the chemistry…until a police raid goes wrong. He critically injures Gabe, changing the trajectory of both their lives. Now the two can’t get close enough. They settle into a forbidden affair threatened by lies and betrayal, living on different sides of the law with no way of breaching the gap between them. With the authorities looking to make an example of Angelo, Gabe has to decide if it’s really worth it to hate the sin but love the sinner.</description>

  <description>It was one night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night of pure intimacy, with a guy she knew nothing about, that couldn’t have prepared her for the next chapter in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But will it be for better, or for worse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen year old Alexis Harper is a smart, attractive and ambitious young woman with great friends, a doting father and a scholarship at one of Washington State’s most prestigious Performing Arts Colleges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mysterious stranger makes his arrival in her life, she’s captivated by him. She’s intrigued by his past and more so by what the future could possibly hold for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Brandon Taylor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A damaged and confused twenty year old who is grieving for the life he once had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He didn’t think for one moment that he could ever find happiness, and he didn’t want to. He was happy living within the high walls he’d barricaded around himself. It felt safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Alexis and Brandon’s worlds collide, nobody could have prepared them for the emotional rollercoaster they were about to board together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With love, loss, deceit and betrayal abound, it’s pretty hard to trust even those closest to you, as both Brandon and Alexis are soon to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Suitable for 18 years + due to language and sexual content***</description>

  <description>A series of murders in New York City has stymied the police and FBI alike, and they suspect the culprit is a single killer sending an indecipherable message. But when the two federal agents assigned to the investigation are taken out, the FBI takes a more personal interest in the case. Special Agent Ty Grady is pulled out of undercover work after his case blows up in his face. He's cocky, abrasive, and indisputably the best at what he does. But when he's paired with Special Agent Zane Garrett, it's hate at first sight. Garrett is the perfect image of an agent: serious, sober, and focused, which makes their partnership a classic cliche: total opposites, good cop-bad cop, the odd couple. They both know immediately that their partnership will pose more of an obstacle than the lack of evidence left by the murderer. Practically before their special assignment starts, the murderer strikes again - this time at them. Now on the run, trying to track down a man who has focused on killing his pursuers, Grady and Garrett will have to figure out how to work together before they become two more notches in the murderer's knife."</description>

  <description>Jessica had the nightmares for as long as she can remember.  Nightmares of being judged by people who have died, of being branded by the angels.  Her friends and family think she's crazy because of it all.  Yet she carries the mark of the condemned, seared into the back of her neck, and hides it and herself away from the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when two men she can't ignore enter her life everything changes, including the nightmares.  The two of them couldn't be more different.  She will do anything to be with one of them.  Even tell him the truth about angels, why she never sleeps, and the scar on the back of her neck.  But one of the two has set events into motion that will pull her toward her own judgment and turn her into the object of her greatest fear.</description>

  <description>Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a dark and dusty shop, a devil’s supply of human teeth grown dangerously low.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious "errands", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When beautiful, haunted Akiva fixes fiery eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past. But will Karou live to regret learning the truth about herself?</description>

  <description>Cut &amp;amp; Run Series Book Two - Sequel to Cut &amp;amp; Run Six months after nearly losing their lives to a serial killer in New York City, FBI Special Agents Ty Grady and Zane Garrett are suffering through something almost as frightening: the monotony of desk duty. When they're ordered to take a vacation for the good of everyone's sanity, Ty bites the bullet and takes Zane home with him to West Virginia, hoping the peace and quiet of the mountains will give them the chance to explore the explosive attraction they've so far been unable to reconcile with their professional partnership. Ty and Zane, along with Ty's father and brother, head up into the Appalachian mountains for a nice, relaxing hike deep into the woods... where no one will hear them scream. They find themselves facing danger from all directions: unpredictable weather, the unrelenting mountains, wild animals, fellow hikers with nothing to lose, and the most terrifying challenge of all. Each other.</description>

  <description>Arrogant womanizer Kyle Manchester hates blind dates; however, when best friend, Brad calls in a favor, insisting Kyle take out his girlfriend’s sister, Kyle reluctantly agrees. Attorney Lanie Carmichael’s appearance is no surprise. She is dowdy, awkward, and dressed in so many layers she resembles a wedding cake, but not in an edible way. Her brazen attitude though, astonishes him, especially when she explains she has no interest in gorgeous Kyle. Lanie Carmichael is in love with Brad, and wants Kyle’s assistance in winning his best friend’s heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyle gradually accepts, justifying that the mystery of Lanie has sparked his natural, thirsty curiosity. As an ambitious journalist, he also can’t resist the Pulitzer worthy scoop she offers him. However, as Lanie sheds more layers, both emotionally and physically, Kyle begins to examine his life choices, and his true feelings for this enigmatic girl. With Kyle’s support, Lanie begins to unravel the secrets of her past, and the deep pain that has quietly defined her life. As they each learn more about themselves and each other, both question how a relationship built on fraudulent lies between two broken people could ever survive.</description>

  <description>Enjoy all four of the Big Girls Do It stories in one volume, with special expanded scenes available only in this collection!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15993262.Big_Girls_Do_It_Better" title="Big Girls Do It Better"&gt;Big Girls Do It Better&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gorgeous, rock-star guys like Chase Delany don't go for girls like me. They go for supermodels and actresses, skinny-girls who never eat and spend all day working out. I'm not that girl. So when he locked his fiery brown eyes on me for the first time, I couldn't quite believe it was really happening to me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was the second night I spent with him that I'll never forget. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Long Drive Home (bonus short story)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16005878.Big_Girls_Do_It_Wetter" title="Big Girls Do It Wetter"&gt;Big Girls Do It Wetter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase went to New York...without me. It was only one night, one delicious, sinful night, but it awakened something within me, and now, with him gone, I have no one to satiate my sudden, ferocious hunger. Then I woke up one day and looked at someone near and dear to me in a whole new light. And my world was rocked once again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16050994.Big_Girls_Do_It_Wilder" title="Big Girls Do It Wilder"&gt;Big Girls Do It Wilder&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm going. Going to New York City to be with gorgeous, mysterious, rockstar Chase Delany seemed like a crazy dream, a fantasy come true. The bright lights and music, and his tight, sexy leather pants called to me...and I answered. Chase might want more and I just might give it to him, if I could only forget what I started with Jeff back in Detroit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought I had my love life all figured out, I thought I knew what I wanted, and then things went and changed on me all over again...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16083133.Big_Girls_Do_It_On_Top" title="Big Girls Do It On Top"&gt;Big Girls Do It On Top&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fled New York with my heart breaking and a million questions. Foremost in my mind was whether Jeff would even see me after the colossal mess that New York turned out to be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I discovered the answer, but that only spawned even more questions, many of the yes or no variety...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Blood Slave.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captured, taken from her beloved family and woods, Aria’s biggest fear is not the imminent death facing her, but that she will be chosen as a blood slave for a member of the ruling vampire race. No matter what becomes of her though, Aria knows that she must keep her identity hidden from the monsters imprisoning her. She has already been branded a member of the rebellion, but the vampires do not know the true depth of her involvement with it, and they must never know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though hoping for death, Aria’s world is turned upside down when a vampire named Braith steps forward to claim her. He delays her execution, but Aria knows it’s only a matter of time before he drains her, and destroys her. Especially once she learns his true identity as a prince within the royal family; the same royal family that started the war that ultimately brought down humankind, reducing them to nothing more than servants and slaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aria is determined to hate the prince, determined not to give into him in anyway, but his strange kindness, and surprising gentleness astonish her. Torn between her loyalties to the rebellion, and her growing love for her greatest enemy, Aria struggles to decide between everything she has ever known, and a love she never dreamed of finding.</description>

  <description>Blue Echohawk doesn't know who she is.  She doesn't know her real name or when she was born.  Abandoned at two and raised by a drifter, she didn't attend school until she was ten years old.  At nineteen, when most kids her age are attending college or moving on with life, she is just a senior in high school.   With no mother, no father, no faith, and no future, Blue Echohawk is a difficult student, to say the least. Tough, hard and overtly sexy, she is the complete opposite of the young British teacher who decides he is up for the challenge, and takes the troublemaker under his wing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of a nobody who becomes somebody.  It is the story of an unlikely friendship, where hope fosters healing and redemption becomes love.  But falling in love can be hard when you don't know who you are.  Falling in love with someone who knows exactly who they are and exactly why they can't love you back might be impossible.</description>

  <description>Dr. Abbie Adler had chosen general, child, and adolescent psychiatrist to treat sexually abused girls. As a victim of such abuse herself, Abbie’s insights make her an effective therapist. In addition, her practice includes adult patients and provides group and individual therapy for a broad range of psychiatric problems including depression, personality disorders, psychopathy,and malignant narcissism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a December evening, the Berkeley Police find Abbie sitting in her car at Inspiration Point overlooking the East Bay of San Francisco. She’s bruised and catatonic. They transport her to Brier Hospital where they admit her to the psychiatric ward. The nature of her condition, and its cause, remain a mystery. After standard treatments fail, her psychiatrist recommends electroshock therapy. Finally, she awakens but remembers nothing of the month preceding. In addition, she discovers significant memory gaps from the past few years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abbie had been treating two victims of the Chabot rapist who targeted girls and as she’s making progress in their care, unbelievably, someone abducts and strangles them. Their deaths devastate Abbie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During Abbie’s difficult recovery, memories of past events gradually return. They are fragmentary and torture her with memory flashes and nightmares. Gradually, she begins to suspect that one of her adult patients may be the strangler. When the police find Abbie’s prime suspect brutally murdered, both she and the police are befuddled. Abbie struggles to discover the &lt;br&gt;identity of the strangler and those who may be abetting his actions. Will he/they get away with it?</description>

A broken family, an asshole husband and the loss of loved ones have left me crying Uncle, and declaring a serious case of the Fuck-Its! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had my heart broken, stomped on and shattered before I ever started on my journey to find my little piece of happiness. With a bucket list, a '66 Ford and wild dreams, I set out on an adventure that changed my life forever. Follow me on my journey that resurrected my inner badass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I found my soul sista from another mista, and opened my dream shop along the way. Just when I gave up on finding true love, a pirate and a princess swept me off my ever lovin' feet and filled my world with sprinkles, mac n’ cheese and the courage to live again. They forced my fragile heart to trust and love without fear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truth is, nobody’s past stays hidden forever. It’s an invisible monster waiting to attack and destroy. It has the capability to ruin everything you’ve worked to set right. All it takes is one final blow to the gut to end everything.</description>

  <description>Contains mature/adult situations and language.  For readers 17 and older.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the beginning of senior year, and seventeen year old Juliet Somers has made the rash decision to transfer to her boyfriend's school in an effort to spend more time with him. Sexy bad boy Johnny Parker is a legend at Leclare Academy, and Juliet still can't believe that an average girl like her was able to tame his wild ways. She can't wait to start her new school with him by her side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one night, Johnny's self-destructive habits lead to a stunning betrayal--and Juliet realizes she's made a huge mistake. Now she's stuck at a school where she doesn't fit in, and all the girls seem to hate her guts. Even worse, Johnny is determined to get her back, pulling crazy stunts to win her forgiveness. Juliet is resigned to being an outcast for the rest of her senior year, with no friends, and no clue what she wants to do with her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things start to look up when she gets to know some of Johnny's friends, and finds that some of them are really good guys. With the help of an unlikely ally at her side, Juliet begins to think her situation is not as bad as it seems. As the school year rolls on, she opens herself up to new experiences, makes some huge mistakes, and discovers things about herself she's not sure she likes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliet resolves to stay strong against Johnny's seductive tactics, but it's becoming increasingly harder to deny she still has feelings for him. Will she risk her heart to him again--or will a hot contender manage to sweep her off her feet?</description>

  <description>After the devastating loss of her close friend and former lover, Jenny decides to trade her old life in northern Florida for a new one on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Even though she's been in L.A. a few months, she's still adjusting to city and her new cadre of misfit friends, including her new young and headstrong apprentice, Lori, and her longtime friend and new roommate, Seth Webber, who happens to be not only her high school crush but also the front man for Tangled Web, one of the hottest rock bands on the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of everything else, Jenny lands her first case as a licensed California detective before she even has a chance to unpack. Despite what she thinks of as her metaphysical handicap—a talent for foresight that isn't all that useful in her line of work—Jenny is good at what she does. Still, the missing persons investigation she finds herself embroiled in presents some unique challenges...and eventually leads her down a path she'd once sworn to herself she'd never follow.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Due to be published August 2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECRETS TO DIE FOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dante has been keeping secrets from everyone&lt;/em&gt;: from his mother when he was a boy, from Ash after his brother was raped by their stepfather, and from his family following the death of his grandmother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his stepfather sends a letter addressed to Ash begging for forgiveness, Dante opens it and finds something from his past which destroys his present state of mind - memories that have shaped him into the troubled man he is today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After overhearing a confession that Dante made to Ant Torres, Corey demands that Dante tells Sledge the truth about the Ratas' grandmother. As a result, Dante falls to pieces, revealing everything about his past, begging Corey to keep his secrets. Corey takes pity on him and promises not to tell Sledge. But when Tama stumbles upon one of the secrets, Corey is forced to choose between tearing the Rata family apart or losing the love of his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of Saul's job requires him to keep secrets, but after his cover is blown they all come to light, losing him a job that he cannot do without. Despondent, he goes to the pub, ending up so drunk he allows a woman to take him home, not realising who he has gone with until the following morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Beth finds him lying naked in her cousin's bed, she confesses to Josie what Saul did to her. Josie doesn’t believe her, resulting in Beth moving back in with her parents. While there, her mother finds out Beth has been keeping her own secret. Concerned for her daughter's well-being, Mrs. Connor insists on taking Beth to the doctor. But the results of a scan leaves Beth terrified of losing Dante to Kara forever, a woman who will do &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to keep her man — including murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And a surprise person arrives in New Zealand, someone Ash and Dante haven't seen in ten years. Now going by the name of L, this unusual person understands the brothers more than anyone else, and is more than capable of turning their lives around for the better, especially Dante, who finds love just got a whole lot more complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Please note that this blurb may change closer to the publication date.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Grace Hamilton was the girl with a plan. She knew exactly where her life was going and prided herself on always achieving her goals. It was who she was, and how she lived her life. She never stepped outside the lines, and never considered what she might desire and whom she was actually trying so hard to please. Until him…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carson Stinger was a man who didn't play by any rules except his own. Working in the adult entertainment industry, he didn't care what others thought, and took each day as it came, no direction, no plan. He knew what women wanted from him and believed it was all he had to offer. Until her… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When circumstances forced them to spend several hours together, they walked away changed. But for two people who never should have meshed, overcoming the reality of their vastly different lives wasn't possible. At least not yet…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS IS A STAND-ALONE NOVEL. The first two books in the series need not be read to enjoy this book. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>In episode two of The Flesh Cartel, the dark purpose behind Mat and Dougie Carmichael’s abduction is revealed. Though Dougie is protected from the worst of the guards’ brutality, he’s disgusted to find himself halfway to broken—despairing of escape and terrified of pain. Mat holds onto hope despite repeated rapes and beatings, but threats toward his brother teach him well to lay aside his pride and pick his battles carefully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worn down by days of unrelenting fear and abuse, Mat and Dougie are packaged and marketed with the same ruthless efficiency as any consumer product: Dougie the prettyboy twink, Mat the rabid pit bull. They are led to the auction block as the showpiece of the house’s collection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mat would rather be beaten to death than play the role of obedient slave for sale, but Dougie, desperate not to be separated from his brother, strikes a deal with the pitiless Madame who runs the auction house and controls both their fates. It might just be enough to keep them together—slaves, but together—assuming Mat even wants to be after Dougie fulfills his end of his deal with the devil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Publisher's note: This title contains material some may find objectionable or trigger-inducing, including explicit violence, non-consent, and forced incest.)</description>

  <description>For nail biting suspense, characters that leap of the page, and a tender love story read The Hungry House. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When billionaire Frank Armstrong hires gorgeous and spunky university freshman Vicky Howell as his household assistant, it seems like the answer to her prayers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With delight, Vicky and her mother move into Frank's charming guest cottage. As Vicky's ailing mother's health declines, Frank picks up the tab for her medical bills, trapping them in his web of control. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At her first university class, Vicky meets tall, handsome Paul, and erotic sparks fly, but she's leery because of a high school affair that left her pregnant and heartbroken. Eventually disenchanted with Frank and revolted by his amorous advances, she flees the estate and begins the fiercest battle of her life as she struggles to escape his far-flung influence and shape her own destiny. Paul, influential movie director John Edwards, and her devoted circle of women friends endeavor to support their beloved Vicky in her fight to protect herself and her young son, conceived in an act of violence and born on a day of tragedy. In the final chapters, Frank discovers that Vicky has developed a will of iron.</description>

  <description>Sergei Stolkov is a faithful officer, though his deepest desires go against the Doctrine. A captain with the invading Coalition forces, he believes that self-sacrifice is the most heroic act and his own needs are only valid if they serve the state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike, an operative planted within Cirokko's rebels, has been ordered to seduce Sergei and pry from him the Coalition's military secrets. His mission is a success, but as he captures Sergei's heart, Mike is tempted by his own charade and falls in love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the hostile natives of the planet Cirokko make their move, all seems lost. Can Mike and Sergei survive when the Coalition's internal affairs division takes an interest in what happened in the dusty mountains of Zasidka Pass...?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;96,000 words</description>

  <description>WARNING: This is a hot, steamy read with explicit language and sex scenes. For mature audiences.&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;There's a fine line between love...and obsession&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promising law student Elizabeth Watson struggled her entire life to claw out of her dirt-poor background. And now the thing she's dreamed of, an associate position at her law firm, is within reach. As long as she keeps up her grades, makes law review. And stays out of trouble. But trouble is just what walks in the door one scorching hot summer day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gabriel Storm crashes into Elizabeth's life she wants nothing to do with him. After all, he's on the opposing side of a business deal her law firm represents. If she's seen with him, she can kiss her career goodbye. But she can't stay away from the billionaire who put the "B" in bad boy, and soon she's embroiled in an affair hot enough to make every ounce of her being burn. She should walk away, hell, she should run away, but she can't. Because all she cares about is his kiss, his touch, and the way she feels when she's in his arms. Even if to be with him means the ruin of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Kyran Reese is a man in control. Driven when it comes to work, focused when it comes to play. From his office to the chalk circle of the bare-knuckle boxing ring, his only thought is to win. That thirst heightens when Dale Porter enters his life. His brother’s assistant should be off limits, but her witty comments and sarcastic comebacks have him desperate to get her between the sheets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Dale agrees to Kyran’s  relationship stipulation of no labels she’s sucked into a whirlwind of lust, money, and underground boxing.  Dale fights her growing affection, trying to hide it when the world around them spirals out of control. All too soon she realizes she can’t hide her true feelings any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has Kyran finally met his match? Could playing to win mean playing for keeps?</description>

  <description>Nessa Cavanaugh, psychology student, knows how to stay on an even keel. Despite the urging of her mother and her academic advisor to get a life and have some fun, “all work and no play” sums up her plan to survive her grueling internship year at a children’s hospital. She doesn’t want to end up like her father, whose constant ups and downs broke her family, and avoiding unnecessary emotional entanglements is a must.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she (literally) runs into Dr. Aron Lindstrom in the middle of her disastrous first day on the job. The attraction is instant—and terrifying. Nessa knows she should stay away—especially when she finds out he has a reputation for being a player—but Aron is brilliant, intense, and as sexy as they come. When he challenges her to take a chance on him, her plans to stay focused on work start to crumble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what begins as passion takes on a dangerous edge, becoming an emotional roller coaster that’s frighteningly familiar. As things spiral out of control, Nessa must decide whether she should hold on for the ride or run … even if it means leaving her heart behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**New Adult content: this novel contains sexual content not suitable for readers under the age of 18 **</description>

  <description>Ellen has loved Jagger since she was five and he was seven when they kissed through the chain link fence at school.  She’s had their wedding planned since she was twelve and is ready for a happily ever after with him, but life just isn't that neat and tidy. Although they lost contact over the years, which broke her heart, during Jag's senior year in high school, sophomore Ellen catches his eye once again and their friendship is back on. When things between them gradually develop into something more, Ellen wants to give herself completely to Jag, but he’s not so sure he wants to risk their relationship in taking things to the next level. When Jag is drafted to the Dodgers as the hot, new pitcher of the team, Ellen decides to go with him, transferring colleges and leaving her friends and family behind. But things get more and more complicated when busy schedules, a slimy agent and a supermodel disrupt their lives, which makes Ellen question whether they’ll ever get their perfect forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first book of the True Love Trilogy.</description>

  <description>Scanguards vampire and master of mind control Thomas has mentored newbie vampire Eddie for over a year-and been in love with him for just as long. But he believes that his love will never be reciprocated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While patrolling San Francisco for evil vampires, Eddie kisses Thomas as a diversionary tactic and is shaken to the core by his reaction. He's terrified of his sexual attraction to his mentor and afraid that moving forward and giving into his desires will destroy the relationship they have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When hurt and disappointment about Eddie's inability to commit leads Thomas onto a dark path that spells destruction for all those he loves, only Eddie can pull him back from the brink of eternal darkness. But does Eddie have the courage to face his true feelings in time to save the man who's meant for him?</description>

  <description>Trapped in a web of hate with no escape, a young woman discovers her attraction to the man determined to protect her may be her undoing. Will time run out, or will he find a way to protect her before her abusive father kills her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rowan is awarded a ballet scholarship to Michigan State University during her senior year of high school, her life’s dream is finally realized. Having lost her mother at an early age and being subjected to the abuse of a destitute drunken father, she has known unimaginable loss and heartache and been left wanting for a better life—a life now within her grasp. But with one ill-fated phone call, her life is turned upside down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logan is Rowan's best friend’s older brother whose career is taking off as he prepares to graduate law school and move cross-country to the prestigious law firm that has offered him a very lucrative contract. When Rowan finds herself at Logan’s mercy after he inadvertently learns of the abuse she has suffered at the hands of her father, their lives become intertwined in a way neither ever imagined nor wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an effort to protect her, but with his own hands tied by her unwillingness to report the abuse, Logan strikes a deal requiring Rowan to stay with him whenever there is a chance her father might be on a drunken binge—which is often. For her agreement and cooperation, he will keep her secret. Soon, their time together weighs on them both, and they find themselves constantly tempted to step outside the bounds of their supposed platonic relationship. But there is no point. The devastating fact of the matter is their lives are moving in opposite directions—a relationship destined to die before it even has a chance to live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ever present clock plagues them both as it ticks off the days until they are parted. But one all important question remains—after he leaves, how will he protect her from a father intent on hating her until the day he dies … or the day he kills her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genre: Erotic Romance Fiction</description>

  <description>“All my life, I battled with the knowledge I was twisted… fucked up to want something so deliciously dark—wrong on so many levels. But then slave fifty-eight entered my world. Hissing, fighting, with a core of iron, she showed me an existence where two wrongs make a right."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tess is Q’s completely. Q is Tess’s irrevocably. But now, they must learn the boundaries of their unconventional relationship, while Tess seeks vengeance on the men who sold her. Q made a blood-oath to deliver their corpses at Tess’s feet, and that’s just what he’ll do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He may be a monster, but he’s Tess’s monster.</description>

  <description>Orion’s promising military career is cut short when he is caught having a sex with another free man. He is condemned to a lifetime of slavery after a public trial, a fate which Meme, his ex-lover, shares with him. When he finds out he has been purchased by General Ares, he risks invoking the wrath of his former superior by pleading with him to also purchase Meme. Even though Ares is furious with Orion, he grants his request. Ares is determined to unravel Orion’s impassive facade and Meme may just be what he needs to break a warrior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘My Warrior, My Slave’ is a companion story of ‘Slave of Heart’.

  <description>*****Recommended for  Readers 18+*****&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘I’m standing here, on top of the building and I need to remind myself to breathe. It’s not like I haven’t done this 146 times before. It’s not like I’m NOT the best in the business. I am the best at this because as sick as it sounds, I WANT to be here. I love doing what I do. I can tell you that I have been in this line of work for the last 13 years. I didn’t quite fall into it, I actually sought it out. I am undoubtedly the best in the industry. I am respected amongst all the big players. I am the biggest player of them all. If a rookie tried to come along and show me up as an example of their capabilities, it didn’t take long for me to work out what they were about.&lt;br&gt;There is no hesitation. No second thoughts. No doubts. No emotions. No feelings.’ ~ Anna Brookes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna Brookes is the most dangerous woman that you hope you will never know.&lt;br&gt;Her life of danger started the day she turned 15.&lt;br&gt;The 13 years that follow shapes her life to have her become the most deadly and lethal woman.&lt;br&gt;HiT 149 becomes her most difficult target. Does she pull the trigger or does she risk becoming the target herself?</description>

  <description>When Jade is given a scholarship to an elite private college in Connecticut, she sees it as a chance to finally escape her painful past and get a fresh start. She’s determined to succeed and that means keeping her focus on school and not guys. But her plan falls apart her first day on campus when Garret, a rich prep school boy with swimmer abs and a perfect smile, offers to help her move in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade tries to push him away, but she can’t deny her attraction to him and Garret won’t let her. Things quickly heat up between them, but then come to a sudden halt when reality hits and Jade realizes that a relationship with Garret may never be possible. He comes from a world of wealth where there are rules, including rules about who he can date. And not following those rules has consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two of them try to overcome the obstacles working to keep them apart, Jade is confronted with another challenge. On her 19th birthday, she receives a letter that her now deceased mother wrote years ago. In it are revelations that explain her traumatic childhood but also make her question the past she’s been running from.</description>

  <description>Bethany Davenport's life is a mess. Her husband is worse than a deadbeat, her appliances are dying one by one, and her only excitement is fantasizing about the stud in produce at the grocery store where she works. She often wonders what her life would be like if she'd made a different choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After a near death experience, suddenly Bethany finds herself in the life she always wanted! Or so she thought. Somehow the glamorous life isn't as pretty and shiny as she always imagined it would be. This new life is filled with blackmail, adultery, and sexual deviance ... and that's just her friends! Now Bethany has to figure out what is real and what is only a vague glimpse of the life she thought she wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for a mature audience. There are scenes of strong sexual content and themes that would not be appropriate for anyone under eighteen.</description>

  <description>I had the perfect life; an awesome job in advertising, a gorgeous high rise apartment, and a flirtation with the guy down the hall. Then it all came crashing down.  Two months later I was a cocktail waitress living in a tiny one bedroom apartment. I had also developed a serious ‘men suck’ attitude. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    That all changed the night I met the beautiful and enigmatic Conner Savage. But there was just one little problem…he said he was a vampire. Figures a man that hot would be batshit crazy. Or so I thought. It didn't take me long to realize that Conner wasn't a nut job and that I was addicted to him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    With every moment we spent together he drew me deeper into his world and the supernatural culture in which he lived.&lt;br&gt; Now I had a choice: the vampire I craved or a normal life. Couldn't be easier, right?</description>

  <description>When the local authorities ask Kyle Juenger to hunt a shape-shifting Glyrinny spy, he can't refuse. After all, he can use the reward to replace his paralyzed legs with cyberware, and maybe even to return to his home planet. Besides, he hates the morphs-those invasive, brain-eating monstrosities whose weapons cost him his legs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyle's best lead is the Scorpion, a mercenary ship armed to the teeth. Grimm, the "Scorpion's" pilot and captain, fascinates Kyle. He's everything Kyle lost with his legs, and he's from the same home world. He's also of the warrior caste-half priest, half savior. But Grimm's been twisted by life as a merc, and Kyle's stuck undercover as a criminal on the run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn't stop Grimm from coming on to Kyle, or from insisting he's more than the sum of his past and his useless legs. But Kyle has other concerns-like tracking a dangerous morph who could be wearing anyone's face. And as if things weren't complicated enough, Kyle can't tell if Grimm is part of the solution . . . or part of the problem.</description>

  <description>Sometimes you need someone else to help you find your way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maria's life was torn apart when she was fifteen, and for seven years she's kept her terrible secret hidden from the world.  Now, in her final semester of college, she still struggles against paralyzing fear just trying to speak up in class, and the terror and helplessness linger on in her nightmares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Across campus, Owen sees his scars in the mirror every morning while he gets ready for class. They remind him of the broken home he left behind, the father he hates and fears, and the little sister he couldn't protect. Now, in his final semester of college, he's scared that he may have to return to the hell he called home after staying away for almost five years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Owen becomes a teaching assistant for one of Maria's classes, they find themselves irresistibly drawn to each other. As the two learn each other's secrets and grow closer, they realize that although they may be lost, they're not alone anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new adult contemporary romance is recommended for ages 17+ due to heavy subject matter.</description>

  <description>It’s taken Clea Rose ten years to get over the one night she spent with bad boy Nick Lombard—a night of teenage passion that produced her son, and sent Nick to prison for murder. Now, with her life finally back on track, Clea’s about to marry a wonderful man and leave town for a promising career in New York. The last thing she expects is Nick’s return and the intense feelings he stirs within her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent to prison for a murder he didn’t commit, Nick Lombard comes home to the tiny town of Port Bliss to attend his mother’s funeral, but he doesn’t count on running into Clea. Seeing her reminds him of everything he’s tried to forget, and everything he longs to remember. When Nick learns Clea is about to marry the man who sent Nick to prison, he knows he must stay and fight for the family he was forced to leave behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Nick and Clea must find their way back to the summer they were young lovers on the beach in Port Bliss, realizing that together their love is strong, strong enough to survive anything, even the web of lies that separated them ten years ago.</description>

  <description>Lazarus Walker, charismatic former frontman of the hard-rocking heavy metal band, Black Ryders, wants nothing more than to be left alone. Having traded fame for solitude, he spends his days tending the gardens at his isolated English manor, the link to his former life of debauchery all but severed. Or so he thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a sexy young fan shows up at his doorstep, Lazarus discovers that walking away might be easy, but leaving no trace to follow is hard. What begins as the mild annoyance of an unwelcome guest, quickly spirals into a nightmare, because Kitty Van Winkle is no groupie, but a vengeful psychotic hell-bent on destroying Lazarus and unearthing his darkest secrets at any cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone, it seems, still wants a piece of Lazarus Walker.</description>

  <description>Every strategy in Camellia Rhodes' plan to conquer the fashion world had been correct, catapulting her up the haute-couture ladder until she finally landed the role of her dreams: editor-in-chief of Flair, one of the top fashion magazines in the country. But the controversial fashion editorials she mandates to garner attention for the magazine prove to be more than a misstep, as numerous long-time advertisers end their contracts with Flair. With the recession taking hold of the economy, the publishing company shutters the magazine, and shuts Camellia out of the organization for good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no opportunities to be found in New York, Camellia winds up in Markleeville, Michigan, with one lonely street making up the entire downtown and the most popular ladies boutique sporting a regular Panty Bonanza (“All the undies you can fit into a big Ziploc for $9.99”). Just as she is starting to lose her sense of self, Camellia discovers Shelby Jenkins–a tall, willowy fan of Flair and a modeling agent’s dream come true. Camellia is certain Shelby is her ticket back into the arms of the fashion world. But while Shelby is willing, her mom's health issues could spoil Camellia’s grand plan.</description>

  <description>One night changed my life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beau Bennett has been my best friend since I can remember. He was my first crush before everything came crashing down, and now he wants more, but it's more than I can give him. Things are different now. I wish I could tell him why, but I can't. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven’t told anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never knew how much I really needed him until the day he left for college, and I was completely alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day, Asher Hunt rides into town with his dark, captivating eyes and cocky grin. He doesn't care who I used to be, he's simply breathing life into what’s left. People warn me to stay away from him, but he helps me forget the pain that has held me hostage for so long; something I thought was impossible before he walked into my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been hurt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been saved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I’ve found hope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought my story was written that night, but now I know it was only a new beginning. Until one secret turns my world upside down…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again.</description>

  <description>Celeste Price is an eighth-grade English teacher in suburban Tampa. She is attractive. She drives a red Corvette. Her husband, Ford, is rich, square-jawed and devoted to her. But Celeste has a secret. She has a singular sexual obsession - fourteen-year-old boys. It is a craving she pursues with sociopathic meticulousness and forethought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within weeks of her first term at a new school, Celeste has lured the charmingly modest Jack Patrick into her web - car rides after dark, rendezvous at Jack's house while his single father works the late shift, and body-slamming encounters in Celeste's empty classroom between periods. It is bliss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Celeste must constantly confront the forces threatening their affair - the perpetual risk of exposure, Jack's father's own attraction to her, and the ticking clock as Jack leaves innocent boyhood behind. But the insatiable Celeste is remorseless. She deceives everyone, is close to no one and cares little for anything but her pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With crackling, stampeding, rampantly sexualized prose, &lt;em&gt;Tampa&lt;/em&gt; is a grand, satirical, serio-comic examination of desire and a scorching literary debut.</description>

  <description>Being bad never felt so good...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After being jilted by her former master, Jane Porter looks to end her year-long celibacy by attending a bondage-themed event. Thanks to her ex-boyfriend's stunning betrayal, she isn't looking for happily-ever-after, just a master who's willing to explore the depths of her passion and teach her what the BDSM lifestyle is all about. Antonio Villareal was a wanted man. Single, rich and good looking, he's on the hunt for a submissive to share his world. The moment he sees Jane on the arm of another man, he wants to possess her body and soul. The only problem is; Jane makes it clear she isn't a forever kind of girl. Can Antonio convince Jane to give him a chance?</description>

  <description>Brooke Valentine is working two crummy jobs to pay off her late grandfather's medical bills and back taxes on his house. A freak accident leads to the loss of both jobs and leaves Brooke at the mercy of her new neighbor, Travis Cooper. Brooke can't figure out why Travis is being so nice -- anyone can see he's way out of her league!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis Cooper sees Brooke as a little sister who needs someone to look out for her. When his friends ask what's going on between them, he assures them -- repeatedly -- that Brooke Valentine is definitely not his type. But if she's not his type, why can't he seem to stop kissing her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter Brooke's new boss and friend, Jazz Valenzuela, with a scheme to make Travis jealous. But what will happen when Travis finds out it was all a fake?</description>

  <description>What happens when a first love is given a second chance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn apart ten years previously, Michaela and Jesse’s lives couldn’t be more different. Jesse is enjoying huge success in New York after denying where he came from, while Michaela treasures the quiet life in their hometown, Starling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who they are may have changed but their love hasn’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A school reunion forces them to meet again, and after a passionate night together they can’t bear to be apart. Faced with problems, past and present, the pair try to pick up their relationship where they left off. But when Jesse has spent the last ten years running from his troubled past he finds the journey home, to his true love, harder than anything he has ever done. Michaela is rooted there by her son and her family, both of which present problems for Jesse, but after building a life in Starling off of her own determination and strength, Michaela isn’t willing to throw that away...for anyone.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After everything this couple have faced, is compromise the biggest test of all?</description>

  <description>Tina Hudson has spent the past two years on the road. Her busy sales job provides the perfect way to ease the painful memories of losing her husband to cancer. Now she’s tired of running from her loneliness. Tina suspects her brawny neighbor has been leaving single red roses in her mailbox, but he’s the strong, silent type – the kind that should come with a warning label.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wade Scott has felt dead inside over the miscarriage of his son and the disintegration of his marriage. When Tina moves next door, Wade comes alive again. Problem is, she’s a beautiful sales whiz and he’s an ordinary plumber with a wicked scar along his temple. With little hope of attracting her attention, he showers her with anonymous acts of kindness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As New Year’s Eve approaches, Tina discovers that Wade is the guardian angel who’s been watching over her for the past six months. She doesn’t know what to do. Should she jump at a new job offer that will keep her busy enough to forget her loneliness, or take a chance the strong, silent type might fill her heart, and her home, with love?</description>

  <description>Megan Whitaker desperately wants to forget what the Malone brothers have done to her over the past two years – the haunting images and sensations still plaguing her thoughts and dreams – but she can’t. Charles may be dead, but Zander isn’t. &lt;em&gt;I’ll find you and bring you back to me.&lt;/em&gt; She wants to believe she’s safe with Nick in their secluded new home, but it doesn’t keep her from looking over her shoulder, jumping over unexpected sounds, carrying a concealed weapon or even preparing for the worst. Because she fears the time is near.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Ellis has seen a change in his long, lost love. Battered emotionally and physically, Megan spends her days at self-defense classes and researching things that’ll never allow her to let go of the past. And he feels guilty even wanting her to, because he knows that heathen will return, it’s only a matter of time. And when he does, Nick knows he will do everything possible to save her, even if it means taking another shot to the heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for Megan, there is no escaping the world of sex trafficking, nor the band of men who continually aid one another to keep it thriving. And as her nightmarish world encroaches on reality, Megan soon realizes there are far worse evils to fear than the sadistic man who haunts her dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Romantic Suspense / Dark Realistic Fiction&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended for 17+ for mature and disturbing situations, language and sexual content.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>When Alice was a teenager, strange things started happening to her. Hours of her life simply disappeared. She'd hear voices shouting at her, telling her she was useless. And the nightmares that had haunted her since early childhood, scenes of men abusing her, became more detailed . . . more real. Staring at herself in the mirror she'd catch her face changing, as if someone else was looking out through her eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In "Today I'm Alice," she describes her extraordinary journey from a teenage girl battling anorexia and OCD, drowning the voices with alcohol, to a young woman slipping further and further into mental illness. It was only after years lost in institutions that she was correctly diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. When her alternative personalities were revealed in therapy she discovered how each one had their own memories of abuse and a full picture of her childhood finally emerged. As she learned to live with her many 'alters', she set out to confront the man who had caused her unbearable pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving and ultimately inspiring, this is a gripping account of a rare condition, and the remarkable story of a courageous woman.</description>

  <description>Greg Cage was born to protect. While growing up, he was his mother and sister’s shield against the world… until he failed. For the last decade, he has carried that guilt and need for vengeance around… until it was stripped from him. Now, with his best friend getting married and no longer needing his protection, he is even more lost, completely adrift, and desperate for some control. All he has ever known was how to protect:  his family, his friends, and his country. Can he go against everything he has ever known, and give up that control?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melissa Larson will never let anyone hold the reins in her life. She has been the rock in her family for more years than she can remember, and the fight to keep them together is her main priority right now. She has always been fiercely independent and proud. The last thing she will ever do is ask for someone else’s help. But when that choice is out of her control, forcing her to rely on others to save her and her family, and pick up the pieces that are left, will she be able to let someone else be her strength?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second Greg locks eyes with Meli, he knows that she is someone he needs. Someone he craves. Meli knew the second she met Greg that he would be nothing but trouble and heartache. Her life takes an unexpected turn, and that bitch Fate is back to wreak more havoc on another member of the Corps family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All hell breaks loose, leaving Greg no choice but to call in a favor. He hooks back up with his old friend Braxxon Breaker from the Breakneck MC. Together, they make sure that nothing threatens anyone Greg loves again.</description>

  <description>The Eskimos may have over a hundred words for snow, but that doesn’t even come close to how many words the English language has for “slut”—and Lindsey has been called them all. “Hussy” is Lindsey’s personal favorite, given to her by her own grandmother, who likes to pat her on the hand and whisper, “Don’t worry, dear—a hussy is just a woman with the morals of a man.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lindsey’s not ashamed of her reputation. She knows she’s earned it—and she’s proud of it. After all, you only live once, right? In fact, she goes out of her way to make it known to every guy she comes in contact with, she’s available for the taking—the rougher, the better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is until Lindsey meets Lieutenant Zachary Davis, a man who refuses to treat her like the trash she believes she really is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But can Lindsey change her impulsive ways and learn to value herself the way the Zach does? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warnings: This title contains graphic language and extreme sexual situations as well as a girl with a slutty attitude bigger than Texas covering a haunted past, and a sweet, hot man in uniform dead set on rescuing her from herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note to Readers: This novel was previously released as “Falling Down.”</description>

  <description>"The moment she woke up, her nightmare began..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would you do if you awakened to find a dangerous stranger in your house? In your bed, next to you? Now your home has become your prison, and your body, a battlefield. How would you hold onto your sanity, your self-esteem, your very soul against someone determined to annihilate all three?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the psychological thriller BREAK HER, one woman will find herself in this almost unthinkable situation, and one man will discover that he has finally come up against someone unlike any of those he has destroyed before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the surface, this intruder has all the advantages: strength, weapons, ruthlessness. The only way he can lose is if he finds himself responding to his victim on a human level. The only way she can win is if she rips away the protective lies she’s told herself, the hard shell of indifference she’s hidden in, and becomes again what she has not been since she lost everything that mattered to her, years ago: human.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Includes graphic depictions of rape, sex, and violence and is for readers over the age of 18 only.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

Ward.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some relationships that destroy your faith in people. They make you jaded and hard, irrevocably changing you forever. I wish I could say that I hate her, I wish I could walk away and never look back, but I can’t… I have to save her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The woman who stole my heart and crushed it in her hand disappeared from my life 3 years ago. So when I see her at a bachelor party, half naked, rolling around on the floor with another stripper, I’m shocked. I have to know what cracked Cassie Hale’s picture perfect world that landed her in this hellhole, and I hope that I’m not so bitter that I can’t help her escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genre: New Adult Romance&lt;br&gt;Type: Novel &lt;br&gt;Related Works: DAMAGED &amp;amp; THE ARRANGEMENT&lt;br&gt;STRIPPED 2 Coming Soon&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Kel isn't at all the animal locked in a cage that he appears to be. Secrets keep him there, hidden from those who hunt him. But what does a man do when he needs physical contact to survive, but can't stand the burning pain that comes with another's touch? He’s found a way to get a small fraction of his needs met at the nightclub, Sleeves. What happens when he lets in an unknown woman with a healing hand? Casey can see past the vulgar mouth to the affection-starved man hiding inside. When she does, all hell breaks loose, and the past finds him. Will he be able to avoid the agency, or will they add Casey to their twisted experiments? She entered the cage with him, and now it seems there's no way out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: crude language, anal sex and intended only for a mature audience 18+ due to graphic love scenes.</description>

  <description>From time to time, a book comes along, and makes you stop. It makes you stop and second guess who you are, what you’re doing in life, with life, and for the ones you love. This is that book. Through colorfully painted characters, “Broken People” forces the reader to reflect on self. There will be a broken part of you in one (or all) of these characters, guaranteed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Fat Kid is a self-proclaimed therapist who devotes his life to help people that have difficulties helping themselves, people he considers to be ‘broken’. When he encounters a bulimic teenage girl through his internet blog who threatens to commit suicide, he begins to reflect on parts of his life that he has spent years repressing. He continues to assist her, and many other ‘Broken People’ through his blog. When he meets an extremely independent teenage girl who challenges him, his way of living, and his way of viewing life, he reluctantly listens. In doing so he challenges his past mistakes, his future, and ultimately he finds himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intentionally becoming obese in an effort to shield himself from the approach of outsiders wanting to better understand him, The Fat Kid hides behind his thick outer self. With an overbearing obnoxious attitude, he allows few people to enter his otherwise private life. Most of the people that he encounters come from his internet blog, and pose no real threat to him or to his odd lifestyle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through his reflections on past experiences and his online assistance to others, we are exposed to alcoholism, addiction, drugs, racism, relationships, homosexuality, love, romance, teen relationships, parenting, teen sex, codependency, divorce, obesity, overworked parents, teen pregnancy, bulimia, bathroom selfies, tattoos, parenting, education, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and photo sharing are all discussed at length. The result is a book that will have you laughing, crying, contemplating your own life, and the lives of your parents and/or children. A must read for parents and children alike, regardless of age. It gives teens and young adults an honest look at what parents consider, and provides parents with a realistic view of what teens are exposed to in today’s competitive social networking world.</description>

  <description>Suspense magazine chose Jennifer Hillier&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;#8220;truly frightening&amp;amp;#8221; debut, &lt;em&gt;Creep&lt;/em&gt;, as one of 2011&amp;amp;#8217;s best novels, while #1 bestselling author Jeffery Deaver cautioned &amp;amp;#8220;you better call in sick&amp;amp;#8212;you&amp;amp;#8217;re not going anywhere until you finish reading.&amp;amp;#8221; Now, Hillier returns to the Pacific Northwest college town where one killer&amp;amp;#8217;s stranglehold has ebbed . . . but another sick mind has waited for the perfect moment to pick up where the terror left off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sitting alone in a maximum-security prison cell, Abby Maddox is a celebrity. Her claim to fame is the envy of every freak on the outside: she&amp;amp;#8217;s the former lover of Ethan Wolfe, the killer who left more than a dozen dead women in his wake and nearly added Puget Sound State professor Sheila Tao to the tally. Now Abby, serving a nine-year sentence for slashing a police officer&amp;amp;#8217;s throat in a moment of rage, has little human contact&amp;amp;#8212;save for the letters that pour in from demented fans, lunatics, and creeps. But a new wave of murders has given Abby a possible chance for a plea bargain&amp;amp;#8212;because this killer has been sending her love letters, and carving a message on the bodies of the victims: &lt;em&gt;Free Abby Maddox&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jerry Isaac will never forget the attack&amp;amp;#8212;or his attacker. The hideous scarring and tortured speech are daily reminders that the one-time Seattle PD officer, now a private investigator, is just lucky to be alive. Abby Maddox deserves to rot in jail&amp;amp;#8212;forever, as far as Jerry&amp;amp;#8217;s concerned. But she alone may possess crucial evidence&amp;amp;#8212;letters from this newest killer&amp;amp;#8212;that could crack open the disturbing case. With the help of Professor Sheila Tao, seasoned police detective Mike Torrance, and intuitive criminology student Danny Mercy, Jerry must coax the shattering truth from isolated, dangerous Abby Maddox. Can he put the pieces together before Abby&amp;amp;#8217;s number one fan takes another life in the name of a killer&amp;amp;#8217;s perverted idea of justice?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;***New Adult Dark Erotic Novel***&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Kidnapped. Taken to a private island.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never thought this could happen to me. I never imagined one chance meeting on the eve of my eighteenth birthday could change my life so completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I belong to &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;. To Julian. To a man who is as ruthless as he is beautiful – a man whose touch makes me burn. A man whose tenderness I find more devastating than his cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; My captor is an enigma. I don’t know who he is or why he took me. There is a darkness inside him – a darkness that scares me even as it draws me in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Nora Leston, and this is my story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;WARNING: This is NOT a traditional romance. It contains disturbing subject matter, including themes of questionable consent and Stockholm Syndrome, as well as graphic sexual content. This is a work of fiction intended for a mature, 18+ audience only. The author neither endorses nor condones this type of behavior.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Libby Day was seven when her mother and two sisters were murdered in “The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” As her family lay dying, little Libby fled their tiny farmhouse into the freezing January snow. She lost some fingers and toes, but she survived–and famously testified that her fifteen-year-old brother, Ben, was the killer. Twenty-five years later, Ben sits in prison, and troubled Libby lives off the dregs of a trust created by well-wishers who’ve long forgotten her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kill Club is a macabre secret society obsessed with notorious crimes. When they locate Libby and pump her for details–proof they hope may free Ben–Libby hatches a plan to profit off her tragic history. For a fee, she’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club… and maybe she’ll admit her testimony wasn’t so solid after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the narrative flashes back to January 2, 1985. The events of that day are relayed through the eyes of Libby’s doomed family members–including Ben, a loner whose rage over his shiftless father and their failing farm have driven him into a disturbing friendship with the new girl in town. Piece by piece, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started–on the run from a killer.</description>

  <description>When family problems push Riley Middleton into giving up a percussion scholarship in another state and attending college from home, her friends push her to try out for a local rock band. Of course, Riley makes the band. She rules at the drums. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley soon finds out rock bands have a different dynamic than marching bands, especially when each of her male band mates has a major ego and is a major player. Two of them relentlessly flirt with her. The other—a dark, sexy rock god she can’t help being attracted to— is a total jerk and pushes her to quit. She becomes determined to ignore his rudeness and his hotness. Even if she was interested in jerks, a hook up would probably get her booted out of the ego-ridden band, and playing keeps her sane. Behind the drums, the world and its troubles evaporate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she wants to stay in the band, Riley needs to ignore the growing sparks between her and her band enemy. But as she gets to know the man behind the stage persona, ignoring him proves to be more difficult than flowing through a time sig shift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*New Adult/Mature YA for language and sexual situations.</description>

  <description>Kate Bell isn't perfect. Not even close. The things she got up to in college would cause her parents to fall off their pedestals in shock. Home for the summer vacation, Kate settles in for a long, boring break in the tiny backwater of Winter with folks who still treat her like she's twelve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Ben Parker arrives and suddenly Winter gets interesting. He's hot, mysterious and good with his hands. Kate falls for him instantly, but her cop father warns her to stay away. But how can she stay away from someone as compelling as Ben? Someone who thinks she's perfect just the way she is?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Ben's secrets catch up to him, not only is Kate's heart in danger of being broken, but Ben's entire future could be ruined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RUIN is a new adult contemporary romance intended for mature readers.

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Emerald O'Brien, single mother of two, is the owner of the Chintz 'n China Tea Room where guests are served the perfect blend of tea and tarot reading. She never set out to be a detective, but once word gets out that she can communicate with the dead, there's no turning back...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was definitely a ghost. There, at the foot of Emerald's bed. A pen hovered above a piece of paper and scrawled these alarming words: &lt;em&gt;I was murdered by my husband but nobody knows. Help me.&lt;/em&gt; True, Emerald was considered the town witch, but she owned a teashop, not a detective agency. What did the spirit expect? But after another darker entity emerges, bent on destroying her world and her family along with it, Emerald's life takes a screeching detour onto a wild and dangerous road. As she careens into a web of deceit, lies, and secrets woven around her ghostly visitor, death strikes again. Now, along with her friends - an ex-supermodel and a cop - and her new love interest, Emerald must search for clues to put the killer behind bars - and this tortured soul to rest...</description>

  <description>Luke Price's life has always been about order, control, and acting tough on the outside. For Luke, meaningless relationships are a distraction-a way to tune out the twisted memories of his childhood. He desperately wishes he could forget his past, but it haunts him no matter what he does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet Hayes has had a rough life. When she was young, she was left with no family and the memory of her parents' unsolved murders. She grew up in foster homes, living with irresponsible parents, drugs, and neglect, and trying to fight the painful memories of the night her parents were taken from her. But it's hard to forget when she never got closure-and she can't stop dreaming about what happened that tragic night. To make it through life, she keeps her distance from everyone and never allows herself to feel anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Violet meets Luke. The two clash instantly, yet they can't seem to stay away from each other. Although they fight it, they both start to open up and feel things they've never felt before. They discover just how similar they are. But they also discover something else: The past always catches up with you . . .</description>

  <description>In this spectacular new novel, Barbara O’Neal delivers a generous helping of the best in life–family, food, and love–in the story of a woman’s search for the one thing worth more than anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At thirty-seven, Tessa Harlow is still working her way down her list of goals to “fall in love and have a family.” A self-described rolling stone, Tessa leads hiking tours for adventurous vacationers–it’s a job that’s taken her around the world but never a step closer to home. Then a freak injury during a trip already marred by tragedy forces her to begin her greatest adventure of all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located high in the New Mexico mountains, Las Ladronas has become a magnet for the very wealthy and very hip, but once upon a time it was the setting of a childhood trauma Tessa can only half remember. Now, as she rediscovers both her old hometown and her past, Tessa is drawn to search-and-rescue worker Vince Grasso. The handsome widower isn’t her type. No more inclined to settle down than Tessa, Vince is the father of three, including an eight-year-old girl as lost as Tessa herself. But Tessa and Vince are both drawn to the town’s most beloved eatery–100 Breakfasts–and to each other. For Tessa, the restaurant is not only the key to the mystery that has haunted her life but a chance to find the home and the family she’s never known.</description>

  <description>Fans of Jennifer Weiner and Emily Giffin are sure to fall in love with Katherine Center's most heartwarming and engaging novel yet-about how even losing the most important thing in your life can help you find yourself again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the sudden loss of her husband in a car crash, Libby Moran falls on hard times-so hard, in fact, that she's forced to move in with her hyper-critical mother. There, sleeping on the pull-out sofa so her two children can share the guest room, she can't stop longing for the life she had. So when a letter arrives from Libby's estranged aunt offering her a job and a place to live on her goat farm, Libby jumps at the opportunity. But starting over is never easy. With an aunt who is nothing like she imagined, a shaggy farm manager with a tragic past, a psychic at the feed store who claims to be able to contact the dead, and a bully at her daughter's school, country life isn't at all what Libby expected. But it also offers her what no other place can: A chance to define the good life for herself. A chance to piece together the mysteries of her own past. A chance, even, at love. And, finally, a chance to bring herself, and her family, back to life.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Life can go on after tragedy...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After surviving a traumatic attack as a teenager as well as a disastrous first marriage, Lauren Taylor Grant is content with her life. So what if she gets lonely from time to time? With a healthy, beautiful daughter and a successful coffee shop-cafe, the divorced single mother convinces herself she doesn’t have time for love. When she gets her first glimpse at her parents’ handsome new neighbor, though, she starts reconsidering her stance. Once Charlie Clark begins breaking through her defensive walls, Lauren finds him hard to resist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing stays hidden forever…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Lauren is learning to let go of the past and embrace the future, her personal demons rear their ugly heads in the guise of a vandal hell-bent on destroying Lauren’s happiness. When another local businesswoman is brutally murdered, the investigation into the crime reveals an unexpected connection to Lauren’s past. The message is clear--the past has come calling, and it’s out for blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note for Readers:&lt;/strong&gt; This book does deal with the issues of incest and sexual abuse, more with the effects on the victims than the abuse itself. Reader Discretion Advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Secrets in the Shadows” is the first book in the Shadows Collection, Romantic Suspense novels set in small-town Indiana. Other titles include “Under the Moon's Shadow,” “Shadows from the Grave,” and “Hidden in the Shadows.”</description>

  <description>Akira Malone believes in the scientific method, evolution, and Einstein's theory of relativity. And ghosts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the logic and reason in the world can't protect her from the truth-she can see and communicate with spirits. But Akira is sure that her ability is just a genetic quirk and the ghosts she encounters simply leftover electromagnetic energy. Dangerous electromagnetic energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zane Latimer believes in telepathy, precognition, auras, and that playing Halo with your employees is an excellent management technique. He also thinks that maybe, just maybe, Akira can help his family get in touch with their lost loved ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But will Akira ever be able to face her fears and accept her gift? Or will Zane's relatives be trapped between life and death forever?</description>

  <description>When Cassie Taylor talks, ghosts listen. She wants to heal their souls so they can leave earth. Brooding songwriter Luke Rivers wants to give his recently found daughter a normal home, but he discovers his new house in small town Wisconsin is haunted by a ghost with an attitude. His ghost whisperer has an attitude too—even before someone tries to kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wants conventional; she wants acceptance. No wonder she thinks men are hard and dead people are easy.</description>

  <description>Incidental: Occurring or likely to occur as an unpredictable or minor accompaniment* Happenstance: A chance circumstance * Neither was looking for it. Neither was expecting it. But sometimes, life has other plans… One year after the loss of her fiancé, Tia Hastings needed to find a way to start over. She had to figure out how to be single again, but she had no idea how to do it. Last Stop was a tiny pub with no significance—she chose it to be anonymous, to watch the interactions between the sexes so she could figure out how to start her life over… Dylan Miller was a megastar. It was impossible for him to move amongst the general population without being recognized, but he longed to simply blend into a crowd. He donned a disguise and wandered into Last Stop, a dark little hole-in-the-wall where he was sure he wouldn’t be recognized… When their worlds collide, Tia and Dylan discover something neither of them thought possible—love. But when a fallen star sees Dylan as her ticket back to the top and will stop at nothing to make him hers, Tia wonders if she’s out of her ; and out of time to rescue the love she thought she’d never find again… Is it fate? Coincidence? Or both?</description>

  <description>Maise O’Malley just turned eighteen, but she’s felt like a grown-up her entire life. The summer before senior year, she has plans: get into a great film school, convince her mom to go into rehab, and absolutely do not, under any circumstances, screw up her own future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life has a way of throwing her plans into free-fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Maise meets Evan at a carnival one night, their chemistry is immediate, intense, and short-lived. Which is exactly how she likes it: no strings. But afterward, she can’t get Evan out of her head. He’s taught her that a hookup can be something more. It can be an unexpected connection with someone who truly understands her. Someone who sees beyond her bravado to the scared but strong girl inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That someone turns out to be her new film class teacher, Mr. Evan Wilke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maise and Evan resolve to keep their hands off each other, but the attraction is too much to bear. Together, they’re real and genuine; apart, they’re just actors playing their parts for everyone else. And their masks are slipping. People start to notice. Rumors fly. When the truth comes to light in a shocking way, they may learn they were just playing parts for each other, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smart, sexy, and provocative, Unteachable is about what happens when a love story goes off-script.</description>

  <description>For forty years the double murder of an elderly couple in the Hollywood Hills remained unsolved and all but forgotten. No one cared. But a stranger, bent on revenge, is out to change all that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kit Griffin has finally overcome a painful childhood at the hands of her mother, former actress Alana Stevens. No longer living in the grasp of the cold, tyrannical woman, Kit has found a new life tucked away in little San Madrid, California, running a business she loves, surrounded by friends she considers family. For the first time her life is on track. That is, until Alana is found brutally murdered on Mother’s Day, pulling Kit back in to the dark horrors of her past. To make matters worse, the police consider her the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Boston, an old family friend and the man Kit has loved since she was a teen, is fighting his own demons as a suspect in his wife’s murder two years earlier. Despite his past, he’s determined to win Kit over once and for all. But before that can happen they need to convince the police there’s a killer working his way down a list with cold-hearted vengeance in mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced to delve into Alana’s dark past, it becomes clear someone is out to settle a score. When Jake and Kit uncover a forty year old double murder that leads them straight to the door of a legal dynasty, they soon find out just how far the heirs will go to keep the past buried and eliminate all the loose ends to protect their empire. Will Jake and Kit become the next victims or will they find an unexpected guardian angel?</description>

  <description>There was something seriously wrong with Marty. That was the only explanation that she could come up with. Why else would she feel this way for the biggest SOB in town? Granted, he was also the hottest man in town, but he was also arrogant, callous, and determined to drive her away even as he drove her crazy with his touch. She should just walk away from him and probably would if it wasn’t for this connection that she’d always had with him that kept making her want more with the one man that couldn’t give her anything more than heartache.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He should have left and never looked back when he’d decided to finally do the right thing and push Marty out of his life, but instead he stuck around to torture himself by staying close to the one woman that he could never allow himself to have. She deserved better than him, better than the tortured existence that he led and better than the horrifying future that waited for him.</description>

  <description>Aside from her dad, who passed away when she was six, Cassidy Jameson has only ever trusted one man: her best friend, Tyler. So of course she follows him to Texas when he leaves for college. She just didn't expect to be so drawn to their new roommate, Gage, a gorgeous guy with a husky Southern drawl. The only problem? He's Tyler's cousin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gage Carson was excited to share an apartment off campus with his cousin. He didn't mind that Tyler was bringing the mysterious friend he'd heard about since they were kids ... until the most beautiful girl he's ever seen jumps out of his cousin's Jeep. There's something about Cassi that makes Gage want to give her everything. Too bad Tyler has warned him that she's strictly off-limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite everything keeping them apart, Cassi and Gage dance dangerously close to the touch they're both been craving. But when disaster sends her running into Tyler's arms, Cassi will have to decide whether to face the demons of her past ... or to burn her chance at a future with Gage.</description>

  <description>One Happily-Ever-After Rocking Chair... and no sign of any forthcoming babies to rock in ol' Georgebury, Vermont. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Callie Grey, turning thirty means coming to grips with the fact that her boss (and five-week fling) is way overdue in his marriage proposal. And way off track because Mark has suddenly announced his engagement to the company's new Miss Perfect. If that isn't bad enough, her mom decides to throw her a three-oh birthday bash in the family funeral home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad goes to worse when she stirs up a crazy relationship with the town's not so warm and fuzzy veterinarian, Ian McFarland, in order to flag Mark's attention. So Ian is more comfortable with animals.... So he's formal, orderly and just a bit tense. The ever-friendly, fun-loving and spontaneous Callie decides it's time for Ian to get a personality makeover. But dang, if he doesn't shock the heck out of her, she might actually fall for Vermont's unlikeliest eligible bachelor....</description>

  <description>There will be a second book, but it isn't a sequel, in that there's no cliffhanger in 'The Tied Man #1', or need to buy a second book. The first book can be read as a stand alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Tabitha McGowan:&lt;br&gt;'Towards the end of the writing process I realised I couldn't write a simple epilogue to TTM, and I really felt there was a second story with the same protagonists, but a whole new plot. There will be two major locations - Spain, and Dublin - and an introduction to Finn's wider family, and also the horror that is the O'Halloran clan! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really wanted to let Finn and Lilith grow and heal and discover, and learn to deal with the demons that they both still have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately I love writing for both Finn and Lilith, and I wasn't quite ready to let the pair of them go *just* yet!'</description>

  <description>Delaney Brannigan and Blake Morrisson meet at the Glebe Point annual costume dance, known only to each other as the leopard and the cowboy---but, as Delaney soon discovers, the cowboy she'd thought had ridden off into the sunset never to tempt her again, is none other than the man she came from New York to find and discredit. Against her will, Delaney is drawn deeper and deeper into an overwhelming attraction to Blake---an attraction she can't give in to if she wants to keep the one thing she values more than anything else. &lt;br&gt;Blake has spent months trying to find the son he never knew he had until a chance encounter with an old friend. Finding the boy has been the only thing he cared about---that is until Delaney Brannigan came to town. Now the bewitching woman has him thinking he might have finally found the one woman who could make him want to settle down. &lt;br&gt;When the private investigator hired to find Blake's son shows up to tell Blake he's located the boy, Delaney's hopes and dreams are shattered and Blake discovers she's not at all what she seemed.&lt;br&gt;Will these two lovers lose one another in a web of deception, or will the small town boy and the girl from New York find a way to trust their hearts and find a once in a lifetime happiness.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;At the heart of The Husband’s Secret is a letter that’s not meant to be read&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My darling Cecilia, if you’re reading this, then I’ve died...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret—something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive. . . .&lt;br&gt;Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all—she’s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, and a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything, and not just for her: Rachel and Tess barely know Cecilia—or each other—but they too are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband’s secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acclaimed author Liane Moriarty has written a gripping, thought-provoking novel about how well it is really possible to know our spouses—and, ultimately, ourselves.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now the #1 international bestselling author returns. The new Crossfire novel by Sylvia Day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon calls me his angel, but he's the miracle in my life. My gorgeous, wounded warrior, so determined to slay my demons while refusing to face his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vows we'd exchanged should have bound us tighter than blood and flesh. Instead they opened old wounds, exposed pain and insecurities, and lured bitter enemies out of the shadows. I felt him slipping from my grasp, my greatest fears becoming my reality, my love tested in ways I wasn't sure I was strong enough to bear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the brightest time in our lives, the darkness of his past encroached and threatened everything we'd worked so hard for. We faced a terrible choice: the familiar safety of the lives we'd had before each other or the fight for a future that suddenly seemed an impossible and hopeless dream...</description>

  <description>Inspired by an episode on Oprah from years ago that dealt with men addicted to porn, a dream, and 8 women's lives, Portrait of Our Marriage, a fictional memoir, is one woman's story you don't want to miss. &lt;br&gt;Nicky, embarks on a journey to find herself and become her own person despite the legacy of a domineering father and an emotionally—and often physically—distant husband. Reminiscing events from her life, she looks at pictures and remembers the romance, falling in love, marriage, and her family. &lt;br&gt;When her husbands interest in pornography becomes an obsession. She wonders how she will compete? Some may call her a wimp, others will say she's a woman in love trying to hold her family together. Fun, sexy, intense, hot, compelling, thought provoking, and so real you may find it shocking even disturbing. &lt;br&gt;Although this is one woman's journey, many women today deal with this issue in silence, feeling ashamed, and embarrassed. What would you endure for love?</description>

  <description>She believes that love can never last, promises are usually broken, and true happiness is extremely elusive in the long run. He believes most risks are worth taking, the promises he makes can be kept, and love doesn't factor in his relationships any longer. They're both wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jordan Holloway has never fully recovered from the unexpected deaths of her famous Hollywood parents. At 27, she is still slow to trust and remains uncertain about the true duration of love and happiness. Yet, it's been four years since she fell in love with Ethan when he rocked her world even as he marched off to war leaving her alone with their young son Max. Now, Ethan tells her this will be his last tour in Afghanistan and that soon the three of them will be together. Still anxious at his leaving again, Jordan extracts a promise for Ethan's safe return from Brock Wainwright, her husband's sniper partner and best friend. But, can she put all her trust in Brock and can he keep such a promise?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 29, Brock Wainwright fully embraces the dangerous life of a Navy Seal. He enjoys his freedom and not being committed to anyone; and, there's been a long line of women who can attest to that. Everything changes for Brock after he meets Jordan. When the two men return to Afghanistan, Brock's intent on keeping his promise to Jordan about keeping Ethan safe for a variety of reasons, including the most disturbing one of all, he is more than just attracted to his best friend's wife. This revelation plagues Brock on the battlefield and in a violent moment changes everything. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you enjoy Nicholas Sparks' The Lucky One or Dear John and the twists and turns of storylines like those of Jodi Picoult, you've got to read When I See You.</description>

She needs to kill the kingpins responsible for Cameron’s death before they come looking for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Cameron secretly observes Emily, he has no idea of the danger he has placed her in—or that it may already be too late for him to save her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scare Crow is a tale of revenge, terror, and love as Emmy and Cameron embark on separate journeys to face enemies, correct past mistakes, and.............. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;find their way to their destinies.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The third sexy novel in &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Alice Clayton’s playful and erotic Redhead series continues the sizzling romance between actress Grace Sheridan and Hollywood’s hottest leading man Jack Hamilton. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grace has landed the lead in a new TV series—but when the director asks her to lose fifteen pounds, she goes public with her weight struggles and suddenly develops a huge fan club who support her right to have curves. But between that and the public’s continuing fascination with her “are they or aren’t they” relationship with Jack, Grace begins to wonder if anyone’s really interested in her because of her upcoming TV series, or if it’s all speculation about the size of her ass and her bedroom partner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Jack is voted the Sexiest Man Alive and becomes a little too enamored with the party-hard lifestyle. Grace vows to give him the space he needs to find himself, but then he begins to spiral down from lovable Brit to Hollywood brat. People are talking, but are Jack and Grace? Her career is on the rise, and his continues into the stratosphere, but will she be able to catch him if he falls? Will they ever be able to just be a couple who can hold hands when they walk down the street?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Will coming home mean heartbreak or happiness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Emily was eighteen, her mother died in an accident on their farm in rural Ontario. Devastated, Emily vowed never to suffer the loss of love again. She fled to Toronto and transformed herself from a farm girl into a sophisticated businesswoman. Now, ten years later, having made good in the big city, Emily is back to sell the family farm and put her past behind her forever. However, she didn’ t count on finding Ray Storm, the farmhand she had nicknamed Rain as a child, more attractive than ever. But as Emily struggles to come to terms with the tragedy of her mother’ s death and learns to trust again, Rain harbours a secret that he fears will keep them apart forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falling for Rain&lt;/em&gt; is a classic contemporary romance in the tradition of Kristin Hannah and Nora Roberts, set against a picturesque country landscape. Meadow Taylor breathes new life into this heartwarming modern-day romance, exploring enduring themes of love, loss, healing, and trust.</description>

Despite the responsibilities resting on her slender shoulders, she’ll not let anyone wrest away what’s left of her way of life—particularly a Yankee officer who wants to set up winter camp on her land.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a defiance born of desperation, she defends her home as though it were the child she never had…and no mother gives up her child without a fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the brazen wisp of a woman pointing a gun at his head, Colonel Reece Cutteridge has his orders. Requisition Shapinsay—and its valuable livestock—for his regiment’s use, and pay her with Union vouchers. He never expected her fierce determination, then her concern for his wounded, to upend his heart—and possibly his career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the armies go dormant for the winter, battle lines are drawn inside the mansion. Yet just as their clash of wills shifts to forbidden passion, the tides of war sweep Reece away.

  <description>Seven-year-old Keighly Barrow never forgot the night she spied a boy her own age at her grandmother's Redemption, Nevada, mansion. He was staring at her from an antique mirror in the ballroom, standing among gaudily dressed women in an old-time western saloon. Keighly could only discover that his name was Darby Elder -- and that he lived a century ago.Twenty years later, engaged to be married, Keighly inherited her grandmother's house. Back before the ballroom mirror, she faces a handsome cowboy whose roguish air radiates trouble. Keighly senses the spirit of Darby Elder -- along with an electric charge of passion passing through the glass...and into her heart. But old news clips declare this outlaw son of a local madam would die in a shoot-out. Keighly's magical connection to Darby is too strong not to try and save his life or, if history will not bend, to love him as fiercely as the fleeting moments will allow.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Linda Lael Miller gave readers "a gift to treasure" &lt;em&gt;(Romantic Times)&lt;/em&gt; with her acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Springwater Seasons&lt;/em&gt; novels. Now, once again capturing the spirit of early America, she delivers a marvelous tale of love, family loyalty, and passionate desire on the Western frontier -- where fairy tales sometimes do come true. &lt;br&gt; She was the only child of a rich and powerful rancher. He was the son of a drunken ne'er-do-well. But when eleven-year-old Luke Shardlow rescued eight-year-old Charity Barnham from drowning, she promised him one wish...any wish his heart might desire. &lt;br&gt; Fifteen years later, Charity and Luke meet once more, but the gulf between them seems as wide as ever. Charity is engaged to a neighboring rancher her father has chosen for her. Luke still seems to be a Shardlow to the core -- a drifter, maybe even an outlaw, on a road to nowhere. But things are not always what they appear, for Luke has a few secrets to hide. And as a sweet, sensual passion begins to grow between them, Luke and Charity discover that the only wish either of them long to fulfill is to spend a sweet eternity in each other's arms -- no matter the cost.</description>

  <description>Like most of the young ladies in Fort Worth, Noelle Brown was smitten by handsome, charming Andrew Paige. But when she challenged the steely-eyed gaze of his stepbrother Jared, something inside her felt a little wild, a little thrilled...a little afraid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was a big-city lawyer with a killer's stance -- a desperado turned lawman, disillusioned with life and haunted by a past he couldn't escape. But this tender, green girl, with her flashfire temper and her unconventional ways, tempted and tormented him with a sweet, maddening passion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rivalry would pit brother against brother and scandal would rock their lives. And Noelle would have to convince a man unwilling to believe in love that only he could still the anguish in her heart -- and fulfill the promise of their destiny together....</description>

  <description>A marriage of convenience...A clash of wills...An uncompromising love! &lt;p&gt; Adelaide Amanda Pinkney was glad to bid Chicago farewell. After the bustle and crowds of the growing city, the news that her aunt and uncle had left her their California farm was like a dream come true. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Addie's idyll was shattered the moment she reached California, and learned there was another claim on her land. Montana Creed was tall, headstrong elemental...as much a part of the rich and rugged California terrain, as the fields and valleys that dotted its majestic landscape. As a boy, Montana had watched his father slaughtered, his land stolen -- and he had vowed that, one day be would fulfill his father's dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Addie soon discovered that Montana's stubborn streak ran as deep as her own...and that his seductive smile was almost impossible to resist. As his reluctant bride, she came to cherish Montana's tender, passionate caresses. But she knew that one day he'd have to face the demons of his past -- or lose the bright and loving promise of their future!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Living on a rundown farm at the edge of a small Texas town, Della Ward is haunted by the bittersweet life she once lived with an adoring husband who died too soon. Once a laughing, carefree soul, Della is now a widow with only guilty memories for company. Until the day she sees a rugged stranger riding across the prairie toward her house. His presence awakens Della’s heart, but she can never imagine the ways this man will forever change her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lawman James Cameron believes in settling debts and living by honor. It may have taken him ten years to arrive at Della’s door, but he’s finally here and is determined to tell her the truth about the day her husband died. But one look at the woman whose picture he has carried with him for years and he knows that the truth may destroy them both. For Cameron will have to face the past and force Della to do the same before either of them can have a future . . . or each other.</description>

  <description>Jake Turner was a man of secrets...and even a woman he'd saved from a Crow massacre couldn't be privy to his true mission. But Emma Lancing was a woman of surprises, blossoming like a cactus rose during their arduous trek through the Western wilderness. Resourceful, brave and beautiful, she alone made him question his solitary life by proving to be the perfect partner for his adventurous soul!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma Lancing's only escape from an abusive, hopeless future lay in trusting a man who made it clear she was not welcome in his world. Even so, she was drawn to Jake Turner's rugged fearlessness and independent spirit, which stirred in her unrealized strengths and undreamt-of passions!</description>

  <description>In the beginning, there was him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gutsy, green-eyed Eleanor never met a rule she didn't want to break. She's sick of her mother's zealotry and the confines of Catholic school, and declares she'll never go to church again. But her first glimpse of beautiful, magnetic Father Søren Stearns and his lust-worthy Italian motorcycle is an epiphany. Suddenly, daily Mass seems like a reward, and her punishment is the ache she feels when they're apart. He is intelligent and insightful and he seems to know her intimately at her very core. Eleanor is consumed—and even she knows that can't be right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when one desperate mistake nearly costs Eleanor everything, it is Søren who steps in to save her. She vows to repay him with complete obedience…and a whole world opens before her as he reveals to her his deepest secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danger can be managed—pain, welcomed. Everything is about to begin.</description>

  <description>Luke's Story&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reclusive artist Cassie López has buried herself in her art high on a mountain in Colorado, safe from all men and far from her family in Peru who betrayed her when she needed them most. Safely tucked away in her own little world, she steeps herself in mystery and mysticism. When her friend Karla Paxton came to Colorado seeking similar escape, she draws Cassie off the mountain a number of times, including the time she first encountered Luke Denton. A disturbing sketch makes him think his dead wife wants the two of them to be together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luke hasn't been this frustrated by a woman since his wife was killed in an avalanche many years ago, but something about the skittish Cassie brings out every protective instinct he possesses. Cassie invaded his dreams even before he met her. He needs to find out why, but getting anywhere near Cassie is a bigger challenge than his toughest mountain search-and-rescue missions. When nature's fury forces them together, will it be Cassie's turning point, or her breaking point?</description>

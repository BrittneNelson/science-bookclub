  <description>On Pine Street, the houses begin to shake. The earth begins to move. The streets crack open and yards split asunder...and rising from subterranean depths far below, a viscid black muck bubbles up and floods the neighborhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In it are a ravenous army of gigantic worms seeking human flesh. They wash into houses, they come up through the sewers, through plumbing, filling toilets and tubs, seeking human prey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cut off from the rest of the town, the people of Pine Street must wage a war of survival or they'll never see morning. As bad as the worms are, there's something worse—and far larger—waiting to emerge.</description>

  <description>If Mike had been in time for breakfast that fatal Easter morning he might have gathered from the expression on his father's face, as Mr. Jackson opened the envelope containing his school report and read the contents, that the document in question was not exactly a paean of praise from beginning to end. But he was late, as usual. Mike always was late for breakfast in the holidays. When he came down on this particular morning, the meal was nearly over. Mr. Jackson had disappeared, taking his correspondence with him; Mrs. Jackson had gone into the kitchen, and when Mike appeared the thing had resolved itself into a mere vulgar brawl between Phyllis and Ella for the jam, while Marjory, recently affecting a grown-up air, looked on in a detached sort of way, as if these juvenile gambols distressed her.</description>

  <description>Imagine an Age of Exploration full of alchemy, human dissection, sea monsters, betrayal, torture, religious controversy, and magic. In Europe, the magic is thin, but at the edge of the world, where the stars reach down close to the Earth, wonders abound. This drives the bravest explorers to the alluring Western Ocean. Christopher Sinclair is an alchemist who cares only about one thing: quintessence, a substance he believes will grant magical powers and immortality. And he has a ship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; </description>

  <description>"Born and raised in Chicago, Detective John Lynch might just be about to die there too.&lt;br&gt;"&lt;br&gt;"Because one dark secret might be about to tear a whole city apart.&lt;br&gt;"&lt;br&gt;A pious old woman steps out of the Sacred Heart confessional and is shot dead by a sniper with what at first appears to be a miraculous and impossible shot. &lt;br&gt;Colonel Tech Weaver dispatches a team from Langley to put the shooter--and anyone else who gets in the way--in a body bag before a half-century of national secrets are revealed. &lt;br&gt;Detective John Lynch, the son of a murdered Chicago cop, finds himself cast into an underworld of political corruption and guilty secrets, as he tries to uncover the truth about what's really going on - before another innocent citizen gets killed.</description>

  <description>Eighteen years after the publication of &lt;em&gt;The Pillars of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;, Ken Follett has written the the long awaited sequel, &lt;em&gt;World Without End&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;World Without End&lt;/em&gt; takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of &lt;em&gt;The Pillars of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;. The cathedral and the priory are again at the center of a web of love and hate, greed and pride, ambition and revenge, but this sequel stands on its own. This time, the men and women among an extraordinary cast of characters find themselves at a crossroad of new ideas -- about medicine, commerce, architecture, and justice. In a world where proponents of the old ways fiercely battle those with progressive minds, the intrigue and tension quickly reach a boiling point against the devastating backdrop of the greatest natural disaster ever to strike the human race: the Black Death.</description>

  <description>Blade Runner meets Sling Blade in the weirdest Southern Gothic ever.    Far into the future, in the nuclear bowels of post-apocalyptic Dixie, there is a town.  A town of derelict mobile homes, ancient junk, and mutant wildlife.  A town of slack jawed rednecks who bask in the splendors of moonshine and mud boggin'.  A town dedicated to the bloody and demented legacy of the Old South.     A TOWN CALLED SUCKHOLE     But all is not well for the last remnant of hillbilly society.  Suckhole's annual "Hell-Yeah Heritage Jamboree" is suddenly threatened by a string of gruesome murders.  The town's sheriff, an illiterate yokel with a cleft pallet, is at his extremely limited wit's end, and he knows there is only one man smart enough to solve the mystery:  Dexter Spikes, a monstrous missing link between swamp and man brought to life by natural evolution.  He lives in the swamps alone, shunned by the simple townsfolk of Suckhole who don't believe in the wicked sciencery of his existence.  If Dexter takes the sheriff's case, he'll have to face the undead culprits behind the murders, who are determined to bring about the next apocalypse.  If he refuses the job, the town will be doomed to a vicious slaughter.          "A Town Called Suckhole is the finest post-apocalyptic southern gothic mudpunk buddy-cop blow-out ever put to print.  Which is to say this mutant motherfucker of a debut novel lands with serious world-inventing swagger and marks David W Barbee as a go-to Bizarro writer for outrageously over-the-top action, big laughs and surprising heart." -JEREMY ROBERT JOHNSON, author of We Live Inside You and Angel Dust Apocalypse    "With the manic intensity of a tent revival on fire and the stupefying mendacity of a snake oil peddler on peyote, Barbee builds a rich, grimy world so steeped in rampaging Confederate id that for long stretches, I could not see it clearly through my red, blinding rage at not having written it, myself." -CODY GOODFELLOW, author of Perfect Union</description>

  <description>Paris, July 1942: Sarah, a ten year-old girl, is brutally arrested with her family by the French police in the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup, but not before she locks her younger brother in a cupboard in the family's apartment, thinking that she will be back within a few hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paris, May 2002: On Vel' d'Hiv's 60th anniversary, journalist Julia Jarmond is asked to write an article about this black day in France's past. Through her contemporary investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connect her to Sarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl's ordeal, from that terrible term in the Vel d'Hiv', to the camps, and beyond. As she probes into Sarah's past, she begins to question her own place in France, and to reevaluate her marriage and her life.</description>

  <description>Prohibition is a big headache for some . . . and a big payday for others, the fearless entrepreneurs with little respect for the law of the land. With $125,000 worth of Kentucky's finest homemade whiskey in his possession, big, hell-raising Son Martin counts himself among the latter. Son knows having this much illegal hooch makes him a very tasty target, but nobody's going to steal it from him. Ware may be coming to his backyard, but Son's not worried. Because when it comes to fighting, shooting, and keeping one step ahead of the Big Boys, he's more than good—he's &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; . . . and dangerous . . . and deadly.</description>

  <description>On a hot summer afternoon in 1972, three teenagers drove into an unfamiliar neighborhood and six lives were altered forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirty five years later, one survivor of that night reaches out to another, opening a door that could lead to salvation.  But another survivor is now out of prison, looking for reparation in any form he can find it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE TURNAROUND takes us on a journey from the rock-and-soul streets of the '70s to the changing neighborhoods of D.C. today, from the diners and auto garages of the city to the inside of Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital, where wounded men and women have returned to the world in a time of war.  It is a novel of fathers and sons, wives and husbands, loss, victory and violent redemption, another compelling, highly charged novel from George Pelecanos, "the best crime novelist in America." -&lt;em&gt;Oregonian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--George Pelecanos' most recent novel, &lt;em&gt;The Night Gardener&lt;/em&gt;, hit the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller List and made more than 10 "Best Of 2006" lists including &lt;em&gt;Salon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocky Mountain News, Los Angeles Times, New York Sun, Washington Post Book World, Miami Herald, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;--The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; nominated &lt;em&gt;The Night Gardener&lt;/em&gt; for the 2006 Best Mystery/Thriller Book Award.</description>

  <description>Jack Ryan always wanted to play pro ball. But he couldn't hit a curveball, so he turned his attention to less legal pursuits. A tough guy who likes walking the razor's edge, he's just met his match -- and more -- in Nancy. She's a rich man's plaything, seriously into thrills and risk, and together she and Jack are pure heat ready to explode. But when simple housebreaking and burglary give way to the deadly pursuit of a really big score, the stakes suddenly skyrocket. Because violence and double-cross are the name of this game -- and it's going to take every ounce of cunning Jack and Nancy possess to survive . . . each other.</description>

  <description>Also available as a Hachette Audio.Gus Ramone is "good police," a former Internal Affairs investigator now working homicide for the city's Violent Crime branch. His new case involves the death of a local teenager named Asa whose body has been found in a local community garden. The murder unearths intense memories of a case Ramone worked as a patrol cop twenty years earlier, when he and his partner, Dan "Doc" Holiday, assisted a legendary detective named T. C. Cook. The series of murders, all involving local teenage victims, was never solved. In the years since, Holiday has left the force under a cloud of morals charges, and now finds work as a bodyguard and driver. Cook has retired, but he has never stopped agonizing about the "Night Gardener" killings. The new case draws the three men together on a grim mission to finish the work that has haunted them for years. All the love, regret, and anger that once burned between them comes rushing back, and old ghosts walk once more as the men try to lay to rest the monster who has stalked their dreams. Bigger and even more unstoppable than his previous thrillers, George Pelecanos achieves in THE NIGHT GARDENER what his brilliant career has been building toward: a novel that is a perfect union of suspense, character, and unstoppable fate.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;For centuries, parasites have lived in nightmares, horror stories, and in the darkest shadows of science. Now award-winning writer Carl Zimmer takes us on a fantastic voyage into the secret parasite universe we actually live in but haven't recognized. He reveals not only that parasites are the most successful life-forms on Earth, but that they triggered the development of sex, shape ecosystems, and have driven the engine of evolution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mapping the parasite universe, Zimmer makes the astonishing observation that most species are parasites, and that almost every animal, including humans, will at one time or another become the home of a parasite. Zimmer shows how highly evolved parasites are and describes the frightening and amazing ingenuity these commando invaders use to devour their hosts from the inside and control their behavior. The sinister Sacculina carcini makes its home in an unlucky crab and proceeds to eat everything but what the crab needs to put food in its mouth, which Sacculina then consumes. When Sacculina finally reproduces, it places its young precisely where the crab would nurture its own progeny, and then has the crab nurture the foster family members. Single-celled Toxoplasma gondi has an even more insidious role, for it can invade the human brain. There it makes men distrustful and less willing to submit to social mores. Women become more outgoing and warm-hearted. Why would a parasite cause these particular personality changes? It seems Toxoplasma wants its host to be less afraid, to be more prone to danger and a violent end -- so that, in the carnage, it will be able to move on to another host. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the steamy jungles of Costa Rica to the fetid parasite heaven of rebel-held southern Sudan, Zimmer tracks the genius of parasitic life and its impact on humanity. We hosts have developed remarkable defenses against the indomitable parasite: our mighty immune system, our culturally enforced habit of keeping clean, and, perhaps most intriguingly, sex. But this is not merely a book about the evil power of parasitism and how we must defend against it. On the contrary, Zimmer concludes that humankind itself is a new kind of parasite, one that preys on the entire Earth. If we are to achieve the sophistication of the parasites on display here in vivid detail, if we are to promote the flourishing of life in all its diversity as they do, we must learn the ways nature lives with itself, the laws of &lt;em&gt;Parasite Rex&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>In the aftermath of a colossal battle, the future of the Seven Kingdoms hangs in the balance — beset by newly emerging threats from every direction. In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone — a structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Spenser is..."The sassiest, funniest, most-enjoyable-to-read-about private eye around today...the legitimate heir to the Hammett-Chandler-Macdonald tradition." -- "The Cincinnati Post" Spenser is..."Tougher, stronger, better educated, and far more amusing than Sam Spade, Phil Marlowe, or Lewis Archer...Spenser gives the connoisseur of that rare combination of good detective fiction and good literature a chance to indulge himself." -- "The Boston Globe"</description>

  <description>A red-haired witch with steel fingers, dragged unconscious from the currents of the Adrenaline River. An isolated researcher suffering from a disease called the Gag. Covens of stoned witches dancing to techno in the forest. A punk whose specialty is replacing body parts with metal replicas. Sleepwalkers who don’t want to wake. Trees hiding a filthy secret—the result of a perverse dictator’s mind. A pink spy-swan, monitoring every move. A lyrical, dark and charming bizarro story of intrigue and discovery from a dimension just beyond ours.</description>

  <description>Sky piracy is a bit out of Darian Frey’s league. Fate has not been kind to the captain of the airship Ketty Jay—or his motley crew. They are all running from something. Crake is a daemonist in hiding, traveling with an armored golem and burdened by guilt. Jez is the new navigator, desperate to keep her secret from the rest of the crew. Malvery is a disgraced doctor, drinking himself to death. So when an opportunity arises to steal a chest of gems from a vulnerable airship, Frey can’t pass it up. It’s an easy take—and the payoff will finally make him a rich man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the attack goes horribly wrong, Frey suddenly finds himself the most wanted man in Vardia, trailed by bounty hunters, the elite Century Knights, and the dread queen of the skies, Trinica Dracken. Frey realizes that they’ve been set up to take a fall but doesn’t know the endgame. And the ultimate answer for captain and crew may lie in the legendary hidden pirate town of Retribution Falls. That’s if they can get there without getting blown out of the sky.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;My name is Katniss Everdeen.&lt;br&gt;Why am I not dead?&lt;br&gt;I should be dead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katniss Everdeen, girl on fire, has survived, even though her home has been destroyed.  Gale has escaped. Katniss's family is safe. Peeta has been captured by the Capitol. District 13 really does exist. There are rebels. There are new leaders. A revolution is unfolding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is by design that Katniss was rescued from the arena in the cruel and haunting Quarter Quell, and it is by design that she has long been part of the revolution without knowing it.  District 13 has come out of the shadows and is plotting to overthrow the Capitol. Everyone, it seems, has had a hand in the carefully laid plans--except Katniss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The success of the rebellion hinges on Katniss's willingness to be a pawn, to accept responsibility for countless lives, and to change the course of the future of Panem. To do this, she must put aside her feelings of anger and distrust. She must become the rebels' Mockingjay--no matter what the personal cost.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.  She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.  Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>Hard-ass Palm Beach County judge Bob Isom Gibbs enjoys sending even petty offenders away to do hard time -- which has made the list of miscreants who want him dead longer than a fully grown Florida gator's tail. And a good number of his illwishers are probation officer Kathy Baker's clients, including young Dale Crowe and his psycho uncle Elvin. Now, Kathy's got an even more daunting task than keeping BIG's horny hands off her: keeping "Maximum Bob" alive. Because Gibbs's many enemies seem to be willing to go to any lengths -- be it death by amphibian or some more tried-and-true method -- to permanently end the career of an oversexed, racist jurist who's more interested in scoring than in saving his own red neck.</description>

  <description>As the subtitle suggests, Joe Pike, the intriguing, enigmatic partner of L.A. PI Elvis Cole, takes center stage in this intense thriller from bestseller Crais (The Two Minute Rule). To pay back an old debt, Pike is coerced into protecting Larkin Barkley, a hard-partying young heiress whose life is in danger after a "wrong place wrong time" encounter that quickly escalates and spins out of control. The enemy is shadowy, violent and relentless—but the fierce, focused Pike, one of the strongest characters in modern crime fiction, is equal to the challenge. The breathless pace and rich styling are sure to appeal to readers of hard-boiled fiction in general, but since up to now Pike has mostly remained in the background, some fans of the Elvis Cole series (The Forgotten Man, etc.) may find the explicit picture that emerges of Pike at odds with the image they've constructed for themselves.</description>

Joe Pike's on a hunt of his own: to clear his friend's name, and to punish the people who murdered him.

But not all of them realize that with great power must also come...you know the rest. Okay, sure we often say Peter Parker's life will never be the same. But listen, pal, we've never been more serious. This will change everything for Pete, for Spidey...and possibly for YOU! Look at it this way...if EVERYONE'S a Spider-Man...then no one is. As the brilliantly fearsome Jackal rises from the past and begins organizing an army of spider-powered soldiers, how can the heroes of NYC hope to contain millons of wall-crawling New Yorkers? Plus: A dangerous new role for Venom. And, nearly 50 years in the making, the story which MUST BE READ: J. Jonah Jameson: THE SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAYOR!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLLECTING:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Collecting AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (1963) #666-673, VENOM (2011) #6-8, SPIDER-ISLAND: DEADLY FOES, material from SPIDER-ISLAND,SPOTLIGHT and the INFESTED prologues from AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (1963) #659-660 and #662-665.</description>

  <description>For centuries the Maintainers have worked. With no help from other worlds, they subsist on the food they can grow and that's little enough. But their purpose, their whole life is to maintain the machines that will one day make their world as habitable as old Earth. Life used to be hard. Now as their crops fail, livestock sickens, and the temperature drops, it's becoming impossible. This year's Winter Season Feast won't be the usual celebration. It's not a time for optimism or hope - and it's not a time to welcome unexpected guests. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Doctor, Amy, and Rory find a society breaking apart under the strain. Tensions are mounting, old rivalries are coming to the fore, people are dying...and then the Doctor's old enemies, the Ice Warriors, make their move. With the cold-hearted threat of invasion, the real battle for survival begins. Or does it? The Doctor begins to suspect that behind everything lies a deadlier, and even more chilling danger...</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The Western Territories, 1880. For four years,Civil War veteran and former U.S. Cavalry CaptainJonas P. Hollister has been rotting in a prison cell at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His crime: lying about the loss of eleven soldiers under his command . . . who he claims were slaughtered by a bandof nonhuman, blood-drinking demons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now a famous visitor, the detective Allan Pinkerton, has arrived with an order for Hollister's release. The brutal murder of a group of Colorado miners in a fashion frighteningly similar to the deaths of Hollister's men has leant new credence to his wild tale. And suddenly Jonas Hollister finds himself on a quest both dangerous and dark—joining forces with Pinkerton, the gunsmith Oliver Winchester, an ex-fellow prisoner, a woman of mystery, and a foreigner named Abraham Van Helsing, who knows many things about the monsters of the night—and riding hell for leather toward an epic confrontation . . . with the undead.</description>

  <description>John Scalzi visits the universe of his bestselling novel The Android's Dream for this exclusive short story, featuring fan favorite character Judge Nugan Bufan Sn -- a brilliant alien jurist whose misanthropy and lack of social graces is matched only by his futile, unrequited for the game of golf. When he hits the links at the absymal Dulles Woods golf course, the unexpected happens: He begins to play well. But there are more hazards on the course for Sn than just sand traps and disaffected caddiesâ€¦&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long a staple of Scalzi's live readings, "Judge Sn Goes Golfing" has never seen print until now. Read what you've been missing.</description>

  <description>Ensign Andrew Dahl has just been assigned to the Universal Union Capital Ship &lt;em&gt;Intrepid&lt;/em&gt;, flagship of the Universal Union since the year 2456. It’s a prestige posting, and Andrew is thrilled all the more to be assigned to the ship’s Xenobiology laboratory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life couldn’t be better…until Andrew begins to pick up on the fact that (1) every Away Mission involves some kind of lethal confrontation with alien forces, (2) the ship’s captain, its chief science officer, and the handsome Lieutenant Kerensky always survive these confrontations, and (3) at least one low-ranked crew member is, sadly, always killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not surprisingly, a great deal of energy below decks is expended on avoiding, at all costs, being assigned to an Away Mission. Then Andrew stumbles on information that completely transforms his and his colleagues’ understanding of what the starship &lt;em&gt;Intrepid &lt;/em&gt;really is…and offers them a crazy, high-risk chance to save their own lives.</description>

  <description>Burke--ex-con, mercenary, sometime killer--makes his living preying on New York's most vicious predators and avenging their innocent victims. But in Andrew Vachss's mercilessly suspenseful new novel, Burke finds himself working the other side of the street, where guilt and innocence are as disposable as the sheets in a Times Square hotel--and as dirty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burke's new employer is Kite, a fanatical crusader who specializes in debunking "false allegations  of child sexual abuse. Kite has a case that may be the real thing, but needs Burke to tell him if it is. And if mere money can't persuade Burke to cooperate, Kite has plenty of other incentives at his disposal--including a fanatical bodyguard with a taste for corsets and brass knuckles. A tour guide to hell written in icy prose, &lt;em&gt;False Allegations&lt;/em&gt; is Vachss at his most unnerving.</description>

  <description>  In &lt;em&gt;Footsteps of the Hawk&lt;/em&gt; Burke himself is in danger of becoming a victim.  Two rogue cops are stalking him.  The coolly seductive Belinda Roberts wants him to free a man charged with a grisly string of rape-murders. The brutal and half-crazy Detective Jorge Morales may be trying to frame Burke for the same crimes.  What ensues is a novel of high-wire suspense and nightmarish authenticity informed by an insider's knowledge of the city where everything—from flesh to other people's cellular phone numbers—is up for sale.</description>

  <description>Mildred Pierce had gorgeous legs, a way with a skillet, and a bone-deep core of toughness. She used those attributes to survive a divorce and poverty and to claw her way out of the lower middle class. But Mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of these elements, Cain creates a novel of acute social observation and devastating emotional violence, with a heroine whose ambitions and sufferings are never less than recognizable.</description>

  <description>In this darkly comic novel, the six women of the Knitting Circle meet every week to talk, eat cake, and make fabulous sweaters. The easy-going circle undergoes a drastic change when the members realize they are all the survivors of rape—worse still, that none of their attackers suffered consequences—and the group becomes the vengeful Knitting Circle Rapist Annihilation Squad, taking punishment into their own hands via their knitting needles. As the women take their revenge, groups of men issue statements against the vigilante ladies, from the Chamber of Commerce to the sinister Men Against Women Against Rape (MAWAR), plotting to stop and punish the Knitting Circle. Featuring strong female characters, this satirical piece explores love, revenge, feminism, violence, and knitting.</description>

  <description>On the night of the new moon, the demons rise in force, seeking the deaths of two men both of whom have the potential to become the fabled Deliverer, the man prophesied to reunite the scattered remnants of humanity in a final push to destroy the demon corelings once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arlen Bales was once an ordinary man, but now he has become something more—the Warded Man, tattooed with eldritch wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. Arlen denies he is the Deliverer at every turn, but the more he tries to be one with the common folk, the more fervently they believe. Many would follow him, but Arlen’s path threatens to lead him to a dark place he alone can travel to, and from which there may be no returning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only one with hope of keeping Arlen in the world of men, or joining him in his descent into the world of demons, is Renna Tanner, a fierce young woman in danger of losing herself to the power of demon magic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahmann Jardir has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army and proclaimed himself Shar’Dama Ka, the Deliverer. He carries ancient weapons--a spear and a crown--that give credence to his claim, and already vast swaths of the green lands bow to his control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Jardir did not come to power on his own. His rise was engineered by his First Wife, Inevera, a cunning and powerful priestess whose formidable demon bone magic gives her the ability to glimpse the future. Inevera’s motives and past are shrouded in mystery, and even Jardir does not entirely trust her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once Arlen and Jardir were as close as brothers. Now they are the bitterest of rivals. As humanity’s enemies rise, the only two men capable of defeating them are divided against each other by the most deadly demons of all--those lurking in the human heart.</description>

  <description>Butch Fatale is a fast-talking, skirt-chasing, two-fisted lesbian private investigator with an insatiable appetite for two things — women and trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It started off easy. A little lost femme, a heartbroken butch and fat roll of bills. But when the beautiful corpses start stacking up, Butch realizes she’s got enemies in high places and the Armenian mob measuring her for a plot in the Glendale Cemetery.</description>

  <description>A &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best Seller!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DC Comics took a bold step and renumbered the longest-running monthly comic, &lt;em&gt;Action Comics&lt;/em&gt;, to #1 for the first time since 1938 as part of the DC Comics—The New 52 event.With this renumbering comes a new creative team featuring comics legend Grant Morrison and fan-favorite artist Rag Morales. While Morrison is no stranger to writing the Superman character, having won three Eisner Award's for his work on &lt;em&gt;All-Star Superman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Action Comics&lt;/em&gt; will be something new for both old and new readers and present humanity's first encounters with Superman, before he became one of the World's Greatest Super Heroes. Set a few years in the past, it's a bold new take on a classic hero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; Superman: Action Comics Vol. 1: Superman and the Men of Steel&lt;/em&gt; includes issues 1-8 of the monthly series</description>

  <description>Outside, something resembling Godzilla attacks the city. At the party, 'Faith' by George Michael is playing and someone is telling you to consider changing apartments. Hollywood is empty. You are wealthy, drive a Ferrari, listen to Tangerine Dream, and associate with famous people. In a poetical abstract form, you live another life.</description>

He's a regular sort of guy who's recently been dealt a shitty hand by life: he lost his job, his wife hates him and wants a divorce, and it turns out she was also cheating on him as well. Now he's living on his brother's couch. Holy fuck, that sucks. Dennis can't imagine things could get much worse, and that's why he jumped at the opportunity to take part in a new reality game show: a "sexcathlon" where the first person to achieve 10 increasingly difficult and perverted sexual challenges wins a million dollars and is crowned King of the Perverts. Dennis doesn't care about the title, he just wants the money, but now he's not sure he can make it to the end. Enduring a golden shower and following through with an Abe Lincoln are hard enough, but he's losing his nerve and fears what act of perversion will come next. He'd like to drop out, but his Russian bear of a cameraman, Mongo, has other plans for him and that million dollar prize, and Dennis has to decide which is worse: winning the King of the Perverts, or losing it.</description>

  <description>A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Batman stands today as one of the most recognizable characters in pop culture, and along with the Batcave and the Batmobile, Gotham City itself stands as one of the most identifiable aspects of Batman lore. This trade explores not only the history of the city but its dark secrets and deadly denizens as well, giving readers a whole scale look at world of Batman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writer Scott Snyder (AMERICAN VAMPIRE) teams with Kyle Higgins to pen the story, which features various members of the Batman family uniting to solve a mystery that travels through multiple eras of Gotham City. When a mystery as old as Gotham City itself surfaces, Batman assembles a team of his greatest detectives – including Red Robin, Owlman, I-Ching and others – to investigate this startling new enigma. As clues are discovered and the mystery deepens, Batman's team soon finds itself on a journey that explores different eras in Gotham's history and touches upon notable Gotham families including the Waynes, Kanes, and Elliotts. This miniseries spins out of recent events in the Batman titles and sets the stage for several exciting storylines in 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This volume collects all five issues of the BATMAN: GATES OF GOTHAM miniseries and also includes BATMAN ANNUAL #28 and DETECTIVE COMICS ANNUAL #12.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;A gritty, high-stakes adventure set in a futuristic world where oil is scarce, but loyalty is scarcer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In America's Gulf Coast region, grounded oil tankers are being broken down for parts by crews of young people. Nailer, a teenage boy, works the light crew, scavenging for copper wiring just to make quota-and hopefully live to see another day. But when, by luck or by chance, he discovers an exquisite clipper ship beached during a recent hurricane, Nailer faces the most important decision of his life: Strip the ship for all it's worth or rescue its lone survivor, a beautiful and wealthy girl who could lead him to a better life....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this powerful novel, Paolo Bacigalupi delivers a thrilling, fast-paced adventure set in a vivid and raw, uncertain future.</description>

  <description>In 1944, as waves of German ninjas parachute into Kent, Britain's best hopes for victory lie with a Spitfire pilot codenamed 'Ack-Ack Macaque'. The trouble is, Ack-Ack Macaque is a cynical, one-eyed, cigar-chomping monkey, and he's starting to doubt everything, including his own existence. A century later, in a world where France and Great Britain merged in the late 1950s and nuclear-powered Zeppelins encircle the globe, ex-journalist Victoria Valois finds herself drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse with the man who butchered her husband and stole her electronic soul. Meanwhile, in Paris, after taking part in an illegal break-in at a research laboratory, the heir to the British throne goes on the run. And all the while, the doomsday clock ticks towards Armageddon.</description>

Father Robert McCullen is a customer with sad eyes, a choirboy smile, and a tattered photograph of his sister, who disappeared almost twenty years ago.

  <description>AN ALO NUDGER MYSTERY New Orleans is off Alo Nudger's beaten path; the St. Louis private detective likes the comforts of home. But he also loves jazz, and when he's given a round-trip ticket to the Crescent City by legendary clarinetist Fat Jack McGee, who needs to talk to him, Nudger is willing to take a flyer. Fat Jack has a problem, maybe two: A singer named Ineida, whose father is a very important man in New Orleans, and a pianist named Hollister. Hollister plays the blues just fine, but there's something about him that disturbs Fat Jack. In fact, now that Hollister and the girl are an item, Fat Jack's scared. It doesn't take long before Nudger is, too....</description>

  <description>Imagine a lush green valley, dotted with prosperous farms and towns. It could be anywhere in North America—the Okanagan in B.C., the Niagara orchards of Ontario. In this case it happens to be the Annapolis Valley in Nova Scotia. But on one hill, South Mountain, lives the a clan of impoverished, inbred hillbillies, ignored or shunned by the people in the valley below for two hundred years. Few have much schooling, most are unemployed, and they keep almost entirely to themselves. &lt;br&gt;Two solitudes side by side, until one day in January 1984, Sandra Golder, aged thirteen, burst into tears in class. When her teacher took her out into the hall to ask her why she was crying, a gruesome story of incest and sexual abuse began to emerge. Within hours the story had spread to the principal, a social worker, and finally the police. Within weeks a full-fledged scandal had been unleashed on the valley: sixteen adults—men and women—from the Mountain were charged with hundreds of allegations of incest and sexual abuse of children as young as five. It gradually became clear that this had been going on for generations, a cycle endlessly repeated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book tells the amazing story not only of the court cases that followed, but the way the valley community reacted. Dark secrets weren't the exclusive property of the Golers: the townspeople had their own, including the fact that some of them had known about the abuse for decades and done nothing about it.</description>

  <description>First in the Kurt Wallander series. Winner of the inaugural Glass Key Award.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It was a senselessly violent crime: on a cold   night in a remote Swedish farmhouse an elderly farmer is bludgeoned to death, and   his wife is left to die with a noose around her neck.  And as if this didn’t present   enough problems for the Ystad police Inspector Kurt Wallander, the dying woman’s   last word is &lt;em&gt;foreign&lt;/em&gt;, leaving the police the one tangible clue they have–and in the   process, the match that could inflame Sweden’s already smoldering anti-immigrant   sentiments.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Unlike the situation with his ex-wife, his estranged daughter, or   the beautiful but married young prosecutor who has piqued his interest, in this case,   Wallander finds a problem he can handle. He quickly becomes obsessed with solving   the crime before the already tense situation explodes, but soon comes to realize   that it will require all his reserves of energy and dedication to solve.</description>

  <description>After serving time for armed robbery, Ernest "Stick" Stickley is back on the outside and trying to stay legit. But it's tough staying straight in a crooked town -- and Miami is a pirate's paradise, where investment fat cats and lowlife drug dealers hold hands and dance. And when a crazed player chooses Stick at random to die for another man's sins, the struggling ex-con is left with no choice but to dive right back into the game. Besides, Stick knows a good thing when he sees it -- and a golden opportunity to run a very profitable sweet revenge scam seems much too tasty to pass up.</description>

  <description>It's no secret the sexy and racy cover art of femme fatales from the golden age of paperbacks and magazines exalts the female form in all its sexy and sultry allure. Still today, these lustful, passionate and sometimes lurid images are enticing and artistically inspiring. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From sexy, semi-dressed pin-up dolls to dangerous bad girls and deadly dames, many of these rare covers were painted by some of the most talented and collectible artists of the last 50 years, including popular American artists Robert Bonfils, Robert Maguire, Gene Bilbrew and Bill Ward, and British artists Reginald Heade and H.W. Perl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Always titillating, often tawdry, definitely not politically correct nor for the faint of heart, the nearly 700 full-color pulp fiction paperback cover images in this book show women in all their sexy, sassy and sinful best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This dynamic book also features: 700 covers with title, author, cover artist, publisher, book number, and date of publication for each book; values for three grades of condition; a quick guide to collecting; and a list of specialist book dealers and collector shows.</description>

  <description>An oddly compelling, often hilarious forensic exploration of the strange lives of our bodies postmortem. For two thousand years, cadavers some willingly, some unwittingly have been involved in science's boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They've tested France's first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender reassignment surgery, cadavers have been there alongside surgeons, making history in their quiet way. In this fascinating, ennobling account, Mary Roach visits the good deeds of cadavers over the centuries from the anatomy labs and human-sourced pharmacies of medieval and nineteenth-century Europe to a human decay research facility in Tennessee, to a plastic surgery practice lab, to a Scandinavian funeral directors' conference on human composting. In her droll, inimitable voice, Roach tells the engrossing story of our bodies when we are no longer with them. 13 b/w illustrations.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;By the author of &lt;em&gt;Dare Me&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The End of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In October 1931, a station agent found two large trunks abandoned in Los Angeles&amp;amp;#8217;s Southern Pacific Station. What he found inside ignited one of the most scandalous tabloid sensations of the decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by this notorious true crime, Edgar&amp;amp;#174;-winning author Megan Abbott&amp;amp;#8217;s novel &lt;em&gt;Bury Me Deep&lt;/em&gt; is the story of Marion Seeley, a young woman abandoned in Phoenix by her doctor husband. At the medical clinic where she finds a job, Marion becomes fast friends with Louise, a vivacious nurse, and her roommate, Ginny, a tubercular blonde. Before long, the demure Marion is swept up in the exuberant life of the girls, who supplement their scant income by entertaining the town&amp;amp;#8217;s most powerful men with wild parties. At one of these events, Marion meets&amp;amp;#8212;and falls hard for&amp;amp;#8212;the charming Joe Lanigan, a local rogue and politician on the rise, whose ties to all three women bring events to a dangerous collision.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A story born of Jazz Age decadence and Depression-era desperation, &lt;em&gt;Bury Me Deep&lt;/em&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;with its hothouse of jealousy, illicit sex and shifting loyalties&amp;amp;#8212;is a timeless portrait of the dark side of desire and the glimmer of redemption.</description>

  <description>The Edgar Award-nominated author of "Gun Monkeys" delivers an adrenaline rush of a novel that features a special appearance by Joe DiMaggio. &lt;br&gt;The high spot of Teddy Folger's life was the day in 1954 that he got an autographed baseball card from Joe DiMaggio himself. It's been downhill ever since. Which is why he just unloaded his freeloading wife and torched his own comic-book store-in one of the stupidest insurance scams in history. Enter Conner Samson. The down-on-his-luck repo man has just been hired to repossess Teddy's boat. Little does he know there's a baseball card on board that some men are willing to kill for. Thus begins a rip-roaring cross-country odyssey-and with bodies piling up, the squeeze is on for the penultimate piece of Americana. And Conner will be lucky if he ends up back where he started: broke and (still) breathing. "From the Hardcover edition."</description>

  <description>Countless writers and artists have spoken for a generation, but no one has done it quite like Chuck Klosterman. With an exhaustive knowledge of popular culture and an almost effortless ability to spin brilliant prose out of unlikely subject matter, Klosterman attacks the entire spectrum of postmodern America: reality TV, Internet porn, Pamela Anderson, literary Jesus freaks, and the real difference between apples and oranges (of which there is none). And don't even get him started on his love life and the whole Harry-Met-Sally situation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether deconstructing &lt;em&gt;Saved by the Bell&lt;/em&gt; episodes or the artistic legacy of Billy Joel, the symbolic importance of &lt;em&gt;The Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; or the Celtics/Lakers rivalry, Chuck will make you think, he'll make you laugh, and he'll drive you insane -- usually all at once. &lt;em&gt;Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs&lt;/em&gt; is ostensibly about art, entertainment, infotainment, sports, politics, and kittens, but -- really -- it's about us. All of us. As Klosterman realizes late at night, in the moment before he falls asleep, "In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever 'in and of itself.'" Read to believe.</description>

  <description>   Andrew Vachss has reinvented detective fiction for an age in which guilty secrets are obsolete and murder isn't even worth a news headline. And in the person of his haunted, hell-ridden private eye Burke, Vachss has given us a new kind of hero: a man inured to every evil except the kind that preys on children. &lt;br&gt;   Now Burke is back, investigating an epidemic of apparent suicides among teenagers of a wealthy Connecticut suburb.  There he discovers a sinister connection between the anguish of the young and the activities of an elite sadomasochistic underground, for whom pan and its accompanying rituals are a source of pleasure—and power</description>

  <description>A collection of twenty-three bizarro fables in which you'll meet Nobody, a performing primate who wants to chew your children's lips off; pontificate with the Stork, philosopher and feces-eater; rejoice as Nordin "The Noggin" Nobel, noted socialite, is reconciled to his estranged head; share the existential despair of Slothra the suicidal kaiju; celebrate the love of Violet and her rotting lover; explore the meaning of life with Dr. Ebenezer A.T. Horkenheimer, sociopath, and the geography of heaven and hell with Ted the mangled toy. And so much more...It's Aesop, as imagined by John Waters.</description>

      <![CDATA[A Hollow Cube is a Lonely Space is a collection of Bizarro short stories by S.D.

The stories within range from just a page to eight pages...]]>

  <description>It's been three years since the last harvest, and the lepers are preparing once again to wage war on the mannequins for spare parts-prosthetic limbs they need to rebuild themselves. Jaundice (a female mannequin) and Quall (a male leper) have fallen in love in the midst of this war, forcing them to confront and redefine the nature of loyalty and betrayal. An absurd and tragicomic allegory, Lepers and Mannequins explores how love, identity, class, religion and desire all divide people not only from each other, but from themselves. As the lepers struggle to maintain their humanity (striving at all costs to conquer both the mannequins and their disease), they could ultimately lose it. This is the mannequin metaphor, and warns of a startling fate for the lepers-if they can stay in one piece long enough to put themselves back together...</description>

  <description>"Sordid, pathetic, senselessly exciting. . . has the immediacy and the significance of a nerve-shattering explosion."—&lt;em&gt;The New Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The depression of the 1930s led people to desperate measures to survive. The marathon dance craze, which flourished at that time, seemed a simple way for people to earn extra money dancing the hours away for cash, for weeks at a time. But the underside of that craze was filled with a competition and violence unknown to most ballrooms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horace McCoy&lt;/strong&gt; was born near Nashville, Tennessee in 1897. His novels include &lt;em&gt;I Should Have Stayed Home&lt;/em&gt; (1938), and &lt;em&gt;Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; (1948).</description>

  <description>The Outsiders-with giant monsters and transforming robots! You know that book about the poor kids and the rich assholes who mess with them all the time? The one where the main poor kid (C. Thomas Howell) and his best friend save those kids from a fire, and then the best friend (Ralph Macchio) dies and croaks out, "Stay gold, Pony Boy." And there's that rich girl, Cherry, who totally leads Pony Boy on the whole time? This is that! But with giant monsters and robots fighting in the rumbles. And it's in The Hamptons. In a dystopian future. It's crazy! Giant monster fights, touching love with sexbots and stinky women, extreme body modification, and Boogers, the guy who's sorta like Pony Boy, but gross and perverted-it's all right here. Stay gold.</description>

  <description>Norman Spooter awakens one morning to find that his eyeballs have fallen in love with each other. They proceed to tear themselves out of his head, steal his car keys, and take off for parts unknown... So he does what any of us would probably do in that situation... he goes back to bed, hoping it'll all resolve itself. Unfortunately, in the middle of the night, a pack of WOLVES moves in. The worst thing is, they're party wolves... BUT they gave him a security deposit, so he decides he's going out to get his eyeballs back. He joins forces on his epic quest with a woman named Zoe, who has a mysterious secret almost as crazy as Norman's Party Wolves. Besides, she needs him too... She's on the run from her psychopathic ex-boyfriend, who happens to be a dangerous sociopath, a classic car enthusiast and, worst of all, a fully grown walrus. The road trip/chase novel is flipped on its head with everyone chasing everyone... explosions, battles and madness are the drivers in this particular race, along with a few stops in such places as the Motel Sick and a cult town in North Dakota featuring some dangerous hooded guys who'll pretty much marry anything to anything. With violence and insanity nipping at his heels and a race against the clock to get his body parts back, this could turn out very badly for Norman Spooter.</description>

  <description>HOLY SHIT! THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! It's kind of like that awesome movie, Frozen, you know where there's those people stuck on a ski-lift while surrounded by wolves. But imagine if instead of wolves they were bears. And the bears spit wolves! Like they're fucking grenade launchers or something! It's awesome!!! And then there's these gigantic death worms that come out of the ground and kill and eat everyone. And they're HUGE. Big enough to eat breweries and shit. And it's all because of 2012! I KNOW! But, don't worry, there's a bunch of Mexican Ninjas with invisibility ponchos and throwing-sombreros that are going to save the day. They are so badass. And the main character Dave does some stuff, too. He can pull things out of the air, like burgers and Armani suits. (If I could do that I'd be eating McDouble cheeseburgers constantly!) He and his friend Worm-Head Girl, along with the Mexican Ninjas, and a veterinarian named LeAnn must try to save Phoenix from total annihilation. But they better hurry up because these gigantic death worms are going to utterly fucking destroy everything in like two seconds!! CHECK OUT THE MOST AWESOME BOOK YOU COULD EVER POSSIBLY IMAGINE!! IT'S THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!</description>

  <description>Franz and Lola are vampires in love. They live in a cottage near the sea with their little vampire baby. Burn Girl is a lonely girl who walks along the bottom of the sea, constantly on fire. The water doesn't put her fire out or soothe her burns. It only makes her feel like she's wearing an itchy wool sweater. Bruno is the buffest vampire. He is building Muscle Island, a floating fortress comprised of mussels. The Vampire Science Council has been working for centuries to prevent the depletion of their arctic planet's blood supply, but the blood has finally run out. Cyrus Lugosi's friends want to slaughter him as part of a ritual sacrifice that will raise Cthulhu from his tomb at the bottom of the sea. There are just two problems: The closest thing to the Necronomicon they've got is a unicorn coloring book, and Cthulhu is more interested in his quest for the perfect hamburger. Their fates will converge when Cthulhu Comes to the Vampire Kingdom.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In Jewish scripture, there is a legend: There are thirty-six righteous people on earth. The thirty-six protect us. Without them, humanity would perish. But the thirty-six do not know they are the chosen ones.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Beijing, a monk collapses in his chamber, dead. A fiery mark&amp;amp;#8212;a tattoo? a burn?&amp;amp;#8212;spreads across his back and down his spine. In Mumbai, a beloved economist, a man who served the poor, dies suddenly. His corpse reveals the same symbol. Similar deaths are reported around the world&amp;amp;#8212;the victims all humanitarians, all with the same death mark. In Venice, an enterprising Italian policeman links the deaths, tracing the evidence. Who is killing good people around the world? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Copenhagen, police are preparing for a world climate summit when they receive the Interpol alert. The task falls to veteran detective Niels Bentzon: Find the &amp;amp;#8220;good people&amp;amp;#8221; of Denmark and warn them. But Bentzon is a man who is trained to see the worst in humanity, not the good. One by one, people are crossed off his list. He senses their secrets and wrongdoings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as Bentzon is ready to give up, he meets Hannah Lund, a brilliant astrophysicist mourning the death of her son and the implosion of her marriage. With Hannah&amp;amp;#8217;s help, Bentzon begins to piece together the puzzle of these far-flung deaths. A pattern emerges. It is, they realize, a perfectly executed plan of murder. There have been thirty-four deaths&amp;amp;#8212;two more to come if the legend is true. According to the pattern, Bentzon and Hannah can predict the time and place of the final two murders. The deaths will occur in Venice and Copenhagen. And the time is now.</description>

  <description>Before Bob Marley brought reggae to the world, before Jimmy Cliff and Peter Tosh, before thousands of musicians played a Jamaican rhythm, there were the men and women who created ska music, a blend of jazz, American rhythm and blues, and the indigenous music of the Caribbean. This book tells the story of ska music and its development from Jamaica to England, where the music took on a distinctively different tone, and finally to the rest of the world. Through the words of legendary artists, gleaned from more than a decade of interviews, the story of ska music is finally told by those who were there.</description>

  <description>Sean McMullen, one of Australia's leading genre writers, took America by storm with his sweeping Greatwinter Trilogy, a post-apocalyptic science fiction tour de force that won over critics and readers alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now McMullen delivers &lt;em&gt;Voyage of the Shadowmoon&lt;/em&gt;, a fantasy epic of daunting skill and scope. The Shadowmoon is a small, unobtrusive wooden schooner whose passengers and crew are much more than they seem: Ferran, the Shadowmoon’s lusty captain who dreams of power; Roval, the warrior-sorcerer; Velander and Terikel, priestesses of a nearly extinct sect; and the chivalrous vampire Laron, who has been trapped in a fourteen-year-old body for seven hundred years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They sail the coast, gathering useful information, passing as simple traders. But when they witness the awful power of Silverdeath, an uncontrollable doomsday weapon of awesome destructiveness, they realize they must act. But every single king, emperor, and despot covets Silverdeath’s power. It will take all of their wits and more than a little luck if they hope to prevent one of these power-hungry fools from destroying the world. Their only advantage? The Shadowmoon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it seems to be little more that a small trading vessel—too small for battle, too fat for speed—it is actually one of the most sophisticated vessels in the world, one that allows them to travel to places where no others would dare. They can only hope it will be enough to save them all before Silverdeath rains destruction across their entire world.</description>

  <description>Relevant and prescient, American Gods has been lauded for its brilliant synthesis of "mystery, satire, sex, horror, and poetic prose" (Michael Dirda, Washington Post Book World) and as a modern phantasmagoria that "distills the essence of America" (Seattle Post-Intelligencer). It is, quite simply, an outstanding work of literary imagination that will endure for generations.</description>

  <description>Battle Royale meets Return of the Living Dead in this post-apocalyptic action adventure Twenty people wake to find themselves in a boarded-up building in the middle of the zombie wasteland. They soon realize they have been chosen as contestants on a popular reality show called Zombie Survival. Each contestant is given a backpack of supplies and a unique weapon. Their goal: be the first to make it through the zombie-plagued city to the pick-up zone alive. But because there's only one seat available on the helicopter, the contestants not only have to fight off the hordes of the living dead, they must also fight each other. Zombies and Shit is Mellick's craziest book to date. A campy, trashy, punk rock gore fest that is as funny as it is brutal, as sad as it is strange. An edge-of-your-seat thrill ride that twists the zombie genre into something you've never seen before.</description>

  <description>The Bitches are back . . . They call themselves the Warriors, their enemies call them the Bitches. They are a gang of man-eating, motorcycle-riding, war-hungry werewolf women, and they are the rulers of the wasteland. Following his 2009 Wonderland Book Award-winning novel, Warrior Wolf Women of the Wasteland, Carlton Mellick III returns with Barbarian Beast Bitches of the Badlands, a collection of three interconnected novellas that take place before, during, and after the events of the first book. Including: BARBARIAN BEAST BABES OF THE BADLANDS Talon and a party of warrior biker women must hunt down a pack of giant wolves that have gone rabid. HORRENDOUS HORROR OF THE HATEFUL HAMBURGLAR A band of mutant soldiers led by the deadly samurai, Hamburglar, investigates an outpost deep in the wasteland that has become plagued by a horde of deranged undead killing machines. FEROCIOUS FEMALE FURRIES IN THE FORBIDDEN ZONE After Talon is infected with a strange mind-killing parasite, Slayer must lead a party of wolf women into the Forbidden Zone in order to find a cure.</description>

  <description>Somewhere in Philadelphia, a master engraver is turning out brilliant forgeries of U.S. currency plates for an organized crime gang - and the government wants to put a stop to it. But how can they get close enough to bring down the criminal enterprise from the inside? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By snatching a west coast crime boss' right-hand man and sending a federal agent undercover in the man's place. His assignment: pose as a buyer of counterfeit bills and try to get the engraver out. Which works fine - until he crosses paths with someone who knows the man he replaced... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lost masterpiece from science fiction Grandmaster Robert Silverberg, published as a complete novel for the very first time!</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Mark Twain meets classic Stephen King--a bold new direction for widely acclaimed Edgar Award winner Joe R. Lansdale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May Lynn was once a pretty girl who dreamed of becoming a Hollywood star. Now she's dead, her body dredged up from the Sabine River.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sue Ellen, May Lynn's strong-willed teenage friend, sets out to dig up May Lynn's body, burn it to ash, and take those ashes to Hollywood to spread around. If May Lynn can't become a star, then at least her ashes will end up in the land of her dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with her friends Terry and Jinx and her alcoholic mother, Sue Ellen steals a raft and heads downriver to carry May Lynn's remains to Hollywood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only problem is, Sue Ellen has some stolen money that her enemies will do anything to get back. And what looks like a prime opportunity to escape from a worthless life will instead lead to disastrous consequences. In the end, Sue Ellen will learn a harsh lesson on just how hard growing up can really be.</description>

  <description>Forget everything you know about life, the world, and all the objects in it. Bradley Sands can bend them to his will with a frightening disregard for reality. You never know who, or what, is lying in wait behind the next comma. Whether it's Super Noxious Air Man and his sidekick, Kid Centrifugal Force, or the next episode of Teddy the Rottweiler Spayer, Sands keeps you off-balance with laughter and astonishment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These stories are crammed with the delightfully odd and the scurrilously silly. From moment to moment My Heart Said No requires the most unexpected, perplexing, and hilarious leaps of faith. But you'll be glad you took this exhilarating jump into uncharted territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There's a place past all reason, most possibility, and all the jokes I can think of. A place shaped kind of like the human heart. Bradley Sands doesn't write about this place, but he writes from it, pushing farther into the unguessable with each word, each scene."&lt;br&gt;—Stephen Graham Jones, author of Demon Theory &amp;amp; It Came From Del Rio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A Bradley Sands story is not like any story you’ve read before… [Sands] discounts reality in a way that renders it obsolete. The book’s strength lies in the way irreverent images are juxtaposed, repeatedly, often rhythmically, creating a sensation that has no use for the traditional confines of literature."&lt;br&gt;—Outsider Writers Collective &amp;amp; Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"There is a disorienting alchemy at work in Bradley Sands' fiction. Here phantasmagoria shifts into stand-up and the avant-garde saddles up besides the geek. Imagine: a hyper-palimpsest beneath which burbles a heady brew of surrealism, poetry, memoir, and horror all set to a DaDa soundtrack that sounds surprisingly like the End of the World."&lt;br&gt;—Rayo Casablanca, author of 6 Sick Hipsters and Very Mercenary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Reading this collection is like ingesting a bag of fun-colored candy, removing your stomach, and then taking it to a party for use as a pinata. Some readers will love these stories, some readers will hate them but, displayed throughout, is a true love of language and a generous dose of creativity." —Andersen Prunty, author of The Beard</description>

  <description>Kevin lives in a small apartment above a porn shop with his tarot-reading cat, Mithra.  He has gotten used to Mithra bringing him things from outside: dead mice, Twinkie wrappers, donut scraps, houseplants, and the occasional rabbit head.  But one day, Mithra brings him an ankle...  a sweaty piece of rubber-latex shaped like a human ankle.   Later, he is brought an eyeball, then a foot.  After more latex body parts are brought upstairs, Kevin decides to glue them together to form a piecemeal sex doll.  But once the last piece is glued into place, the sex doll comes to life.  She says her name is June.  She comes from another world and is on the run from an evil pornographer and three crab-human hybrid assassins.    Piecemeal June is a reality-bending journey into love, sex, death, and a bizarre parallel world of butchered flesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PRAISE FOR JORDAN KRALL:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Krall's writing flows nicely....(and) is an exciting new voice to arrive on the horror scene. He combines gross-out with occultism but never forgets that characters are what makes a story." - &lt;strong&gt;Dark Scribe Magazine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This is as weird as you'd expect from an Eraserhead Press release, but certain scenes are so funny--and our obscure couple so cool--you'll really get lost in the situations and characters to the point all the background strangeness becomes an afterthought." - &lt;strong&gt;The Horror Fiction Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fans of the early works of Clive Barker and the paintings of Salvador Dali will have a lot to appreciate in Piecemeal June's world...This chaotic, well wrought and brilliantly paced caper features something the reader wouldn't expect from either a Bizarro novel or a book that explores the nature of kink and pornography: warmth and tenderness, components that end up making Piecemeal June a sublime balance of sacred profane, grimy, beautiful and sickening that could only be found in a world of gutsy surrealism." - &lt;strong&gt;Withersin Magazine &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Jordan Krall is a bit like Jonathan Lethem meets the Coen Brothers with an H.P. Lovecraft fetish. His tales will quickly grow on you. Read two books and you'll be addicted." - &lt;strong&gt;Carlton Mellick III, author of SATAN BURGER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The plot is well-paced, the characters lovingly fleshed out, all of which add up to a read that's out-and-out fun." - &lt;strong&gt;Whitney Lakin, winner of the World Horror Convention's GROSS OUT CONTEST of 2008.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Click Click Click Click Phillipsport, Maine is a quaint and peaceful seaside village. But when hundreds of creatures pour out of the ocean and attack, its residents must take up arms to drive the beasts back. They are the Clickers, giant venomous blood-thirsty crabs from the depths of the sea. The only warning to their rampage of dismemberment and death is the terrible clicking of their claws. But these monsters aren't merely here to ravage and pillage. They are being driven onto land by fear. Something is hunting the Clickers. Something ancient and without mercy. Deadite Press is proud to present the authors' preferred version of J. F. Gonzalez and Mark Williams' gore-soaked cult classic tribute to the giant monster B-movies of yesteryear. "Miss those glory days of cheap'n'nasty bone-crunching horror? They're back. Clickers will eat you up and spit you out!" - Peter Atkins, screenwriter for Hellraiser II &amp;amp; III and Wishmaster</description>

  <description>"Like a bionic Ralph Bakshi reborn from snorting Orwell's ashes, Kevin Shamel drags cherished childhood fantasies into the gutter of adulthood, and makes you pay dearly to swallow them all over again. Intelligence is a universal disease, but never fear... Rotten Little Animals just may be the cure we've been praying for." - Cody Goodfellow, author of Radiant Dawn and Silent Weapons For Quiet Wars. "Looney Tunes amped up on cocaine, sex and soft, silky fur and feathers. Shamel's debut is wildly entertaining and destined to become an instant bizarro classic." - Gina Ranalli "This book has three of my favorites things: Kittens, Zombies, and Snuff Films." - Jeff Burk "It begins as a zombie film, transforms into a deranged puppet show, and ends with a car chase. If you ever wondered what a Pixar exploitation film would be like, you need Rotten Little Animals." - Cameron Pierce "Written with the humor of Adult Swim, but with enough psychological profundity to matter. Shamel is a bright motherfucker!" - Forrest Armstrong Animals are people too! And that is messed up. So they have independent cinema. See what happens when an animal film crew kidnap a human boy and make a movie of the abduction. Read things about Nature that just aren't natural. Fear your pets from this day forward. With zombie-cat attacks, gun-blasting massacres, drugged-out puppet shows, exploding car chases, camera-chickens, bat acrobats, wild sex, martini parties and torture-ROTTEN LITTLE ANIMALS is a crazy ride through the underground animal film scene and on to the Big Time.</description>

  <description>Joe LaBrava first fell in love in a darkened movie theater when he was twelve -- with a gorgeous femme fatale up on the screen. Now the one-time Secret Service agent-turned-photographer is finally meeting his dream woman in the flesh, albeit in a rundown Miami crisis center. When she's cleaned up and sober, though, former movie queen Jean Shaw still makes LaBrava's heart race. And now she's being terrorized by a redneck thug and his slimy &lt;em&gt;marielito&lt;/em&gt; partner, which gives Joe a golden opportunity to play the hero. But the lady's predicament is starting to resemble one of her earlier cinematic &lt;em&gt;noirs.&lt;/em&gt; And if he's not careful, LaBrava could end up the patsy -- or dead -- in the final reel.</description>

  <description>Furries-you know, people in animal costumes. You may love them. You may hate them. But chances are, you have not considered eating them...until now! Not since the early days of Monty Python has dark satire so subversive reared its ugly head! From the Hellmouth of the Heartland, Nicole Cushing brings you How To Eat Fried Furries-your guide on how to raise furries as livestock and cook 'em up tender and tasty. The cast of characters is as motley and grotesque as one would imagine given such a premise. There's the misshapen, proto-furry cast of the '70s action-adventure show, Ferret Force Five. Extraterrestrial Squirrels. The Amish and the even more despicable Pseudo-Amish. Whether an avid Bizarro fan or a newcomer to this wave of weird fiction, you're bound to be satisfied once you take a bite out of How To Eat Fried Furries.</description>

  <description>Reborn as an oozing humanoid composed of vitreous humor after a sudden death via a disembodied hand and a wood chipper, Gary Olstrom found no difficulty in saying goodbye to the life he once knew. After all, he had become quite adept at saying goodbye, to his right arm in a hardware store accident at eight, to his parents in a fiery car crash, to his right leg in a factory mishap, and to the only person who ever tried to help him in an untimely bus collision. What he never prepared for was saying goodbye to misfortune, until he found Uncle Sam's Carnival of Copulating Inanimals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therein, Gary finds refuge training furniture to copulate before spectators who vomit in applause. But while Gary's luck shifts for the better, cities left in the wake of the carnival's visits disappear; many are murdered. With his pet desk Akimbo and his empty-socketed girlfriend-turned-futon, Liberty, Gary attempts to unravel this mystery, culminating in a re-imagining of America to rival that of Benedict Anderson's! Well, not quite...but there is furniture porn.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;The alien's four-step plan to conquer our planet included the attack of minivan-sized griffin-like dragons and the destruction of all humankind. Into that ominous sounding onslaught wanders a trio of earthly survivors who don't seem to take anything too seriously. Writer Christopher Moore and artist Ian Corson have created a graphic novel that could probably keep even its bad guys laughing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>A bizarro tribute to Spaghetti westerns, H.P. Lovecraft, and foot fetish enthusiasts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Screwhorse, Nevada is legendary for its violent and unusual pleasures, but when a mysterious gunslinger drags a wooden donkey into the desert town, the stage is set for a bloodbath unlike anything the west has ever seen. His name is Calamaro, and he's from New Jersey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring Cthulhu-worshipping Indians, a woman with four feet, a Giallo-esque serial killer, a crazed gunman who is obsessed with sucking on candy, Syphilis-ridden mutants, ass juice, burping pistols, sexually transmitted tattoos, and a house devoted to the freakiest fetishes, Jordan Krall's Fistful of Feet is the weirdest western ever written.</description>

  <description>At first, only a few things are known about the celestial object that astronomers dub Rama. It is huge, weighing more than ten trillion tons. And it is hurtling through the solar system at an inconceivable speed. Then a space probe confirms the unthinkable: Rama is no natural object. It is, incredibly, an interstellar spacecraft. Space explorers and planet-bound scientists alike prepare for mankind's first encounter with alien intelligence. It will kindle their wildest dreams... and fan their darkest fears. For no one knows who the Ramans are or why they have come. And now the moment of rendezvous awaits — just behind a Raman airlock door.</description>

  <description>Davy is set in the far future of our world, in the fourth century after the collapse of what we describe as the twentieth-century civilisation. In a land turned upside-down and backwards by the results of scientific unwisdom, Davy and his fellow Ramblers are carefree outcasts, whose bawdy, joyous adventures among the dead ashes of Old-Time culture make a novel which has been hailed as "a frightening, ribald, poignant look at the imaginary future," as "this chilling and fascinating book," as "superb entertainment - unique," as "so unusual as the make it both refreshing and thought provoking."</description>

  <description>Billy Gillespie wakes up one morning to discover his junk is gone. In its place is his wife's junk. Billy is now Tina, and Tina is dead. That's because Billy's dead. His lifeless body is still in bed and empty beer bottles and a container of antifreeze litter the kitchen counter. Over the next 24 hours, Billy and an odd assortment of neighbors, all experiencing their own bouts of body switcheroo, try to figure out what happened and why. Can they do it before the Feds find Billy's body? Was it aliens that caused this, or God, or the government? And did Edgar Winter really sleep with his sheep? Pro football Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw has those answers in a story that asks, What Would Kirk Cameron Do?</description>

  <description>In &lt;em&gt;The Wind Through the Keyhole&lt;/em&gt;, Stephen King returns to the rich landscape of Mid-World, the spectacular territory of the Dark Tower fantasy saga that stands as his most beguiling achievement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roland Deschain and his ka-tet&lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;Jake, Susannah, Eddie, and Oy, the billy-bumbler&amp;amp;#8212;encounter a ferocious storm just after crossing the River Whye on their way to the Outer Baronies. As they shelter from the howling gale, Roland tells his friends not just one strange story but two . . . and in so doing, casts new light on his own troubled past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his early days as a gunslinger, in the guilt-ridden year following his mother&amp;amp;#8217;s death, Roland is sent by his father to investigate evidence of a murderous shape-shifter, a &amp;amp;#8220;skin-man&amp;amp;#8221; preying upon the population around Debaria. Roland takes charge of Bill Streeter, the brave but terrified boy who is the sole surviving witness to the beast&amp;amp;#8217;s most recent slaughter. Only a teenager himself, Roland calms the boy and prepares him for the following day&amp;amp;#8217;s trials by reciting a story from the &lt;em&gt;Magic Tales of the Eld &lt;/em&gt;that his mother often read to him at bedtime. &amp;amp;#8220;A person&amp;amp;#8217;s never too old for stories,&amp;amp;#8221; Roland says to Bill. &amp;amp;#8220;Man and boy, girl and woman, never too old. We live for them.&amp;amp;#8221; And indeed, the tale that Roland unfolds, the legend of Tim Stoutheart, is a timeless treasure for all ages, a story that lives for us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;King began the Dark Tower series in 1974; it gained momentum in the 1980s; and he brought it to a thrilling conclusion when the last three novels were published in 2003 and 2004. &lt;em&gt;The Wind Through the Keyhole &lt;/em&gt;is sure to fascinate avid fans of the Dark Tower epic. But this novel also stands on its own for all readers, an enchanting and haunting journey to Roland&amp;amp;#8217;s world and testimony to the power of Stephen King&amp;amp;#8217;s storytelling magic.</description>

  <description>The United States is near total collapse. But 87% of the population doesn't care: they're addicted to flashback, a drug that allows its users to re-experience the best moments of their lives. After ex-detective Nick Bottom's wife died in a car accident, he went under the flash to be with her; he's lost his job, his teenage son, and his livelihood as a result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick may be a lost soul but he's still a good cop, so he is hired to investigate the murder of a top governmental advisor's son. This flashback-addict becomes the one man who may be able to change the course of an entire nation turning away from the future to live in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A provocative novel set in a future that seems scarily possible, FLASHBACK proves why Dan Simmons is one of our most exciting and versatile writers.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A twisting debut novel of murder and dark family secrets from a riveting new voice in crime fiction. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A murdered woman. A grieving husband. And their son-a mentally handicapped adult with a history of violent outbursts. A very simple case. Or is it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Leo Hewitt, an Assistant DA once blamed for setting free a notorious child-killer, is eager to redeem himself with this intimate and grisly crime. As he digs below the surface he discovers more than he ever anticipated-including an emotionally disturbed wife, a husband who'd do anything to escape his disastrous marriage, and an accused young man with no apparent means of defense. But with each shocking new revelation, Leo is only led deeper and deeper into the darkness-an inescapable trap of blood bonds and twisted family secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>In his fourth and hardest-hitting novel, Andrew Vachss once again plunges into the labyrinthine New York City underworld that ex-con turned troubleshooter known as Burke calls home. Burke must get a high-paid call girl's teenage daughter out of a commune that exploits rather than saves--a twisted cult that turns warm young flesh into cold hard cash. After he finds he's been set up, Burke retaliates, but he'll have justice served his way.</description>

  <description>BECAUSE HOMICIDE&lt;br&gt;BEGINS AT HOME&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the enigmatic hit man called Quarry had to start somewhere. And for him that was the day he returned stateside from Nam to find his young wife cheating. He’d killed plenty overseas, so killing her lover was no big deal. And when he was recruited to use his skills as a contract killer, that transition was easy, too. He survived in this jungle as he had in that other one—by expecting trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he didn't expect was ever running into her again...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    * First publication ever!&lt;br&gt;    * By the bestselling author of ROAD TO PERDITION&lt;br&gt;    * Quarry is the star of eight previous novels and the award-winning feature film "The Last Lullaby"</description>

  <description>Beverly Thompson has been kidnapped and brutalized, but she refuses to be a passive victim.  She will never stop fighting the unknown man who's keeping her prisoner.  And she will never give up hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the attractive attorney was snatched from her home, her husband was callously shot to death with the same gun used to kill an elderly woman two days earlier.  Since then, four more victims have been murdered with the same weapon.  Now Phoenix homicide detective Sean Richardson must somehow stop an elusive killer with few clues to work on and no idea where the madman will strike next.  Until he can find him, Beverly Thompson will be left to struggle against ever-dwindling odds, battling desperately to survive long enough to see her husband's murderer brought to justice.</description>

  <description>Acclaimed writer and editor Robert Silverberg gathered eleven of the finest writers in Fantasy to contribute to this collection of short novels. Each of the writers was asked to write a new story based on one of his or her most famous series: from Stephen King's opening piece set in his popular Gunslinger universe to Robert Jordan's early look at his famed Wheel of Time saga, these stories are exceptionally well written and universally well told. The authors include King, Jordan, and Silverberg himself, as well as Terry and Lyn Pratchett, Terry Goodkind, Orson Scott Card, Ursula K. Le Guin, Tad Williams, George R.R. Martin, Anne McCaffrey, and Raymond E. Feist.</description>

  <description>"Classy" Freddie Blassie was universally acknowledged as one of the most hated heels in wrestling history. Freddie really knew how to antagonize the fans -- how to "get heat." Death threats were frequent, enraged fans stabbed him twenty-one times, and he was even doused with acid. Undeterred, Blassie just took the action up a level. He reveled in being the heel. It was commonplace to see him biting his opponents and then spitting out their blood. Blassie would routinely "file" his teeth during interviews. His matches in Los Angeles' Olympic Stadium brought him to the attention of Hollywood. Freddie's style and unpredictability made him a natural for the medium, and he became one of the biggest draws in the wrestling business. In the early '60s, he was invited to wrestle in Japan. Blassie both horrified and mesmerized sedate Japanese society. &lt;br&gt; At seventeen, Freddie made his wrestling debut in a carnival. Unhappy with his choice of occupation, his family persuaded him to get a "real" job, and for a while he worked as a meatcutter. But after serving in the Navy in World War II, Freddie returned to wrestling. Here he picked up his catch phrase: "pencil neck geek." &lt;br&gt; Early in his career, Blassie wrestled for Jess McMahon, and would later work for both his son, Vincent James McMahon, and his grandson, Vincent Kennedy McMahon, the current owner of World Wrestling Entertainment. &amp;amp;#153; When his days in the ring ended, "Classy" Freddie Blassie became the manager of heels, transferring to a whole new generation of wrestlers the style, moves, and ring knowledge that had made him a legend of wrestling. &lt;br&gt; Released just prior to his death, &lt;em&gt;Legends of Wrestling: "Classy" Freddie Blassie&lt;/em&gt; contains vibrant tales of his days in wrestling with the likes of Hulk Hogan, Killer Kowalski, and the Iron Sheik. He frankly chronicles his dealings with the wrestling fraternity and the promoters, even recounting the infamous "boxer vs. wrestler" match with Muhammad Ali, who was managed by Blassie. &lt;br&gt; His out-of-the-ring stories are equally compelling. Freddie details his countless sexual exploits, and his three marriages. He reflects on the cult status that he gained after his song "Pencil Neck Geek" rocketed to the top of the Dr. Demento Show play list. He recounts his touching relationship with comedian Andy Kaufman, who cast him in &lt;em&gt;Breakfast with Blassie&lt;/em&gt; -- an underground classic in which Blassie uttered: "What the hell ever happened to the human race?" &lt;br&gt; Added to this edition is an epilogue, recounting Freddie's last days and his unforgettable funeral.</description>

  <description>A true legend, Harley Race has enjoyed almost unparalleled success in the world of professional wrestling. Having turned pro in 1959 at the age of 15, his work ethic and innovative style allowed him to become one of the three biggest names in wrestling during the 1970s and early '80s. He won the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) championship on eight occasions and was dubbed World Wrestling Entertainment's first "King of the Ring" in 1986. In the autobiography King of the Ring. Harley Race tells his incredible life story for the first time. In addition to his legendary ring career, Harley Race also became a successful promoter in the Midwest during the mid '80s with a wrestling organization seen on 13 television stations covering five states. Although injuries and a car accident in 1995 effectively ended his wrestling career, he decided to give back to the sport he loved. Race opened the World League Wrestling (WLW) organization in 1999.</description>

  <description>The historians can’t seem to settle whether to call this one "The Third Space War" (or the fourth), or whether "The First Interstellar War" fits it better. We just call it “The Bug War." Everything up to then and still later were "incidents," "patrols," or "police actions." However, you are just as dead if you buy the farm in an "incident" as you are if you buy it in a declared war...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In one of Robert A. Heinlein’s most controversial bestsellers, a recruit of the future goes through the toughest boot camp in the Universe—and into battle with the Terran Mobile Infantry against mankind’s most alarming enemy.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Spencer had gone to London--and not to look at the Queen. He'd gone to track down a bunch of bombers who'd blown his client's wife and kids away. His job was to catch them. Or kill them. His client wasn't choosy.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The military sci-fi classic in a striking new package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Felix is an Earth soldier, encased in special body armor designed to withstand Earth's most implacable enemy-a bioengineered, insectoid alien horde. But Felix is also equipped with internal mechanisms that enable him, and his fellow soldiers, to survive battle situations that would destroy a man's mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a remarkable novel of the horror, the courage, and the aftermath of combat-and how the strength of the human spirit can be the greatest armor of all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Most of the big money belongs to Torquil Paterson Frisby, the dyspeptic American millionaire - but that doesn't stop him wanting more out of it. His niece, the beautiful Ann Moon, is engaged to 'Biscuit', Lord Biskerton, who doesn't have very much of the stuff and so he has to escape to Valley Fields to hide from his creditors. Meanwhile, his old schoolfriend Berry Conway, who is working for Frisby, himself falls for Ann - just as Biscuit falls for her friend Kitchie Valentine. In this typically hilarious novel by the master of light comedy, life can sometimes become a little complicated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and Berry has been left a lot of shares in the Dream Come True copper mine. Of course they're worthless... aren't they?</description>

  <description>History is . . . &lt;br&gt;(a) more or less bunk.&lt;br&gt;(b) a nightmare from which I am trying to awaken.&lt;br&gt;(c) as thoroughly infected with lies as a street whore with syphilis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Match your answers:&lt;br&gt;(1) Stephen Daedalus of James Joyce's Ulysses&lt;br&gt;(2) Henry Ford&lt;br&gt;(3) Arthur Schopenhauer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It turns out that answer need not be bunk, nightmarish, or diseased. In the hands of mental_floss, history's most interesting bits have been handpicked and roasted to perfection. Packed with little-known stories and outrageous—but accurate—facts, you'll laugh yourself smarter on this joyride through 60,000 years of human civilization. Remember: just because it's true, doesn't mean it's boring!</description>

  <description>New York is sweltering in the summer heat, and Harlem is close to the boiling point. To Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, at times it seems as if the whole world has gone mad. Trying, as always, to keep some kind of peace-their legendary nickel-plated Colts very much in evidence-Coffin Ed and Grave Digger find themselves pursuing two completely different cases through a maze of knifings, beatings, and riots that threaten to tear Harlem apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The word is out on the street, and the hopheads and whores and flimflam artists are running scared: Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones are back in print."-- Newsweek</description>

  <description>Readers of Jeremy C. Shipp’s fiction will be familiar with his minimalist, breakneck pacing, his surreal forays into political satire, and his seamless blending of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Now, in his fourth book, the Bram Stoker Award finalist expands on what many critics and fans alike have long considered the most compelling aspect of his work—relationships. This story collection explores how a person’s desire can infect their every action and interaction with others. The desire to protect. The desire to hurt. The desire to be desired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fungus of the Heart explores what happens between people when society breaks down and the rules go out the window. Haunting and heartbreaking, pithy and potent, the quirky inhabitants of Shipp’s bizarro world will carve an indelible line from your funnybone to your spleen to your emotional core..+-</description>

      <![CDATA[Once again, I wrestle with the dilemma of trying to review a collection of short stories.  Should I talk about The Sun Never Rises in the Big City, a bizzaro detective story about a detective and the search for the killer of his rag?

  <description>1942: Boldly advancing through Asia, the Japanese need a train route from Burma going north. In a prison camp, British POWs are forced into labor. The bridge they build will become a symbol of service and survival to one prisoner, Colonel Nicholson, a proud perfectionist. Pitted against the warden, Colonel Saito, Nicholson will nevertheless, out of a distorted sense of duty, aid his enemy. While on the outside, as the Allies race to destroy the bridge, Nicholson must decide which will be the first casualty: his patriotism or his pride.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A heart-wrenching, powerfully written novel that could do for Palestine what &lt;em&gt;The Kite Runner &lt;/em&gt;did for Afghanistan. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Forcibly removed from the ancient village of Ein Hod by the newly formed state of Israel in 1948, the Abulhejas are moved into the Jenin refugee camp. There, exiled from his beloved olive groves, the family patriarch languishes of a broken heart, his eldest son fathers a family and falls victim to an Israeli bullet, and his grandchildren struggle against tragedy toward freedom, peace, and home. This is the Palestinian story, told as never before, through four generations of a single family. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The very precariousness of existence in the camps quickens life itself. Amal, the patriarch's bright granddaughter, feels this with certainty when she discovers the joys of young friendship and first love and especially when she loses her adored father, who read to her daily as a young girl in the quiet of the early dawn. Through Amal we get the stories of her twin brothers, one who is kidnapped by an Israeli soldier and raised Jewish; the other who sacrifices everything for the Palestinian cause. Amal’s own dramatic story threads between the major Palestinian-Israeli clashes of three decades; it is one of love and loss, of childhood, marriage, and parenthood, and finally of the need to share her history with her daughter, to preserve the greatest love she has. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Previously published in a hardcover edition with a limited run under the title &lt;em&gt;The Scar of David&lt;/em&gt;, this powerful novel is now available in a fully revised, newly titled paperback edition. The deep and moving humanity of &lt;em&gt;Mornings in Jenin &lt;/em&gt;forces us to take a fresh look at one of the defining political conflicts of our lifetimes.</description>

  <description>Hyenas marks the always-welcome return of Joe R. Lansdale’s most indelible fictional creations: Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. Once again, the embattled but resilient duo find themselves enmeshed in a web of danger, duplicity, and escalating mayhem. The result is a tightly compressed novella that is at once harrowing, hilarious, and utterly impossible to put down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story begins with a barroom brawl that is both brutal and oddly comic. The ensuing drama encompasses abduction, betrayal, robbery, and murder, ending with a lethal confrontation in an East Texas pasture. Along the way, readers are treated to moments of raucous, casually profane humor and to scenes of vivid, crisply described violence, all related in that unmistakable Lansdale voice. An essential addition to an already imposing body of work, Hyenas shows us both the author and his signature characters at their inimitable best. It doesn’t get better than this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hyenas also includes the bonus Hap Collins short story, “The Boy Who Became Invisible”.</description>

  <description>Michael Moorcock's &lt;em&gt;Sojan The Swordsman&lt;/em&gt; revisits the author's very first published character, the original incarnation of the Eternal Champion. Rewritten and expanded from its original appearance in Moorcock's self-published &lt;em&gt;Tarzan Adventures&lt;/em&gt; fanzine, this tale of swordplay, airships, and bizarre landscapes sees the hero Sojan and his beloved Princess Noothar encountering strange races of men and even stranger monsters in a fast-paced adventure in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Leigh Brackett.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe R. Lansdale's &lt;em&gt;Under the Warrior Star&lt;/em&gt; is the tale of Brax Hooker, a freelance journalist whose world travels in search of adventure lead him to a secret laboratory in the Rocky Mountains where a rogue scientist is attempting to create a universe in miniature. Having come to believe his life has lost meaning, Brax agrees to be the first traveler into this new Universe, venturing into a forest world of strange plants, weird creatures, and deadly warriors. There Brax leads a life of adventure, discovering danger, a ton of surprises, and the love of his life under the hazy blue light of an alien sun.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nostradamus he isn't; but award-winning journalist Pete Hamill's 1983 pulp noir classic, &lt;em&gt;The Guns of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; -- reissued with new cover art by Hard Case Crime -- has disturbing similarities to the events of 9/11. American reporter Sam Briscoe, after visiting relatives in Northern Ireland and inadvertently getting involved in an international IRA gun-smuggling plot, must deal with a group of sadistic terrorists who have not only kidnapped his daughter but also have plans on blowing up a historic Manhattan landmark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While visiting his 72-year-old uncle -- a staunch IRA supporter -- in Northern Ireland, Briscoe gets the once-in-a-lifetime chance to talk face to face with an enigmatic IRA leader known only as Commander Steel. In return for the exclusive interview, Briscoe agrees to deliver an envelope to an Irish tavern owner in Queens upon his return to the States. But shortly after Briscoe hands over the envelope to its intended recipient, Irish-born Jack McDaid, McDaid and his bar are blown to smithereens by a bomb; and Briscoe becomes entangled in a bloody conflict that could mean the death of him, his daughter, four prominent Irish-American politicians, and thousands of innocents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As with every Hard Case Crime release since the imprint's 2004 inception, &lt;em&gt;The Guns of Heaven&lt;/em&gt; is an utterly readable and thoroughly enjoyable pulp noir gem. As timely as it is timeless, this unearthed crime fiction classic featuring hard-nosed reporter Sam Briscoe will enthrall, enlighten, and, above all else, entertain. &lt;em&gt;Paul Goat Allen&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Mystery fans in search of pure, unadulterated pulp noir should look no further than Donald Hamilton's 1954 &lt;em&gt;Night Walker,&lt;/em&gt; a classic whodunit that is being reissued by Hard Case Crime for the first time in more than 30 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Young is a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve, returning to active duty. On his way to Norfolk Naval Base in the middle of the night, Young hitches a ride with Lawrence Wilson, an ill-tempered man who explains how he was recently fired from the Navy Department for alleged seditious activities. Young is suddenly attacked by the stranger and loses consciousness. When he awakens, he is laying in a hospital bed with his head wrapped in bandages. The nurse calls him "Mr. Wilson" and informs him that he is lucky to be alive after such a horrific car accident. Things get even stranger when his supposed wife -- a brunette bombshell named Elizabeth -- checks the still-sedated Young out of the hospital and takes him home. Without even realizing it, Young becomes the main target of a killer -- or killers -- involved in an intricate Communist plot that threatens the security of the nation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a testament to Hamilton's narrative brilliance that &lt;em&gt;Night Walker&lt;/em&gt; is just as wildly compelling today as it was when it was originally released in 1954. This timeless pulp classic has it all: down-and-dirty fall guys, sexy damsels in distress, sadistic villains, elaborate conspiracies -- an absolute must-read for any and all discerning connoisseurs of mystery. &lt;em&gt;Paul Goat Allen&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Six years ago Peter Mallory quit the Florida Mob and never looked back. He took his hard earned money and set himself up in a fishing shop on the Florida coast. Met a girl and got engaged. Now someone is gunning for his old boss and Peter is the only one who can find out who it is and why they are doing it before it's too late for his former mob boss.&lt;br&gt; It's a pretty basic plot, but the book is written so visually. You can see what Farris wanted the movie to look like even if they never made the movie. The characters are well rounded for an old pulp novel and the suspense that Farris generates makes this one of those impossible to put down books.</description>

  <description>Brad Thor, master of suspense and #1 "New York Times "bestselling author is back with his highest-voltage thriller to date in which Navy SEAL turned covert Homeland Security operative Scot Harvath must race to locate an ancient secret that has the power to stop militant Islam dead in its tracks. &lt;br&gt;June 632 A.D.: Deep within the Uranah Valley of Mount Arafat in Mecca, the Prophet Mohammed shares with his closest companions a final and startling revelation. Within days, he is assassinated. &lt;br&gt;September 1789: U.S. Minister to France Thomas Jefferson, who is charged with forging a truce with the violent Muslim pirates of the Barbary Coast, makes a shocking discovery--one that could forever impact the world's relationship with Islam. &lt;br&gt;Present day: When a car bomb explodes outside a Parisian cafe, Scot Harvath is thrust back into the life he has tried so desperately to leave behind. Saving the intended victim of the attack, Harvath becomes party to a perilous race to uncover a secret so powerful that militant Islam could be defeated once and for all. But as desperate as the American government is to have the information brought to light, there are powerful forces determined that Mohammed's mysterious final revelation continue to remain hidden forever. &lt;br&gt;What Jason Bourne was to the Cold War, Scot Harvath is to the War on Terror. In "The Last Patriot," readers will be engrossed as Harvath once again takes them on a whirlwind tour through international cities and nail-biting suspense where the stakes are higher than they have ever been before.</description>

  <description>The Third in a Series of ibooks Reissues of Mysteries by Multi-Award-Winning Author, LAWRENCE BLOCK! It was a perfect setting for a honeymoon -- a charming little cabin in the isolated Pennsylvania woods. It should have been the perfect beginning to a long and happy marriage. Then five shots rang out in the quiet woods and shattered Dave and Jill Wade's perfect honeymoon. Terror had come crashing through their cabin door, snuffing out all thoughts of love. Now all that Dave and Jill Wade felt was haste -- hate and the overwhelming desire for revenge.</description>

  <description>Thor has broken the sword Tyrfing so that it cannot strike at the roots of Yggdrasil, the tree that binds together earth, heaven and hell. But now the mighty sword is needed again to save the elves in their war against the trolls, and only Scafloc, a human child kidnapped and raised by the elves, can hope to persuade Bolverk the ice-giant to make Tyrfing whole again. But Scafloc must also confront his shadow self, Valgard, the changeling who has taken his place in the world of men.</description>

  <description>The Gnostic Gospels is a landmark study of the long-buried roots of Christianity, a work of luminous scholarship and wide popular appeal. First published in 1979 to critical acclaim, winning the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, The Gnostic Gospels has continued to grow in reputation and influence over the past two decades. It is now widely recognized as one of the most brilliant and accessible histories of early Christian spirituality published in our time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1945 an Egyptian peasant unearthed what proved to be the Gnostic Gospels, thirteen papyrus volumes that expounded a radically different view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ from that of the New Testament. In this spellbinding book, renowned religious scholar Elaine Pagels elucidates the mysteries and meanings of these sacred texts both in the world of the first Christians and in the context of Christianity today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With insight and passion, Pagels explores a remarkable range of recently discovered gospels, including the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, to show how a variety of “Christianities” emerged at a time of extraordinary spiritual upheaval. Some Christians questioned the need for clergy and church doctrine, and taught that the divine could be discovered through spiritual search. Many others, like Buddhists and Hindus, sought enlightenment — and access to God — within. Such explorations raised questions: Was the resurrection to be understood symbolically and not literally? Was God to be envisioned only in masculine form, or feminine as well? Was martyrdom a necessary — or worthy — expression of faith? These early Christians dared to ask questions that orthodox Christians later suppressed — and their explorations led to profoundly different visions of Jesus and his message. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brilliant, provocative, and stunning in its implications, The Gnostic Gospels is a radical, eloquent reconsideration of the origins of the Christian faith.</description>

  <description>Paul Hoffman's novel of astonishing scope and imagination, featuring a darkly gifted teenage boy at the center of a brutal holy war, grabs the reader from its incredible opening lines and refuses to let go. &lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of God&lt;/em&gt; is the first novel in an epic, ambitious trilogy that will prove irresistible to the readers who have turned the Inheritance Cycle, &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/em&gt; series into publishing phenomena. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Left Hand of God&lt;/em&gt; is the story of sixteen-year-old Thomas Cale, who has grown up imprisoned at the Sanctuary of the Redeemers, a fortress run by a secretive sect of warrior monks in a distant, dystopian past. He is one of thousands of boys who train all day in hand-to-hand combat, in preparation for a holy war that only the High Priests know is now imminent. He has no reason to think he's special, no idea there's another world outside the compound's walls, and no hope for a life any different from the one he already knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; And then, Cale opens a door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What follows is a daring escape, an unlikely alliance, a desperate pursuit, a journey of incredible discovery, and an adventure the likes of which Cale could never possibly have imagined, culminating in Cale's astonishing realization that he alone has the power to save his world- or to destroy it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Watch a Video</description>

  <description>The police think yuppie lawyer Glenn Holtzmann was randomly blown away by a deranged derelict. The accused's brother thinks otherwise-and hires Matt Scudder to prove the crazed Vietnam vet innocent. But Scudder's investigation is leading the tormented p.i. into the darkest corners of his own soul. And it threatens to destory everything he believes in... and everyone he loves.</description>

  <description>Wandering tribes of primitive humans meet and fight and love and die. When one tribe meets another, individuals fight inside a Battle Circle. The loser must become a member of the victorious tribe. Each warrior is named by his weapon. When Sol the Sword is bested by Sol of All Weapons, he loses his tribe, his name, and his weapon. Re-named Sos the Rope, he joins with Sol of All Weapons to try to create something greater than a world of Battle Circles. An early classic from Piers Anthony, creator of the legendary Xanth series, Sos the Rope was nominated for the prestigious Hugo Award.</description>

  <description>Like many Southern California millionaires, Ralph Sampson keeps odd company. There's the sun-worshipping holy man whom Sampson once gave his very own mountain; the fading actress with sidelines in astrology and S&amp;amp;M. Now one of Sampson's friends may have arranged his kidnapping. As Lew Archer follows the clues from the canyon sanctuaries of the megarich to jazz joints where you get beaten up between sets, The Moving Target blends sex, greed, and family hatred into an explosively readable crime novel.</description>

  <description>A corrupt African colonel has converted half his country's wealth into diamonds and smuggled them to a Manhattan safe house. Four upstanding citizens plan to rescue their new nation by stealing the diamonds back—with the help of a “specialist”—Parker, that is. He has the best references in town. Will Parker break his rule against working with amateurs and help them because his woman would be disappointed if he doesn’t? Or because three hired morons have threatened to kill him and his woman if he does? They thought they were buying an advantage, but what they get is a predated death certificate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Crime fiction stripped down—as it was meant to be. . . . Oh, how the pages keep turning.”—&lt;em&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Inquirer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Old master that he is, Stark does all of them one better.”—&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sometimes mystery master Donald E. Westlake is the author of uproarious crime capers. Sometimes he has a mean streak-and its name is Parker. From his noir classic &lt;em&gt;The Man with the Getaway Face&lt;/em&gt; to his recent novel &lt;em&gt;Nobody Runs Forever&lt;/em&gt;, whenever Westlake writes as Stark, he lets Parker run loose-a ruthless criminal in a world of vulnerable "straights." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a sunny October afternoon a man is running up a hill. He's not dressed for running. Below him are barking police dogs and waiting up ahead is a stranger-with a rifle, a life full of regrets, and a parrot at home who will mutely witness just how much trouble the runner, Parker, can bring into an ordinary life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rabbit hunter is Tom Lindahl, a small-town lonely heart nursing a big-time grudge against the racetrack that fired him. He knows from the moment he sees Parker that he's met a professional thief-and a man with murder in his blood. Rescuing Parker from the chase hounds, Lindahl invites the fugitive into his secluded home. He plans to rip off his former employer and exact a deadly measure of revenge-if he can get Parker to help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tom doesn't know Parker and that the desperate criminal will do anything to survive-no matter who has to die...</description>

  <description>Parker put down the body and answered the phone. And from that moment on he had two jobs to do. One was to rob a remote Montana lodge where a dot-com billionaire hid stolen art treasures in his basement. The other was to find out why a hit man had come to his home -- and who had sent him.

  <description>The frighteningly prolific mystery writer Donald E. Westlake, a.k.a. Richard Stark, ended his legendary series of books about a career criminal known only as Parker with 1974's &lt;em&gt;Butcher's Moon&lt;/em&gt;. He cited too much competition from copycats in print, on film, and on television. Persuaded by fans and family, Westlake has resurrected Parker with a welcome burst of energy and imagination. The felon and his long-time lady friend Claire are enjoying the quiet life in their New Jersey lakeside home when Parker's invited to become part of a plan to remove a large sum of cash from a glossy TV-preacher named William Archibald. It's a heist that goes wrong from the start and turns into a tense, chaotic ballet of betrayal and death. One of Parker's partners is a weak babbler, another a cold traitor. Archibald's security chief is a tenacious pursuer, intent on retrieving his employer's money. Along the way, we learn how to hide crooks, cars, and cash in a small city with an efficient police force; how to escape from a variety of traps and sealed rooms; and most of all how Parker has managed to stay alive--in readers' minds as well as in the brain of his creator--for all these years.  </description>

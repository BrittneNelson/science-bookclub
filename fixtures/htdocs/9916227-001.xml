  <description>Their love had the power of a runaway freight train, and the potential to be just as destructive. &lt;br&gt;The tempestuous sequel to Bad Things picks up where the first book left off. Reeling from a profound loss, Tristan and Danika struggle to pick up the pieces and build a life together, but the hard habits of a lifetime are not so easy to escape. &lt;br&gt;Rock Bottom takes us on a dual point of view journey through addiction and desire, through love and agony, and answers the question we’ve been asking since these characters were introduced in Grounded: “What happened between Tristan and Danika?” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DANIKA &lt;br&gt;Even love couldn’t cushion a fall like ours. My love for Tristan was so big that I felt consumed by it, and even so, it was not enough to overpower our combined demons. &lt;br&gt;I struggled. I yelled and screamed. I scratched and kicked. &lt;br&gt;I fought like hell, but even the most determined fighters have to stop before they break. &lt;br&gt;No one could say I didn’t fight for him. &lt;br&gt;“I love you,” I spoke softly into his ear. &lt;br&gt;He gripped me harder. “I can’t ever lose you, Danika. I’m not sure I’d survive it.” &lt;br&gt;“You’ve got me. And I’m not going anywhere. Not ever.” &lt;br&gt;I meant the words when I said them, but life had other plans for us. &lt;br&gt;I’d have given my life for that fight. In fact, I very nearly did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRISTAN &lt;br&gt;She was the one. &lt;br&gt;If I’d ever had a doubt, I didn’t now. She was the one I’d be thinking about, longing for, until I took my last breath. If I lost her tomorrow, I’d pine for her like a lovesick fool. &lt;br&gt;This was the kind of love that only hit you once in your life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for readers 18 and up.</description>

  <description>Arrive at work at 7:58 A.M. sharp. Check. Count forty-seven steps to cubicle. Check. Arrange pens in their red-blue-black-green-purple order of importance. Check. Apply hand sanitizer before opening email. Double check.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that’s just the first few minutes of her work day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thirty-one-year-old proofreader Bailey Mitchell is a slave to her tics. She inherited Obsessive Compulsive Disorder from her father, and it’s done nothing but inhibit her love life. She’s run the gamut of boyfriends—none of them willing or able to cope with her condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter 32-year-old Reece Powell, her new coworker at Beach Elite Marketing Firm. He’s more than willing to cope. He finds her habits cute and quirky . . . for now. Reece wins her over, and life coasts along for them until Bailey experiences a devastating blow. Tragedy exacerbates her OCD, and Reece realizes her tics aren’t so cute and quirky anymore. Just like all the others, he has the choice to leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Reece isn’t like all the others.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note:  Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00AZZDKFW.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother’s house one afternoon doesn’t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she’s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse—she doesn’t know his real name or where he lives, she’s ninety percent certain he’s a criminal and that the “business” he talks with her brother isn’t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he’d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she’s not interested in becoming “property of”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live.&lt;br&gt;Maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Romantica® contemporary erotic romance from Ellora’s Cave</description>

  <description>You met Romeo Prince in the Amazon &amp;amp; USA Today bestselling novel, Sweet Home. Now hear the story from his lips: unbarred, uncensored and raw to the bone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It makes me laugh when I hear that folk think Mol and I rushed into it too fast, spouting that we couldn't possibly have felt what we did for each other in such a short space of time. I say, how the hell would they know? We made it, didn't we? She became my whole life, didn't she? And as for my folks not being real, being true? Tell that to me aged ten, eleven, twelve — damn, all my bastard life — when I was never enough, when I was beaten until I bled for being too good at football and not being everything they'd dreamed: the perfectly dutiful son. Tell that to thousands of kids around the world getting wailed on by asshole parents for whatever stupid reason; tell them that evil don't exist in their eyes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fuck Romeo and Juliet: this is the story of me and my girl, from my lips. No mushy sentiment, no cheese, just the plain, hard truth, and, because I'm feeling generous, I'm going to let you in on more of our story too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sweet Rome is a New Adult Companion Novel to Sweet Home — contains adult content, sexual situations and mature topics.  Suited for ages 18 and up</description>

  <description>I thought things were bad and weird before – hold on – it’s getting worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam and I are both going through identity crises of epic proportions as we Transition from who we were, and discover who we were meant to be. More Fae are dying, and I feel as if time is running out for us to find all of those responsible and put an end to the killings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The people I thought I could trust have betrayed me and the one person I should absolutely not trust; is taking me deeper and deeper into his world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryder’s secrets are dangerous and devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With each touch and word, he pulls my heart closer to himself and at the same time he is trying to keep me at arm’s length. The dance he and I have begun, is getting more complicated as our worlds are being shaken from all sides, and the visions of the future are frightening, and nothing like I had ever pictured for myself or those I care for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, destiny is taunting me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had always thought that I controlled my destiny. Now, my rights are being taken from me by powerful people and leaving me with alternatives that range between bad and awful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, the choices I have to make can decide the fate of both worlds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything is unraveling, and nothing will ever be the same again.</description>

  <description>It’s said that women and men are from two different planets when it comes to communication, but how can they overcome the obstacles of prehistoric times when one of them simply doesn’t have the ability to comprehend language?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ehd’s a caveman living on his own in a harsh wilderness. He’s strong and intelligent, but completely alone. When he finds a beautiful young woman in his pit trap, it’s obvious to him that she is meant to be his mate. He doesn’t know where she came from; she’s wearing some pretty odd clothing, and she makes a lot of noises with her mouth that give him a headache. Still, he’s determined to fulfill his purpose in life – provide for her, protect her, and put a baby in her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth doesn’t know where she is or exactly how she got there. She’s confused and distressed by her predicament, and there’s a caveman hauling her back to his cavehome. She’s not at all interested in Ehd’s primitive advances, and she just can’t seem to get him to listen. No matter what she tries, getting her point across to this primitive, but beautiful, man is a constant – and often hilarious – struggle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With only each other for company, they must rely on one another to fight the dangers of the wild and prepare for the winter months. As they struggle to coexist, theirs becomes a love story that transcends language and time.</description>

  <description>THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE BOOK. YOU MUST READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS IN THIS SERIES FIRST. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ALL. OF. THEM.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spencer Shrike is a man with a plan. Get in. Get out. Move on. He loves Ron the Bomb, and her safety is the only thing on his mind these days. But life is a tricky bastard, and conning criminals for the better part of ten years brings its own set of problems. Sure, Rook lied her way out of a sticky situation, covering for crimes Ronin, Ford, and Spencer committed, and getting them all off scot-free in the process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not everyone is buying Rook’s story, and Spencer is desperate to figure out who’s in town setting them up for a fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Veronica the Bombshell Vaughn has put up with Spencer Shrike’s shit for years and where has it gotten her? A big fat nowhere. No ring, no house, no kids, and no promises. In fact, Spencer is worse than ever—completely distant and moody. She’s done sitting at home, pining over a man she can’t have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she’s not opposed to fighting for him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ron the Bomb fights hard and she fights dirty, so she’s willing to do whatever it takes to get Spencer’s attention.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now there’s another man in town with his eye on her. He’s got secrets too, but unlike Spencer, Bobby Mansi is more than willing to let Veronica in on them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire Rook and Ronin series comes full circle. Every con, every lie, and every skeleton in the closet is back for one final shot at vengeance and the only way to set it right…  is to get out the guns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**I'm fucking serious. ALL. THE. BOOKS. Every character, every plot point, every word was written for a reason. And that reason is THIS LAST BOOK.</description>

  <description>A deadly game of hide and seek. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With blood still on her hands, Samantha Matthews is on the run, running from dark secrets and a man she prays to God will never find her. Running and hiding, just to stay alive. She had no choice but to run, to leave, to hide and forget about her life before. When Samantha believes she's gained enough distance from her past and her demons, she stops running, hoping to find her future in the heavily wooded area of the Adirondack Mountains, a place she never expected to encounter a man with secrets as dark and as sordid as hers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kade Grayson is hiding, not from the demons after him, but from himself and from the entire outside world, wishing every day he could have just died. Arrogant and domineering, he’s tormented and terrorized by his past, seeing nothing good for his future. With the ghosts of his past still haunting him, he has exiled himself to a life of solitude, only living for his words and through his stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An undeniable attraction, turns into hate and then ultimately obsession, an obsession that grows into a powerful story of love and redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will the bond they have begun to build between them grow stronger than the tragedies that have scarred both of their lives? Or will they allow their demons to consume them?</description>

  <description>Seoafin "Finnie" Wilde was taught by her parents that life was meant to be lived, every breath was a treasure and to seek every adventure she could find. And she learns this lesson the hard way when they perish in a plane crash when she's fifteen. But she never forgets and when she discovers there is a parallel universe where every person has a twin, she finds a witch who can send her there so she can see her parents again and have the adventure of a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But nearly upon arrival in the Winter Wonderland of Lunwyn, she realizes she's been played by her twin of the alternate universe and shortly finds herself walking down the aisle to be wed to The Drakkar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instantly thrown into inauspicious circumstances, with years of practice (she did, of course, survive that elephant stampede, if she could do that, she can do anything), Finnie bests the challenges and digs into her adventure. But as Frey Drakkar discovers the woman who is his new wife is not Princess Sjofn, a woman he dislikes (intensely) but instead, his Finnie, a free-spirit with a thirst for venture just like him (not to mention she is his destiny), without her knowledge he orders his new bride bound to his frozen world, everlasting.</description>

  <description>Ford Aston is not too picky about what he wants out of Christmas.  He’s not into this holiday—like at all. He doesn’t do presents, or family dinners, or parties, or church. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He does pets. And he’s got one lined up for Christmas Eve. In fact, it’s the highlight of his day. And if he can get through drop-in visits, nosy twelve year olds, an inappropriate conversation with his best friend’s girlfriend, dinner with a family that’s not his, and a party at his mother’s house—well, he might just get home in time to enjoy himself with a stranger and make it all OK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SLACK: A Day in the Life of Ford Aston, is a prequel to TAUT: The Ford Book, and can be read as a standalone novella.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SLACK releases on December 18, 2013 and TAUT releases on January 20, 2014</description>

  <description>Ryan Kendall is broken. He understands pain. He knows the hand of violence and the ache of loss. He knows what it means to fail those who need you. Being broken doesn’t stop him wanting the one thing he can’t have; Finlay Tanner. Her smile is sweet and her future bright. She’s the girl he grew up with, the girl he loves, the girl he protects from the world, and from himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At nineteen, Ryan leaves to join the Australian Army. After years of training he becomes an elite SAS soldier and deploys to the Afghanistan war. His patrol undertakes the most dangerous missions a soldier can face. But no matter how far he runs, or how hard he fights, his need for Finlay won’t let go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning home after six years, one look is all it takes to know he can’t live without her. But sometimes love isn’t enough to heal what hurts. Sometimes people like him can’t be fixed, and sometimes people like Finlay deserve more than what’s left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story about war and the cost of sacrifice. Where bonds are formed, and friendships found. Where those who are strong, fall hard. Where love is let go, heartache is born, and heroes are made. Where one man learns that the hardest fight of all, is the fight to save himself.</description>

  <description>Ambrose Young was beautiful.  He was tall and muscular, with hair that touched his shoulders and eyes that burned right through you. The kind of beautiful that graced the covers of romance novels, and Fern Taylor would know.  She'd been reading them since she was thirteen.  But maybe because he was so beautiful he was never someone Fern thought she could have...until he wasn't beautiful anymore.&lt;br&gt;	Making Faces is the story of a small town where five young men go off to war, and only one comes back.  It is the story of loss.  Collective loss, individual loss, loss of beauty, loss of life, loss of identity.  It is the tale of one girl's love for a broken boy, and a wounded warrior's love for an unremarkable girl.  This is a story of friendship that overcomes heartache, heroism that defies the common definitions, and a modern tale of Beauty and the Beast, where we discover that there is a little beauty and a little beast in all of us.</description>

  <description>
  &lt;strong&gt;One simple lesson in seduction between two friends can turn into so much more…&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite her outgoing demeanor, Olivia is painfully insecure around the opposite sex—usually, she can’t get up the nerve to approach guys she’s interested in. But moving to Edinburgh has given her a new start, and, after she develops a crush on a sexy postgrad, she decides it’s time to push past her fears and go after what she wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nate Sawyer is a gorgeous player who never commits, but to his close friends, he’s as loyal as they come. So when Olivia turns to him with her relationship woes, he offers to instruct her in the art of flirting and to help her become more sexually confident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The friendly education in seduction soon grows into an intense and hot romance. But then Nate’s past and commitment issues rear their ugly heads, and Olivia is left broken-hearted. When Nate realizes he’s made the biggest mistake of his life, he will have to work harder than he ever has before to entice his best friend into falling back in love with him—or he may lose her forever…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Joss and Braden Novella&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Braden Carmichael never imagined he’d fall as hard and as fast as he did for Jocelyn Butler. He also could not have anticipated how difficult it would be to convince her to give in to love. But now that he has her, he’s never letting go. He’s got it all planned—the passionate proposal, the dream wedding, the sexy Hawaiian honeymoon—even the perfect family they’ll start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After trying to flee from her painful past, Joss is finally allowing herself to embrace the future. But when things start moving faster than she anticipated, she finds herself panicking over something Braden can’t understand. After everything they’ve been through, Joss is sure that their love can survive even her worst fears. But, this time, she may push Braden too far—and risk losing everything all over again…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This novella is a companion novel to the Hopeless series, but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance encounter in the dark leads eighteen-year-old Daniel and the girl who stumbles across him to profess their love for each other. But this love comes with conditions: they agree it will only last one hour and it will only be make-believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When their hour is up and the girl rushes off like Cinderella, Daniel tries to convince himself that what happened between them only seemed perfect because they were pretending it was perfect. Moments like that with girls like her don’t happen outside of fairytales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One year and one bad relationship later, his disbelief in insta-love is stripped away the day he meets Six: a girl with a strange name and an even stranger personality. Daniel soon realizes the way he pretended to feel about Cinderella and the way he really feels about Six may not be so different after all. Especially when the two loves of his life end up being one in the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately for Daniel, finding Cinderella doesn’t guarantee their happily ever after…it only further threatens it.</description>

  <description>At twenty-two years old, aspiring musician Sydney Blake has a great life: She’s in college, working a steady job, in love with her wonderful boyfriend, Hunter, and rooming with her good friend, Tori. But everything changes when she discovers Hunter cheating on her with Tori—and she is left trying to decide what to do next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sydney becomes captivated by her mysterious neighbor, Ridge Lawson. She can’t take her eyes off him or stop listening to the daily guitar playing he does out on his balcony. She can feel the harmony and vibrations in his music. And there’s something about Sydney that Ridge can’t ignore, either: He seems to have finally found his muse. When their inevitable encounter happens, they soon find themselves needing each other in more ways than one…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From #1 New York Times bestselling author Colleen Hoover, a passionate tale of friendship, betrayal, and romance—and the enchanting music that inspires one young woman to put her life back together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the author of the New York Times bestsellers Slammed, Point of Retreat, Hopeless, This Girl, and Losing Hope, Maybe Someday is destined to become another bestseller and long-lasting fan favorite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Includes a free original soundtrack by musician Griffin Peterson.</description>

  <description>Lily can't escape the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years after a tragedy tore her family apart, Lily is on her way to college for what she hopes will be a fresh start. Instead, she finds herself broken down in the place she swore she'd never return to, the place by the water that damaged her family beyond repair. When Ty Reilly offers her help, she reluctantly accepts, eager to get her car fixed and get the hell out of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But before that can happen, an eerily similar recurrence stops Lily cold. With her identity and ties to the old tragedy revealed, new suspicions cast a bright light on Lily. Everyone around her – the guy who offered her help, her own wayward sister, and the town sheriff who remembers her from a decade earlier – begins to wonder if her reappearance is merely a coincidence or if she's somehow involved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lily begins to thread together strands from the past with the present, she realizes that there's no such thing as a coincidence down by the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that you can't ever really leave the past behind.</description>

  <description>One night changed my life forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beau Bennett has been my best friend since I can remember. He was my first crush before everything came crashing down, and now he wants more, but it's more than I can give him. Things are different now. I wish I could tell him why, but I can't. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven’t told anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I never knew how much I really needed him until the day he left for college, and I was completely alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day, Asher Hunt rides into town with his dark, captivating eyes and cocky grin. He doesn't care who I used to be, he's simply breathing life into what’s left. People warn me to stay away from him, but he helps me forget the pain that has held me hostage for so long; something I thought was impossible before he walked into my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been hurt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve been saved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I’ve found hope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I thought my story was written that night, but now I know it was only a new beginning. Until one secret turns my world upside down…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again.</description>

  <description>Nova Reed can't forget him-Quinton Carter, the boy with the honey-brown eyes who made her realize she deserved more than an empty life. His pain was so similar to her own. But Nova has been coming to terms with her past and healing, while Quinton is out there somewhere, sinking deeper. She's determined to find him and help him . . . before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Nova has haunted his dreams for nearly a year-but Quinton never thought a sweet, kind person like her would care enough about a person like him. To Quinton, a dark, dangerous life is exactly what he deserves. And Nova has no place in it. But Nova has followed him to Las Vegas, and now he must do whatever it takes to keep her away, to maintain his self-imposed punishment for the unforgivable things he's done. But there's one flaw in his plan: Nova isn't going anywhere . . .</description>

  <description>Wyatt Conner is a hard man. A sixth generation sheriff in his hometown of Garnet. A former MMA fighter. His life is about following the rules and making sure everyone else in Garnet follows them too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before life hurt him, Wyatt was different. Love had once blinded him to his upbringing and made him defiant against anyone who tried to separate him from the girl he loved. He easily broke laws to ensure her safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she left it destroyed him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she's back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabitha knew coming home was a mistake, but family obligation demanded it. She wasn’t expecting to run smack into the love of her life the same day she returned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the danger, Tabitha is powerless against the wild rush of desire that explodes between them the moment she finds herself in Wyatt’s arms again. She needs a second chance too, but she can't risk Wyatt finally discovering the real reason she left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even for another taste of true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabitha knows her haunted past will destroy both of them if Wyatt finds out. What she suffered through was too terrible and it's the one thing that will have him crossing the line for revenge.</description>

  <description>Elizabeth knows what’s expected of her, perfection. She’s the daughter of an Earl and expected to marry well, say and do the right things with a smile on her face when inside she’s dying for a chance to escape. Thanks to an inheritance her godmother left her years ago, her chance will come with her next birthday. Her hopes of escape abruptly end when Robert, her childhood nemesis that she hasn’t seen in over fourteen years, comes back into her life and does everything he can to drive her out of her mind even as he steals her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He hated her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least, he tried to hate her, but it was so damn difficult to hate someone that he couldn’t live without. He tried to ignore her, tried to focus on anything but her, but nothing worked. Somehow she made her way into his heart and started to make him want things that he never thought possible, made him smile and laugh even while she drove him out of his mind and started a legacy by turning him into…..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Bradford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author’s Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is first and foremost a historical novel.  This novel is written differently than the other Neighbor from Hell books. Truce is about a man who takes everything too damn seriously and can’t let go of the past until the woman that he would love to hate comes back into his life and brings out the Bradford within. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Neighbor from Hell novels that follow will be written in the same style as the originals.</description>

  <description>*new adult romance*&lt;br&gt;**explicit scenes and language**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t care what my cousin says; I am not the queen of impossible relationships. I mean, just because my last boyfriend tried to kill me and left a bit of a scar on my neck, then forced me to move across the country and legally change my name to Reese Randall to escape him, does not mean—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Oh, who am I kidding? For a freshman in college, I have to have the worst dating track record ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It’s no wonder love is the last thing on my mind when Mason Lowe enters my life. But the chemistry between us is like bam! Our connection defies logic. And he’s just so freaking hot. Being around him makes me feel more alive than I’ve ever felt before. I even like bickering with him. He could be my soul mate...except for one teeny tiny glitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's a gigolo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boy, do I know how to pick them.</description>

  <description>The fourth and final installment in the sexy miniseries, The Dumont Diaries!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have discovered the witch who started this disaster, and her name is Cecile. She is the lock around my husband's heart; she is the barrier between me and everything I ever wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have decided to fight. For his heart, for my father, for the Jimmy Choos that rest on my perfectly manicured feet. The problem with a fight is that there is ultimately a loser. And in a situation like this, she has the advantage and a clear head start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I am here, and she is not. And I have not shared everything. I have some secrets and some advantages of my own. I will fight to the death, if not of my body, than of my heart. And if my heart is destroyed in this battle, I will find a way to survive. Poor planning may not be the final chapter in my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Do Us Part is a novella, 16,000 words in length, and is the final volume of The Dumont Diaries, a 4-part series.&lt;br&gt;The Dumont Diaries series synopsis:&lt;br&gt;Candace Tapers' life finally takes an upward swing when Nathan Dumont, shipping heir and notorious playboy, sweeps her away to a lifestyle of wealth and privilege. But that life comes with strings, and she is soon pulled in directions she never expected, discovering secrets and ulterior motives in the man who shares her bed.</description>

  <description>He watches me. Watches as my husband makes me submit, makes me do things that, even in their depravity, bring me pleasure. He knows what I like, and how I like it. But while Nathan dominates my body, Drew is interested more in my soul.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can only bend so far before I break. Drew is my crack, my weak point around which everything else splinters. Even as more secrets are unveiled and all of the signs point to danger, I roll farther into this world. Into this high-brow life, into both of their beds.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to what end? At this point, I don’t know what’s in more danger: my heart or my life. For these men, these two men who I am pushed and pulled between? They seem to be much more interested in my death than they ever were my life.</description>

  <description>Book 2 of The Dumont Diaries (four books in the series)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Nathan Dumont, heir to Dumont Shipping, steps onto the scene with a new wife, the media sits up and takes notice. But nothing can be found on the new Mrs.Dumont. No family history, private school chums, or expensively hidden skeletons in couture closets. It is as if she has materialized out of thin air, and wearing Chanel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life in a fairytale sucks. Even if it does come complete with eight inches of wontleavemealone steel. But when that glorious package is attached to a man that won’t give me a second glance, much less a piece of his heart, what good is a wedding ring and boatloads of cash?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make matters worse, I am slowly stumbling along and finding red flags. Flags that make me think there is more to this fairytale than meets the eye. In fact, I’m not so sure it’s a fairytale at all. It looks to be much, much worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Hold is a novella, approximately 60 pages, and is book 2 of a 4-part series.</description>

  <description>Nova Reed used to have dreams-of becoming a famous drummer, of marrying her true love. But all of that was taken away in an instant. Now she's getting by as best she can, though sometimes that means doing things the old Nova would never do. Things that are slowly eating away at her spirit. Every day blends into the next . . . until she meets Quinton Carter. His intense, honey brown eyes instantly draw her in, and he looks just about as broken as she feels inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quinton once got a second chance at life-but he doesn't want it. The tattoos on his chest are a constant reminder of what he's done, what he's lost. He's sworn to never allow happiness into his life . . . but then beautiful, sweet Nova makes him smile. He knows he's too damaged to get close to her, yet she's the only one who can make him feel alive again. Quinton will have to decide: does he deserve to start over? Or should he pay for his past forever?</description>

  <description>I'm not your typical girl. I've been running away from the memories that haunt me for so long that depression has become my only comfort. I was content in the darkness...until Wes Michals offered to be my light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I didn't know that time wasn't my ally -- that every second that ticked past was one step closer to the end of something that was beginning to mean the end of myself. He tried to warn me. He promised me all he was able to offer--each moment as it came--but it would never be enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes when you think it's the end, it's only the beginning. Wes thought he could save me, but in giving me everything, he ruined me. Because after one kiss, one touch, I couldn't--I wouldn't ever be the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And from that moment on, his heartbeat became my own.</description>

  <description>Ty Walker was wrongly imprisoned and for the five years he was inside, he honed his plan so when he gets out, he has nothing but vengeance on his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then he walks straight to stylish, leggy, beautiful, goofy Lexie Berry and he suddenly has something else to think about. He knows within seconds he wants her and within days he can love her but with the filth that was flung at him clinging; he also knows he can’t have her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since birth, Lexie Berry has been Lady Luck’s favorite toy and because of that, Lexie is cautious. But within a day, she senses Ty is something special. With her luck, however, she can’t trust it. Then she finds out what was done to Ty and she’s willing to do anything to make it right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even what Ty will never forgive her for doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ty clings to vengeance and Lexie goes all out to give him back the time he lost. But Ty is battling demons within and they’re up against dirty cops and criminals who will stop at nothing to sway Lady Luck against them. All Ty and Lexie have is hope Lady Luck will finally swing their way.</description>

  <description>Rook is chasing her dream—film school and a chance at a life beyond the one she ran from six months ago. But before she can become the girl she wants to be, she must deal with the girl she left behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ronin is also chasing his dream—a family of his own and a life away from erotic modeling. And he too, has a past he’s trying to forget. A past that makes Rook question everything about their life together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lies, secrets, and shocking truths will rock the foundation Rook and Ronin have built. Can they put the past behind them and move forward together? Or is this just another too good to be true relationship that will crash and burn in the end?</description>

  <description>"For every action there is an equal or opposite reaction."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For every choice you make there are rewards, &lt;br&gt;or there are consequences.&lt;br&gt;It was my choice to walk away the first time.&lt;br&gt;And my choice to chase her the second.&lt;br&gt;But sometimes you don't get a choice, &lt;br&gt;and all you get are the consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, &lt;br&gt;while loving someone deeply gives you courage.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless that someone is Logan Matthews. &lt;br&gt;Because loving him didn't give me &lt;br&gt;the strength to walk away.&lt;br&gt;It didn't give me &lt;br&gt;the courage to fight for him.&lt;br&gt;And when it was over, &lt;br&gt;all it gave me was a broken heart.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the follow-up to Colleen Hoover’s #1 New York Times bestseller &lt;em&gt;Hopeless&lt;/em&gt;, the charming and irresistible Dean Holder tells the passionate story that has melted thousands of hearts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Hopeless&lt;/em&gt;, Sky left no secret unearthed, no feeling unshared, and no memory forgotten, but Holder’s past remained a mystery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still haunted by the little girl he let walk away, Holder has spent his entire life searching for her in an attempt to finally rid himself of the crushing guilt he has felt for years. But he could not have anticipated that the moment they reconnect, even greater remorse would overwhelm him…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes in life, if we wish to move forward, we must first dig deep into our past and make amends. In &lt;em&gt;Losing Hope&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Colleen Hoover reveals what was going on inside Holder’s head during all those hopeless moments—and whether he can gain the peace he desperately needs.</description>

  <description>Determined to live a dark life in the company of the assassin who freed her from bondage, Sarai sets out on her own to settle a score with an evil sadist. Unskilled and untrained in the art of killing, the events that unfold leave her hanging precariously on the edge of death when nothing goes as planned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarai’s reckless choices send her on a path she knows she can never turn back from and so she presents Victor with an ultimatum: help her become more like him and give her a fighting chance, or she’ll do it alone no matter the consequences. Knowing that Sarai cannot become what she wants to be overnight, Victor begins to train her and inevitably their complicated relationship heats up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Arthur Hamburg’s right-hand man, Willem Stephens, closes in on his crusade to destroy Sarai, she is left with the crushing realization that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. But Sarai, taking on the new and improved role of Izabel Seyfried, still has a set of deadly skills of her own that will prove to be all she needs to secure her place beside Victor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there is one test that Izabel must face that has the potential to destroy everything she is working so hard to achieve. One final test that will not only make her question her decision to want this dangerous life, but will make her question everything she has come to trust about Victor Faust.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From the author of the New York Times, USA Today &amp;amp; Wall Street Journal bestselling novel, THE EDGE OF NEVER, comes a story of passion and survival…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sarai was only fourteen when her mother uprooted her to live in Mexico with a notorious drug lord. Over time she forgot what it was like to live a normal life, but she never let go of her hope to escape the compound where she has been held for the past nine years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Victor is a cold-blooded assassin who, like Sarai, has known only death and violence since he was a young boy. When Victor arrives at the compound to collect details and payment for a hit, Sarai sees him as her only opportunity for escape. But things don’t go as planned and instead of finding transport back to Tucson, she finds herself free from one dangerous man and caught in the clutches of another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While on the run, Victor strays from his primal nature as he succumbs to his conscience and resolves to help Sarai. As they grow closer, he finds himself willing to risk everything to keep her alive; even his relationship with his devoted brother and liaison, Niklas, who now like everyone else wants Sarai dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Victor and Sarai slowly build a trust, the differences between them seem to lessen, and an unlikely attraction intensifies. But Victor’s brutal skills and experience may not be enough in the end to save her, as the power she unknowingly holds over him may ultimately be what gets her killed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is their story…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(94,000 words | 400 pages)</description>

  <description>Reaper's Legacy is a raw and intensely erotic tale in Joanna Wylde's Reapers Motorcycle Club series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight years ago, Sophie gave her heart-and her virginity-to Zach Barrett on a night that couldn't have been less romantic or more embarrassing. Zach's step-brother, a steely-muscled, tattooed biker named Ruger, caught them in the act, getting a peep show of Sophie he's never forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She may have lost her dignity that fateful night, but Sophie also gained something precious-her son Noah. Unfortunately, Zach's a deadbeat dad, leaving Ruger to be Noah's only male role model. When he discovers Sophie and his nephew living in near poverty, Ruger takes matters into his own hands-with the help of the Reapers Motorcycle Club-to give them a better life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living with outlaw bikers wasn't Sophie's plan for her son, but Ruger isn't giving her a choice. He'll be there for Noah, whether she wants him or not. But Sophie does want him, has always wanted him. Now she'll learn that taking a biker to bed can get a girl dirty in every way.</description>

  <description>TRAGIC is over and Rook is ready for the future—Spencer Shrike and the STURGIS contract! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s three months of body art modeling! That means three months of Spencer Shrike’s paintbrush all over her body, three months in front of Antoine’s camera, and three months of twenty-four hour filming for Spencer’s Biker Channel reality show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait a minute…what reality show? Maybe she should’ve read that STURGIS contract a little closer? ;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, Rook’s bank account is almost overflowing, but Ronin is angry, Clare is trying to escape rehab, Antoine is a worried mess, and Elise is just trying to hold everyone together. Her new family is about to fall apart before she even gets the chance to enjoy them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add in a mysterious man from her past, a road trip to the famous Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, and a final show in front of the entire world where all her goods are on display, and you’ve got Manic—a new adult contemporary romance that will definitely make your summer sizzle!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expected release date: August 1, 2013</description>

  <description>Sometimes happy endings are just the beginning of an even harder road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although her aunt and sister believe she should get help to deal with her past demons, Patience believes the only thing she needs is Zeke. When he comes back into her world, her life couldn’t be more perfect. Except old demons pick the worst time to surface, and once again their happiness is threatened. Help was never a necessity, but Patience finds out that love isn’t always all you need. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zeke’s dealt with a lot in his life, but nothing could prepare him for watching the person he loves fall apart. Patience is different, she’s not the girl he came to love. He's willing to do whatever it takes to get her back, but a budding music career and his own demons seem to keep getting in the way. How can you help someone else when you can barely help yourself? Once again Zeke is faced with deciding between his future and the future of Patience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young adult readers.***</description>

  <description>When college sophomore Angela Birch sneaks from Texas to Mexico for Spring Break, she believes the worst that can happen is her parents finding out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst is falling for the ruse of handsome, alluring Fernando. One spontaneous choice whisks Angela across the world to the pseudo paradise of Spain’s Mediterranean Riviera where she has another choice to make: live cooperatively as one of billionaire Marco Ruiz’s slaves, or die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin Douglas’s future was seized and choked when deliberate tragedy struck his Scottish family at the age of sixteen. He spent his remaining youthful years infiltrating the U.K.’s crime world, seeking power, control, and revenge, all leading to a position as an undercover agent. With nothing to lose, Colin accepts the seemingly impossible job of rescuing America’s famous missing girl, Angela Birch. Colin knows that to enter a snake lair, one must become a snake. It turns out to be a mission which will put his desire for control to the ultimate test, and make him wish for things he never knew he wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*AUTHOR'S NOTE*    Escape from Paradise is a work of fiction intended for adult readers, containing graphic sexual scenarios and strong language.</description>

  <description>How do you keep existing when your heart is so splintered, so completely torn to shreds, your pulse is fading?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’re…broken.  How do you move forward when every breath is nothing more than a constant ache?  Living becomes an insidious reminder that you threw away the single largest part of yourself. Your…soul.  No amount of distraction can pull you from the torture of losing your…life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that Emily Cooper has walked away from her first love, she finds herself running toward her only love.  Unraveling fast, but clinging to hope, Emily risks all she has left on the man that has consumed her every thought and dream since the day they met.  Will Gavin take her back?  And if so, will their reunion be a collision of two hearts destined to complete one another and rekindle a love that knew no boundaries?  Or will scars from their past rip open, tearing slowly at what each of them was meant to be?  Can fate, the ultimate game changer, mend the shattered road it laid out from the start?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only time will tell…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tick-Tock…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What does it take to rise from life’s depths, swim against the current, and breathe?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weighted down by the loss of her parents, Blythe McGuire struggles to keep her head above water as she trudges through her last year at Matthews College. Then a chance meeting sends Blythe crashing into something she doesn’t expect—an undeniable attraction to a dark-haired senior named Chris Shepherd, whose past may be even more complicated than her own. As their relationship deepens, Chris pulls Blythe out of the stupor she’s been in since the night a fire took half her family. She begins to heal, and even, haltingly, to love this guy who helps her find new paths to pleasure and self-discovery. But as Blythe moves into calmer waters, she realizes Chris is the one still strangled by his family’s traumatic history. As dark currents threaten to pull him under, Blythe may be the only person who can keep him from drowning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book is intended for mature audiences due to strong language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: due to mature content recommended for Ages 17+</description>

Here are the stories of a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. And now a dutiful twin must choose between two lives...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiercely loyal to the Black Dagger Brotherhood, Phury has sacrificed himself for the good of the race, becoming the male responsible for keeping the Brotherhood's bloodlines alive. As Primale of the Chosen, he is obligated to father the sons and daughters who will ensure that the traditions of the race survive, and that there are warriors to fight those who want all vampires extinguished. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As his first mate, the Chosen Cormia wants to win not only his body, but his heart for herself. She is drawn to the noble responsibility behind the emotionally scarred male. But Phury has never allowed himself to know pleasure or joy.

  <description>Drew Evans is a winner. Handsome and arrogant, he makes multimillion dollar business deals and seduces New York’s most beautiful women with just a smile. He has loyal friends and an indulgent family. So why has he been shuttered in his apartment for seven days, miserable and depressed? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’ll tell you he has the flu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we all know that’s not really true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Katherine Brooks is brilliant, beautiful and ambitious.  She refuses to let anything - or anyone - derail her path to success. When Kate is hired as the new associate at Drew’s father’s investment banking firm, every aspect of the dashing playboy’s life is thrown into a tailspin. The professional competition she brings is unnerving, his attraction to her is distracting, his failure to entice her into his bed is exasperating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, just when Drew is on the cusp of having everything he wants, his overblown confidence threatens to ruin it all.  Will he be able untangle his feelings of lust and tenderness, frustration and fulfillment? Will he rise to the most important challenge of his life? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Drew Evans win at love? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tangled is not your mother’s romance novel.  It is an outrageous, passionate, witty narrative about a man who knows a lot about women…just not as much as he thinks he knows.  As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing he never wanted in life, is the only thing he can’t live without.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;From acclaimed author Katie McGarry comes an explosive new tale of a good girl with a reckless streak, a street-smart guy with nothing to lose, and a romance forged in the fast lane.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The girl with straight As, designer clothes and the perfect life—that's who people expect Rachel Young to be. So the private-school junior keeps secrets from her wealthy parents and overbearing brothers...and she's just added two more to the list. One involves racing strangers down dark country roads in her Mustang GT. The other? Seventeen-year-old Isaiah Walker-a guy she has no business even talking to. But when the foster kid with the tattoos and intense gray eyes comes to her rescue, she can't get him out of her mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isaiah has secrets, too. About where he lives, and how he really feels about Rachel. The last thing he needs is to get tangled up with a rich girl who wants to slum it on the south side for kicks-no matter how angelic she might look. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when their shared love of street racing puts both their lives in jeopardy, they have six weeks to come up with a way out. Six weeks to discover just how far they'll go to save each other.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian Note: This is an alternate cover edition, asin:B00AUV1R42&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years before Trip Wiley could be seen on movie screens all over the world, he could be seen sitting in the desk behind me in my high school English class.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was back in 1990, and I cite the year only to avoid dumbfounding you when references to big hair or stretch pants are mentioned. Although, come to think of it, I am from New Jersey, which may serve as explanation enough. We were teenagers then, way back in a time before anyone could even dream he’d turn into the Hollywood commodity that he is today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In case you live under a rock and don't know who Trip Wiley is, just know that these days, he’s the actor found at the top of every casting director’s wish list. He’s incredibly talented and insanely gorgeous, the combination of which has made him very rich, very famous and very desirable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And not just to casting directors, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can’t confirm any of the gossip from his early years out in Tinseltown, but based on what I knew of his life before he was famous, I can tell you that the idea of Girls-Throwing-Themselves-At-Trip is not a new concept.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should know. I was one of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And my life hasn’t been the same since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Remember When is the first book in an NA romantic comedy trilogy, but there is NO CLIFFHANGER. It is intended for mature teen readers and immature adult ones due to some high school sex scenes, underage drinking, questionable language and 1980s flashbacks.**</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;This is a stand alone novel that is an adult spin-off of the &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/66252-lux"&gt;Lux Series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You do not need to read a Lux book to read Obsession and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s arrogant, domineering, and... To. Die. For.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter is a ruthless killer. And the Department of Defense has him firmly in their grasp, which usually doesn’t chafe too badly because he gets to kill bad guys. Most of the time he enjoys his job. That is, until he’s saddled with something he’s never had to do before: protect a human from his mortal enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serena Cross didn’t believe her best friend when she claimed to have seen the son of a powerful senator turn into something... unnatural. Who would? But then she witnesses her friend’s murder at the hands of what can only be an alien, thrusting her into a world that will kill to protect their secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter stirs Serena’s temper and her lust despite their differences. Soon he’s doing the unthinkable—breaking the rules he’s lived by, going against the government to keep Serena safe. But are the aliens and the government the biggest threats to Serena’s life… or is it Hunter?</description>

  <description>Obsession, defined as the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a persistent idea, image or desire....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chantel Rosenberg's passion for music and life had never shone brighter than the time she spent in Bordeaux France.  It's a time when feelings arose and desires ran deep, a time that fundamentally changed her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man living in seclusion, Phillipe Tibideau is haunted and plagued by memories he cannot disregard. Choosing to live a quiet life in his Chateau surrounded by the vineyards of France, he's left his passion for art behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the time has arrived to tell his side of a tale. A tale that has depicted him as a 'beautiful monster' and he's finally allowing someone close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Close enough to ask questions. Questions he's not sure he wants to answer. Questions about her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For up and coming journalist Gemma Harris, the pursuit of truth is what drives her and when a job of a lifetime presents itself there is nothing in the world that will stop her from taking it. Even if it does mean leaving her home for several months to stay at Chateau Tibideau, with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story of what happens when three passionate lovers collide and the desire for truth, art and music merge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chateau Tibideau is a place full of unanswered questions, dark sinful desire and a beauty so hauntingly sad it will have you wondering how you will ever leave the same....</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there’s a deadly war raging between vampires and their slayers. And there exists a secret band of brothers like no other - six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Of these, Zsadist is the most terrifying member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A former blood slave, the vampire Zsadist still bears the scars from a past filled with suffering and humiliation. Renowned for his unquenchable fury and sinister deeds, he is a savage feared by humans and vampires alike. Anger is his only companion, and terror is his only passion—until he rescues a beautiful aristocrat from the evil Lessening Society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bella is instantly entranced by the seething power Zsadist possesses. But even as their desire for one another begins to overtake them both, Zsadist’s thirst for vengeance against Bella’s tormentors drives him to the brink of madness. Now, Bella must help her lover overcome the wounds of his tortured past, and find a future with her…</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war raging between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Possessed by a deadly beast, Rhage is the most dangerous of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within the brotherhood, Rhage is the vampire with the strongest appetites. He's the best fighter, the quickest to act on his impulses, and the most voracious lover-for inside him burns a ferocious curse cast by the Scribe Virgin. Owned by this dark side, Rhage fears the time when his inner dragon is unleashed, making him a danger to everyone around him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary Luce, a survivor of many hardships is unwittingly thrown into the vampire world and reliant on Rhage's protection. With a life-threatening curse of her own, Mary is not looking for love. She lost her faith in miracles years ago. But when Rhage's intense animal attraction turns into something more emotional, he knows that he must make Mary his alone. And while their enemies close in, Mary fights desperately to gain life eternal with the one she loves...</description>

  <description>In the shadows of the night in Caldwell, New York, there's a deadly turf war going on between vampires and their slayers. There exists a secret band of brothers like no other-six vampire warriors, defenders of their race. Yet none of them relishes killing more than Wrath, the leader of The Black Dagger Brotherhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only purebred vampire left on earth, Wrath has a score to settle with the slayers who murdered his parents centuries ago. But, when one of his most trusted fighters is killed-leaving his half-breed daughter unaware of his existence or her fate-Wrath must usher her into the world of the undead-a world of sensuality beyond her wildest dreams.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; This is the story before everything.. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elizabeth knows what’s expected of her, perfection. She’s the daughter of an Earl and expected to marry well, say and do the right things with a smile on her face when inside she’s dying for a chance to escape. Thanks to an inheritance her godmother left her years ago, her chance will come with her next birthday. Her hopes of escape abruptly end when Robert, her childhood nemesis that she hasn’t seen in over fourteen years, comes back into her life and does everything he can to drive her out of her mind even as he steals her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; He hated her. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least, he tried to hate her, but it was so damn difficult to hate someone that he couldn’t live without. He tried to ignore her, tried to focus on anything but her, but nothing worked. Somehow she made her way into his heart and started to make him want things that he never though possible, made him smile and laugh even while she drove him out of his mind and started a legacy by turning him into…..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Bradford.</description>

  <description>Lilith Bresson, an independent, successful young artist, is forced to travel from her home in Spain to the wild borderlands of northern England, to repay her feckless father’s latest debt by painting a portrait of the enigmatic Lady Blaine Albermarle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On her first night at Albermarle Hall she meets Finn Strachan, Blaine’s ‘companion’, a cultured and hauntingly beautiful young man who seems to have it all. But Lilith has an artist’s eye, and a gift for seeing what lies beneath the skin. She soon discovers that Blaine is more gaoler than lover, and if the price is right, depravity has no limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the weeks pass, Lilith finds that she too is drawn into the malign web that her patron has spun, yet against the odds she forges a strong friendship with the damaged, dysfunctional Finn. In a dark, modern twist to an age-old story, Lilith Bresson proves that sometimes it’s the princess who needs to become the rescuer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that this storyline contains depictions of drug abuse, violence and non-consensual sexual activity.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What happens when in order to win, you’re forced to lose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only daughter of an infamous Las Vegas pimp, Raven Morretti grew up an outsider.  Liberated from the neglectful home of her prostitute mother, she finds solace as a mechanic. With few friends, she’s content with the simple life.  Flying under the radar is all she knows, and more than she expects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until she catches the eye of local celebrity, UFL playboy Jonah Slade.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Weeks away from his title fight, Jonah is determined to stay focused on everything he’s trained so hard to achieve.  Undefeated in the octagon, he’s at the height of his career.  But resisting Raven’s effortless allure and uncomplicated nature is a fight he can’t win.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonah trades in his bad-boy reputation and puts his heart on the line.  But when her father contacts her, setting in motion the ugly truth of her destiny, Jonah must choose.  In a high-stakes gamble where love and freedom hang in the balance, a war is waged where the price of losing is a fate worse than death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the hotheaded Jonah be able to restrain his inner fighter to save the woman he loves?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or will Raven be forced into a life she’s been desperate to avoid?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: 112,406 &lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>A childhood crush who moved away. An adult love that shattered her world. Twenty-seven year old Mackenzie Tillson hasn’t been living for quite some time, rather, just existing. Life is passing her by and even with the love of her friends and family she can’t quite seem to snap out of the disconnected bubble she has created around her. Moving day by day as a shell of a person who once knew what it meant to live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until one day, the boy who first had her heart comes back. With a vengeance...Drew Dean has been apart from the girl he loved all of those years ago for far too long and now that fate has provided them with a second chance, he will make it clear to her that she is, and always has been the one for him. But what Drew discovers in the process, is Mackenzie may just end up being completely unreachable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it possible to get through to someone who has no intentions of ever letting anyone in again? Can a person find their way through the darkness and emptiness they've created? For Mackenzie, trudging along in life alone is where she feels she deserves to be. But will she find it in her to fight and break the barrier of the internal distorted view she has of herself? Or will she let everyone and everything slip away?&lt;br&gt;As Mackenzie tries to piece together the remnants of her shattered existence, she inadvertently discovers life, love and loss are one in the same. A hopeful journey to be taken with an ending to fill the emptiness she's carried for too long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book contains adult situations and some explicit language.*</description>

  <description>My life has always been safe. I like it that way. I grew up in a fake society where plastic hearts rule. If our hearts are made of plastic, they can never be broken. My parents have expectations and I do everything I can to meet them, even if it means giving up on my own dreams. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, all I want is to be free to make my own choices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dane Wright is everything I have been warned to stay away from. We met one night while I was with my perfect, parent-approved boyfriend and I haven’t stopped thinking about him. I don’t want to like him. I am doing everything I can to ignore his pull, but my heart seems to want what it cannot have, what it has never had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can he measure up? He may think I am too good for him, but maybe he is too good for me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is a series of choices and I have never been able to make my own. Until one day, when my heart decides to make a choice for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended for mature readers due to sexual content and language</description>

  <description>Jess Mackey is living a meticulously fabricated lie of necessity. She's left the secret tragedy of her past behind along with who she was and is forging ahead with a clean slate. But Jess soon discovers that passion can't be left behind—neither her own, nor that of the one man who sees who she really is…and whose unexpected presence may breach the peaceful life Jess has painstakingly created for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Devin Castile didn’t expect to meet a young woman who may be the missing puzzle piece to his existence…and who is also the victim of a heinous crime. Devin convinces himself that he can remain emotionally distant even while indulging his physical desire for her. But when Jess’s lies begin to crumble in the face of their undeniable attraction and the truth is revealed, one of them might pay with their life.</description>

  <description>Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane. The dark secrets of her past weren’t something she ever intended to share with anyone. They would never understand. No one would ever get close enough to find out. There was always a chance she’d go crazy sooner than they expected…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Woods Kerrington had never been one to be attracted to fragile females. They seemed like too much work. He wasn’t in it for the work just the pleasure. A night full of naughty fun had been exactly what was on his mind when he’d laid eyes on the hot little number that didn’t know how to pump gas and needed some help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What he didn’t know was she was as fragile as they came.&lt;br&gt;The carefree girl who spoke her mind and didn’t care what the world thought of her was more breakable than he could ever imagine…</description>

  <description>**Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual content and language, mature subject matter**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Contemporary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lost. That one single word best describes my life at this very moment. I lost the last games of the season and both my team and my coach blame me. I lost the last two months because I drowned in my own despair like a complete loser. And I lost the only girl who ever mattered because I was afraid being with me would destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now I realize how truly lost I am without her. She has become my story…and even though she acts like she’s moved on, I know she still thinks about me just as much as I think about her. She’s beautiful, sweet—and so damn vulnerable, all I want to do is help her. Be there for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love her…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only I could convince Fable to give me a second chance. Then I wouldn’t feel so lost anymore, and neither would she. We could be found together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>I'm writing this because you begged. You know how I love the begging. In fact, you probably know too many things and know them far too well. Who am I? Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out. I was a whore in my youth, a killer since my adolescence, and a monster as a man. I am the man who kidnapped Livvie. I am the man who held her in a dark room for weeks. But, most importantly, I am the man she loves. She loves me. It's quite sick, isn't it? Of course, there's more to our story than can be surmised in a few short sentences, but I'm at a loss for justifying my behavior back then. I assume if you're reading this, I don't need to make those justifications. You've already made your own. You're reading this because you want to know about the rest of the story. You want to know what happened that warm summer night in September of 2010, the night I met Livvie at The Paseo. It was the night my life changed all over again. It didn't happen exactly as Livvie said. She's been very kind to me in the retelling of our story. The truth is far more...complicated.</description>

  <description>Obsession, defined as the domination of one's thoughts or feelings by a persistent idea, image or desire....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chantel Rosenberg's passion for music and life had never shone brighter than the time she spent in Bordeaux France.  It's a time when feelings arose and desires ran deep, a time that fundamentally changed her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man living in seclusion, Phillipe Tibideau is haunted and plagued by memories he cannot disregard. Choosing to live a quiet life in his Chateau surrounded by the vineyards of France, he's left his passion for art behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the time has arrived to tell his side of a tale. A tale that has depicted him as a 'beautiful monster' and he's finally allowing someone close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Close enough to ask questions. Questions he's not sure he wants to answer. Questions about her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For up and coming journalist Gemma Harris, the pursuit of truth is what drives her and when a job of a lifetime presents itself there is nothing in the world that will stop her from taking it. Even if it does mean leaving her home for several months to stay at Chateau Tibideau, with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a story of what happens when three passionate lovers collide and the desire for truth, art and music merge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chateau Tibideau is a place full of unanswered questions, dark sinful desire and a beauty so hauntingly sad it will have you wondering how you will ever leave the same....</description>

  <description>Ellie Watt is used to starting over. The daughter of a grifting team, Ellie spent her childhood being used as a pawn in her parents' latest scam. Now she’s much older, wiser and ready to give her con artist life a rest. But returning to the dry desert town of Palm Valley, California means one more temptation than she bargained for – Camden McQueen. Once known as the high school weirdo, Camden is bigger and badder than the boy he used to be and a talented tattoo artist with his own thriving business. Ellie’s counting on Camden still being in love with her but what she’s not counting on is how easily unrequited love can turn into obsession over time. When Camden discovers Ellie’s plan to con him, he makes her a deal she doesn’t dare refuse, but her freedom comes with a price and it’s one that takes both Ellie and Camden down a dangerous road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***The Artists Trilogy is a dark and sexy contemporary ride about three flawed individuals caught in a world where it's so easy to justify the bad things we do. This is a pure adult read (Not YA or NA).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 1st book in the trilogy. It is followed by the novella On Every Street (released in March 2013) and the sequel Shooting Scars (released in May 2013). The third and final book in the series will also be released October 15, 2013.***</description>

  <description>Marie doesn’t need a complication like Horse. The massive, tattooed, badass biker who shows up at her brother’s house one afternoon doesn’t agree. He wants Marie on his bike and in his bed. Now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Marie just left her abusive jerk of an ex-husband and she’s not looking for a new man. Especially one like Horse—she doesn’t know his real name or where he lives, she’s ninety percent certain he’s a criminal and that the “business” he talks with her brother isn’t website design. She needs him out of her life, which would be a snap if he’d just stop giving her mind-blowing orgasms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horse is part of the Reapers Motorcycle Club, and when he wants something, he takes it. What he wants is Marie, but she’s not interested in becoming “property of”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then her brother steals from the club. Marie can save him by giving Horse what he wants—at home, in public, on his bike… If she’s a very, very good girl, she’ll get lots more of those orgasms only he can offer, and he’ll let her brother live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Romantica® contemporary erotic romance from Ellora’s Cave</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Opposites in every way . . . except the one that matters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaw Landon loved Rule Archer from the moment she laid eyes on him. Rule is everything a straight--A pre-med student like Shaw shouldn’t want--and the only person she’s never tried to please. She isn’t afraid of his scary piercings and tattoos or his wild attitude. Though she knows that Rule is wrong for her, her heart just won’t listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To a rebel like Rule Archer, Shaw Landon is a stuck-up, perfect princess-and his dead twin brother’s girl. She lives by other people’s rules; he makes his own. He doesn’t have time for a good girl like Shaw-even if she’s the only one who can see the person he truly is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a short skirt, too many birthday cocktails, and spilled secrets lead to a night neither can forget. Now, Shaw and Rule have to figure out how a girl like her and a guy like him are supposed to be together without destroying their love . . . or each other.</description>

  <description>If you’re looking for a story about a good, humble girl, who’s been hurt by someone she thought she could trust, only to find out she’s not as vulnerable as she thought she was and discovers an empowering side of herself that falls in love with the guy who helps her find that self, blah, blah, blah...then you’re gonna’ hate my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because mine is not the story you read every time you bend back the cover of the latest trend novel. It’s not the “I can do anything, now that I’ve found you/I’m misunderstood but one day you’ll find me irresistible because of it” tale. Why? Because, if I was being honest with you, I’m a complete witch. There’s nothing redeeming about me. I’m a friend using, drug abusing, sex addict from Los Angeles. I’m every girlfriend’s worst nightmare and every boy’s fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Sophie Price...And this is the story about how I went from the world’s most envied girl to the girl no one wanted around and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Come forth with an open mind, for an unconventional tale of love..&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dublin native Freda Wilson considers herself to be an acquired taste. She has a habit of making offensive jokes and speaking her mind too often. She doesn't have the best track record with first impressions, which is why she gets a surprise when her new neighbour Nicholas takes a shine to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nicholas is darkly handsome, funny and magnetic, and Freda feels like her black and white existence is plunged into a rainbow of colour when she's around him. When he walks into a room he lights it up, with his quick wit and charisma. He is a travelling cabaret performer, but Freda doesn't know exactly what that entails until the curtains pull back on his opening night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is gob-smacked and entirely intrigued to see him take to the stage in drag. Later on, Nicholas asks her if she would like to become his show assistant. Excited by the idea, she jumps at the chance. Soon she finds herself immersed in a world of wigs, make-up and high heels, surrounded by pretty men and the temptation of falling for her incredibly beautiful employer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this story of passion and sexual discovery, Nicholas and Freda will contend with jealousy, emotional highs and lows, and the kind of love that only comes around once in a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publication date: 16th December 2012.</description>

  <description>How do you keep going when you feel like your life is over?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie never thought she’d see Clay again.  So, she attempts to put her life back together after her heart has been shattered to pieces.  Moving on and moving forward, just as Clay wanted her to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clay never stopped thinking of Maggie.  Even after ripping their lives apart and leaving her behind to get the help he so desperately needed.  He is healing...slowly.  But his heart still belongs to the girl who tried to save him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a sudden tragedy brings Maggie and Clay face to face again, nothing is the same.  Yet some things never change.  Can the darkness that threatened to consume them be transformed into something else and finally give them what they always wanted?  And can two people who fought so hard to be together, finally find their happiness?  Or will their demons and fear drive them apart for good?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thing about love, is even when it destroys you, it has a way of mending what is broken.   And in the shadows, you can still see the light.</description>

  <description>Through the corridors of the Windy City’s criminal courts, single mother Libby Tucker knows exactly how far she’ll go to save her cancer-stricken son’s life. The undefeated defense attorney is prepared to take her fight all the way to the majors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Circumstances force Libby to plead her case at the cleats of celebrity baseball player Banford Aidan Palowski, the man who discarded her at their college graduation. Libby has worked her backside bare for everything she’s attained, while Aidan has been indulged since he slid through the birth canal and landed in a pile of Gold Coast money. But helping Libby and living up to his biological duty could jeopardize the only thing the jock worships: his baseball career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If baseball imitates life, Aidan admits his appears to be silver-plated peanuts, until an unexpected confrontation with the most spectacular prize that’s ever poured from a caramel corn box blindsides him. When he learns about his son’s desperate need, it pricks open the wound he’s carried since he abandoned Libby and the child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All Libby wants is a little anonymous DNA, but Aidan has a magical umpire in his head who knows Libby’s a fateball right to the heart. When a six-year-old sage and a hippy priestess step onto the field, there’s more to settle between Libby and Aidan than heartache, redemption, and forgiveness.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Daemon will do anything to get Katy back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the successful but disastrous raid on Mount Weather, he’s facing the impossible. Katy is gone. Taken. Everything becomes about finding her. Taking out anyone who stands in his way? Done. Burning down the whole world to save her? Gladly. Exposing his alien race to the world? With pleasure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Katy can do is survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surrounded by enemies, the only way she can come out of this is to adapt. After all, there are sides of Daedalus that don’t seem entirely crazy, but the group’s goals are frightening and the truths they speak even more disturbing. Who are the real bad guys? Daedalus? Mankind? Or the Luxen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together, they can face anything.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the most dangerous foe has been there all along, and when the truths are exposed and the lies come crumbling down, which side will Daemon and Katy be standing on? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And will they even be together?&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>One small town girl with a bright future. &lt;br&gt;One smokejumper with a dark past. &lt;br&gt;One summer that will forever change them both. &lt;br&gt;They’re going . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Up In Flames. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elle’s life couldn’t possibly get any more small town than it already is. She was raised in the same home as the two generations before her were, her family owns the iconic downtown cafe, and she’s been dating the pastor’s son since she was allowed to go on her first date at sixteen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole’s life couldn’t possibly get any larger. He’s tried. Roaming from town to town for the past three summers as a smokejumper, Cole dreads the thought of putting down roots. The only thing he avoids more than that is settling down with one woman, especially when there are as many willing women as there are trees in the forest he jumps out of planes to save.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elle Montgomery’s life is going one way. And Cole Carson’s is going the opposite. There’s no reason their paths should ever intersect, even in a small town in central Washington. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But summer in the Methow Valley has other plans for Elle and Cole. After an awkward run-in at the local swimming hole, Elle tries to keep away from the guy who looks at her like she’s already lying beneath him in bed. She fails. Cole is about as successful at staying away from the girl who seems immune to his charms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the summer heats up, and tensions between Elle and Cole run high, he begins to realize there’s more he’s attracted to than Elle’s body, and she discovers there’s a lot more to the man that jumps out of planes into raging forest fires than meets the eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UP IN FLAMES is a New Adult Romance intended for mature readers due to steamy content and saucy language.</description>

  <description>Kacey Cleary’s whole life imploded four years ago in a drunk-driving accident. Now she’s working hard to bury the pieces left behind—all but one. Her little sister, Livie. Kacey can swallow the constant disapproval from her born-again aunt Darla over her self-destructive lifestyle; she can stop herself from going kick-boxer crazy on Uncle Raymond when he loses the girls’ college funds at a blackjack table. She just needs to keep it together until Livie is no longer a minor, and then they can get the hell out of Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Uncle Raymond slides into bed next to Livie one night, Kacey decides it’s time to run. Armed with two bus tickets and dreams of living near the coast, Kacey and Livie start their new lives in a Miami apartment complex, complete with a grumpy landlord, a pervert upstairs, and a neighbor with a stage name perfectly matched to her chosen “profession.” But Kacey’s not worried. She can handle all of them. What she can’t handle is Trent Emerson in apartment 1D.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kacey doesn’t want to feel. She doesn’t. It’s safer that way. For everyone. But sexy Trent finds a way into her numb heart, reigniting her ability to love again. She starts to believe that maybe she can leave the past where it belongs and start over. Maybe she’s not beyond repair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Kacey isn’t the only one who’s broken. Seemingly perfect Trent has an unforgiveable past of his own; one that, when discovered, will shatter Kacey’s newly constructed life and send her back into suffocating darkness.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; "Who gives a damn about their reputation? Oh, that would be me! Especially since mine had gone straight to hell in the span of thirty minutes". &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maysie Ardin is soaking up the summer before her junior year of college, shopping, hanging by the pool and shopping some more. But when her black belt in spending lands her in trouble with her parents, she is forced to take a second job at a local bar to dig herself out of a deep financial pit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She thought she’d be miserable. But then Maysie didn’t count on Jordan Levitt, the hot, pierced and tattooed, drum playing bartender who also happens to be very interested in her. And the feelings are totally mutual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It had the makings of the perfect romantic set up. Boy meets girl. Boy likes girl. Boy has girlfriend? Okay, maybe not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But attraction is a hard thing to ignore and soon Jordan and Maysie find themselves in the middle of a gossip induced firestorm. Maysie has to learn whether she can set aside her fear of public disapproval in order to be with the one she wants. Or will she let the opinions of others dictate her life and her heart?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Secret of Ella and Micha&lt;/em&gt; comes a mesmerizing novel of fate, friendship, and the healing power of love . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE COINCIDENCE OF CALLIE &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;KAYDEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Kayden, suffering in silence was the only way to survive. If he was lucky, he could keep his head down, do as he was told, and make it through the day. But one night it seemed like his luck-and his life-might finally end . . . until an angel named Callie appeared just in time to rescue him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Callie has never believed in luck. Not since her twelfth birthday when everything was taken from her. After the worst was over, she locked up her feelings and vowed never to tell anyone what happened. Now, six years later, she continues to struggle with the painful secret that threatens to consume her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When fate lands Kayden and Callie at the same college, Kayden is determined to get to know the beautiful girl who changed his destiny. Quiet and reserved, Callie still fears letting anyone else into her world. But Kayden is certain that Callie has come back into his life for a reason. And the more he tries to be a part of her life, the more he realizes that, this time, it's Callie who needs to be saved . . .</description>

  <description>Alexis Sky Martine thinks of herself as the average girl-next-door that does what she has to do to get by, have fun and enjoy life. &lt;br&gt;She is madly in love with her sexy, drop-your-panties-at-first-sight, hottie boyfriend who is equally in love with her; more like downright obsessed. He treats her like she is his heart; like he needs her to exist; like he would do anything in his power to make her happy.&lt;br&gt;Lexi knows Landyn James loves her just as much as she loves him, if not more. Deep down, she also knows high school sweethearts aren’t expected to last, but their relationship is different. They are soul mates. Their connection is unbreakable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What could possibly go wrong when you have love like that...?&lt;br&gt;Everything.&lt;br&gt;What will the future hold...?&lt;br&gt;Only time will tell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author's Note: Contains Adult Content – Namely, a teenager-turned-woman with a very dirty mouth and fiery temper that may or may not know how to throw a punch. Also includes hot and steamy scenes, and a small glimpse into physical/verbal abuse.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The final book in The Original Sinners Series - The Red Years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's punishment-and then there's vengeance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nora Sutherlin is being held, bound and naked. Under different circumstances, she would enjoy the situation immensely, but her captor isn't interested in play. Or pity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the reality of her impending peril unfolds, Nora becomes Scheherazade, buying each hour of her life with stories-sensual tales of Søren, Kingsley and Wesley, each of whom has tempted and tested and tortured her in his own way. This, Nora realizes, is her life: nothing so simple, so vanilla, as a mere love triangle for her. It's a knot in a silken cord, a tangled mass of longings of the body and the heart and the mind. And it may unravel at any moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in Nora's world, no one is ever truly powerless-a cadre of her friends, protectors and lovers stands ready to do anything to save her, even when the only certainty seems to be sacrifice and heartbreak....</description>

  <description>Twenty-year-old Camryn Bennett had always been one to think out-of-the-box, who knew she wanted something more in life than following the same repetitive patterns and growing old with the same repetitive life story. And she thought that her life was going in the right direction until everything fell apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Determined not to dwell on the negative and push forward, Camryn is set to move in with her best friend and plans to start a new job. But after an unexpected night at the hottest club in downtown North Carolina, she makes the ultimate decision to leave the only life she’s ever known, far behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a purse, a cell phone and a small bag with a few necessities, Camryn, with absolutely no direction or purpose boards a Greyhound bus alone and sets out to find herself. What she finds is a guy named Andrew Parrish, someone not so very different from her and who harbors his own dark secrets. But Camryn swore never to let down her walls again. And she vowed never to fall in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But with Andrew, Camryn finds herself doing a lot of things she never thought she’d do. He shows her what it’s really like to live out-of-the-box and to give in to her deepest, darkest desires. On their sporadic road-trip he becomes the center of her exciting and daring new life, pulling love and lust and emotion out of her in ways she never imagined possible. But will Andrew’s dark secret push them inseparably together, or tear them completely apart?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book #2 of the Consequences Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Nichols endured the CONSEQUENCES of Anthony Rawlings’ vendetta.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she first arrived to his home, her goal was survival.  Through strength and compartmentalization Claire captivated her captor.  Her resilience in the face of his rule threatened Anthony’s well developed plan. He thought he taught her to behave-but domination became desire and Claire taught Tony to love.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their passion and adoration in a world of opulence appeared perfect, yet the reality was a roller coaster of emotion.  Claire’s world teetered on the edge of sanity as Antony monitored her every move. When given the opportunity to flee, Claire drove away—a fateful decision which began a well laid plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unbeknownst to either of them, there were others who saw past the perfect facade of Anthony Rawlings. There were others who saw the TRUTH. Conspiracy and unfulfilled promises result in an early prison release for Claire. Not just a release—a pardon. According to the law, her crime never happened! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will it be that easy? Faced with freedom from her past—can Claire seize it? Can she build a new life, mend her broken spirit, become the woman she once was, and seek her own revenge? Or is it all a game? And does the game master have different plans?&lt;br&gt;How does Sophia Burke fit into the puzzle that is Tony and Claire? Will her presence affect the future of this well esteemed man? Can he dominate twice? Is that his goal? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRUTH continues the tumultuous saga of CONSEQUENCES,introduces new players, and uncovers more intrigue. Aleatha Romig skillfully weaves past transgressions through current deception to create a fervent world of obsessed desire. In this reality can an all-consuming relationship survive? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When buried sins are discovered they threaten not only Tony and Claire’s future—but their very lives!  Will the TRUTH be revealed in time?</description>

  <description>Nineteen-year-old Cheyenne tries to portray the perfect life to mask the memories of her past. Walking in on her boyfriend with another woman her freshman year in college threatens that picture of perfection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-one-year-old Colt never wanted college and never expected to amount to anything, but when his mom's dying wish is for him to get his degree, he has no choice but to pretend it's what he wants too. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheyenne needs a fake boyfriend to get back at her ex and Colt needs cash to take care of his mom, so they strike a deal that helps them both. But what if Cheyenne’s past isn’t what she thought? Soon they’re trading one charade for another—losing themselves in each other to forget about their pain. The more they play their game, the more it becomes the only thing they have that feels real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Cheyenne and Colt know life is never easy, but neither of them expect the tragedy that threatens to end their charade and rip them apart forever.</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a story about fate or destiny. This is a story about pain, sorrow, and suffering. This is an impulsive whirlwind romance between two lovers that are not meant to be together. Theirs is not a world with sunshine and roses. Instead, their love blossoms in a secret world full of crime, violence, and death. Their story is about what can be born from nightmares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danielle “Danny” West is the daughter of Deuce West, President of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. A sweet and beautiful girl, she loses her way, searching for things that are always out of her reach. Erik “Ripper” Jacobs is the Sergeant of Arms in the Hell’s Horsemen. Once a man who always had a smile on his face, his life takes a turn for the worst when a tragedy befalls him, leaving him scarred and broken. During a midsummer night, Danny and Ripper’s paths cross, forever changing their lives. Hastily, their lust turns to love until another tragedy forces them apart. On a journey that is marred with ugliness and chaos, Danny and Ripper must discover if their unforeseen connection can find the beauty in their world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Danny and Ripper’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything has beauty. Even the ugly. Especially the ugly.&lt;br&gt;Because without ugly, there would be no beauty.</description>

  <description>Southpointe High is the last place Lucy wanted to wind up her senior year of school. Right up until she stumbles into Jude Ryder, a guy whose name has become its own verb, and synonymous with trouble. He's got a rap sheet that runs longer than a senior thesis, has had his name sighed, shouted, and cursed by more women than Lucy dares to ask, and lives at the local boys home where disturbed seems to be the status quo for the residents. Lucy had a stable at best, quirky at worst, upbringing. She lives for wearing the satin down on her ballet shoes, has her sights set on Juilliard, and has been careful to keep trouble out of her life. Up until now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jude's everything she needs to stay away from if she wants to separate her past from her future. Staying away, she's about to find out, is the only thing she's incapable of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Lucy Larson and Jude Ryder, love's about to become the thing that tears them apart.</description>

  <description>One night, Callum is driven into the woods by instinct, an instinct to protect… what, he does not know. Until he, in the form of wolf, meets a young, human child who he is instantly drawn to in a fierce way he doesn’t quite understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the end, she protects him. Then he finds this human child is his destined mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sonia Arlington has lived a lonely life. She has certain abilities that make her strange and she has a rare disease that, if untreated, could kill her. Her mother and father are assassinated but before, her father makes her vow that she will never let others discover her abilities. This forces Sonia to stay distant from others, no family, no close friends and always guarding against exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then the intelligence leaks that Sonia is Callum’s human mate. He is now King of the Werewolves and therefore she becomes targeted by the wolves who have aligned with other immortals to enslave the human race. Callum has war on his hands and is forced to claim his mate and quickly integrate Sonia into a world that is strange and frightening to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sonia attempts to adjust, not entirely successfully, Callum attempts to cope with the knowledge that his mate is mortal. He will have her beauty and gentleness only the length of a mortal life and as werewolves only have one mate their entire lives, their union for him is unbearably bitter as well as unbelievably sweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he finds that due to her illness, her human life will be even shorter and he is forced to endure the increased bitter while doing everything he can to make Sonia’s short life incredibly sweet.</description>

Mostly it makes their friends want to throw up in their mouths a little.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With two little kids and two busy lives, for the first time, Drew and Jenny aren't on the same page in the bedroom.  Drew will stop at nothing to get his previously amorous wife back in the sack, and Jenny will do anything for a full night of sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carter and Claire, and Jim and Liz are their usual (un)helpful selves and are full of advice for the discontented duo, wanting nothing more than to help restore order to the usually happy couple's lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the third and final installment of the Chocolate Lovers Series, will Drew and Jenny find the spark that's been missing in their marriage, or will the trouble they're having cause a stickier situation than the time Jenny poured honey all over Drew and he fused himself to a tree?</description>

  <description>Warning: This is not a typical love story. This is an all-consuming, soul-crushing, tear-your-heart-into-pieces story. It’s intense, gritty and raw, dark and disturbing, and it doesn’t happen overnight. This is an epic love story that knows no boundaries and has no time limits. It grows and develops—with hurt, sacrifice, and heartache—over the span of a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Fox is the princess of the Silver Demons Motorcycle Club. Growing up with bikers in the club lifestyle is all that she knows. When she’s a young girl, Eva meets the reason for her existence. Deuce West is the sexy, biker bad-ass of the Hell’s Horsemen Motorcycle Club. Like Eva, he was born and raised in the club—but that’s where the similarities end. Their first meeting is innocent, but as Eva matures into a woman, their chance reunions evolve into a fit of lust and love. Fate continues to bring them together time and time again, but their twisted journey is filled with pain, betrayal, and bloodshed that could tear them apart. Eva sees in Deuce what he cannot see in himself—a man worthy of love—and Eva spends her lifetime proving to him that her undeniable love is the one thing he can’t live without.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Eva and Deuce’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It wasn’t easy. &lt;br&gt;Nothing worth doing ever is.&lt;br&gt;And love is worth everything.</description>

  <description>The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus per­formers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;©2011 Random House Audio</description>

  <description>He counts her smiles every day and night at the train station. And morning and evening, the beautiful commuter acknowledges him—just like she does everyone else on the platform. But Blake Hartt is not like the others . . . he’s homeless. Memories of a broken childhood have robbed him of peace and twisted delusions into his soul. He stays secluded from the sun, sure the world would run from him in the harsh light of day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each day, Livia McHugh smiles politely and acknowledges her fellow commuters as she waits for the train to the city. She dismisses this kindness as nothing special, just like her. She’s the same as a million other girls—certainly no one to be cherished. But special or not, she smiles every day, never imagining that someone would rely on the simple gesture as if it were air to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the moment comes that Livia must do more than smile, without hesitation she steps into the fray to defend the homeless man. And she's surprised to discover an inexplicable connection with her new friend. After danger subsides, their smiles become conversation. Their words usher in a friendship, which awakens something in each of them. But it’s not long before their bond must prove its strength. Entanglements from the past challenge both their love and their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blake’s heart beats for Livia’s, even if her hands have to keep its rhythm. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love never fails. Love never fails, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interwoven tale of unlikely loves and relationships forged by fire, Debra Anastasia takes readers into the darkest corners of human existence, only to show them the radiant power of pure adoration and true sacrifice. Complicated families and confused souls find their way to light in this novel, which manages to be racy, profane, funny, and reverent all at once.</description>

  <description>This novel contains mature themes and graphic content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Mackenzie Taylor can't wait to be free; free from high school, the shadow of her perfect older sister, and her disapproving parents. The rebellious party girl has a perfect accomplice in best friend Riley, a boy from the wrong side of the tracks who scores them drugs, booze and under-age entry into the only club in town. But then everything changes. A traumatized Riley suddenly decides to give up the party life, and a wide-eyed Mackenzie meets Grey Lewis, a broodingly talented, gorgeous older man she falls instantly in love with. Though Riley warns her to stay away, the aspiring rock star's body and ample drug supply are too tempting for her to resist. Previously inseparable, Riley and Mackenzie go their separate ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When summer hits, Mackenzie has new friends, a new apartment and new drugs to mask the pain of Riley's absence. And of course, she has Grey. But despite the fierce, consuming passion they share, the mysterious bad-boy always leaves her guessing. Is Grey really a good guy? Or was Riley right about him all along? Mackenzie's in too deep to care. Unable to curb her mounting addictions, before long the lust-for-life teen totally loses control. She forgets Riley, forgets life, forgets everything but Grey and their next hit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But luckily for Mackenzie...Riley has never forgotten about her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;To want what you’re not supposed to have…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is only nineteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is his new stepfather’s daughter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits. His famous father’s guilt money, his mother’s desperation to win his love, and his charm are the three reasons he has never been told no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaire Wynn left her small farmhouse in Alabama, after her mother passed away, to move in with her father and his new wife in their sprawling beach house along the Florida gulf coast. She isn’t prepared for the lifestyle change and she knows she’ll never fit into this world. Then there is her sexy stepbrother who her father leaves her with for the summer while he runs off to Paris with his wife. Rush is as spoiled as he is gorgeous. He is also getting under her skin. She knows he is anything but good for her and that he’ll never be faithful to anyone. He is jaded and has secrets Blaire knows she may never uncover but even knowing all of that…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blaire just may have fallen too far.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shapeshifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you.  A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck.  I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full of rage and without a purpose, former pianist Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone discovering her past and to make the boy who took everything from her pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All 17 year-old Josh Bennett wants is to build furniture and be left alone, and everyone allows it because it’s easier to pretend he doesn’t exist.  When your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone except Nastya, a hot mess of a girl who starts showing up and won’t go away until she’s insinuated herself into every aspect of his life.  The more he gets to know her, the more of a mystery she becomes.  As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he may ever learn the secrets she’s been hiding or if he even wants to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sea of Tranquility is a slow-building, character-driven romance about a lonely boy, an emotionally fragile girl, and the miracle of second chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please Note:  This book contains mature content including profanity, drug/alcohol use, and sexual situations/language.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She is one woman he should never touch…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sole Regret’s enigmatic vocalist, Jacob “Shade” Silverton, is a consummate womanizer, but even he knows better than to get involved with one special woman from his past. Mixing friendship and pleasure can only lead to a broken heart, and he’s suffered enough heartache to swear off relationships for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;He is one man she has always desired…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amanda Lange knows all about Shade’s naughty reputation, but that doesn’t stop her from wanting to dive into the gorgeous rock star’s arms and into his bed. She convinces herself that one night of passion won’t complicate their friendship, but can she convince him of that?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re both playing with fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither of them realized how far one kiss would take them. As the flames of their passion ignite with the intensity of an inferno, will either of them escape the experience without being burned or will both be branded fool enough to take a chance on a relationship that was marked for ruin before it even began?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob and Amanda's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Book 8: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17899118.Treat_Me" title="Treat Me"&gt;Treat Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released) and Book 13: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490405.Teach_Me" title="Teach Me"&gt;Teach Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released)</description>

  <description>Way too young, eleven year old Tucker Creed and his six year old neighbor, Sylvie Bissenette, find they have something awful in common. Creed then decides he’s going to do everything in his limited power to shield his Sylvie from her ordeal. So he does and Creed and Sylvie form a bond that grows and blossoms with their ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They plot to leave their lives behind, the town they live in that will hold them down and the histories they share that, unless they break free, will bury them. Sylvie goes to their special place, Creed never shows and she doesn’t see him again until it’s too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Creed gone, Sylvie is forced to endure a nightmare and do the unspeakable to end it. To deal, she develops a hard shell with sharp edges that very few can break through. So when Creed again finds his Sylvie, he discovers the girl he loved is locked away and he has to find his way back into her heart without getting shredded in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;No one is like Daemon Black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he set out to prove his feelings for me, he wasn’t fooling around. Doubting him isn’t something I’ll do again, and now that we’ve made it through the rough patches, well... There’s a lot of spontaneous combustion going on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But even he can’t protect his family from the danger of trying to free those they love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After everything, I’m no longer the same Katy. I’m different... And I’m not sure what that will mean in the end. When each step we take in discovering the truth puts us in the path of the secret organization responsible for torturing and testing hybrids, the more I realize there is no end to what I’m capable of. The death of someone close still lingers, help comes from the most unlikely source, and friends will become the deadliest of enemies, but we won’t turn back. Even if the outcome will shatter our worlds forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together we’re stronger... and they know it.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Violet Winters once had it all but lost it when her husband was murdered by a criminal madman. During a cold winter night Violet has to leave her warm bed to tell her neighbor to turn the music down. And that’s when she meets sinister, scarred, scarily attractive security specialist, Joe Callahan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wants to deny it, but Violet can’t beat back the hunger she feels for Joe so she gives in again and again. Feeling it himself, Joe feeds Vi’s hunger, breaking his own rules to keep her in his bed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Violet had only one man in her life, she’s sure Joe is giving her the signals and Vi decides she’s ready to take a second chance at life and, maybe, love. But Violet doesn’t know the dark secrets in Joe’s past, secrets so soul-wrenching, they’ve drained him dry. With nothing left to give, Joe’s determined to live his life alone and he breaks Violet’s heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crushed by Joe’s betrayal, Violet comes to terms with the fact that, no matter what signals he gave, Joe was not theirs to win. But Violet’s husband’s murderer is obsessed with her and heartbreak again haunts the door of the Winters home. When it does Joe is forced to face the knowledge that he can’t fight Violet’s pull, she’s under his skin and filled him full to bursting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe needs to win her back and put his life on the line to keep Violet safe. But, having had it all once, can Violet endure losing Joe?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Ryan lowers his lips to my ear. "Dance with me, Beth."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"No." I whisper the reply. I hate him and I hate myself for wanting him to touch me again....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I dare you..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone knew the truth about Beth Risk's home life, they'd send her mother to jail and seventeen-year-old Beth who knows where. So she protects her mom at all costs. Until the day her uncle swoops in and forces Beth to choose between her mom's freedom and her own happiness. That's how Beth finds herself living with an aunt who doesn't want her and going to a school that doesn't understand her. At all. Except for the one guy who shouldn't get her, but does....&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan Stone is the town golden boy, a popular baseball star jock-with secrets he can't tell anyone. Not even the friends he shares everything with, including the constant dares to do crazy things. The craziest? Asking out the Skater girl who couldn't be less interested in him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what begins as a dare becomes an intense attraction neither Ryan nor Beth expected. Suddenly, the boy with the flawless image risks his dreams-and his life-for the girl he loves, and the girl who won't let anyone get too close is daring herself to want it all....</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Jocelyn Butler&lt;/strong&gt; has been hiding from her past for years. But all her secrets are about to be laid bare…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Four years ago, Jocelyn left her tragic past behind in the States and started over in Scotland, burying her grief, ignoring her demons, and forging ahead without attachments. Her solitary life is working well—until she moves into a new apartment on Dublin Street where she meets a man who shakes her carefully guarded world to its core.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Braden Carmichael&lt;/strong&gt; is used to getting what he wants, and he’s determined to get Jocelyn into his bed. Knowing how skittish she is about entering a relationship, Braden proposes an arrangement that will satisfy their intense attraction without any strings attached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But after an intrigued Jocelyn accepts, she realizes that Braden won’t be satisfied with just mind-blowing passion. The stubborn Scotsman is intent on truly knowing her… down to the very soul.</description>

  <description>Carter, Claire and Gavin have formed the perfect little family.  Their friends are getting married and everyone is growing up, maturing and ready to face the future.  Or are they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From bachelorette party hell, porn addictions, dinner roll baseball and botched wedding proposals to finding out everyone's extended family is chock full of crazy, Carter and Claire begin to question the strength of the ties that bind them.  Unfortunately, these ties have nothing to do with fuzzy handcuffs and everything to do with the mounting differences between them.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will their friends make a mess of things with their inappropriate comments and need to know everything, or will they convince the couple that happily-ever-after sometimes really can start with beer pong?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The sexy second installment in the Inside Out erotic romance trilogy, following &lt;em&gt;If I Were You&lt;/em&gt;—in the seductive tradition of &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fascinated by the dark fantasies in the journals she’s discovered, and the two men who have now found a place in her life, Sara McMillan finds herself torn between her new life and her past. Now, more than ever, Sara identifies with the lost journal writer, Rebecca, and is certain that something sinister has happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the arms of the sexy, tormented artist Chris Merit, Sara seeks answers about Rebecca and ends up discovering things about herself she never knew existed. Chris forces Sara to reconsider who she is and what she truly wants from life, but not before his dark desires threaten to tear them apart. Her boss, Mark Compton, offers her the shelter to understand just what those needs mean to her, and what they might have meant to Rebecca, but can she trust him to lead her to a final conclusion to Rebecca’s story?</description>

  <description>When Sara McMillan finds a stack of journals in a storage unit, she’s shocked and enthralled by the erotic life the writer led. Unable to stop reading, she vicariously lives out dark fantasies through Rebecca, the writer—until the terrifying final entry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certain something sinister has happened, Sara sets out to discover the facts, immersing herself in Rebecca’s life. Soon she’s working at the art gallery Rebecca worked at and meeting Rebecca’s friends. Finding herself drawn to two dangerously sexy men, the manager of the gallery and a famed artist, Sara realizes she’s going down the same path Rebecca took.  But with the promise of her dark needs being met by a man with confident good looks and a desire for control, she’s not sure anything else matters. Just the burn for more.</description>

  <description>Claire is a twenty-something, single mom that grudgingly helps her best friend sell sex toys while she attempts to make enough money to start her own business to give her foul-mouthed, but extremely loveable (when he's asleep) toddler a better life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carter, the one-night-stand from her past that changed her life forever, shows up in her hometown bar without any recollection of her besides her unique chocolate scent, Claire will make it a point that he remembers her this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Carter's undisguised shock at suddenly finding out he has a four-year-old son and Claire's panic that her stretch marks and slim to none bedroom experience will send the man of her dreams heading for the hills, the pair will do whatever they can to get their happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: contains explicit sex, profanity and enough sarcasm to choke a horse.</description>

  <description>Leah Buchanan’s family has been in service to vampires for five centuries. Even so, Leah wants nothing to do with her family’s legacy but when she’s summoned to her Selection by the Vampire Dominion, under familial pressure, she has no choice but to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucien has been living under the strict edicts of the Vampire Dominion for centuries but he’s tired of these ancient laws stripping away everything that is the essence of the vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So he’s taking it back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is because Lucien has also been watching and waiting for decades for Leah to become available for a Selection and he will not be limited with what he can do with her. He will have her, all of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, Lucien is going to tame Leah, even if he gets hunted and killed for doing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What neither Leah nor Lucien expects is the strong bond that will form between them, connecting them on unprecedented levels for mortals or immortals. And what will grow between them means they will challenge their ways of life and their union will begin the Prophesies which makes them one of three couples who will save humanity… or die in the effort.</description>

  <description>Lauren Grahame has spent her whole life thinking something special was going to happen. She didn’t know what it was, she just knew it would one day be hers. But she learned the hard way that special wasn’t on offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, after divorcing her cheating husband, Lauren searched for nothing special and she thought she found it when she landed a job as a waitress in a biker bar in Carnal. It was perfect: a nothing job in a nowhere bar in Nowheresville.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Tatum Jackson walked in. Part-owner of the bar, he took one look at high-class Lauren and wanted nothing to do with her. And he made this known, loudly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tate’s angry insults seared in her brain, Lauren decides the feeling is mutual and she doesn’t want anything to do with the gloriously handsome Tate Jackson. The clash of the bartender and barmaid begins but, even though Tate makes his change of mind clear (in biker-speak, a language Lauren is not fluent in), Lauren is intent on going her own way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until a serial killer hits Carnal and Lauren finds out Tate isn’t a bartender, he’s a bounty hunter. He stakes his claim for Lauren before he goes on the hunt for a killer but Laurie doesn’t speak biker nor does she understand bounty hunters and Tate comes back from the hunt to find his old lady has moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life throws curveball after curveball at Laurie and Tate. As secrets are revealed, women are brutally murdered, and Lauren tries to find her inner biker babe.</description>

  <description>There are some mistakes we make that we will regret for the rest of our lives.  For Christian, it was the day he betrayed Elizabeth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christian Davison has a plan for his life.  He is determined to become an attorney and to one day take his place as partner in his father’s law firm.  Nothing will stand in his way, not even Elizabeth Ayers and their unborn child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Christian cuts her from his life, Elizabeth spends the next five years struggling to provide for her daughter and willing to sacrifice anything to give her child a safe, comfortable life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For five years, Christian has regretted the day he walked away from his family and will do anything to win them back just as Elizabeth will do anything to protect her daughter from the certain heartache she believes Christian will bring upon them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Christian wrestles his way into their lives, Elizabeth is faced with asking herself if it is possible to forgive someone when they’ve committed the unforgivable and if it is possible to find a love after it has been buried in years of hate.  Or are there some wounds that go so deep they can never heal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say everyone deserves a second chance.</description>

  <description>The day Preston Drake figured out that wealthy women paid well for a set of tight abs and a pretty face his life turned around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The run down rat-infested trailer he had shared with his alcoholic mother and three younger siblings was now only a place he visited to pay the bills and stock the pantry with food. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He no longer worried about his family starving or living without electricity. The money he made entertaining rich older women more than covered his family’s needs and his own. He had it all figured out.  Except…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was this girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was as innocent as he was tainted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amanda Hardy wished her knees didn’t get weak when Preston walked into a room. She hated the fact her heart raced when he flashed his smile in her direction. He had a different girl in his bed every night. He was the kind of boy a smart girl ran from. So, why was she coming up with ways to get close to him? Even when it was obvious he wanted to keep her at a distance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe her heart knew something the world didn’t. Maybe Preston Drake was more than just a pretty face.</description>

  <description>When struggling waitress Melody Dylan gives a handsome, lonely stranger a simple gift she has no clue her life is about to take a drastic turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stranger ends up being Clay Powers, a famous UFC heavyweight fighter. Clay’s large build and dangerous fists have always intimidated. People in his hometown keep their distance and Clay is fine with that. Everything changes when a new waitress at the local diner buys him a piece of pie on thanksgiving. Touched by the gesture when it’s obvious she can barely afford to survive, her warm smile and lush body churn up powerful feelings that leave Clay wanting more from her than pie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melody is running from her past and the small, country town of Garnet is the perfect hiding place. With an ex-husband after her and scars from her abusive marriage etched deep, the last thing she expects is to fall for a man who makes a living with his fists, but she can’t resist Clay or the tender connection they share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding love in the most unlikely of places, the passion is undeniable, but Clay and Melody know their haunted pasts and unpredictable futures leave the odds stacked against them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: violence.</description>

  <description>Maybe driving home after a few (or more) shots of tequila had been a bad idea, but hell, he did it all the time. The cops had to have been freaking bored to have pulled him over. He wasn’t even swerving! That’s Cage York’s story and he’s sticking to it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, his baseball coach isn’t buying it. Cage has a free ride to the local junior college for baseball -- or he did, until he’d gotten a DUI. Now, Cage has to decide: does he drop out and give up his dream of getting noticed by a college in the SEC, and possibly making it into the Major Leagues -- or does he give in to his coach’s demands and spend his summer baling hay?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eva Brooks planned out her life step by step when she was eight years old. Not once over the years had she lost sight of her goals. Josh Beasley, her next door neighbor, had been the center of those goals. He’d been her first boyfriend at seven, her first kiss at ten, her first date at fifteen, and her first tragedy at eighteen. The moment she’d received the phone call from Josh’s mother saying he’d been killed along with four other soldiers just north of Baghdad, Eva’s carefully planned life imploded in the worst way possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cage isn’t real happy with his closet-sized bedroom in the back of a foul smelling barn, or his daily interactions with cows, but he knows that if he doesn’t make his coach happy then he can kiss his scholarship goodbye. Only a sick and twisted man would decide his punishment was to be working on a farm all summer. No hot babes in bikinis waiting to meet a Southern boy to make her vacation complete. Just him and the damned cows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh -- and an uptight, snarky brunette with the biggest blue eyes he’s every seen. But she doesn’t count, because as hard as he’s tried to charm her out of her panties - he’s pretty sure she’d rather see him hung from the rafters than let him get a taste of her pretty little lips.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;No safe word can protect the heart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Infamous erotica author and accomplished dominatrix Nora Sutherlin is doing something utterly out of character: hiding. While her longtime lover, Søren—whose fetishes, if exposed, would be his ruin—is under scrutiny pending a major promotion, Nora's lying low and away from temptation in the lap of luxury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her host, the wealthy and uninhibited Griffin Fiske, is thrilled to have Nora stay at his country estate, especially once he meets her traveling companion. Young, inexperienced and angelically beautiful, Michael has become Nora's protégé, and this summer with Griffin is going to be his training, where the hazing never ends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while her flesh is willing, Nora's mind is wandering. To thoughts of Søren, her master, under investigation by a journalist with an ax to grind. And to another man from Nora's past, whose hold on her is less bruising, but whose secrets are no less painful. It's a summer that will prove the old adage: love hurts.</description>

  <description>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful executive named Juliana Crowne, whose life appeared to be charmed, right down to her seemingly perfect boyfriend. But long-denied forbidden fantasies have a way of bubbling to the surface and refusing to be ignored. When Juliana succumbs to her dark desires one day at work, believing her internet travels to be untraceable, her online journey into BDSM is discovered by dangerously attractive Alexander Knight, the one man capable of exposing her or bringing all her fantasies to life. Ruggedly handsome, self-assured and mischievous, Alexander launches a game of cat-and-mouse from the bowels of the corporation to ensnare the lovely Juliana. But will Alexander become entangled in the web of decadent desires and succumb to Juliana's considerable charms? With everything on the line, can they trust each other and earn their chance at Happily Ever After? A modern-day, upside-down BDSM Cinderella story told in exactly 100-word drabble chapters.</description>

  <description>Southpointe High is the last place Lucy wanted to wind up her senior year of school. Right up until she stumbles into Jude Ryder, a guy whose name has become its own verb, and synonymous with trouble. He's got a rap sheet that runs longer than a senior thesis, has had his name sighed, shouted, and cursed by more women than Lucy dares to ask, and lives at the local boys home where disturbed seems to be the status quo for the residents. Lucy had a stable at best, quirky at worst, upbringing. She lives for wearing the satin down on her ballet shoes, has her sights set on Juilliard, and has been careful to keep trouble out of her life. Up until now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jude's everything she needs to stay away from if she wants to separate her past from her future. Staying away, she's about to find out, is the only thing she's incapable of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Lucy Larson and Jude Ryder, love's about to become the thing that tears them apart.</description>

  <description>"I won't tell anyone, Echo. I promise." Noah tucked a curl behind my ear. It had been so long since someone touched me like he did. Why did it have to be Noah Hutchins? His dark brown eyes shifted to my covered arms. "You didn't do that-did you? It was done to you?" No one ever asked that question. They stared. They whispered. They laughed. But they never asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So wrong for each other...and yet so right.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows what happened the night Echo Emerson went from popular girl with jock boyfriend to gossiped-about outsider with "freaky" scars on her arms. Even Echo can't remember the whole truth of that horrible night. All she knows is that she wants everything to go back to normal. But when Noah Hutchins, the smoking-hot, girl-using loner in the black leather jacket, explodes into her life with his tough attitude and surprising understanding, Echo's world shifts in ways she could never have imagined. They should have nothing in common. And with the secrets they both keep, being together is pretty much&lt;em&gt; impossible.&lt;/em&gt;Yet the crazy attraction between them refuses to go away. And Echo has to ask herself just how far they can push the limits and what she'll risk for the one guy who might teach her how to love again.</description>

  <description>That Boy is a contemporary romance about falling in love with the boys next door.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, being friends with two cute boys does have its benefits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's Danny. Danny is a golden boy in every way. He has dreamy blue eyes and blonde hair that always looks perfect, even when it’s windblown or been stuck under a football helmet. He’s the boy every girl crushes on. The boy I get into trouble with, the boy I fight with, the hot quarterback no girl can resist, not even me. Being with Danny is like being on an adventure. He has a bright, contagious smile and abs to die for. He’s pretty much irresistible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equally crush worthy is Phillip. Adorable, sweet Phillip, who I have known since birth.  Phillip has dark hair, a perfect smile, brown eyes, and the sexiest voice I have ever heard. He’s the boy I talk to every night before I go to sleep. The boy who rescues me, the boy who can read my mind, the boy who is always there for me, the boy who tries to keep me out of trouble, the boy who irritatingly keeps getting hotter, and whose strong arms always seem to find their way around me.  And when he gives me that grin, I can never say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One boy will give me my very first kiss.&lt;br&gt;One boy will teach me to make out.&lt;br&gt;One boy will take me to prom.&lt;br&gt;And finally, one boy will ask me to marry him.&lt;br&gt;They will both be my best friends.&lt;br&gt;But only one of them will be the boy I fall in love with.&lt;br&gt;Only one of them is That Boy.</description>

  <description>17-year-old Kate has lived her whole life in abject poverty, with an alcoholic father and drug-addicted mother, who severely abuses Kate. At school, her second-hand clothing marks her as a target. Her refusal to stand up for herself makes her the recipient of her classmates taunts and bullying. That is, until Henry returns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Henry Jamison moved away six years earlier, just as he and Kate had begun an to develop feelings for one another. He returns to find the bright, funny, outgoing girl he had known now timidly hiding in corners, barely speaking to anyone around her, suspicious of even him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate can’t figure out what game Henry is playing with her - for surely it is a game. What else would the gorgeous, popular boy from her past want with her? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate finally decides to trust Henry’s intentions, opening her heart to him. Just when it seems he might be genuine in his friendship, tragedy strikes, threatening everything Kate has worked so hard to gain. Can Henry help her to overcome this new devastation, or will it tear them apart forever?</description>

  <description>No connections. Play it safe. These were the rules Ivey lived her life by.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she hit Mustang, Colorado, a perfectly imperfect town where the citizens were welcoming and one of them included the tall, beautiful, macho man rancher cowboy, Grayson Cody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the run for a decade, Ivey knew she was supposed to play it safe. But she was tired of being on the run. She wanted a normal. She wanted real. She wanted a home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she wanted Grayson Cody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Grayson Cody wanted Ivey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one who looked at them couldn’t see they belonged together. There was one man in this world for Ivey and one woman in this world for Grayson Cody.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So they fell in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But just as quickly as they fell together, they were betrayed and torn apart. Separated for years, Ivey was certain her life would not include her rancher cowboy. Until the town of Mustang reached out to her when Gray was in trouble. Even though she thought he broke her heart, she charged in to help. Then Gray and Ivey discovered they were betrayed and, not only that, Gray had an enemy who would stop at nothing to defeat him.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The first in &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Alice Clayton’s Redhead series is a playful and erotic romance between an aspiring actress and Hollywood’s hottest new leading man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Grace Sheridan returns to Los Angeles to become a working actress, it’s a second shot at a life-long dream. With some help from her best-friend agent, will that dream become a reality—or at thirty-three, has Grace missed her chance at the big time? And when an unexpected sizzling romance with Jack Hamilton, the entertainment industry's newest “it” boy, threatens to shine an uncomfortable spotlight on her life, how will that affect her career…and his?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funny, borderline neurotic Grace is perfect in her imperfections, and the sexual chemistry between her and charming yet blissfully unaware Jack is off the charts. With laugh-out-loud dialogue and a super-steamy romance that will get your heart racing, sneaking around in L.A. and dodging the paparazzi has never been so fun.</description>

  <description>Makenna James thinks her day can’t get any worse, until she finds herself stuck in a pitch-black elevator with a complete stranger. Distracted by a phone call and juggling too much stuff, the pin-striped accountant caught only a glimpse of a dragon tattoo on his hand before the lights went out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caden Grayson is amused when a redhead literally falls at his feet. His amusement turns to panic when the power fails. Despite his piercings, tats, and vicious scar, he’s terrified of the dark and confined spaces. Now, he’s trapped in his own worst nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To fight fear, they must both reach out and open up. With no preconceived notions based on looks to hold them back, they discover just how much they have in common. In the warming darkness, attraction grows and sparks fly, but will they feel the same when the lights come back on?</description>

  <description>While drinking cosmopolitans, Gwendolyn Kidd meets the man of her dreams. Then she takes him home. Then she wakes up alone. But her fear that she lost her dream man turns into a relationship with a mystery man when, night after night in the dead of night, he comes back for more. Hoping it will blossom into something real, she lets him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she doesn’t even know his name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gwen’s struggling with the decision to end their crazy non-relationship when her sister-from-hell, Ginger’s best friend pays a visit and warns Gwen that if she and her sister don't get smart, they'll both get d-e-a-d, dead. Gwen has no clue what’s going on but she’s used to Ginger’s antics and decides to lay the problem on her sister’s biker boyfriend's doorstep. Bad choice. She hits the Denver Underground radar with a big, loud ping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means Gwen’s Mystery Man, Cabe “Hawk” Delgado has to step in to keep her safe. But when Hawk gets a dose of Gwen in the daylight, he makes the decision that he finally wants real with Gwen. However when Gwen gets a dose of badass, bossy, straight-talker Hawk in the daylight, she decides she’s done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus begins the head-to-head of the Commando vs. Cosmo Girl as Hawk woos Gwen in his own unique way, Gwen survives firebombs, drive-bys, kidnappings, hot pursuits by biker hotties and gorgeous police detectives and discovers the heartbreaking reason why Hawk kept her at arm’s length.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as all this happens, Gwen finds that her sister’s troubles are serious trouble and she must decide who to keep alive: her sister-from-hell or the man of her dreams.</description>

  <description>For college student Emily Sheppard, the thought of spending a summer alone in New York is much more preferable than spending it in France with her parents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just completing her freshman year at Callister University, Emily faces a quiet summer in the city slums, supporting herself by working at the campus library.&lt;br&gt;During one of her jogs through the nearby cemetery while visiting her brother Bill’s grave, Emily witnesses a brutal killing—and then she blacks out. When Emily regains consciousness, she realizes she’s been kidnapped by a young crime boss and his gang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is hurled into a secret underworld, wondering why she is still alive and for how long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Held captive in rural Vermont, she tries to make sense of her situation and what it means. While uncovering secrets about her brother and his untimely death, Emily falls in love with her very rich and very dangerous captor, twenty- six-year-old Cameron. She understands it’s a forbidden love and one that won’t allow her to return to her previous life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But love may not be enough to save Emily when no one even knows she is missing.</description>

  <description>This month my name is Mary. My name is different every month—Brandy, Honey, Amy…sometimes Joe doesn't even bother to ask—but he never fails to arouse me with his body, his mouth, his touch, no matter what I'm called or where he picks me up. The sex is always amazing, always leaves me itching for more in those long weeks until I see him again.&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My real name is Sadie, and once a month over lunch Joe tells me about his latest conquest. But what Joe doesn't know is that, in my mind, I'm the star of every X-rated one-night stand he has revealed to me, or that I'm practically obsessed with our imaginary sex life. I know it's wrong. I know my husband wouldn't understand. But I can't stop. Not yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>For the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melanie has no desire to meet the members of the rock band, Sole Regret, but her groupie of a best friend gets them both backstage and then rushes off with the band’s lead singer. Left alone at an after party with a bunch of scary tattooed and pierced metal-heads, sheltered Melanie is relieved when the only normal-looking guy in the room insists on keeping her company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the time Melanie discovers that Gabe is the band’s drummer and not as normal as she assumed, she has already made a complete fool of herself. She can’t help but be interested in him, not as a rock star, but as the sexiest man she’s ever encountered. Strangely attracted to his hidden tattoos and body piercing, she wonders what it would be like to spend a night with a bad boy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe is more than willing to show sweet Melanie there’s more to him than meets the eye. All she has to do is try him. Will they only share a single night of passion? Or will their hearts entangle as quickly as their bodies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Contains explicit sex, graphic language, and a hot rock star with a naughty and inventive mind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe and Melanie's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Book 6: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17832488.Tell_Me" title="Tell Me"&gt;Tell Me&lt;/a&gt; and Book 11: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490402.Trust_Me" title="Trust Me"&gt;Trust Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released).</description>

  <description>Sweet tea, corn bread, and soup beans—everyday fare for eight-year-old Alix French, the precocious darling of a respected southern family. But nothing was ordinary about the day she met ten-year-old Nick Anderson, a boy from the wrong side of town. Armed with only a tin of bee balm and steely determination, Alix treats the raw evidence of a recent beating that mars his back, an act that changes both of their lives forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through childhood disasters and teenage woes they cling together as friendship turns to love. The future looks rosy until the fateful night when Frank Anderson, Nick's abusive father, is shot to death in his filthy trailer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Nick is gone—leaving Alix alone, confused and pregnant. For the next fifteen years she wrestles with the pain of Nick's abandonment, a bad marriage, her family and friends. But finally, she's starting to get her life back together. Her divorce is almost final, her business is booming, and she's content if not happy—until the day she looks up and sees Nick standing across the counter. He's back…and he's not alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once again Alix is plunged into turmoil and pain as Nick tries to win her love, something she resists with all her strength. Only one thing might break the protective wall she's built around her emotions—the truth about Frank Anderson's death. But when that truth comes out and those walls crumble, neither Alix nor Nick is prepared for the emotional explosion that could destroy as well as heal.</description>

  <description>Ashton is getting tired of being good, of impressing her parents and playing ideal girlfriend to Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer is perfect, a regular Prince Charming, but when he leaves town for the summer, it’s his cousin Beau who catches Ashton’s eye. Beau is the sexiest guy she’s ever seen, and even though he’s dangerous, Ashton is drawn to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beau loves his cousin like a brother, so the last thing he wants to do is make a move on Sawyer’s girl. Ashton is off-limits, absolutely. That’s why he does his best to keep his distance, even though he’s been in love with her forever. When Ashton wants to rekindle their childhood friendship in Sawyer’s absence, Beau knows he should say no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashton and Beau don’t want to hurt Sawyer. But the more they try to stay away from each other, the more intense their urges become. It’s getting way too hard to resist....</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;Written in her wonderfully honest, edgy, passionate and often hilarious voice, Tiffanie DeBartolo tells the story of Eliza Caelum, a young music journalist, and Paul Hudson, a talented songwriter and lead singer of the band Bananafish. Eliza's reverence for rock is equaled only by Paul's, and the two fall wildly in love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bananafish is signed by a big corporate label, and Paul is on his way to becoming a major rock star, Eliza must make a heartbreaking decision that leads to Paul's sudden disappearance and a surprise knock-your-socks-off ending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Jack and Lexi never had a typical relationship. After 2 years without speaking, she receives a phone call that changes everything. He unexpectedly asks her to convince the new girl, Bekah, that he's ready to commit. Jack is calling now after everything they had been through because there is another woman. She can't believe it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Follow Lexi in this heart wrenching drama as she relives her past relationship, or lack thereof, with Jack, and not just in her own mind, but to his fiance-to-be. Throw in Bekah's hot brother who always seems to be in the right place at the right time, a past with more secrets to unravel than you can even imagine, and you get a recipe for disaster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out what happens to Lexi as she travels to Atlanta to get the closure she so desperately desires from Jack, and how the bumps of life seem to keep getting in the way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Words: 152,477 (approximate)*</description>

  <description>I've spent most of my life trying to make it to a future that still hasn't happened, or avoid a past that won't let me go. I don't remember when I've ever just stopped to live in the present, to hold on to the seconds I'm in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's so much more to life than breathing.</description>

  <description>There has only been three people in Jaxxon Carter's life who truly mattered to her. Her mum, who committed suicide. Her sister, who she hasn’t seen since her teens. And Connor McKenzie, who disappeared from her life the same day he left their foster home. The hardest part of that was that he never completely left her life because she was forever seeing him on T.V. or in magazines as a Formula One Driver. But Jaxxon refuses to live a ‘woe is me’ life, even in spite of living alone in her one-roomed flat and being expected to survive on a ridiculously low income. Then one night she is offered a modelling job and before she knows it she has been catapulted to the peak of success, gaining fame, fortune and security. Oh and a stalker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connor McKenzie is busy trying to shake off his crazy ex-girlfriend – another woman who thought she could get around his no marriage rule – when he sees Jaxxon on the cover of a magazine. Remembering how close they had once been, he’s shocked when she doesn’t respond to his attempts to contact her and then acts indifferently to him when they meet. But Connor can’t let it go. The only reason he had kept his hands off her ten years ago was that she had been younger than him. Now that they’re adults, he isn’t prepared to allow anything – not even Jaxxon – to stop him from having her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This novel contains a bitchy female who curses like a sailor, a persistent alpha male who doesn’t understand the word ‘no’, and explicit hot sex in some very public places.</description>

  <description>Caleb is a man with a singular interest in revenge. Kidnapped as a young boy and sold into slavery by a power-hungry mobster, he has thought of nothing but vengeance. For twelve years he has immersed himself in the world of pleasure slaves searching for the one man he holds ultimately responsible. Finally, the architect of his suffering has emerged with a new identity, but not a new nature. If Caleb is to get close enough to strike, he must become the very thing he abhors and kidnap a beautiful girl to train her to be all that he once was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen-year-old Olivia Ruiz has just woken up in a strange place. Blindfolded and bound, there is only a calm male voice to welcome her. His name is Caleb, though he demands to be called Master. Olivia is young, beautiful, naïve and willful to a fault. She has a dark sensuality that cannot be hidden or denied, though she tries to accomplish both. Although she is frightened by the strong, sadistic, and arrogant man who holds her prisoner, what keeps Olivia awake in the dark is her unwelcome attraction to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WARNING: This book contains very disturbing situations, dubious consent, strong language, and graphic violence.</description>

  <description>Olivia Kaspen has just discovered that her ex-boyfriend, Caleb Drake, has lost his memory. With an already lousy reputation for taking advantage of situations, Olivia must decide how far she is willing to go to get Caleb back. Wrestling to keep her true identity and their sordid past under wraps, Olivia’s greatest obstacle is Caleb’s wicked, new girlfriend; Leah Smith. It is a race to the finish as these two vipers engage in a vicious tug of war to possess a man who no longer remembers them. But, soon enough Olivia must face the consequences of her lies, and in the process discover that sometimes love falls short of redemption.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;"No one tried to get involved with me, and I kept to myself.  This was the place where everything was supposed to be safe and easy.  How could Evan Mathews unravel my constant universe in just one day?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the affluent town of Weslyn, Connecticut, where most people worry about what to be seen in and who to be seen with, Emma Thomas would rather not be seen at all. She’s more concerned with feigning perfection while pulling down her sleeves to conceal the bruises - not wanting anyone to know how far from perfect her life truly is. Without expecting it, she finds love. It challenges her to recognize her own worth - but at the risk of revealing the terrible secret she’s desperate to hide. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reason to Breathe is an electrifying page turner from start to finish, a unique tale of life-changing love, unspeakable cruelty, and one girl’s fragile grasp of hope.</description>

  <description>Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We’d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...</description>

  <description>Starting over sucks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we moved to West Virginia right before my senior year, I'd pretty much resigned myself to thick accents, dodgy internet access, and a whole lot of boring.... until I spotted my hot neighbor, with his looming height and eerie green eyes. Things were looking up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he opened his mouth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daemon is infuriating. Arrogant. Stab-worthy. We do not get along. At all. But when a stranger attacks me and Daemon literally freezes time with a wave of his hand, well, something...unexpected happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hot alien living next door marks me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You heard me. Alien. Turns out Daemon and his sister have a galaxy of enemies wanting to steal their abilities, and Daemon's touch has me lit up like the Vegas Strip. The only way I'm getting out of this alive is by sticking close to Daemon until my alien mojo fades. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I don't kill him first, that is.</description>

  <description>He counts her smiles every day and night at the train station. And morning and evening, the beautiful commuter acknowledges him—just like she does everyone else on the platform. But Blake Hartt is not like the others . . . he’s homeless. Memories of a broken childhood have robbed him of peace and twisted delusions into his soul. He stays secluded from the sun, sure the world would run from him in the harsh light of day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each day, Livia McHugh smiles politely and acknowledges her fellow commuters as she waits for the train to the city. She dismisses this kindness as nothing special, just like her. She’s the same as a million other girls—certainly no one to be cherished. But special or not, she smiles every day, never imagining that someone would rely on the simple gesture as if it were air to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the moment comes that Livia must do more than smile, without hesitation she steps into the fray to defend the homeless man. And she's surprised to discover an inexplicable connection with her new friend. After danger subsides, their smiles become conversation. Their words usher in a friendship, which awakens something in each of them. But it’s not long before their bond must prove its strength. Entanglements from the past challenge both their love and their lives.&lt;br&gt;Blake’s heart beats for Livia’s, even if her hands have to keep its rhythm. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love never fails. Love never fails, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interwoven tale of unlikely loves and relationships forged by fire, Debra Anastasia takes readers into the darkest corners of human existence, only to show them the radiant power of pure adoration and true sacrifice. Complicated families and confused souls find their way to light in this novel, which manages to be racy, profane, funny, and</description>

  <description>The #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling book from new adult phenomenon S.C. Stephens&amp;amp;#8212;even a rock star&amp;amp;#8217;s life isn&amp;amp;#8217;t always perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can love survive when life gets Reckless?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the band hits it big, Kiera and Kellan must ask themselves: Can their love for each other withstand the constant pressures of superstardom? The friendships they&amp;amp;#8217;ve formed, the new family they&amp;amp;#8217;ve found, and the history they&amp;amp;#8217;ve forged will all play a part in helping them navigate the turbulent waters of the band&amp;amp;#8217;s exploding popularity. A greedy executive hell-bent on success, a declining pop star looking for an edge, and a media circus that twists lies into truths are just some of the obstacles the lovers will have to overcome if they are going to remain together. Fame comes with a price&amp;amp;#8212;but will it cost Kiera and Kellan everything?</description>

  <description>When thirty-year-old English teacher Anna Emerson is offered a job tutoring T.J. Callahan at his family's summer rental in the Maldives, she accepts without hesitation; a working vacation on a tropical island trumps the library any day. T.J. Callahan has no desire to leave town, not that anyone asked him. He's almost seventeen and if having cancer wasn't bad enough, now he has to spend his first summer in remission with his family - and a stack of overdue assignments - instead of his friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna and T.J. are en route to join T.J.'s family in the Maldives when the pilot of their seaplane suffers a fatal heart attack and crash-lands in the Indian Ocean. Adrift in shark-infested waters, their life jackets keep them afloat until they make it to the shore of an uninhabited island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Anna and T.J. just want to survive and they must work together to obtain water, food, fire, and shelter. Their basic needs might be met but as the days turn to weeks, and then months, the castaways encounter plenty of other obstacles, including violent tropical storms, the many dangers lurking in the sea, and the possibility that T.J.'s cancer could return. As T.J. celebrates yet another birthday on the island, Anna begins to wonder if the biggest challenge of all might be living with a boy who is gradually becoming a man.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;An A-List Movie Star. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Christensen just wanted to be an actor. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine a life where fans would chase him, paparazzi would stalk him, and Hollywood studios would want to own him. While filming in Seaport, Rhode Island, Ryan ducks into a neighborhood bar for a quick escape from legions of screaming fans . . . and finds much more than he expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Small-Town Girl. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Nursing a recent heartbreak, Taryn Mitchell believes men are best kept at a safe distance. But when Ryan Christensen unexpectedly bursts through the front door of her pub, she can’t help but be drawn in by his humor, charm, and undeniable good looks. At six foot two, with dirty blond hair, blue eyes, and an incredible body, Ryan has every girl in Seaport swooning. But Taryn isn’t every other girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Relationship That Doesn’t Follow the Script. . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Despite her better judgment, Taryn soon finds herself falling hard for Ryan. But is their bond strong enough to survive the tabloid headlines, the relentless paparazzi, and the jealous fans who seem determined to tear them apart?</description>

  <description>Done with being the world's biggest pushover, Haley decides that things are going to change starting with the aggravating neighbor who has too much charm and not enough restraint. What she didn't expect was to be sucked into his world, but Haley has a game plan and she won't let herself forget just what the bad boy next door is capable of.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Jason expected was for his little shy neighbor to go Rambo on him over some ruined flowers. After he decides to take her under his wing he can't help but notice that she fits very nicely in his life. Now the only thing left is to convince her that this is anything but a game.</description>

  <description>Zoe is used to taking care of herself and has long ago accepted that if anything bad was going to happen, it was going to happen to her. So when she loses her job over something most bosses would probably be happy with and her life starts going down hill from there she doesn't expect it to get any better. She certainly didn't expect any help from the loud jerk next door, but then again she has nothing to lose so puts her trust in him and hopes for the best. What she didn't expect was the once in a lifetime opportunity that he offers her through an arrangement where they both benefit and no one is supposed to get hurt, but she should have known better because her luck has never been that good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like most Bradfords, Trevor has a soft spot for food, but that's about all. He leads a pretty straightforward life and likes to keep things simple and that includes his relationships. He wants the perfect woman and knows exactly what she'll be like. So when he discovers much to his horror that he's thinking about his frumpy little neighbor he decides the best way to get his head straight is by working her out of his system. He'll keep her around, but only until he finds perfection.</description>

  <description>For almost two years now, Kiera's boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she's ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her. When they head off to a new city to start their lives together, Denny at his dream job and Kiera at a top-notch university, everything seems perfect. Then an unforeseen obligation forces the happy couple apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeling lonely, confused, and in need of comfort, Kiera turns to an unexpected source – a local rock star named Kellan Kyle. At first, he's purely a friend that she can lean on, but as her loneliness grows, so does their relationship. And then one night everything changes...and none of them will ever be the same.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Sparks are igniting.&lt;br&gt;Flames are spreading.&lt;br&gt;And the Capitol wants revenge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games.  She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive.  Katniss should be relieved, happy even.  After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale.  Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be.  Gale holds her at an icy distance.  Peeta has turned his back on her completely.  And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop.  And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try.  As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever.  If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Catching Fire&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.</description>

  <description>When unworldly student Anastasia Steele first encountered the driven and dazzling young entrepreneur Christian Grey it sparked a sensual affair that changed both of their lives irrevocably. Shocked, intrigued, and, ultimately, repelled by Christian’s singular erotic tastes, Ana demands a deeper commitment. Determined to keep her, Christian agrees.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Ana must somehow learn to share Christian’s opulent lifestyle without sacrificing her own identity. And Christian must overcome his compulsion to control as he wrestles with the demons of a tormented past.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to make Ana’s deepest fears turn to reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When literature student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly, innocent Ana is startled to realize she wants this man and, despite his enigmatic reserve, finds she is desperate to get close to him. Unable to resist Ana’s quiet beauty, wit, and independent spirit, Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Shocked yet thrilled by Grey’s singular erotic tastes, Ana hesitates. For all the trappings of success—his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, his loving family—Grey is a man tormented by demons and consumed by the need to control. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian Grey’s secrets and explores her own dark desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Erotic, amusing, and deeply moving, the Fifty Shades Trilogy is a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the Trade Paperback edition.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>When Tucker Branch, playboy heir to Branch Bolt and Screw, screws and bolts a week before their wedding, Mia Devine wants nothing more than to crawl under her newly monogrammed sheets and plan a funeral for her dignity. But her friends convince her that bitter tastes better when it’s drowned in Bordeaux, so Mia grits her teeth and packs her bags, determined to make the best of her luxurious Paris honeymoon—alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She never planned on meeting Lucas Fournier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The easygoing bartender’s scruffy good looks and less-than-sympathetic ear annoy her at first, but when she takes him up on his offer to show her around the city, she discovers that the romance of Paris isn’t just a myth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nor is the simultaneous O. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Mia needs is another doomed love affair, but since she only has a week, she figures she might as well enjoy la vie en O with Lucas while she can. But each day—and night—with Lucas is better than the last, and suddenly her heart is telling her this is more than a rebound fling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is it just the seduction of Paris…or could this be the real thing?</description>

  <description>Things are off, and I can’t quite put my finger on it. Some things, however, are the same. For example, the sex with Matt is just as nuclear and consistent as it always has been. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still… I feel like I’m holding onto Matt with my fingertips, like he’s on the verge of slipping away and I don’t know what to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I started these Legal Affairs, I had no way of knowing the depth of feeling that would become involved. I had no way of knowing this man could shatter my existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t want to be hurt, so I’m grasping hard and I can only hope that he wants me enough to hang on just as tight.</description>

  <description>Matt Connover is like a new person. Caring, romantic and thoughtful. No worries though… he’s still sexy as hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has changed in every way that I have ever dreamed of, and he did it because he wants me. It’s like a fairy tale of sorts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except… like with every fairy tale, there is a villain. One who threatens to disrupt the harmony we have created together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is what we have strong enough to survive? I truly believe that perhaps I can find love within these Legal Affairs. I’m just not sure Matt believes it.</description>

  <description>I’ve seen a new side to Matt Connover. He’s proven to me that there is something inside him other than icy control and masculine force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve seen care… tenderness… even protectiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve seen vulnerability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Matt Connover’s issues run deep. I know Cal hurt him deeply, and he keeps himself protected because of that. I also sense there is something more to his pain that even I cannot comprehend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt is struggling between what he knows and what he wants.&lt;br&gt;I’m struggling with boundaries and how to protect my own fragile heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time I’m drawing a line in the sand and Matt can either step over to join me, or these Legal Affairs are finished forever.</description>

  <description>My life is in a tail-spin and I’m about ready to crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve cut Matt Connover out of my life… well, at least out of my bedroom… but I still have to deal with him at work. I have Lorraine intent on raining hell and destruction down upon me, which at least provides a nice diversion from my miserable feelings over Matt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About the only good thing that has happened to me lately?&lt;br&gt;Cal Carson asked me out… and I accepted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt’s not going to like that. Not one little bit.&lt;br&gt;But that’s not my problem now, is it?</description>

  <description>I crossed a line with my boss and there’s no taking it back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that I’d want to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You see… Matt Connover? Well, he’s something else. Strong, magnetic, sexy as hell… but yeah, he’s still my boss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What am I doing? Why is he so irresistible to me? Maybe it’s because I finally saw a different side to him. I saw, for a brief moment, that Matt is vulnerable, possibly damaged. Is it wrong that it makes him even sexier in my opinion?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m in deep and I don’t see any way out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t want to find a way out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to find a way for both of us to stay involved in these Legal Affairs.&lt;br&gt;   ~ McKayla “Mac” Dawson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs is a serial romance with a whole lot of hot and a little bit of funny.

  <description>One year ago, I graduated from law school and embarked on a career as a purveyor of high priced legal shenanigans. &lt;br&gt;Six months ago, my boyfriend dumped me when I thought he might be proposing. &lt;br&gt;Two weeks ago, I got drunk and joined a secret sex club. &lt;br&gt;Two days ago, I had a torrid one-night stand with a stranger. &lt;br&gt;Today? Well, today I’m contemplating having an affair with my boss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Matt Connover is all kinds of forbidden temptation wrapped up in a deliciously wicked package, and he’s made it clear… he’s only interested in sex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is McKayla Dawson but everyone calls me Mac. I work at the powerhouse firm of Connover &amp;amp; Crown, LLP, where the law has never felt so hot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But between you and me, I’m afraid my heart won’t survive these Legal Affairs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs is a serial romance with a whole lot of hot and a little bit of funny. It has six volumes that will be released every two weeks, the first one, entitled Objection, on January 10, 2014. &lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs – Objection – releasing January 10, 2014 &lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs – Stipulation – releasing January 24, 2014 &lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs – Violation – releasing February 7, 2014 &lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs – Mitigation – releasing February 21, 2014 &lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs – Reparation – releasing March 7, 2014 &lt;br&gt;Legal Affairs – Affirmation – releasing March 21, 2014</description>

  <description>NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY BESTSELLING AUTHOR, ELLE CASEY, presents the contemporary romance serial novel, JUST ONE NIGHT. [This book is PART 2. Readers should begin by reading PART 1 first.] &lt;br&gt;******************************** &lt;br&gt;Jennifer is suffering a serious man hangover when her best friend Mia swoops in and forces her out of her apartment for a night of good old-fashioned girlfriend fun. It seems like just the ticket to help her move on and follow through with her plan for a new perspective on life and men ... until everything goes really right and then just as quickly goes really wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William would love to focus on his work to the exclusion of all else, but his annoying assistant and nagging calendar have other ideas. When the two of them are joined by his father (the boss) and the threat of the unleashing of his brother (the troublemaker), he has little choice but to obey their commands and attend the event that just might net them some new clients. Or, perhaps, something none of them were bargaining for. &lt;br&gt;******************************** &lt;br&gt;**This ebook is Part 2 of the serial romance novel, JUST ONE NIGHT, approximately 21,000 words or 85 paper pages long. The story continues with additional Parts which will be published in 2-3 week increments. DUE TO SEXY SITUATIONS AND CONTENT, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNGER READERS**</description>

  <description>If someone had told me a year ago that I was about to fall in love, go on an epic road trip, ride a Triceratops, sing on a bar, and lose my virginity, I would have assumed they were on drugs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, that is, until I met Beckham. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beck was mostly to blame for my recklessness. Gorgeous, clever, undeniably charming Beck barreled into my life as if it were his mission to make sure I never took living for granted. He showed me that there were no boundaries, rules were for the spineless, and a kiss was supposed to happen when I least expected.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beck was the plot twist that took me by surprise. Two months before I met him, death was knocking at my door. I’d all but given up my last scrap of hope when suddenly, I was given a second chance at life. This time around, I wasn’t going to let it slip through my fingers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  We set out on a road trip with nothing to lose and no guarantees of tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Our road trip was about young, reckless love. The kind of love that burns bright.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The kind of love that no road-map could bring me back from.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Recommended for ages 17+ due to language and sexual situations.**</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;THE IMPACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tristan hit rock bottom, and no one felt the impact harder than Danika. She was forced to see, in the most brutal of ways, that love does not conquer all. Bruised, bloody, and broken she had to walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE AFTERMATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Picking up the pieces of your life after a tragedy is a daunting prospect, and that’s considering you still own all of the pieces. But what if you don’t? What if someone else owns those pieces, and those pieces are a part of your soul?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You dig deep and work with what you’ve got. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what Danika told herself and believed, every single day, for years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tristan and Danika’s love had failed every test that life had thrown at them. She couldn’t forget that, not for one second. And if those tests had been overly harsh, well, she wasn’t one to wallow in self-pity. The failure was the thing she had to focus on. The failure was the lesson. She had no intention of working so hard to make it out of hell without learning that lesson well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE REUNION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over six years after the night that changed everything, Danika finds herself forced to spend the weekend constantly in Tristan’s company, as they attend the wedding of two of their dearest friends. It’s been long enough that she feels they can be friendly again without it destroying her peace of mind, but just a small amount of time in his presence has her remembering something she had forced herself to forget: There’d been a reason she’d gone through hell with this man, for this man, some true good to precede the bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She shocks herself by quickly giving in to a hunger that she never imagined could still consume her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even the best intentioned denial has a breaking point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HARSH REALITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After everything that’s happened, the rise and the fall, the pain and the aftermath, can these two navigate the waters of acute regret, survive the trials of coming face to face with all that they have lost, and find the strength to try again?</description>

  <description>Danika hasn’t had an easy life. Being insanely attracted to bad boys has never helped make it easier. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One look at Tristan, and every brain cell she possessed went up in smoke. This man was trouble with a capital T. It was a given.&lt;br&gt;She knew better. Bad boys were bad. Especially for her. Considering her history, it was crazy to think otherwise. So why did crazy have to feel so damn fine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For as long as she could remember, Danika had been focused on the future with single-minded purpose. Tristan came along and taught her everything there was to know about letting go, and living in the present. She fell, hard and deep. Of course, that only made her impact with the ground that much more devastating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad Things is about Tristan and Danika, and their train wreck of a love story. This series can be read as a standalone, or with the Up in the Air series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad Things is a full length novel, at roughly 105,000 words.&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>My need for power came to me by accident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The need was real. It was overwhelming. It was consuming me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we played a dangerous game of trial and error. What I could handle and what I couldn’t. It became apparent fairly quickly that I couldn’t handle much. But I liked this game because I controlled it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Link and Rocky’s story continues in this second installment of the Dirty series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This is part two in a five-part novella series.&lt;br&gt;**Due to sexual situations and violence, this series is recommended for 18+.</description>

  <description>Jennifer is sexually frustrated and disillusioned with love, a very dangerous combination. Convinced there's no such thing as Prince Charming, and against her best friend's better judgment, she places a personal ad seeking a one-night stand. No strings, no commitments, no second dates. Her goal? To restore her faith in men by setting up a single night of fantasy that can never be tainted by reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William is a busy executive, newly arrived in the United States from England. Life for him is all about minimizing complications. He doesn't have the time nor the inclination to share his life with anyone, to have obligations outside of work, or to become entangled in a relationship with an emotional basket case of a woman who’s desperately seeking her Prince Charming. But he does see the value in having an attractive woman in his arm for networking purposes ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**This ebook is Part 1 of the serial romance novel, JUST ONE NIGHT, approximately 25,000 words or 100 paper pages long. The story continues with additional Parts which will be published in 2-3 week increments. DUE TO SEXY SITUATIONS AND CONTENT, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNGER READERS**</description>

  <description>I am a Master. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You must know this fact to understand my story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I capture women. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I break them down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I rebuild them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If they are lucky, they are sold into the professional hands of another Master. If they are less fortunate, they are buried beneath the ground, never to be thought of again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I lust for the control, I demand absolute submission and my body yearns to warp the minds of those I train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Power is the only thing I’ll ever need and I am addicted to the feeling of ultimate control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am wealthy, good-looking, educated and charming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I am - in no way - a good man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not want love. &lt;br&gt;I do not want kindness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She thought she could change me by giving me the two things I knew I never wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was wrong.</description>

  <description>Three. This is my number. It’s the exact sum of reasons I continue to go on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One: To strengthen my body. Make it strong. Make it a machine. Make it so that what happened before can never, ever, happen again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two: To help others find their own strength so that what happened to me, what happened to my Olivia, doesn’t happen to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And three: My favorite—to find the bastards that took my life away and make them pay for what they did.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is what my life is now. A dead man, inside a scarred body, living only for revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This is part one in a five part novella serial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Due to sexual situations and violence, this series is recommended for 18+.</description>

  <description>Fredrik Gustavsson never considered the possibility of love, or that anyone could ever understand or accept his dark and bloody lifestyle—until he met Seraphina, a woman as vicious and blood-thirsty as Fredrik himself. They spent two short but unforgettable years together, full of lust and killing and the darkest kind of love that two people can share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Seraphina was gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s been six years since Fredrik’s lover and sadistic partner in crime turned his world upside-down. Seraphina went into hiding and has eluded him ever since. Now, he’s getting closer to finding her, and an innocent woman named Cassia is the key to drawing Seraphina from the shadows. But Cassia—after sustaining injuries from a fire that Seraphina ignited—suffers from amnesia and can’t give Fredrik the information he desperately seeks. Having no other choice, Fredrik has been keeping Cassia locked in his basement as he not only tries to get her to recall her past—because she and Seraphina share it—but also to protect her from Seraphina, who clearly wants her dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Cassia is a light in the darkness that Fredrik never believed existed. After a year subjected to her kindness and compassion, he finds himself struggling with his love for Seraphina, and his growing feelings for Cassia—because he knows that to love one, the other must die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will light win out over darkness, or will something more powerful than either further destroy an already tortured soul?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Note: THE SWAN &amp;amp; THE JACKAL is NOT a New Adult title. It, and all other books in the series are categorized as Suspense/Crime/Thriller/Romantic Suspense and Adult.)</description>

  <em>”The past has shaped me, molded me into a monster.  A monster with a persecuted heart and a dead soul.”</em>

  <description>They lived the life they were given; they loved the life they made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheerleader Taylor Smith doesn’t want to die a virgin. Unfortunately, if the terminally-ill leukemia patient doesn't find a lover or a stem-cell match within months, her fear will become reality. When her cancer mentor is revealed to be a hottie entrepreneur from California, it seems fate might finally be on her side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tech-geek Gavin Taylor has everything he ever wanted, except someone to grieve for him when he's gone. With his melanoma cancer beyond the help of his riches, he agrees to participate in a cancer patient mentoring program where he's matched with a dying teen from Texas. Despite his immediate attraction, the Silicon Valley whiz intends only to provide friendship and happy memories to the beautiful, young woman who is determined to win his love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it's discovered that his frozen sperm and her harvested eggs could lead to a cure, Taylor's mother offers to be a surrogate. And Gavin must decide if he can risk the heart he has never given and a child he'll never know to a girl he just met.</description>

  <description>Six months ago, I was happy. I was simply Naomi Carradine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One month ago, I was admitted into a psych ward. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yesterday, Lachlan visited me. Kissed me. And told me that I’m starting to lose my mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hours later, Max haunted my thoughts, reminding me I’m not crazy and that he needs my help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few minutes ago, I drifted further from reality, trying to unravel the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now...everyone thinks I’m insane. But, I know he's real, and I know he needs me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you believe me?</description>

  <description>Day of Employment: 359&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11:05 a.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location: Cubicles outside Canon’s office.&lt;br&gt;Co-workers: Betting on how long Canon’s new PA will last.&lt;br&gt;Me: No doubts. Ms. Gum-smacker won’t last the day. I need to place my bet.&lt;br&gt;Manolo Blahnik’s New Fall Shoes: Mine. As soon as Madeline hands over my winnings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma Baker has never spoken a word to Alaric Canon, nor has he to her. But she’s studied him every day across the office tundra for almost a year. Canon is hard and fierce, terrifying and beautiful. He’s also the most stern, unforgiving person Emma has ever seen. Emma’s co-workers run a betting pool for Personal Assistant terminations. There’s a separate pot for the day one leaves without crying. Not likely…Canon made a former Navy SEAL cry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has high standards and low tolerance. Everyone knows it. Everyone stays away. Everyone who can, that is. Except Emma. She can’t look away. Alaric Canon is the single most attractive man she’s ever seen. Bar none.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Canon has never noticed her. Not once in almost a year. She’s not even a blip on his radar. But she will be. His radar will be blipless no more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a goal. Emma has a plan.</description>

  <description>My life, inside this apartment is simple. It works, as long as I follow the rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Don’t leave the apartment. Not in case of fire, not to mail a letter, not to run an errand. The door stays shut, and I stay inside.&lt;br&gt;2. Don’t get attached to clients. I take off my clothes, I stand in front of the camera, and I perform. What they want, I give. Their secrets, I keep. Everything I tell them, is a lie.&lt;br&gt;3. Don’t kill anyone. I’ve obeyed that rule for over three years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My life, inside this apartment was simple, and it worked. Then, I started breaking rules.</description>

  <description>Juliette hasn’t touched anyone in exactly 264 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.</description>

  <description>Arrogant womanizer Kyle Manchester hates blind dates; however, when best friend, Brad calls in a favor, insisting Kyle take out his girlfriend’s sister, Kyle reluctantly agrees. Attorney Lanie Carmichael’s appearance is no surprise. She is dowdy, awkward, and dressed in so many layers she resembles a wedding cake, but not in an edible way. Her brazen attitude though, astonishes him, especially when she explains she has no interest in gorgeous Kyle. Lanie Carmichael is in love with Brad, and wants Kyle’s assistance in winning his best friend’s heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyle gradually accepts, justifying that the mystery of Lanie has sparked his natural, thirsty curiosity. As an ambitious journalist, he also can’t resist the Pulitzer worthy scoop she offers him. However, as Lanie sheds more layers, both emotionally and physically, Kyle begins to examine his life choices, and his true feelings for this enigmatic girl. With Kyle’s support, Lanie begins to unravel the secrets of her past, and the deep pain that has quietly defined her life. As they each learn more about themselves and each other, both question how a relationship built on fraudulent lies between two broken people could ever survive.</description>

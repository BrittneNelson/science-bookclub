  <description>Ana Belle never wanted anything more than to hang up her apron, jump on her Vespa and ride off into the sunset, leaving Sugartown in the dust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elijah Cade never wanted anything more than a hot meal, a side of hot arse and a soft place to lay his head at night where he could forget about his past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But you know what they say about wanting: you always want what you can’t have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nineteen year-old virgin Ana is about to discover that’s not quite true because a six foot three, hotter than hell, tattooed, Aussie sex god just rode into town. He’s had a taste of her pie and he wants more– no really, Ana bakes pies for a living, get your mind out of the gutter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’d be willing to hand over everything tied up in a big red bow, there’s just one problem; Elijah has secrets dirtier than last week’s underwear. Secrets that won't just break Ana’s heart, but put her life at risk, too. When those secrets come to light, their relationship is pushed to breaking point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Add to that a psychotic nympho best friend, an overbearing father, a cuter than humanly possible kid brother, a wanton womanizing cousin, the ex from hell, and more pies than you could poke a ... err ... stick ... at.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And you thought small towns were boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Sugartown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Content Warning. Intended for a mature 18+ audience. Contains explicit sex, oodles of profanity and a crap-tonne of AWKWARD.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A new adult novel from Entangled's Embrace imprint...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three knocks can change everything…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"She knew. That’s why Mom hadn’t opened the door. She knew he was dead."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty years as an army brat and Ember Howard knew, too. The soldiers at the door meant her dad was never coming home. What she didn’t know was how she would find the strength to singlehandedly care for her crumbling family when her mom falls apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Josh Walker enters her life. Hockey star, her new next-door neighbor, and not to mention the most delicious hands that insist on saving her over and over again. He has a way of erasing the pain with a single look, a single touch. As much as she wants to turn off her feelings and endure the heartache on her own, she can’t deny their intense attraction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Josh’s secret shatters their world. And Ember must decide if he’s worth the risk that comes with loving a man who could strip her bare.</description>

  <description>A New Adult Dark Contemporary Romance, not suitable for people sensitive to grief, slavery, and nonconsensual sex. A story about finding love in the strangest of places, a will of iron that grows from necessity, and forgiveness that may not be enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My life was complete. Happy, content, everything neat and perfect.&lt;br&gt;Then it all changed.&lt;br&gt;I was sold.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tess Snow has everything she ever wanted: one more semester before a career in property development, a loving boyfriend, and a future dazzling bright with possibility. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For their two year anniversary, Brax surprises Tess with a romantic trip to Mexico. Sandy beaches, delicious cocktails, and soul-connecting sex set the mood for a wonderful holiday. With a full heart, and looking forward to a passion filled week, Tess is on top of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But lusty paradise is shattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidnapped. Drugged. Stolen. Tess is forced into a world full of darkness and terror. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Captive and alone with no savior, no lover, no faith, no future, Tess evolves from terrified girl to fierce fighter. But no matter her strength, it can’t save her from the horror of being sold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Brax find Tess before she’s broken and ruined, or will Tess’s new owner change her life forever?</description>

  <description>I thought things couldn't get worse. I was wrong. &lt;br&gt;I found out what I really wanted and was forced to give him up. Just as I found out who I really am, I was presented to the elusive Horde King as a gift. &lt;br&gt;This was the mystical being I was hidden from for more than twenty years. &lt;br&gt;Although Ryder promised to save me, I couldn't let him get near this creature, so I willingly (sort of) signed myself over to be his new plaything. &lt;br&gt;Now in the Horde Realm, nothing is going remotely like I thought it would.&lt;br&gt;My powers and emotions are on the fritz, and each day seems to bring surprises that I am not sure how to deal with. &lt;br&gt;The Horde King thinks he has me exactly where he wants me. &lt;br&gt;He thinks he has taken all of my options away. &lt;br&gt;I still have choices. &lt;br&gt;Embracing what destiny has planned for me, or escaping it.</description>

  <description>Have you ever heard of the old Celtic legends of the Fae - beautiful, magical, and deadly creatures that have a love of messing with humans just for kicks and giggles?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to my world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What started out as a strange assignment, lead to one of the most gruesome murder mysteries of our times. My friends and I are set and determined to find out who is killing off Fae and Witches alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Couple of problems in the way – I hate the Fae and the Prince of the Dark Fae is bound and determined that I work for him. He’s a rude, overbearing egotistical ass with a compulsive need to possess, dominate and control me. Oh – did I mention that he is absolutely sex-on-a-stick gorgeous and he makes me feel things that I never ever wanted to feel for a Fae...every time he touches me or looks at me with those dangerous golden eyes he seems to pull me further in under his spell, despite my better judgment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friends and I can’t trust anyone and nothing is as it seems on the surface – not even me.</description>

  <description>**This story contains graphic sexual content and strong language. Intended for mature audiences only.**  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Jace Jamison is every woman’s fantasy. He’s a mysterious businessman willing to sweep you off your feet, a tattooed bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks, and a sexy friend you want to take that next step with. Jace is everything and anything you want him to be. He’s a highly paid escort. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   But nobody knows who Jace really is; the man whose dad abandoned him, whose brother was killed, and who had to take care of his mom at a young age. At the age of nineteen, he was living in Sin City, ready for a life away from stress and struggle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Adrienne has been having a sexual drought since she broke up with her boyfriend. Even then she wasn’t getting fully satisfied. Being an event planner, she’s constantly working at numerous events. Several times she’s seen a man she can only refer to as the God-like creature at her work functions. He’s devastatingly handsome, tall, and has beautiful eyes, but he’s always with a different woman. The last thing she needs is another player in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   After a few chance encounters with Jace, her best friend convinces her to just get some good sex out of him and not worry about who she’s seen him with. But what happens when she finds out that he isn’t dating these women because he wants to, but because he’s paid to?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Keeping his job a secret from Adrienne seems easy at first, but when she begins meeting people he knows in his escort life, and they begin getting closer, he knows he has to tell her before someone else does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   When their worlds entwine, and confessions are made, will they be able to work through it? Will she be able to push aside his sins and focus on the good in him? Will Jace get what he’s never had? A woman who wants him despite what he’s done. Or will living in sin cost him what he never knew he wanted?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*An erotic, contemporary romance* &lt;br&gt;*Book one in a series, but can be read as a standalone.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--As it's been mentioned a lot, I want to warn you of the first chapter. For some people, it's hot and amazing, and they love it! For others, it's shocking and not for them. However, don't let it scare you away, it's not like that the whole way through. Others who were taken aback by it, ended up giving it 5 stars.It is an erotic book though, so there will be adult situations. ;)--</description>

  <description>***A Standalone Horror Romance***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A note about this book: Donners of the Dead is set in 1851 – couples were often thrust into marriage together with short courtships, racism was widespread and not overly frowned upon, and women had little to no rights. What wouldn't fly in today's day and age was unfortunately the norm back then - it is worth keeping that in mind when reading this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jake McGraw was unlike anyone I’d ever known. He was brash, rude, unapologetic and arrogant; chauvinistic, close-minded, and terribly stubborn. He was built like a tree, tall with a hard chest and wide shoulders and hands that looked like they could wrestle a bear. He was a cigar-chomping, scruffy-faced, beast of a man. I was pretty sure I hated him. And I know he hated me. But among the flesh-eating monsters in these snow-capped mountains, he was the only thing keeping me alive &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year is 1851 and pioneers in search of California gold are still afraid to travel on the same route as the tragic Donner party did years before. When the last wagon train to go into the Sierra Nevada mountains fails to arrive at their destination, Eve Smith, an 18-year old half-native girl with immense tracking skills is brought along with the search party, headed by an enigmatic former Texas Ranger, Jake McGraw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What they find deep in the dangerous snow-covered terrain is a terrifying consequence of cannibalism, giving new meaning to the term “monster.” While the search party is slowly picked off, one by one, Eve must learn to trust Jake, who harbors more than a few secrets of his own, in order to survive and prevent the monstrosities from reaching civilization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is NOT New Adult***</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Everyone tells him he needs to move on, but how can a man function without his heart?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten-year-old Caleb Tanner wants nothing to do with Sylvie Cranston, the annoying weird girl who moves next door to him and gets him in trouble for swearing. But at twelve, they become friends when he teaches her how to hook a fishing line and she shows him the value of a selfless act. At fourteen, he falls in love with her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At sixteen, she dies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or so he’s told. But Cal never believes it. Sylvie has become part of his soul. He knows her like the steady beating of his own heart. He’d know if she was dead. Cal looks for her, prays for her and finally he just waits for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nine years later, she walks into the community college English class Cal is teaching. Only this girl claims her name is Sophie Becker and she doesn’t know him. Cal knows better. He’s determined to get the girl he loves back—and protect her from the danger that took her away all those years ago.</description>

  <description>Far too young, Apollo Ulfr lost Ilsa, his wife, the love of his life and the mother of his two children. The grief of her loss does not settle in his soul, it solders to it. But when he discovers there is a parallel universe where his wife may have a twin, he feels there's hope and sets about bringing her to his world so he can have her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Ilsa Ulfr of our world is married to the parallel universe's twin, Pol, who is not a good man. Not in any way. She's on the run from him and the last thing she wants is to be transported to a fantastical world and be forced to take his side as his wife, even if he is not Pol. And Apollo finds the broken, bitter Ilsa nothing like his beloved and he further wants nothing to do with her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But darkness is looming and evil is amassing. Apollo must protect his land and keep his family safe, including the new Ilsa.</description>

  <description>Cora Goode has woken up in a fairytale world where she can understand what birds are saying to her, men ride horses and have fluffy feathers in their hats and furniture zigs, zags and whirls in miracles of construction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is, she thinks she’s in a dream but she’s actually taken the place of the parallel universe Cora and without realizing it, our Cora does something that starts a centuries old curse that will sweep the land if she gets captured by the evil Minerva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point, her dream world becomes a nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily, hot guy, fantasyland Noctorno is there to save her from the clutches of the grotesque vickrants sent by Minerva to capture her. Unfortunately, hot guy, fantasyland Noctorno doesn’t like the Cora of his world all that much (to say the least) and he thinks our Cora is her. And no matter what our Cora says or does to try to convince him, he won’t be convinced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Cora needs Tor to keep her safe and guide her through this fantastical world as she hopes one day to wake up in her not-so-great apartment in her not-so-great life in her world. The problem is, the more time she spends with the gorgeous warrior Tor, the faster she falls in love with him.</description>

  <description>Everyone has a secret...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabe Hyde is on borrowed time. He's been hiding his identity for over four years-hidden from the world that used to adore him--obsess over him--driven to the edge of insanity by one poor choice. &lt;br&gt;But that one choice, altered the course of his life forever. &lt;br&gt;Pretending isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially when pretending means hiding your real self from the people that care about you the most. But if anyone ever discovered the truth it wouldn't just be his life at risk--but hers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saylor doesn't hate men. &lt;br&gt;Just Gabe. &lt;br&gt;Only Gabe. &lt;br&gt;He's a reckless, happy-go-lucky, silver spoon fed pain in her ass. Everything about him makes her more and more confused. Unfortunately they both donate time at the same Group Home. If she wasn't afraid of flunking, she'd be long gone. She hates that she's attracted to him almost as much as he hates that he's attracted to her--and she can tell, especially since their first encounter ended up making her knees so weak she couldn't form coherent sentences for weeks afterwards. But the closer she gets to him, the more confused she becomes. He isn't who he says he is, and he's hiding something big. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happen when two worlds collide? Two worlds that never should have met in the first place? Some secrets are too big to be hidden forever--the only question? Will his destroy everyone he loves? Or finally bring about the redemption he's been craving for the past four years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has a secret...What's yours?</description>

He is hiding something pretty big, scratch that, it’s <strong>HUGE</strong>.  I will not reveal any aspects of his secret, but for me part of his secret it hit too close for home.

  <description>Growing up, Chyna was handed everything on a silver platter. She never wanted for anything, except love—unconditional love from her parents. Love was a foreign emotion, and watching her parents love/hate relationship was never easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when it came to her personal life, she made sure she never had to relive that. With looks that could kill, it was simple for Chyna to be the love 'em and leave 'em kind of girl. And she had always been okay with it. She would rather be single the rest of her life then end up as miserable as her parents. So when a man rescued her after she was drugged in a night club, she never expected to start a relationship with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one chance meeting changes it all. Chyna is offered a once in a lifetime opportunity that could sky rocket her career, and she is forced to make a decision that could ruin everything.</description>

  <description>Two women.  Carly and Tabitha.  They each have suffered life-altering events that have left them both traumatically damaged. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carly Sloan’s life was perfect until her security and innocence was torn from her.  The vast repercussions from horrific events threaten to destroy her stability and her chances for a happily ever after. Kyle Finnegan comes into Carly’s life at the height of her turmoil. Can he help her find what she desires most?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabitha Fletcher has constantly suffered from a very young age.  She has been hiding from her past, which was full of sadness, loss and abuse.  She has been so brutally damaged that she has very little hope for redemption.  The revolving door of men only leads her deeper into misery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What circumstance brings these two women together and can they help each other heal?  And will they each find what they need?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Redemption.&lt;br&gt;Love.&lt;br&gt;Family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Dear Emily” is the first book in the “Forever Family” series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is not suitable for young readers.  It is intended for mature adults only (18+).  It contains strong language, adult/sexual situations, non-consensual sex and some violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Teaser - Unedited and subject to change**&lt;br&gt;Copyright Trudy Stiles 2013&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Emily,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do I start off a letter to a child I have yet to meet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A child that has always been in our hearts? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A child that is meant for our family?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your Daddy and I cannot wait for the moment we are able to hold you in our arms for the first time.  To lay our eyes on your perfect face, eyes, toes. To breathe in the essence of a new baby, swirling scents of powder and linen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We cannot wait to feel your beating heart against our chests and to listen to your slow and steady breaths. To hear your soft baby noises.  To soothe your crying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have always dreamed of you, Emily.  We’ve dreamed that someday our family would be blessed with a child.  We are so close.  Our new family is within reach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are here hoping, waiting, praying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love and kisses,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Momma&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My eyes are glistening with tears as I scrawl my signature at the bottom of the letter, touch my fingers to my lips, press them onto her name and close my journal.  I look over to my left where Kyle is softly snoring, sleeping soundly.  I mouth the words “I love you” to him, touch his back lightly, put my journal in my night table drawer and turn out the soft light by my bedside.  I curl my body into his, tuck my head into his chest and hold on tight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love this man with all that I am and I love the father that he is going to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My heart is full of hope.</description>

Kenner’s upcoming novel, &lt;em&gt;Wanted &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I’ve long dreamed of my fairy tale wedding, but it wasn’t until I met Damien Stark—who captured me with his kisses and undid me with his touch—that I began to believe it was my destiny. Though we both carry secrets and scars, our shared passion heals us, binding us together. We have surrendered to each other completely, and our mutual ecstasy is the brightest light in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But darkness still snakes through the cracks in our armor. Ghosts from our past have moved in, bringing fresh pain that cuts deep and threatens to destroy everything we hold dear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Damien is my anchor to this world, and I am his. But if we are going to keep each other, we have to fight the shadows of our pasts to move forward into our future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Take Me” is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Sculpt is an illegal fighter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s also the lead singer of a local rock band.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows his real name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And from the moment I met him, he made me forget mine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to convince Sculpt to give me self-defense lessons, I had to follow his one rule—no complaining or he’d walk. I didn’t think it would be a problem. I could handle a few bruises. What I hadn’t anticipated was landing on my back with Sculpt on top of me and my entire body burning up for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I tried to ignore it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I failed of course. And having a hot, tattooed badass on top of me week after week, acting completely immune to what he was doing to my body—it was frustrating as hell, so I broke his rule—I complained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he kissed me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Author’s Note: This novella is Sculpt and Emily’s beginning and how they met. It is an extra and not required to be read before “Torn from You”. Their story and what happens to them is the novel “Torn from You”.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Warning* Huge cliff-hanger. Like huge! But “With You” and “Torn from You” are released on the same day.*&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

Find out in this forty page short story, filled with his sexy charm, unique advice and hilarious one-liners.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marriage: the final frontier. Steven went first. He was kind of our test subject.

You’ve seen my friends, you’ve met our families, you know you're in for a treat. Everyone wants their wedding to be memorable. This one’s going to be un-frigging-forgettable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holy Frigging Matrimony &lt;em&gt;takes place about a year after Tangled’s end and is from Drew’s POV.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;The rules are clear—until they're broken. Lauren Layne puts a New Adult spin on Pygmalion, also the inspiration for Pretty Woman, and gives the classic love story its edgiest twist yet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Who knew that pretending you're not falling for someone would be so much more difficult than pretending that you are?"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stephanie Kendrick gave up her whole summer to ace her NYU film school screenwriting course, so she's pissed to be stuck with a preppy, spoiled frat boy as her writing partner. Then again, with her piercings, black-rimmed eyes, and Goth wardrobe, Stephanie isn't exactly Ethan Price's type, either. He's probably got his eye on some leggy blonde with a trust fund... or does he?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the summer scene kicks off in the Hamptons, Ethan is desperate to make his snobbish mother forget the pedigreed girl who broke his heart. While Stephanie's a stretch as a decoy, the right makeover and a pastel cardigan just might do the trick. She may not love the idea of playing Ethan's brainless Barbie girlfriend, but the free rent and luxurious digs make a tempting offer. So does the promise of a ready-made screenplay idea inspired by their charade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Stephanie steps into Ethan's privileged world, the "acting" begins to feel all too real. The kissing and touching that were intended to fool the Hamptons crowd wind up manipulating "them." And Stephanie faces a question she's too afraid to ask: Is Ethan falling for the real her or for the dolled-up princess he wants to see?</description>

  <description>Monica Murphy returns with her most beloved characters, Drew and Fable, in this eBook original 40,000-word novella that brings her bestselling New Adult series full circle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fantasy. How I ended up with NFL player Drew Callahan, the guy every woman wants, is beyond my wildest dreams. All I know is that once he chose me as his one and only, I sure wasn’t looking back. I had past wounds and he showed patience and concern—even taking responsibility for my messed-up kid brother. Now, once again, he’s found a way to blow my mind: an exotic wedding and honeymoon miles and miles away from home. What else could a girl ever ask for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reality. Now the honeymoon’s over. Drew’s football schedule takes him on the road constantly, while I need to stay put and look after my brother until he finishes high school—because God knows our sorry excuse for a mother won’t. I know Drew loves me with all his heart, and I’ll always be over the moon about him. This just isn’t how I imagined our life as newlyweds . . . dealing with the distance, missing him all the time. But we’ve gone through hard times before. We can get through this, too, right? We’re Drew and Fable, together forever. At least I hope so. . . .</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Love is like an avalanche. It hits hard, fast and without mercy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least it did for me when Sculpt, the lead singer of the rock band Tear Asunder knocked me off my feet. Literally, because he’s also a fighter, illegally of course, and he taught me how to fight. He also taught me how to love and I fell hard for him. I mean the guy could do sweet, when he wasn't doing bossy, and I like sweet.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it all shattered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kidnapped. &lt;br&gt;Starved.  &lt;br&gt;Beaten. &lt;br&gt;I was alone and fighting to survive.&lt;br&gt;When I heard Sculpt's voice, I thought he was there to save me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(It is highly recommended to read "With You" the novella first).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Warning: This book contains some disturbing situations, strong language and sexual content. Over 18 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a love story with some dark elements. Dark contemporary romance. No cliffhanger and next in the Tear Asunder series is Ream's story (the band's lead guitarist).</description>

  <description>When it comes to trouble, Eve’s used to showing plenty of it to her Targets, but when she’s assigned a new Errand, the roles become reversed. Rob Tucker is the kind of man who raises every red flag in a woman. He reminds Eve that some Clients aren’t just looking for freedom from their husbands—they’re trying to save their lives. She’s worked domestic violence Errands before, but this one’s . . . different. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a seemingly quick and simple job turns into the complete opposite, Eve finds herself juggling two of the most difficult Errands of her career. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How far will she go to see both through to completion?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;The newest release from Olivia Thorne, author of The Billionaire’s Seduction series!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Kaitlyn Reynolds is a year out of college and fighting to become a journalist when she gets the biggest break of her young life: the shot at a cover story in Rolling Stone magazine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But there’s a catch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She’ll be covering the hottest bad-boy in rock, Derek Kane, whom Kaitlyn met when she was a freshman in college and he was a struggling unknown. It was passionate two-week affair: tumultuous, sensual, exhilarating… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; …and it ended very, very badly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Now Kaitlyn has to decide whether she can face the pain of the past, her fear of the future – and the man who might just have been the One. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Rock Me Hard (The Rock Star’s Seduction Part 1) is the first novel in a series of four. It is 57,000 words in length. Due to frank scenes of sensuality and profanity, it is intended for Mature Audiences only.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover for ASIN B00DE5EBZ8&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’s addicted to sex. He’s addicted to booze…the only way out is rock bottom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one would suspect shy Lily Calloway’s biggest secret. While everyone is dancing at college bars, Lily stays in the bathroom. To get laid. Her compulsion leads her to one-night stands, steamy hookups and events she shamefully regrets. The only person who knows her secret happens to have one of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loren Hale’s best friend is his bottle of bourbon. Lily comes at a close second. For three years, they’ve pretended to be in a real relationship, hiding their addictions from their families. They’ve mastered the art of concealing flasks and random guys that filter in and out of their apartment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as they sink beneath the weight of their addictions, they cling harder to their destructive relationship and wonder if a life together, for real, is better than a lie. Strangers and family begin to infiltrate their guarded lives, and with new challenges, they realize they may not just be addicted to alcohol and sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their real vice may be each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Adult Romance recommended for readers 18+ for mature content&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Release date: January 20, 2014&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since A LOT of people have been asking here is the scoop on how this book fits in with my Rook &amp;amp; Ronin series: Ford first appears in Rook and Ronin #2, Manic. He has a bigger role in Panic, R&amp;amp;R #3, and then he has a novella, called SLACK. This TAUT book is only FORD. It's not really part of the R&amp;amp;R series, as that plot has all been sidelined for this one romance book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ford Aston is known for many things. Being an emotionless, messed up bastard, a freakishly smart social outcast, and a cold, domineering master who keeps "pets" instead of girlfriends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And after Rook broke his heart, he plans to keep it that way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashleigh is known for nothing, and that's exactly what she's got going for her. She's broke, stranded in the mountains with a three month old baby, and Ford Aston is screwing with her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big. Time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And she plans to mess with his right back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a coy game at first, filled with flirting, and innuendo--but Ford soon realizes something is not quite right with Ashleigh. In fact, something is seriously, seriously wrong and the closer they get to their final destination, the closer Ford gets to the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night of devastation, self-loathing, and emptiness turns into the best thing that ever happened to Ford Aston. But one day of in-your-face reality threatens Ashleigh's whole existence.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From Joey W. Hill—author of the Knights of the Boardroom series—comes a novel of erotic games and power plays, in which an adventurous woman attempts to break down her own barriers…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Athena is an accomplished businesswoman in control of every aspect of her life. But since the death of her husband, she’s had the desire to explore submissive cravings she’s had for some time. Unfortunately, Athena is known as a Mistress, because that’s the role she’s always played.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Her type A personality was strong enough to serve her husband as a Domme because that’s what he needed. It’s not until she meets Dale, a retired Navy SEAL, that she attempts to discover what her own submissive desires are. But letting go of her control is not so easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Fortunately, Dale is an accomplished Master who can help Athena live out her fantasies. And as she slowly surrenders to his touch, both of them will learn more about the nature of love between Dominant and submissive, and how it defies all expectations.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Eversea, a love story, is a Winter Rose Contest FINALIST 2013.  Emilia Pisani of Simon &amp;amp; Schuster (judge) says "Great southern flavor!" and "Jack is an alluring leading man!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An orphaned, small-town, southern girl, held hostage by responsibility and self-doubt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Hollywood A-list mega-star, on the run from his latest scandal and with everything to lose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A chance encounter that leads to an unlikely arrangement and epic love affair that will change them both forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his co-star and real-life girlfriend is caught cheating on him with her new director, A-list hottie, Jack Eversea, finds himself in sleepy Butler Cove, South Carolina. Jack hopes the sultry southern heat in this tiny coastal Lowcountry town will hide him not only from the tabloids and his cheating girlfriend, but his increasingly vapid life and the people who run it.  He doesn’t count on meeting Keri Ann Butler. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keri Ann has relied on herself so long, dealing with her family’s death and the responsibilities of keeping up her family's historic mansion, that boys and certainly the meager offering of eligible boys in Butler Cove, have never figured into her equation.  But fate has other plans.  Suddenly face to face with the man who played the movie role of her favorite fictional character, Jack has Keri Ann yearning for everything she has previously avoided ... and Jack must decide whether this funny, sassy girl is worth changing his life for, before his mistakes catch up to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The digital version of &lt;em&gt;Eversea&lt;/em&gt; by Natasha Boyd carries a QED Seal: Quality, Excellence, Design, the “Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval™” for ebooks and apps. “This title has received a QED seal for quality in eBook design. It can be read easily on screens both large and small.”</description>

  <description>Rising-star blogger Milla Kierce knows she's arrived when she sees the swag basket in her dressing room on the night of her late-night television debut. But before she can bite into the muffin that symbolizes her success, gunfire echoes through the TV studio. She's just hidden herself (mostly in plain sight) when the door flings open. Instead of a gunman, there stands one of the world's most popular rock stars, Gage Daxson, looking for his own way out of danger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thrown together, they'll battle a venomous man seeking revenge and his own sexual pleasure, but they may never leave the building again. Distracted by fear, fame, and infamy, can these two somehow find their way to each other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equal parts horrifying and hilarious, Debra Anastasia's Late Night With Andres offers more than a few twists and turns—and, of course, enough heat to keep things interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;100% of the proceeds generated from sales the novella Late Night with Andres will be donated by Debra Anastasia, Omnific Publishing, and all the staff members involved, to assist in the battle against breast cancer—because cancer sucks.</description>

  <em>”"Society's a classless whore." </em>
</strong><br /><br />As a fan of Debra Anastasia’s writing, I feel that she has a flair for incorporating an intense read with her twisted humor (good thing).  I find her writing to be one of a kind.  I truly never know where she will take me page to page.  She is truly unique! <br /><br />This nove...]]>

  <description>KISS THIS continues with Jay’s story, a rebel of his own sort with the need for freedom and unfiltered opinions. His days of unruly behavior and risky decisions have dealt him a hand that he’s still trying to overcome as he seeks to accomplish his business dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the hits keep adding up. His best friend is knocked up by an ex that won’t back off, a family member drops in unexpectedly and questions need answered, and the easier aspects in life are suddenly being tested beyond his control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When ultimate tragedy wreaks havoc on his life, it sends Jay over the edge. He can’t seem to manage the simple things anymore and he reverts back to his old ways of shutting people out and living carelessly. He loses everything he’s gained so far—everything that he didn’t know he wanted—all in one ugly weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is only one thing that can really save him from complete ruins, and this time it might not be so easily at his disposal. And then there is that damn McCallan pride that automatically resists help at every turn. It just may be the very thing that causes him to lose everything for good…</description>

  <description>When Jade is given a scholarship to an elite private college in Connecticut, she sees it as a chance to finally escape her painful past and get a fresh start. She’s determined to succeed and that means keeping her focus on school and not guys. But her plan falls apart her first day on campus when Garret, a rich prep school boy with swimmer abs and a perfect smile, offers to help her move in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jade tries to push him away, but she can’t deny her attraction to him and Garret won’t let her. Things quickly heat up between them, but then come to a sudden halt when reality hits and Jade realizes that a relationship with Garret may never be possible. He comes from a world of wealth where there are rules, including rules about who he can date. And not following those rules has consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the two of them try to overcome the obstacles working to keep them apart, Jade is confronted with another challenge. On her 19th birthday, she receives a letter that her now deceased mother wrote years ago. In it are revelations that explain her traumatic childhood but also make her question the past she’s been running from.</description>

  <description>I love two men. I screw two men. I am in a relationship with them both, and they are both aware there is another. That is all they need to know, that is all I let them know. They don’t need to know a name; they don’t need to know anything but that they are not alone in my heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have accepted the situation. Stewart, because his life is too busy for the sort of obligations that are required in a relationship. Paul, because he loves me too much to tell me no. And because my sexual appetite is such that one man has trouble keeping up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we exist, two parallel relationships, each running their own course, with no need for intersection or conflict. It works for us, for them, and for me. I don’t expect it to be a long-term situation. I know there is an expiration date on the easy perfection of our lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I should have paid more attention, should have looked around and noticed the woman who watched it all. She sat in the background and waited, tried to figure me out. Saw my two relationships, the love between us, and the moment that it all fell apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She hates me. &lt;br&gt;I don’t even know she exists. &lt;br&gt;She loves them. I love them. &lt;br&gt;And they love me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EVERYTHING else hangs in the balance.</description>

  <description>Ellen has loved Jagger since she was five and he was seven when they kissed through the chain link fence at school.  She’s had their wedding planned since she was twelve and is ready for a happily ever after with him, but life just isn't that neat and tidy. Although they lost contact over the years, which broke her heart, during Jag's senior year in high school, sophomore Ellen catches his eye once again and their friendship is back on. When things between them gradually develop into something more, Ellen wants to give herself completely to Jag, but he’s not so sure he wants to risk their relationship in taking things to the next level. When Jag is drafted to the Dodgers as the hot, new pitcher of the team, Ellen decides to go with him, transferring colleges and leaving her friends and family behind. But things get more and more complicated when busy schedules, a slimy agent and a supermodel disrupt their lives, which makes Ellen question whether they’ll ever get their perfect forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first book of the True Love Trilogy.</description>

It does in fact end with a <strong>CLIFFHANGER</strong>.  To me, there are several different types of cliffhanger endings, my favorite type is the “happy for now” ending.

  <description>It’s a typical boring night at work when I first meet the mysterious and sexy Colt Lancaster. Minutes after he leaves, I’m robbed at gunpoint by a masked man.&lt;br&gt;I suspect that the two events are related.&lt;br&gt;No matter how hard Colt tries to convince me that it was all just a coincidence, my gut tells me otherwise. However, the more I get to know him the more I want to believe him. Just when he’s about to win me over, a condemning secret from his past is exposed. &lt;br&gt;Then again, everyone deserves a second chance. Don’t they?</description>

  <description>I am weak.&lt;br&gt;I am lonely.&lt;br&gt;I am a slut.&lt;br&gt;I am strong.&lt;br&gt;I am Dominant.&lt;br&gt;I am independent.&lt;br&gt;I am Seven James.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My entire life, no one has wanted me, and that was fine, because I sure as shit didn't need anyone else. Blah, Blah Blah, insert sad story here about negligent parents, and shitty siblings, and you have my life story in a nut shell. When my college boyfriend dumped me, it was just icing on the cake. Five years, and a booming career later I am here to collect my revenge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was until a delicious plaything walked into the kink club I frequent, and rocked my typically un-rockable world. Causing me to break the one rule I have lived by since Daniel Alexander walked out of my life, never have sex with the same person twice. Ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Warning!!!! Hers contains sexually explicit situations that may be uncomfortable for some. These include FF, FMF, and MFM interactions.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>I didn't see it coming, didn't realize how different everything would be within the space of a month. I would fall in love with one man, I would kill another, and I would lose my body, my mind, my soul - my freedom to them. I was an operative, a strong woman, someone sent in to save others, but under these two men I became weak - or pretended to be. I didn't like being weak, it angered me. If I had free rein I could cut my masters in two. But I wasn't there for pride, I was there to free those women and to take down the two men who sold them as sex slaves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those men needed to be punished&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I would do it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No matter the cost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or how much I lost&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because I am Rita Kovak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MY MASTERS' NIGHTMARE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;#Dark Erotica&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: Like a television series, this book series is broken up into seasons and episodes. Each episode is approximately 20,000 words long, with a new one coming out on average every three weeks until the first season has ended. There will be fifteen episodes per season. The character on the cover will change after five episodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This series is a soap opera, so has crazy plot twists. It also has M/M and M/F non-con and dub-con. It is very dark and violent, so if this isn't for you, don't read it.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>***Author Note: This is not a love story. This is a story of love gone wrong.***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up the way I did, you’d think I’d be more screwed up than what I actually am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon as I turned sixteen, I left that bump in the road I called home and took my chances on the street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best decision I ever made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, at the age of twenty six, I’m educated, employed and damn good at my job.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My friends have become my family. Like me, they know what it’s like to grow up unloved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the saying is true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world makes way for those who know where they are going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know where I’m going and I’ll get there eventually. On my own terms and at my own pace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then there’s him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel his eyes on me. I see him hiding in plain sight. He watches me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He makes me feel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s unconventional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it’s real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m sure you’re wondering how a person falls in love with their stalker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So am I.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This isn’t a story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is my life.</description>

Bad things happen in the rain. As a small town social worker dedicated to protecting children, she is forced to start over to escape her rural disaster. Determined to follow her father’s advice—head up and chin high—Lili finds herself in a new city, taking on a new system, this time healthcare. In doing so, she gets something she never expected, an intimate behind-the-scenes look at life in the hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lili learns that a surgeon’s hands have the power to heal more than physical wounds. And a prescription for truth can cure three years of sleep running and leave you beautifully awake.</description>

  <description>A mistake made long ago…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pain buried so deep…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bailey Trent returns home to her small little Ozark mountain town after being away for nearly six years, she knows she’ll face the ghosts of her past. It does not mean she’s prepared to come face to face with the cruelest of those memories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Darren Cory’s life is a shell of what it once was, and when he’s forced to endure the cause of his agony, hatred abounds quickly. But hating Bailey destroys him too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Darren find a way to move past the pain and forgive the woman he once cared so much for before his anger consumes them both? Or will he drag them into the hell of an unforgiven past.</description>

  <description>November 17, 2013...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the past, I've always been given everything I've wanted, but nothing that I truly needed. I've experienced a lot of things in my twenty-five years, everything except the one thing I want. It's the one thing that can’t be bought. It can't even be taken, it has to be given. And nobody has ever given it to me, not really anyway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not until him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Music is the center of both our lives, but as he found his place in it, I lost my way. He soared, while I spiraled down a destructive path.&lt;br&gt;I lost myself in more ways than I can count.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ironic thing is that I didn’t realize how lost I was until he found me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And now that he has, I have to wonder if he'll stay around long enough to catch me.</description>

  <description>***Volume One includes Books 1-3 of the Through Glass Novella Series***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone remembered the day the sky went black. The day the sun was wiped from the sky. They remember the wind as it brought in the darkness; the way the earth shook and everything changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Everyone remembered the screams as the darkness ate those who were out in the open, those who had surrounded themselves by light, and those who made noise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Everyone remembered the voice from the sky and the way food disappeared.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    At least, that’s what I hoped. I hoped that there was an ‘everyone’ that would remember because I am not sure how many are left, how many survived. Or if anyone did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I hoped that I wasn’t alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I remembered that day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    I remembered because it was the day I became alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    It was the day that everything was perfect until the monsters took it away. Then the house went silent and the birds stopped singing. It was the day when everyone disappeared, everyone except the boy, the only person I have seen in two years.&lt;br&gt;    The boy I talk to through the glass.</description>

  <description>A little FAITH can get you through…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night. That’s all Finn had with the only girl he ever loved. Years later, all he has left of that night is a silver cross, a broken give a damn, and the unrelenting desire to drink her memory away. As the lead singer of Blow Hole, Finn has his pick of women, but none are able to squash the need he still carries around for Faith. To hate her offers some relief, but when Finn sees her again after so many years, it’s hard to despise her. Especially when every reason he had to hate her, turn out to be lies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the daughter of a strict Baptist preacher, Faith Warren lived sheltered from all things sinful. When she met Jimmy Finn, the epitome of all seven deadly sins, she found out exactly what she was missing. After being forced to choose between her soul and the only person in the world who made her feel alive, Faith walked away from Finn and dove head first into her father’s preferred life. But now Finn’s back and he’s getting payback by wreaking havoc on her emotions. Except sometimes bad things feel good, and Faith has to decide once again if she wants to stay in her gilded cage or fly free with the dark angel of lust himself.</description>

  <description>"You have to teach your heart and mind how to sing together…then you'll hear the sound of your soul."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mia Kelly thinks she has it all figured out. She's an Ivy League graduate, a classically trained pianist, and the beloved daughter of a sensible mother and offbeat father. Yet Mia has been stalling since graduation, torn between putting her business degree to use and exploring music, her true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her father unexpectedly dies, she decides to pick up the threads of his life while she figures out her own. Uprooting herself from Ann Arbor to New York City, Mia takes over her father's café, a treasured neighborhood institution that plays host to undiscovered musicians and artists. She's denied herself the thrilling and unpredictable life of a musician, but a chance encounter with Will, a sweet, gorgeous, and charming guitarist, offers her a glimpse of what could be. When Will becomes her friend and then her roommate, she does everything in her power to suppress her passions-for him, for music-but her father's legacy slowly opens her heart to the possibility of something more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A "heartbreaking and romantic" (Aestas Book Blog) debut, Sweet Thing explores the intensity and complexities of first love and self-discovery.</description>

  <em>”Sometimes it takes the love of others to show us who we really are.”</em>
</strong><br /><br />This story has a good share of angst.  Don't get me wrong, I do like angst when it’s because of circumstances.  Not when the main character is just outright <strong>STUPID</strong> and takes pretty much the whole book to go for the guy. I’m just...]]>

  <description>*THIS IS A STAND ALONE WITH NO CLIFFHANGER!*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bully and victim. &lt;br&gt;Tormenter and tormented. &lt;br&gt;Villain and hero. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ellie McCallum was a bully. No connection to anyone or anything. A sad and lonely existence for a young woman who had come to expect nothing more for herself. Her only happiness coming from making others miserable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Particularly Freaky Flynn. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flynn Hendrick lived a life completely disconnected even as he struggled to become something more than that boy with Asperger's. He was taunted and teased, bearing the brunt of systematic and calculated cruelty, ultimately culminating in a catastrophic turn of events that brought Ellie and Flynn’s worlds crashing down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Flynn and Ellie grew up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And moved on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until years later when their paths unexpectedly cross again and the bully and the freak are face to face once more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When labels come to define you, finding yourself feels impossible. Particularly for two people disconnected from the world who inexplicably find a connection in each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And out of the wreckage of their tragic beginnings, an unlikely love story unfolds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a painful past doesn’t always want to let go. And old wounds are never truly healed…and sometimes the further you try to run from yourself the closer you come to who you really are.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;Can she overcome her consuming desire for him? Can he make her comfortable with the other C-word…commitment?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marley Mason is dreading the arrival of the new business consultant. After all, this man will most likely outsource her job to China. The last thing she would expect is a case of mistaken identity, leading to false accusations of kidnapping when she attempts to pick up the wrong man at the airport, or worse…that she would have such a visceral reaction to the right man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rick Randy is super sexy, scandalously flirty and perfect masturbation material, but a relationship is out of the question. Rick is contracted on a temporary basis to fix Marley’s ailing company, then pull out, although as he expresses to Marley, pulling out is difficult for him, in more ways than one! Marley’s feelings range from utter confusion to intense contemplation as Rick charms his way into her life. All of those C-words Marley can control, but it’s the other C-word she fears—commitment.</description>

It's a game without rules, logic, or consequence, and he'll stop at nothing to claim her as his—even if it means destroying them both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, Valerian Kimble got herself entangled with a burgeoning sociopath intent on adding her to his own columns of wins and losses. She managed to escape him, but at a terrible cost...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This time it's personal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now a high school senior, Val is a pale shadow of the girl she once was and still recovering from the terrible trauma she suffered at his hands. She is understandably reluctant when her friends receive mysterious invitations to a theme party being held in one of the old manor homes on the edge of town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right away, something about the party seems off. The other guests are secretive, and strangely hostile. Cell phones don't work. Doors lock and unlock, seemingly at will. And the festivities start to take a turn for the sinister as the evening progresses. Because their host loves games. Loves them so much that he's decided to make a little wager. The deadline is sunrise. The stakes? Their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let the games begin&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

  <description>He followed her because he wanted to own her. She trusted him because she wanted excitement. There's a saying that curiosity can kill … but Valerian Kimble is beginning to learn that satisfaction might just be worse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fourteen-year-old Valerian lives in an age where antiheroes and bad boys are portrayed as the romantic ideal, and good guys are passe and boring. So when Gavin Mecozzi, the school's brilliant but twisted loner, begins to show an interest in her after a chance meeting in a pet store, Val is intrigued. He's charming and poetic and makes her feel things that she thought were only possible in books--&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because somebody is stalking Val. Somebody who wants to hurt her. Own her. Possess her. Maybe even kill her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As her meetings with Gavin unravel into a more complex and frightening relationship, Val can't help but wonder if the new boy in her life is her depraved and obsessive stalker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And whether he's capable of murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time is running out.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>A couture wedding dress designer to the rich and famous, Lexi LaCroix’s image means everything. But crossing paths with a sexier-than-sin, bad-boy biker makes Lexi realize how much living she’s sacrificed for her success and one touch is all it takes to threaten her carefully choreographed life. When that touch fills far more than just Lexi’s physical needs, she finds herself torn between the career she needs and the bad-boy she craves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jax Chamberlin gave up the superficial life of acting for the thrill of running his own stunt company years ago. But a recent betrayal proves he’s still too close to the limelight to find a woman who doesn’t plan to use him as a stepping-stone to success. When the charming and mysterious Lexi offers him a totally anonymous hook-up during an out of town trip, Jax accepts. Only Lexi is more sextacular than charming, and Jax wants more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Lexi’s got a major hang-up over his renegade lifestyle, and Jax isn’t willing to change his ways. Especially not when he discovers who she really is. Because if she finds out his connections could catapult her to the top of her career, he’s afraid the fantasy woman he’s falling for might just end up like all the other gold-diggers. And this time, it’s not just his bad-boy reputation at risk, but his heart, too.</description>

  <description>The lights have become a blanket of sorts, wrapping me in their warmth, shielding me from whatever is out there to hurt me. They block the faces that stare, the eyes that follow my movement. I used to squint when they came on, would duck my head to avoid the glare. But ducking takes me under the glare and reveals the world behind the lights, and that is a world I don’t want to see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When salvation comes in the form of six feet of drop-dead-gorgeous, complete with a limo and a thick wad of cash, my stilettos run happily out the door to freedom. They say that money doesn’t buy happiness. But it does buy escape. Happiness is an overrated fairytale.</description>

  <description>Pressing the boundaries of both the psyche and the heart, Sam and Holden embark on a dangerous journey that will test the limits of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam Wintry’s life used to be almost perfect. She was engaged to her childhood best friend and high school sweetheart, Tyler Marks, planning an amazing cross-country honeymoon during her college break. But after a hit-and-run leaves her in ruin, she begins seeing Tyler’s fractured, ghostly presence, and her family believes she’s losing her mind. Not until she completes their journey, stopping along the way to scatter Tyler's remains, will Tyler be able cross over. Only...is Sam ready for him to leave her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the black sheep of the Marks' family, Holden Marks, returns to check on Tyler's case, Sam convinces him to give her his brother's ashes. Despite their shaky history, she needs him...plus, he owes it to Sam and his brother. What she doesn’t count on is Holden’s relentlessness to go on the trip.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the road, Holden realizes just how unhinged Sam has become. Dealing with her psychosis forces him to confront his dark past, making it harder to keep secrets hidden that should remain buried. Especially from Sam, the only woman he’s ever loved. And as Sam starts to unravel the truth, she begins to question if the brother she's unwillingly falling for again is in an even darker place than her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult Contemporary coming this year.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Kylie Scott returns with the highly anticipated follow-up to international bestseller &lt;em&gt;Lick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Mal Ericson, drummer for the world famous rock band Stage Dive, needs to clean up his image fast—at least for a little while. Having a good girl on his arm should do the job just fine. Mal doesn’t plan on this temporary fix becoming permanent, but he didn’t count on finding the one right girl. Anne Rollins never thought she’d ever meet the rock god who plastered her teenage bedroom walls—especially not under these circumstances. Anne has money problems. Big ones. But being paid to play the pretend girlfriend to a wild life-of-the-party drummer couldn’t end well. No matter how hot he is. Or could it?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>1971 — In the tiny, backward town of Tulma, Tennessee, optimistic, bookish Caroline Carson unwittingly finds herself in the middle of a forbidden romance. Severely neglected by her family and forced to flee Tulma to protect her secrets, Caroline’s young life comes crashing down around her. She finds refuge in a new town, but the past always has a way of stretching around time and stirring up trouble. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a new love comes into her life, she has to decide if she can give her heart to someone else, or if she will always be tied to someone she can’t have.</description>

  <description>#1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Sylvia Day, America’s premier author of provocative fiction, delivers the debut novel from &lt;em&gt;Cosmo&lt;/em&gt; Red-Hot Reads from Harlequin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The realization that Jax still affected me so strongly was a jagged pill to swallow. He’d only been part of my life for five short weeks two years ago. But now he was back. Walking into a deal I’d worked hard to close. And God, he was magnificent. His eyes were a brown so dark they were nearly black. Thickly lashed, they were relentless in their intensity. Had I really thought they were soft and warm? There was nothing soft about Jackson Rutledge. He was a hard and jaded man, cut from a ruthless cloth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In that moment I understood how badly I wanted to unravel the mystery of Jax. Bad enough that I didn’t mind how much it was going to cost me...</description>

Being a freshman in college was supposed to create some of the best memories of her life, especially with her best friend, Lauren, and longtime boyfriend, Sander, by her side. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the excitement begins to slip away when the people closest to her start to change.

  <description>Stalking and restraining orders are a thing of Alayna Wither’s past. With her MBA newly in hand, she has her future figured out—move up at the nightclub she works at and stay away from any guy who might trigger her obsessive love disorder. A perfect plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what Alayna didn’t figure on is Hudson Pierce, the new owner of the nightclub. He’s smart, rich, and gorgeous—the kind of guy Alayna knows to stay away from if she wants to keep her past tendencies in check. Except, Hudson’s fixed his sights on her. He wants her in his bed and makes no secret of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Avoiding him isn’t an option after he offers a business proposition she can’t turn down and she’s drawn further into his universe, unable to resist his gravitational pull. When she learns Hudson has a dark history of his own, she realizes too late that she’s fallen for the worst man she could possibly get involved with. Or maybe their less than ideal pasts give them an opportunity to heal each other and finally find the love their lives have been missing.</description>

  <description>Scarred by loss, Layla leaves her hometown of Hope Springs, Georgia, hoping to put her painful past behind her and start over in college in California. When she runs into Landen at freshmen orientation, she has a choice to make. Reinforce those steel walls she's built up around herself or give the only boy who can keep her still a second chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Landen’s more than ready to tear down those walls, but this time when they come crashing down, they might bury her&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* This special edition of &lt;em&gt;Keep Me Still&lt;/em&gt; includes the novella, &lt;em&gt;Let You Leave:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Layla Flaherty had the perfect life, or close to it. Until a stranger gunned her parents down right in front of her, leaving her with seizure inducing PTSD. After years of trying to pass as normal and failing miserably, she resigns herself to being invisible. But new to town Landen O’Brien sees her, and he likes what he sees. Much to Layla’s surprise, he doesn’t freak out when she has a seizure in front of him. He does the exact opposite, calming her until the tremors subside. But Landen has secrets of his own. Secrets that will either bind them together or tear them apart.</description>

      <![CDATA[Full Review  to come -- on vacation. <br /><br />Loved this book a good read with just the right amount of sweet, sad and hot in it. Only complaint would be that the pacing was very fast. <br /><br />Alternating pov and not a cliffhanger ending.  <br /><br />This story was so very swoon worthy and I truly adored Landen and Layla❤❤]]>

  <description>Maise O’Malley just turned eighteen, but she’s felt like a grown-up her entire life. The summer before senior year, she has plans: get into a great film school, convince her mom to go into rehab, and absolutely do not, under any circumstances, screw up her own future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But life has a way of throwing her plans into free-fall.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Maise meets Evan at a carnival one night, their chemistry is immediate, intense, and short-lived. Which is exactly how she likes it: no strings. But afterward, she can’t get Evan out of her head. He’s taught her that a hookup can be something more. It can be an unexpected connection with someone who truly understands her. Someone who sees beyond her bravado to the scared but strong girl inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That someone turns out to be her new film class teacher, Mr. Evan Wilke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maise and Evan resolve to keep their hands off each other, but the attraction is too much to bear. Together, they’re real and genuine; apart, they’re just actors playing their parts for everyone else. And their masks are slipping. People start to notice. Rumors fly. When the truth comes to light in a shocking way, they may learn they were just playing parts for each other, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smart, sexy, and provocative, Unteachable is about what happens when a love story goes off-script.</description>

  <description>When the local police department's secrets are revealed and the wife he's forced to marry is murdered, Chace finds himself the town of Carnal's hero. Knowing how deep in the mud he was forced to sink, Chace feels he'll never get clean. The quiet, content future he envisioned of the love a good woman with whom he could build a family was now beyond his reach. The only thing he can do is find his wife's murderer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he isn't the only one looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While searching for new leads, he runs into Faye Goodknight, the town's quiet, shy, pretty librarian. Chace has long since had his eye on what could possibly be the town's last remaining virgin but he has also long since given up hope he could make her his. Faye is pure and clean and Chace refuses to dirty her with his sordid past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pure and clean Faye may be, but when the shy librarian is forced to go head to head with the man who she's had a crush on since he hit her hometown, Chace finds Faye is full of surprises. And he doesn't know what to do with her.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When old friends become new lovers...anything can happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sexy, gifted, and loyal, PI Jacob Decker is a tall, cool drink of perfection who had Emmanuelle Holmes at "hello." His relationship with Emme's best friend kept them apart for years, but things have changed. Now that a case has brought him to Gnaw Bone, Colorado, the road is wide open for Emme and Deck to explore something hotter and deeper than Emme dreamed possible. So why is she sabotaging the best thing that's ever happened to her? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It isn't easy to catch Deck off guard, but Emme does just that when she walks back into his life after nine long years. The curvy brunette had her charms back in the day, but now she's a bona fide knockout . . . and she wants to rekindle their friendship. Deck, however, wants more. Emme's always been the one; she excites Deck's body and mind like no other woman can. But a dark chapter from Emme's past overshadows their future together.

  <description>Join Keatyn on Thanksgiving Break in this Keatyn Chronicles novella. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve finally become the kind of girl my little sisters could look up to. &lt;br&gt;Except for the lies. &lt;br&gt;Lying to my friends is killing me. &lt;br&gt;And the longer I’m there—the closer we get—the more I feel like I’m being eaten from the inside out. &lt;br&gt;If I go back to Eastbrooke, I’ll end up nothing but a shell. &lt;br&gt;So I'm not going back. &lt;br&gt;I'm going to St. Croix by myself. And for the first time in my life, I'm okay with being alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except...I don't actually end up on the island alone.</description>

  <description>A love triangle gone bad...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was the one guy I couldn't get enough of. One look from him would make me melt. He was the one I always wanted to love me, but always seemed so far away. Now he stands before me and he's turning my world upside down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one time I would have done anything to be close to him. But will that anything include betraying the man I pledged myself to and that loves me faithfully?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samantha Monroe had it all. Or at least everyone thought she did. A career on the rise, a gorgeous husband, great friends and a beautiful home. So why does she feel so alone and empty? When she reconnects with an old flame, lines are tested and compromises made in a quest for happiness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob Matthews always wondered what happened to Sam Monroe. When fate brings them together after all these years, he can't help but wonder if its meant to be. But when he meets his perfect woman, there is no doubt in his mind she's his soul mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will the search for happiness cost them everything or will their love square show them what really matters?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Infinite possibilities….&lt;br&gt;Infinite passion…..&lt;br&gt;Infinite danger….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His touch spirals through me, warm and sweet, wicked and hot. I shouldn’t trust him. I shouldn’t tell him my secrets. But how do I not when he is the reason I breathe? He is what I need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the young age of eighteen, tragedy and a dark secret force Lara to flee all she has known and loves to start a new life. Now years later, with a new identity as Amy, she’s finally dared to believe she is forgotten–even if she cannot forget. But just when she lets down her guard, the ghosts of her past are quick to punish her, forcing her back on the run.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a plane, struggling to face the devastation of losing everything again and starting over, Amy meets Liam Stone, a darkly entrancing recluse billionaire, who is also a brilliant, and famous, prodigy architect. A man who knows what he wants and goes after it. And what he wants is Amy. Refusing to take “no” as an answer, he sweeps her into a passionate affair, pushing her to her erotic limits. He wants to possess her. He makes her want to be possessed. Liam demands everything from her, accepting nothing less. But what if she is too devastated by tragedy to know when he wants more than she should give? And what if there is more to Liam than meets the eyes?</description>

  <description>What do you do when everything you avoid, turns out to be exactly what you need?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Easy and predictable, just the way he likes it, Blake Daniels flies through life the way he burns through women: on his terms, no regrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his fighting career in full swing, he's on the threshold of title contention. But when his training is compromised by injury, the stakes grow impossibly higher. The rage that fuels his punches also chips away at his focus, and he risks losing everything he cares about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He won’t let that happen. Not again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Layla’s through with men. After a marriage that never should’ve happened, she hopes to reclaim the pieces of the woman she lost years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emotional abuse has left her insecure and terrified. A master at faking what she’s not feeling, she masks her self-doubt in false confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’ll never let another man hurt her. Not again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chased by shadows of the past, Blake and Layla know what they don’t want, but their hearts have a different plan. As a web of lies and betrayal threatens to destroy them, they’re forced to make a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is love enough to heal even the deepest wounds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or will they be left Fighting to Forgive?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Live young. Live hard. Love deep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charley Redford was just an ordinary girl until Jake Caplin moved to her small town in Indiana and convinced her she was extraordinary. Almost from day one Jake pulled Charley into the deep and promised he was right there with her. But when a tragic incident darkened Jake’s life he waded out into the shallows and left Charley behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost four years later Charley thinks she’s moved on. That is until she takes a study year abroad in Edinburgh and bumps into none other than Jake Caplin at a party with his new girlfriend. The bad-boy-turned-good attempts to convince Charley to forgive him, and as her best friend starts spending time with Jake’s, Charley calls a truce, only to find herself tumbling back into a friendship with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they grow closer, the spark between them flares and begins playing havoc with their lives and relationships. When jealousy and longing rear their destructive heads, Charley and Jake struggle to come to grips with what they mean to one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And even if they work it out, there is no guarantee Charley will ever trust Jake to lead her back into the deep…</description>

More than just her body, she must recover her heart after an altering declaration by Nathan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all that happened between them she must chose to forgive him and take him back, or sever all ties. Nathan has a hard road ahead of him to earn back her trust, and doing so will open her up to the possibility of being hurt again. A possibility Lila doesn’t think she can survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The secrets Nathan keeps buried, hidden from the world, of the life he used to lead are revealed. They tell the horror of what caused the scars on his body, mind, and heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Lila and Nathan push through all of the obstacles in front of them? Will the journey be their healing, or their destruction?</description>

  <description>My name is Tate. He doesn't call me that, though. He would never refer to me so informally, if he referred to me at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; We're neighbors, and once, we were best friends. But then, one summer, he turned on me and has made it his mission to screw up my life at every opportunity. I've been humiliated, shut out, and gossiped about all through high school. His pranks and rumors got more sadistic as time wore on, and I made myself sick trying to hide from him. I worried about what was around every corner and behind every door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; So I left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I spent a year studying abroad and bathed in the freedom of life without Jared. Now I'm back to finish up high school and get the hell out of here forever. I'm hoping that after a year of breathing room, he's moved on and forgotten all about me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But even if he hasn't changed, I have. I'm not interested in avoiding him or turning the other cheek anymore. We're going to go head to head, because neither of us wants to back down.</description>

  <description>Tracey Garvis Graves - and Anna and T.J. - return in this companion novella to the New York Times bestseller On the Island&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When twenty-three-year-old dot-com millionaire Owen Sparks walked away from his charmed life, he had one goal in mind: get as far away as possible from the people who resented his success, or had their hand out for a piece of it.  A remote uncharted island halfway around the world seemed like a perfectly logical place to get away from it all.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calia Reed wasn't part of Owen's plans.  The beautiful British girl - on holiday in the Maldives with her brother, James - made Owen wonder if getting away from it all might be a lot more enjoyable with a carefree girl who didn't know anything about the life he left behind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Owen had no idea how much his carefully detailed plans would go awry.  Nor did he realize that a decision he made would have such a catastrophic effect on two passengers who boarded a plane in Chicago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And when Owen shows up at Anna and T.J.'s door with an incredible story to tell, everyone involved will learn just how much their lives are intertwined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uncharted includes an early look at Covet, coming September 2013.</description>

  <description>Welcome to the South - where the tea is sweet and the accents are sweeter. This Southern way of life is all Charlie has ever known.  It’s not until she loses the only person who pushed her to break free of the Southern Belle mold that she starts living the life she needs and not the life her parents forced on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jhett has lived on the edge for as long as he could remember - constantly teetering back and forth between being a rock star and living a normal life.  His rebellious and sometimes arrogant attitude is known to get him into trouble, especially with the girls who hang on his every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie never thought that a trip to pack up her brother’s apartment would leave her feeling even more unsettled about the grainy details of her brother’s death.  Her quest for information leads her straight to his old hangout and into arms of Jhett, who suspiciously knows more about her situation than he ever should. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a few questions remain - Can you trust someone based on their word alone? And if you make a promise, how far will you go to keep it?</description>

  <description>Waking up in Vegas was never meant to be like this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evelyn Thomas’s plans for celebrating her twenty-first birthday in Las Vegas were big. Huge. But she sure as hell never meant to wake up on the bathroom floor with a hangover to rival the black plague, a very attractive half-naked tattooed man, and a diamond on her finger large enough to scare King Kong. Now if she could just remember how it all happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing is for certain, being married to rock and roll’s favourite son is sure to be a wild ride.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;You know how sometimes, your high school crush grows up to be an insanely famous movie star? Okay, probably not. But I do.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;~Layla Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back in high school, Trip Wiley’s fanbase only encompassed the denizens of the nothing little suburb of Norman, New Jersey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ten years later, all that is about to change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the summer of 2000, Layla Warren is enjoying her career as a journalist in New York City (well, sort of), while Trip spends most of his time grabbing Hollywood by the balls. In the days before what will turn out to be his skyrocketing fame, they’ll find themselves confronted with some life-altering choices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remember When 2&lt;/em&gt; is the second story in an NA romance trilogy. It will bring you back to that exuberant and riotous time of life in your twenties when you struggled to figure out your place in the world and the person you were meant to be…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…and the person you were meant to be &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;**Intended for ages 18+ due to some questionable language and sex.**&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Note from the author--This book is intended for a mature reading audience and isn't suitable for younger readers.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fate hasn’t always been friends with Isabelle West. In fact, fate has been a downright bitch. Isabelle has learned the hard way how hard life can be when fate isn’t by your side. It can hand you dreams on silver platters, but it can snatch them right back and hand you nightmares. One thing Isabelle knew for sure fate was consistent with was taking away everything she ever loved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the last two years Isabelle has been slowly clearing the clouds of her past. Happiness is finally on the horizon. She has a thriving business, great friends, and her life back. All she has to do is jump over the last hurdle…her ex-husband. When problems start causing her to fear her new life, and memories that are better left forgotten start rushing to the surface the last thing she needs is a ghost from her past to come knocking on her door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Axel never thought he would look into the eyes of Isabelle West again, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to now. He’s carried his anger for so long he isn’t sure he can just turn it off, but when he is faced with protecting her and an unexpected desire to have her again, life gets a little more complicated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How will Axel and Isabelle deal when all their cards are put on the table and everything they thought was true blows up in their faces?</description>

  <description>Revenge isn’t what the Eves are about. Justice is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Sienna Stevens leaves Miami for her Errand in Seattle as Ally Andrews, revenge is the only thing on her mind. A woman scorned is one thing, but Ally is something else altogether. She will not rest until the man who upended her world is brought to his personal and financial knees. She won’t settle for just upending his world in return. She’s going for full-blown annihilation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ally’s barely in Seattle a day before complications arise. She begins making slips. She’s one error away from being pulled from the biggest Errand of her career when she comes face to face with Henry Callahan. Former lover. Current Target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things just went from complicated to catastrophic.</description>

  <description>Appearances are not always reality…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what twenty-year old Tori discovers when she moves in with her best friend, Liv for the summer. Liv’s older brother Brady is everything Tori knows is wrong for her, yet he invokes emotions deep in her soul that she’s never felt with anyone else. When the two eventually succumb to their feelings, Tori realizes Brady is not the same confident guy she’s secretly loved for years. Tori desperately wants Brady to confide in her, but he refuses to talk about the secrets that have drastically changed his life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turning to the one person that always makes her laugh, she begins spending time with the younger brother, Tug. The two grow closer and Tori wonders if her feelings for Tug run deeper than the “just buddies” status they’ve always shared. As she begins to explore her feelings, the conflict between brothers, she’d hoped to avoid erupts. She has to choose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Brady finally reveals his secrets, Tori makes her decision; one that may leave them all Irreparably Broken.</description>

  &lt;em&gt;The worldwide phenomenon continues as Eva and Gideon face the demons of their pasts, and accept the consequences of their obsessive desires…&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn’t resist. I saw the dangerous and damaged soul inside–so much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I’d been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession…</description>

  <description>The story takes you back a few months before Scornfully Yours in Carter’s POV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carter Mason was the playboy soccer stud in their campus. Coming from wealth and good genes, he was used to getting everything he wanted. At a young age, he witnessed how love can become your worst enemy. It was a man’s downfall, an irrevocable poison that will forever haunt you, until you’re out of fight and gasping for your last breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lust at first glance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what Carter instantly thought when his eyes landed on Emma Anderson for the very first time. She was gorgeous woman who wore her sexiness and naïveté with confidence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both wanted to enjoy each other without the complications of love and all the drama it came with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one thing they both avoided unexpectedly sprouted, causing a rift between them.</description>

  <description>Sometimes the wrong choice can be just right . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fun and fearless, Cora Lewis knows how to keep her tattooed "bad boy" friends at the Marked in line. But beneath all that flash and sass is a broken heart. Cora won't let herself get burned again. She's waiting to fall in love with the perfect man—a baggage-free, drama-free guy ready for commitment. Then she meets Rome Archer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rome Archer is as far from perfect as a man can be. He's stubborn, rigid, and bossy. And he's returned from his final tour of duty more than a little broken. Rome's used to filling many roles: big brother, doting son, supersoldier—but none of those fit anymore. Now he's just a man trying to figure out what to do with the rest of his life while keeping the dark demons of war and loss at bay. He would have been glad to suffer through it alone, until Cora comes sweeping into his life and becomes a blinding flash of color in a sea of gray.Perfect may not be in the cards, but perfectly imperfect could just last forever . . .</description>

  <description>A missed first encounter…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colliding with a second chance…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the heels of graduating college and trying to cope with her mother’s death, Emily Cooper moves to New York City for a fresh start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While harboring secrets of his own, Dillon Parker takes care of Emily through her grief. Knowing he can’t live without her by his side, he’s sweet, thoughtful, and everything Emily has ever wanted in a man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she meets Gavin Blake—a rich and notorious playboy who is dangerously sexy and charming as hell. Emily tries to deny the instant connection she feels, but Mr. Tall, Dark, and Handsome is not inclined to let go so easily. Recovering from his own painful past, Gavin will stop at nothing to win Emily over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This unexpected encounter compels Emily to question her decisions, forcing her to make a choice that will destroy friendships, shatter hearts, and forever change her life.</description>

  <description>When a gorgeous young dancer walks through his door, a strip club owner must decide whether to follow his rules or his heart in the third novel by the author of &lt;em&gt;One Tiny Lie&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ten Tiny Breaths&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owning a strip club isn’t the fantasy most guys expect it to be. With long hours, a staff with enough issues to keep a psych ward in business, and the police regularly on his case, twenty-nine-year-old Cain is starting to second guess his unspoken mission to save the women he employs. And then blond, brown-eyed Charlie Rourke walks through his door, and things get really complicated. Cain abides by a strict “no sleeping with the staff” rule. But being around Charlie challenges Cain’s self-control…and it’s been a long time since any woman has done that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Charlie Rourke needs a lot of money, really fast, in order to vanish before it’s too late. Taking her clothes off for men makes her stomach curl but Charlie tells herself that at least she’s putting her acting and dancing skills to good use. And though her fellow dancers seem eager to nab their sexy, sophisticated, and genuinely caring boss, she’s not interested. After all, Charlie Rourke doesn’t really exist—and the girl pretending to be her can't get distracted by romance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Charlie soon discovers that developing feelings for Cain is inevitable, and that those feelings may not be unrequited—but losing him when he finds out what she’s involved with will be more painful than any other sentence awaiting her.</description>

  <description>(This book includes mature content, including sex and language)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;22-year-old Camryn Jacobs lost the love of her life once and vows to never kiss another guy unless she's in love with him. When she meets Teague, their attraction to one another is off the charts, and for the first time in two years, she wants to disregard her rule. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Camryn makes a bet that he can't go just one week without kissing her. She's protecting her own fragile heart, but her wit and smart mouth end up driving Teague crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Teague is equally skilled at her challenge, their friendship turns complicated. He's not at all what she assumed, and he makes her feel things she never expected to feel. But sharing her true reasons for the no-kiss bet hurts too much and she keeps him in the dark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teague has his own secrets to hide, starting with his last name. It's the reason he left town--to lick his wounds until he can piece his life back together. His time with Camryn proves that it might actually be possible, but with the threat of his family and his past ruining all that he's finally gained, can he really take that risk again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loving might be easy; learning to trust again could be too difficult to achieve...</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you create rules to keep others out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing Emerson Moore has come to terms with is that &lt;strong&gt;she is the school slut.&lt;/strong&gt; She knows her way around a frat house and how to get what she wants. She doesn’t make any excuses for her actions and she doesn’t pretend to be anything different. She is who she is and with that she knows how to have a good time. She’s made rules to keep relationships at bay and avoid the demons of her past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her best friend, Cole has his two friends from back home move in with him she begins to think she has met her match with Jaxon Riley. Jax is the perfect mixture of tattooed muscle and a sweet-talking mouth. With “hand” written notes, a voice that exudes sex and knowing just how to get under her skin, Jaxon learns how to break all the rules. &lt;strong&gt;But will he just end up breaking her heart anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult/Adult Contemporary Romance - recommended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>Charlotte Gates is tired of being Charlie Rae. She loves the lake she was raised on, their rental cabins, and spending her nights under the stars…but inside she yearns for more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After his freshman year, Nathaniel Chase’s family spends their first summer at The Village. From the beginning Charlotte intrigues him. She’s the girl who always says what’s on her mind, wins at night games, and each time she looks through her telescope, gets lost in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of four summers together, Charlotte and Nathaniel become best friends, share firsts, mend broken hearts, protect each other’s secrets, overcome tragedies…fall in love. And say goodbye…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie wants out of The Village. Nate wants her to have her stars. And they dream of being able to do it all together. But life isn’t as easy as their summers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each summer is told in alternating points of view between Charlie and Nate. Journey with the pair, and their friends, as they share their story about growing up, discovering who they are, making tough choices, and falling in love again and again.</description>

  <description>His heart is tied to his past…&lt;br&gt;When Sole Regret’s rhythm guitarist, Kellen Jamison, vowed to be faithful to his fiancée and love her forever, he meant it. He never expected to lose her to cancer so early in life. He’s certain he’ll never love again, but destiny has another plan for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her heart is tied to her work…&lt;br&gt;Grammy-winning classical composer and piano virtuoso, Dawn O’Reilly, is overwhelmed with music-writing deadlines, a fickle muse, and high-expectations. She doesn’t have time to find love, but chance seeks to interfere with her carefully devised plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re bound to become entangled...&lt;br&gt;From the instant Kellen hears Dawn’s latest musical composition, his spirits rise. The stirring melody and the remarkable woman responsible for its creation are impossible to resist. His attraction is undeniable; her passion unquenchable. Kellen teaches Dawn there’s freedom in bondage, while her sensuality drives him to unleash his tightly controlled self-restraint. Will the ropes Kellen uses to secure Dawn’s body be the force that binds them together or ultimately sever all ties between them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kellen and Dawn's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Book 10: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490400.Treasure_Me" title="Treasure Me"&gt;Treasure Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released) and Book 15: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490412.Transfix_Me" title="Transfix Me"&gt;Transfix Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released)</description>

One night was all it took, and I forgot everything and anything except the sexy fighter in the ring who sets my mind ablaze and my body on fire with wanting…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remington Tate is the strongest, most confusing man I’ve ever met in my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s the star of the dangerous underground fighting circuit, and I’m drawn to him as I’ve never been drawn to anything in my life. I forget who I am, what I want, with just one look from him. When he’s near, I need to remind myself that I am strong–but he is stronger. And now it’s my job to keep his body working like a perfect machine, his taut muscles primed and ready to break the bones of his next opponents . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the one he’s most threatening to, now, is me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want him. I want him without fear. Without reservations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If only I knew for sure what it is that he wants from me?</description>

  <description>My mom says that you can’t love someone until you learn to love yourself. &lt;br&gt;So even though Vincent is getting more and more scary. &lt;br&gt;Even though he’s doing a nationwide search for me.&lt;br&gt;I’m going to learn to love myself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, I’m going to try. &lt;br&gt;Mostly, I want a boy to love me. &lt;br&gt;But which one?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawson - The gorgeous boy who made a mistake, but whose molten lava kisses and steaminess I can’t freaking resist. &lt;br&gt;or &lt;br&gt;Aiden - The God of all Hotties, who is practically infused with love potion. Who I thought liked me, but now says he wants to be my friend. &lt;br&gt;or &lt;br&gt;Brooklyn - The boy that first stole my heart. Who has always loved me. Well, until the whole cabana incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mean, it was bad enough when there was sort of a love triangle, but now that I’m talking to B again, it’s like I’m in a love rectangle, or a rhombus, or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and did I mention Cooper Steele? &lt;br&gt;The new soccer coaching, health teaching, tattooed hunk?&lt;br&gt;Who Garrett sent to school to guard my body. &lt;br&gt;I mean, be my bodyguard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But back to loving me. &lt;br&gt;I should forget about boys and worry about me. &lt;br&gt;Love me.&lt;br&gt;Like, eventually.</description>

  <description>A minor penalty that is not called until the offending team gains control of the puck. As long as the non-offending team maintains possession, the referee allows play to continue and signals a delayed penalty by raising his arm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Evan Mason, an NHL hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks. I spend my nights roughing up two hundred pound defensemen and, at times, spend more time in the penalty box than I do on the ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s my job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night changed everything I thought I once knew about my life on, and off, the ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A girl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brutally beaten girl left to die in an alley.&lt;br&gt;I don’t know why or how but something made me stay that night after taking her to the hospital. I didn’t know her, nor did I have an obligation to stay but something inside of me rooted me there telling me I should stay. Saving a life is worth something. At least I thought so. And I wouldn’t have been me if I just simply left her there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any man who put his heart and soul into a game of hockey couldn’t just walk away when someone needed them. She had no one else right now. The same guy who saw determination where there was desire, now saw hope where there was once despair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t leave. That wouldn’t be me. No, not a man that put all he had into something some called just a game. I couldn’t walk away from her holding onto life, weak and powerless to something she had no control over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I stayed. In a room full of family members praying for their loved ones to pull through, I prayed for a girl I didn’t know and had never met before, to have a beating heart. While others’ sorrows turned to grieving pain, I sat waiting on the words of the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No bond is stronger than the ones you’ll bleed for.</description>

  <description>New Adult. MA 17+ Content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Kylie’s dad dies in a freak accident, he leaves her with nothing other than her crazy step-mother, Darla, and the ability to play guitar. When Darla kicks Kylie out and she loses her job all in the same day, she hops a bus to Nashville determined to make her late father’s dreams come true. Waitressing and saving her pennies to record a demo, her big break comes when she’s asked to join a tour going down the tubes with once platinum album-selling country music superstar Trace Corbin. But touring with Trace is hardly a dream come true since he’s pretty much drinking his career down the drain. If Kylie can’t pull Trace out of his rut, he’ll pull her and her dreams down with him.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Some things are worth waiting for…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling thousands of miles from home to enter college is the only way nineteen-year-old Avery Morgansten can escape what happened at the Halloween party five years ago—an event that forever changed her life. All she needs to do is make it to her classes on time, make sure the bracelet on her left wrist stays in place, not draw any attention to herself, and maybe—please God—make a few friends, because surely that would be a nice change of pace. The one thing she didn’t need and never planned on was capturing the attention of the one guy who could shatter the precarious future she’s building for herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things are worth experiencing…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple that’s just so… so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous, but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible, he brings out a side of her she never knew existed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some things should never be kept quiet…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Avery starts receiving threatening emails and phone calls forcing her to face a past she wants silenced, she’s has no other choice but to acknowledge that someone is refusing to allow her to let go of that night when everything changed. When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar? And can Cam be there to help her or will he be dragged down with her?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And some things are worth fighting for…&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Trista Stevens&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things went quickly sour with the already married Harry when she found out their affair had a bigger repercussion. Heartbroken, she had to do what was best for everyone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as planned, she and Lindsey went to visit Emma in Greece. Trista thought this vacation was going to be a way for her to heal and come to terms with of the gargantuan mistakes she’s made in the past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor Montgomery thought himself a rational man, but meeting the fiery Trista made him think twice. Yet, her mask slips once in awhile. She carried pain and secrets hidden from within. Her fire and vulnerability made him want to protect her all the more. But Trista wouldn’t have any of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing Trista should know about the indispensable man though. He's not the kind who gives up easily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Come what may.</description>

  <description>Blue Echohawk doesn't know who she is.  She doesn't know her real name or when she was born.  Abandoned at two and raised by a drifter, she didn't attend school until she was ten years old.  At nineteen, when most kids her age are attending college or moving on with life, she is just a senior in high school.   With no mother, no father, no faith, and no future, Blue Echohawk is a difficult student, to say the least. Tough, hard and overtly sexy, she is the complete opposite of the young British teacher who decides he is up for the challenge, and takes the troublemaker under his wing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of a nobody who becomes somebody.  It is the story of an unlikely friendship, where hope fosters healing and redemption becomes love.  But falling in love can be hard when you don't know who you are.  Falling in love with someone who knows exactly who they are and exactly why they can't love you back might be impossible.</description>

  <description>Butch O'Neal is a fighter by nature. A hard-living ex-homicide cop, he's the only human ever to be allowed in the inner circle of the Black Dagger Brotherhood. And he wants to go even deeper into the vampire world-to engage in the turf war with the lessers. His heart belongs to a female vampire, Marissa, an aristocratic beauty who's way out of his league. And if he can't have her, then at least he can fight side by side with the Brothers. But fate curses him with the very thing he wants. When Butch sacrifices himself to save a civilian vampire from the slayers, he falls prey to the darkest force in the war. Left for dead, he's found by a miracle, and the Brotherhood calls on Marissa to bring him back, though even her love may not be enough to save him.</description>

  <description>Delilah Palmer has control of her life and outward personality, blocking the truth just below the surface. A façade meant to be normal and hide the scars of her childhood. She’s made a good life for herself, became a lawyer, and is free from the tortured past that haunts her daily. Until he comes along and breaks open the cracks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nathan Thorne has a past of his own. On the surface he is loved by all, personable, extroverted; everything Delilah isn’t. Hidden beneath is a dark and tormented man that only Delilah has to power to unveil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crammed in a small office together they see through each other’s masks, and the draw becomes too much, igniting an explosive relationship. Holloway and Holloway Law has a strict non-fraternization policy, forcing them to conceal their breach. Despite their efforts, separation becomes impossible, deceptions escalate, and Nathan has trouble coping; teetering on the edge of being overtaken by his past demons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What secrets does he harbor that could keep him from giving in? What keeps him from healing and moving forward? And Delilah, where does she fit into all this turmoil?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they accept love and deal with all the trials that come their way when secrets are exposed? Or will they fall through the cracks of their pasts and be consumed by all that haunts them?</description>

  <description>For Damien, our obsession is a game. For me, it is fiercely, blindingly, real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien Stark’s need is palpable—his need for pleasure, his need for control, his need for me. Beautiful and brilliant yet tortured at his core, he is in every way my match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have agreed to be his alone, and now I want him to be fully mine. I want us to possess each other beyond the sweetest edge of our ecstasy, into the deepest desires of our souls. To let the fire that burns between us consume us both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there are dark places within Damien that not even our wildest passion can touch. I yearn to know his secrets, yearn for him to surrender to me as I have surrendered to him. But our troubled pasts will either bind us close . . . or shatter us completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Release Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>Ellie Carmichael had a crush on Adam Sutherland, her brother, Braden’s, best friend, for years, and although Adam treated her with proprietary concern he made it clear he thought of her only as a little sister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the years, as Ellie’s crush develops into love, her romantic idealism makes it difficult for her to move on. To make matters worse, as she’s gotten older, Adam’s attitude has changed toward her. His affection for her is now joined by attraction, but his loyalty to Braden, and his fear of losing the only family he has, stops him from claiming Ellie the way she wishes he would. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But one night his attraction is put to the test, and as much as Adam would like things to remain the same everything changes between them in a simple brush of the lips. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon lust, love, jealousy and heartbreak combine to force change upon their relationship… and Adam discovers the hard way that life is too damn short to spend it on regret.</description>

  <description>Evie and Leo met in foster care as children and formed a bond of friendship. As they grew, their bond turned to love, and they vowed to make a life together when they turned 18 and were no longer a part of the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Leo unexpectedly gets adopted as a teen and he moves to another city, he promises Evie that he will contact her as soon as he gets there and come back for her in a few short years. She never hears from him again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now eight years later, in spite of the odds, Evie has made a life for herself. She has a job. She has friends. She's content. Then a man shows up out of the blue, claiming that her long lost love, Leo, sent him to check up on her. The attraction between them is undeniable. But, should she trust this sexy stranger? Or is he keeping a secret about what his connection to Leo is really all about and why Leo disappeared all those years ago?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>I wasn't always in love with Colton Calloway; I was in love with his younger brother, Kyle, first. Kyle was my first one true love, my first in every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, one stormy August night, he died, and the person I was died with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colton didn't teach me how to live. He didn't heal the pain. He didn't make it okay. He taught me how to hurt, how to not be okay, and, eventually, how to let go.</description>

  <description>Sometimes all you need is Patience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life’s been hard for Zeke. Being a punching bag for his alcoholic father has turned him into stone. Not even the dodgy trailer park he lives in can scare him. Fighting is his release and sex, drugs, and his guitar bring him peace, but deep down Zeke isn’t quite as hard as he makes himself out to be. When he meets Patience, she finds all his broken pieces and puts him back together, but she’s a ray of light in his shadowed life and the last thing he wants to do is bring her into his dark world. Playing careless is easy, playing the bad guy can be fun, but playing Patience is impossible, especially when she can see right through him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zeke isn’t the only one who’s broken, and for the first time, in a long time, Patience feels alive. Her black and white world gets a shot of color when she meets Zeke. He’s unlike anyone she’s ever met with his tattoos, piercings, and blunt honesty. She wants nothing more than to let go and ride the wild side with him, but some wounds never heal and the broken pieces of Patience aren’t so easy to find.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young adult readers.***</description>

  <description>Ever since the one time Andie Weber threw caution to the wind - and paid the price for it - she’s learned that it’s safer and smarter to live life playing by the rules.  Now she’s got a great apartment, a steady job, and a wonderful boyfriend in Colin; he’s sweet, stable, and essentially perfect – except maybe for the fact that his best friend is Chase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chase McGuire lives his carefree, unstructured life strictly for himself. Dripping sarcasm and oozing wit, he refuses to censor his feelings or opinions for anyone, making no apologies for either and wearing his abrasiveness like a badge of honor. No one has ever gotten under Andie’s skin the way Chase does – and vice versa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So when Andie and Chase find themselves forced to take a two-day road trip together, they are already dreading an inevitable all-out war. But as the trip progresses, and the undeniable friction that has always defined their relationship slowly begins to wear away their preconceived notions of each other, Andie and Chase discover they both have a lot to learn about life, courage, happiness, and the age-old battle between logic and love.</description>

  <description>“Who are you?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The image in the mirror staring back at me feigns disinterest.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rock star?  Recovering addict?  Murderer?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can you explain to someone what it’s like not to care?  Not about yourself or the person standing next to you.  I’ve lost that, the ability to feel and show affection. I do, however, have a heart.  Sometimes, when I chase the dragon, it thunders through my head like a drum, reminding me it still beats.  It’s still there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hollow.​  Empty.​  Wasted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My agent says I have one more shot.  A single, solitary chance to stay in the music biz, but there is one massive problem.  HER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***This is a stand-alone book.  It is a spin-off from the Ruining Series; however, you do not have to read the series to read Rhye's story.</description>

  <description>Seduction. Infidelity. Blackmail. Scandal. It can all be bought for the right price and for Sienna Stevens, business is good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because she’s in the business of Great Exploitations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’s an Eve, a member of a secret society of women contracted by the wives of wealthy, powerful men for one reason and one reason only: to seduce their husbands. To ensure their pre-nuptial agreement will be null and void thanks to a little loophole known as the Infidelity Clause. To ensure that those wives don’t find themselves on the other side of a divorce without a penny to their name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the Eves, Sienna’s one of the best because she follows the number one rule of the Eves to the letter: don’t let it get personal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the job file of her wealthiest client yet falls into her lap, Sienna realizes that this case could be the one that’s impossible to detach herself from. The payout would lead to her independence, but will the cost be too high in the end?</description>

But, when she is reconnected with her past, the bonds that form are irrefutable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When River Wilde, lead singer of The Wilde Ones, comes back into Dahlia’s life, the intensity that fires their relationship combined with underlying feelings that have never died lead her to believe she has met her soul mate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling with confusion as old connections fade and new ones begin, Dahlia's grief begins to lift—but guilt remains.

  <description>Beth Morgan is a young woman who’s just been given the ‘once in a lifetime’ opportunity to meet her favorite band, Traveler. That meeting leads to a chance encounter with her idol, the band’s lead singer, Andy Stevens. What follows is a love story. A journey through the peaks, valleys and trials of a relationship lived in the public eye; the miles they traveled together through his career in the music business, and her struggles to stay obscure in a world she never really settled into comfortably. In the end it's all about love, fate, and what the heart can't hold back.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“We both want this so badly. I can feel it resonating between us like the hot pull of our first attraction, tangible and intense.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After lies and betrayal almost destroy their marriage, Dean and Olivia West reignite their blissful passion. The medieval history professor and his lovely wife are determined to fix their mistakes, and Liv’s unexpected pregnancy intensifies their desire to fall madly in love all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then a family crisis forces Dean back into a feud with his parents and siblings, dredging up guilt over a painful family secret. Dean fights to shield Liv from the hostility, but for the first time, Liv resists her white knight’s defense. Her newfound resolve clashes with Dean’s desperate need to protect her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liv and Dean have battled obstacles together before, but bitter family conflicts now endanger their fragile intimacy. And when Dean’s career is suddenly threatened, he and Liv must struggle with events that could damage them in ways they had never imagined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scheduled for mid-May release.</description>

  <description>For fans of Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to You comes an erotic, emotionally charged romance between a powerful man who’s never heard “no” and a fiery woman who says “yes” on her own terms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was the one man I couldn’t avoid. And the one man I couldn’t resist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damien Stark could have his way with any woman. He was sexy, confident, and commanding: Anything he wanted, he got. And what he wanted was me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our attraction was unmistakable, almost beyond control, but as much as I ached to be his, I feared the pressures of his demands. Submitting to Damien meant I had to bare the darkest truth about my past—and risk breaking us apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Damien was haunted, too. And as our passion came to obsess us both, his secrets threatened to destroy him—and us—forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Release Me is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.</description>

  <description>There’s complicated. And there’s Rowen Sterling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After numbing pain for the past five years with boys, alcohol, and all-around apathy, she finds herself on a Greyhound bus to nowhere Montana the summer after she graduates high school. Her mom agreed to front the bill to Rowen’s dream art school only if Rowen proves she can work hard and stay out of trouble at Willow Springs Ranch. Cooking breakfast at the crack of dawn for a couple dozen ranch hands and mucking out horse stalls are the last things in the world Rowen wants to spend her summer doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Jesse Walker saunters into her life wearing a pair of painted-on jeans, a cowboy hat, and a grin that makes something in her chest she’d thought was frozen go boom-boom. Jesse’s like no one else, and certainly nothing like her. He’s the bright and shiny to her dark and jaded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rowen knows there’s no happily-ever-after for the golden boy and the rebel girl—happily-right-now is a stretch—so she tries to forget and ignore the boy who makes her feel things she’s not sure she’s ready to feel. But the more she pushes him away, the closer he seems to get. The more she convinces herself she doesn’t care, the harder she falls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her dark secrets refuse to stay locked behind the walls she’s kept up for years, Rowen realizes it’s not just everyone else she needs to be honest with. It’s herself.</description>

  <description>Bailey Gray is tired of her perfectly planned life. Everything about her life has been organized and lived out to the expectations set of her parents. She is the class valedictorian, has perfect grades, the perfect friends, a perfect boyfriend, basically perfect life...or so everyone thought. That's when she realizes the path planned isn't always the path chosen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On graduation day she makes a decision. One that changes everything she thought she knew about her intended future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a whim, she runs away with the town rebel, Dylan Wade, in search of the unknown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan Wade isn't looking to run away from anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows what he wants as he's been waiting on it for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a journey to find the unknown, they discover a friendship they once knew along the open highway and have not a care in the world. Between the yellow and white lines of the heated summer asphalt, a spark draws them together as Dylan's past and Bailey future try to rip them apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could it be that Dylan and his GTO are exactly what her perfectly planned life needs?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A Companion Novel to The Proposition and The Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her former boyfriend left her pregnant and alone, Megan McKenzie swore off men. She spent the last eighteen months focused solely on her son, Mason, along with finishing nursing school at the top of her class. Although she’s not ready to complicate her life with a long-term relationship, a nice no-strings attached hook-up is just what she needs. At her godson, Noah’s, baptism, she finds the perfect candidate in the soft-spoken godfather, Pesh Nadeen.  After all, the widower could use a good time too. But after drinking too much, the night doesn’t end the way she thought it would. Forced to leave Pesh’s house through a walk of shame, Megan hopes to never, ever see him again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Pesh Nadeen, the very sight of Megan sends him into an emotional tailspin. Since she reminds him too much of what he has lost, he wants to be out of her sight…at first. But the more he gets to know her, there's something about the diminutive blonde that causes his protective side to go into overdrive, and he finds himself wanting more. When Megan is assigned to work in his ER to complete her nursing clinicals, he sees it as fate, but she’s having no part of it. She only wants a physical relationship while he wants far more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What happens next is a sexy game of cat and mouse to see who will break first or if both of them will eventually get more than they ever bargained for.</description>

  <description>An old flame rekindled . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zara Cinders always knew Ham Reece was the one, but he wasn't interested in settling down. When she found someone who was, Ham walked out of her life. Three years later, Zara's lost her business, her marriage, and she's barely getting by in a tiny apartment on the wrong side of the tracks. As soon as Ham hears about Zara's plight, he's on her doorstep offering her a lifeline. Now, it will take every ounce of will power she possesses to resist all that he offers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ham was always a traveling man, never one to settle down in one town, with one woman, for more time than absolutely necessary. But Ham's faced his own demons, and he's learned a lot. About himself, and about the life he knows he's meant to live. So when he hears that Zara's having a rough time, he wants to be the one to help. In fact, he wants to do more than that for Zara. A lot more. But first, he must prove to Zara that he's a changed man.</description>

  <description>Alexandra's older brother died the night he graduated. That day changed everything for her. No longer was she the party girl. No longer did she care about being popular and no longer was her family the happy unit she always thought existed. The only person who could help her heal is the same person who loved her brother as much as she did, his best friend. She only hopes to keep her entire heart from breaking when Jesse will move on, and she knows he will. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Ethan died, Jesse excelled at basketball, partying, and girls. He used it all to turn his emotions off, but the irony was that Alex was the only person who could do that for him. She helped him forget, but she was the one person he shouldn't be with because the secrets he knows could shatter everything. They could shatter her.</description>

  <description>A Story Inspired by Steven Tyler: The first book in a three-part series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It happened by accident, a lottery of events…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1988, a blind seven-year-old lay in a hospital room longing for her mother, unaware that eight years earlier a chance encounter occurred that would shape her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;American musician Bobby Carter moved to Manchester, England with one objective—to become a major player in the postpunk scene of the late Seventies. His quest for stardom steers him in the direction of Kindle Hyrum, whose feistiness is only exceeded by her raw beauty. Though Bobby’s steady pursuit trumps Kindle’s cheeky resistance—sweeping them into present bliss—past secrets, new temptations, and a series of hapless and happy accidents will determine their future...and the future of a blind child.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set to the lyrical soundtrack of the 60s and 70s, A Happy Accident is a story of love and choice that transcends the ages.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;How do you move on when he’s every song you sing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Laurelyn Prescott walks away from the love of her life, she returns to Nashville to pursue the only dream she has left. Determined to find a distraction from the pain of losing Jack Henry, she immerses herself in her music. But with her old life comes old acquaintances and new expectations. When Laurelyn refuses her record producer’s outrageous demands, she finds herself without a career—until an unforeseen opportunity presents itself. From there it’s a rocket ride straight to the top where Laurelyn finds the success she’s always dreamed of. Will it be enough to bring her the happiness she so deserves, or will the absence of Jack Henry leave her wanting more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Henry McLachlan never expected to fall in love with Laurelyn Prescott—but he did. After he foolishly let her slip through his fingers, he spends three months searching for her, but their reunion doesn’t come easy. The woman he finds isn’t the same one who drifted away without a goodbye. No longer an insecure girl on an Australian adventure, this Laurelyn is a successful musician with a promising career. Her dreams are becoming a reality, and Jack is terrified his American girl won’t have a place for him in her new life. With only a month to convince her otherwise, will it be enough time to make her visualize a life beyond the glitz and glamour, a life that includes him?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A good girl trying to find herself.&lt;br&gt;A troubled boy running from his past.&lt;br&gt;The seductive allure of the cirque.&lt;br&gt;One summer that will change them both forever …&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Eighteen-year-old ballerina Ariel is determined to experience life outside the dance studio. She auditions for the cirque on a whim, and though ballet training didn’t prepare her for dodging knives, she refuses to flinch and wins the spot of target girl alongside Gabriel, the mysterious knife-thrower. There’s something unmistakably dangerous yet tempting about Gabriel’s crystal blue eyes and tattoos. She’s determined to solve the mystery of his past after learning he’s on the run from the law. Especially since the distraction is just what she needs to avoid admitting to her parents she was dismissed from her ballet contract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The more she learns about Gabriel, the scars on his body, the foster homes he grew up in, and his fascination with knives, she knows she should run the other way, but that boy’s like crack, oh so bad for you, yet addicting as hell. When he’s arrested and forced to deal with his past, she has to choose between putting her own life back together and dealing with her parents, or taking a chance on Gabriel, as no one else has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cirque is a contemporary new adult romance.</description>

  <description>They agreed on three months...but their love knew no boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack McLachlan is a winemaking magnate and easily one of Australia’s most eligible bachelors. His success and wealth make him no stranger to the complications of romantic relationships and that’s why he goes to extreme measures to avoid the hassle. He prefers simplicity in the form of a beautiful female companion with no strings attached. He arranges relationships like business deals and they’re always the same. No long term relationships. No real names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s his game and his rules. He’s content to play as usual, but when Laurelyn Prescott enters his life, his strategy must change because this player is like none he's ever encountered. His world is turned on its head after he begins a three month affair with the beautiful American musician. Nothing goes according to plan and as he breaks more and more of his own rules for her, she’s exceptionally close to becoming something he never thought possible. His ultimate game changer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not recommended for younger readers due to sexual content and language.</description>

  <description>Aleena Moore is content with her life. She has goals and dreams and an easy smile. She also has a secret she holds locked inside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared Holt believes he doesn’t deserve to love or be loved. He destroys everything he touches. Haunted by the mistake that shattered his life, he’s fled from the memory of that pain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jared doesn’t know why he’s compelled to return, but finds himself drawn back to the place where it all began. The exact place where it ended. When he runs into his childhood best friend, Aleena’s older brother Christopher, he agrees to share Christopher and Aleena’s apartment while he looks for a place of his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aleena is no longer the little girl Jared remembers from his past and evokes feelings in him he never wanted to feel again. Terrified of destroying her, he fights to keep her away. But her touch is something he can’t resist—the touch that sealed his fate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their pasts are intertwined and their futures uncertain. The only truths they know are the secrets they whisper in the night.</description>

  <description>Scarlett MacGregor has lived a very sheltered life courtesy of her over-the-top controlling parents. Having never been to a co-ed party, much less on a date, Scarlett has relied on her books, her music, and living vicariously through her best friend Evie to keep her sanity as she's patiently awaited her freedom from their rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Scarlett and Evie go away to college, Scarlett quickly meets Ashton, Dylan, and later, Mason, and is thrown into a crash course of like, love, and lust. With Evie's help, she must figure out the difference in the three and which one she wants before she ends up without any of them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metamorphosis is the story of Scarlett's transformation from a young, naive girl to a strong, mature young woman and her search for self-discovery and true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Recommended for readers 17+ due to sexual content and harsh language.**</description>

  <description>Eighteen year old Jay Stevenson is living a horrible nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two years ago, she had the world in the palm of her hand, but in one moment, it was ruined. Secrets, lies, and the worst imaginable betrayal haunt her new reality. Burying her problems under a cold façade seems to be the only way to cope until it all catches up with her.  Soon, she loses control of the lonely world she built around her, and the past, present, and future collide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three guys are there when it all comes crashing down: JT, the perfect boyfriend she never wanted to give up; Rhye, the local bad boy “rock star” who made her forget the past; and Kane, the funny and sweet tattooed bartender who wants her future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Secrets must be kept. Choices must be made. Is it possible to move forward while still chained to the wicked vices of the past?</description>

  <description>Enter the world of the highly-acclaimed Experiment in Terror Series by visiting...the Darkhouse:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s always been something a bit off about Perry Palomino. Though she’s been dealing with a quarter-life crisis and post-college syndrome like any other twenty-something, she’s still not what you would call “ordinary.” For one thing, there’s her past which she likes to pretend never happened, and then there’s the fact that she sees ghosts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily for her, that all comes in handy when she stumbles across Dex Foray, an eccentric producer for an upcoming webcast on ghost hunters. Even though the show’s budget is non-existent and Dex himself is a maddening enigma, Perry is instantly drawn into a world that both threatens her life and seduces her with a sense of importance. Her uncle’s haunted lighthouse provides the perfect catalyst and backdrop for a mystery that unravels the threads of Perry’s fragile sanity and causes her to fall for a man, who, like the most dangerous of ghosts, may not be all that he seems.</description>

  <description>Sparrow Fisher is transforming. No longer dressed up in antiquated clothes and ideals, she is finally trying on her freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before she moves to New York City, she meets Ian Sterling, a musician Sparrow has dreamed about since she first saw him. The attraction is instant, but their relationship isn't so simple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over a five year span, Sparrow and Ian run into each other in unusual places. Each time, Sparrow has to decide if she can trust him, if he feels the same for her, and finally, if love is really enough.</description>

  <description>Makenna James thinks her day can't get any worse, until she finds herself stuck in a pitch-black elevator with a complete stranger. Distracted by a phone call and juggling too much stuff, the pin-striped accountant caught only a glimpse of a dragon tattoo on his hand before the lights went out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caden Grayson is amused when a redhead literally falls at his feet. His amusement turns to panic when the power fails. Despite his piercings, tats, and vicious scar, he's terrified of the dark and confined spaces. Now, he's trapped in his own worst nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To fight fear, they must both reach out and open up. With no preconceived notions based on looks to hold them back, they discover just how much they have in common. In the warming darkness, attraction grows and sparks fly, but will they feel the same when the lights come back on?</description>

  <description>Mason and Logan Kade are two brothers who did their own thing. They were rich and expected to attend her school, Fallen Crest Academy. They chose public school and now Samantha has to live with them. The problem is that she doesn't care at all: about them, about her friends, about her cheating boyfriend, or even about her parent's divorce. But maybe that's a good thing. Maybe change is a good thing.</description>

  <description>For Noah Sullivan being the best friend to a douchebag and player like Jake Nelson has never been easy. It's been a rocky road since kindergarten when Jake duct taped Noah to his chair before recess.  With just six weeks to high school graduation, Jake accidentally blows his drunken ass up on his grandfather's tractor, and Noah finds himself immersed not only in a whirlwind of grief, but on a quest to find a mystery girl from Jake's past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While cleaning out Jake's room, Noah and Jake's dad make a startling discovery. Instead of the obligatory porn collection or pot stash, they find a ring, but not just any ring. Its half a carat of commitment in a platinum setting-proving even man whores have taste. After Jake's mom pleads with Noah to find the girl who meant so much to Jake, Noah begins a modern day Grail quest to track the girl down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Jake was a notorious player with a legendary collection of trophy panties, Noah finds himself in over his head. There are the usual suspects like Avery, the Ice Princess Jake dated for appearances, or Presley, the school mattress Jake dated for convenience. But the trail begins to point to the most unlikely of suspects: Maddie, the Valedictorian and choir girl who was trying to help the unmotivated jock graduate--the girl who also has surprisingly caught Noah's eye and meddled with his heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hanging out with Maddie shows Noah a different side of Jake--one that was deeply human and surprisingly douche-free. And the more he tries to solve the mystery of the ring and of Jake, the more Noah starts to discover about himself and of love.</description>

That one single word best describes my life these last few years. I’m working at a temporary job until I can finally break free. I’m my little brother’s temporary mother since our mom doesn’t give a crap about either of us. And I’m that temporary girl all the guys want to get with because I give it up so easily. According to the rumors, at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now I’m the temporary girlfriend of Drew Callahan, college football legend and all around golden guy. He’s beautiful, sweet—and he’s hiding way more secrets than I am. He’s brought me into this fake life where everyone seems to hate me. And everyone seems to want something from him. The only thing he seems to want though is…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t know what to believe anymore. All I know is, I think Drew needs me. And I want to be there for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forever.</description>

  <description>The pounding in Anna's heart rings in her ears as she sits naked in the tub. The bath water sloshes around her bare hips, even though she tries to stand without making a sound. All this time, Anna thought someone was following her, but every time she turned around no one was there. The chills that climbed up her spine those few times seemed silly, but not now. Now, they seem horrific. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole is gone, Emma is at work, and Anna is completely alone. A shadow darkens the space under the door. The metallic clink of a hand touching the knob sends Anna out of her mind. Pulse pounding in her ears, Anna has no other option, but to open the bathroom door and come face to face with her stalker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volume 5 is the final book in the bestselling SECRETS series.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>At night, when Anna closes her eyes, everything comes rushing back; the sensuous sound of Cole’s voice, his scalding touch, and the way his eyes roved over her body like he could never get enough. Flirtation, promises of passionate sex, and nights filled with Cole’s sexy smile are gone. Anna worries that her crush on Cole was something more, because her life is total agony without him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna realizes she’s at a turning point. Someone burned her. This isn’t a little blister that would go away on its own, it’s an inferno that destroyed everything it touched. In a matter of minutes, Anna lost her future and the man who holds her heart.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna has to decide how and when to get even with the person who destroyed her life—Sophia Sottero.</description>

  <description>*WARNING: This story contains sexually explicit content*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Anna admits she's falling for Cole she can't believe his response. He pushes her away with an excuse that seems too flimsy to be real. Crushed, Anna continues working at Cole's Long Island studio, but she can't stop thinking about him. It isn't until Anna is called into the dean's office that the real trouble starts. To make matters worse, Edward keeps popping up at the worst times reminding her of everything she wants to forget.</description>

  <description>Sexy thoughts about Cole fill Anna's dreams. Every detail burns brightly in her mind; the way his hands feel on her bare skin, the soft brush of his lips against hers, and the way their bodies fit perfectly together. Anna awakes breathless, tingling as if it really happened. What caused her to think about Cole like that? It was completely forbidden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Anna didn't feel that way about him, at least she didn't think she did. Cole was fun to flirt with, that's all, and the sexual tension between them was normal, right? Everyone has that from time to time with some super-hot guy. It made sense. Her mind was just telling her that she needs a boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what if Cole's the right guy? What if he's right there and Anna lets him slip through her fingers?  Cole's more than she bargained for, with enough sex appeal to make Anna realize everything she's been missing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Warning: This novel has sexually explicit content*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each volume tracks a different stage of Anna and Cole's relationship. &lt;br&gt;Vol. 1&lt;br&gt;Vol. 2&lt;br&gt;Vol. 3 &lt;br&gt;Vol. 4&lt;br&gt;Vol. 5&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Genre: Mature YA/ New Adult</description>

  <description>Here's the deal... I learned a long time ago that sometimes you have to use what you've got to make things happen.  What I happen to have is a pretty smile, long legs and the ability to make men believe anything I say.  Before you get on your high horse and start judging me, can you honestly say you've never batted your lashes at some guy for a free drink at the bar? That's what I thought.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep that in mind as I tell you my story of how I took it one step further.  My story of lies, deceit, manipulation and love.  Yeah, love.  Believe me, it fits.  Especially, when you factor in Nick and Tucker –  one had my heart and the other one wanted it all for himself.  Which one?  Well, I can't tell you that.  It would defeat the purpose of the story.  If I'm going to fill you in about me, Lila Garrison, and my life as a con artist you're going to need to know all the facts, including the ones about the two guys who made me want to give up the life of fancy clothes, expensive jewelry, fast cars and easy money.  Because sometimes, one person can give you something that's more valuable than all of that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're still interested, stick around.  Just remember, I'm pretty good at convincing people to do what I want, so if by the end of this whole thing you feel worked over, don't say I didn't warn you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COVER REVEAL FEBRUARY 7th!</description>

  <description>Livie has always been the stable one of the two Cleary sisters, handling her parents' tragic death and Kacey's self-destructive phase with strength and maturity. But underneath that exterior is a little girl hanging onto the last words her father ever spoke to her. “Make me proud,” he had said. She promised she would...and she’s done her best over the past seven years with every choice, with every word, with every action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Livie walks into Princeton with a solid plan, and she’s dead set on delivering on it: Rock her classes, set herself up for medical school, and meet a good, respectable guy that she’s going to someday marry. What isn’t part of her plan are Jell-O shots, a lovable, party animal roommate she can’t say ‘no’ to, and Ashton, the gorgeous captain of the men’s rowing team. Definitely him. He’s an arrogant ass who makes Livie’s usually non-existent temper flare and everything she doesn’t want in a guy. Worse, he’s best friends and roommates with Connor, who happens to fits Livie’s criteria perfectly. So why does she keep thinking about Ashton?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Livie finds herself facing mediocre grades, career aspirations she no longer thinks she can handle, and feelings for Ashton that she shouldn’t have, she’s forced to let go of her last promise to her father and, with it, the only identity that she knows.</description>

  <description>**Mature Content Warning** 17+ for language and sexual content.&lt;br&gt;(A re-imagining of my young adult book, The Fallen Star, told as a New Adult Paranormal)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For twenty-one year-old Gemma, life has never been normal. She knows nothing about her past and has been haunted by the same monsters in her nightmares for the last few months.  Unemotional and numb to life, she feels disconnected from everyone. Until the very first day she cries. After that, nothing in her life is the same. &lt;br&gt;Her emotions slowly surface and she starts experiencing love, happiness, and anger, feelings she never knew existed. But they leave her confused and she doesn’t know whether to embrace them or run away from them.&lt;br&gt;Her life only gets more complicated when she meets Alex. Sexy, arrogant, and secretive, Alex can get under Gemma’s skin like no one can. Yet she’s drawn to him by an invisible connection she has no control over. She’s also seen him before. In her nightmares. &lt;br&gt;Every part of Gemma’s mind is screaming at her to stay away from Alex, but every other part of her is begging to get close to him. But the closer she gets, the more she realizes Alex knows more about her than he originally let on.&lt;br&gt;As secrets about her past unravel, Gemma’s life becomes threatened. She needs to figure out what’s going on, before she winds up dead. But the only person she can turn to for answers is the one person she isn’t sure she can trust.</description>

  <description>Myra Sommers, an attractive young copy editor living in Philadelphia, makes the tough decision to return to her family home in Nyssa, Oregon. A recent death leaves her with no remaining family, and she decides to heal and regroup there. Her decision to leave is solidified by recent revelations involving her cheating ex-boyfriend, Trent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Myra parts ways with her only friend, Susie O’Connor, a zany woman who’s more than a little insane. In Nyssa, Myra finds little immediate comfort in her “new” home which is literally falling apart around her. She sinks into a deep depression, exacerbated by her feelings of loneliness and isolation in the small town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;News of Myra’s return takes no time to spread through Nyssa, and she quickly encounters several locals, some friendly, some not. Among the friendly faces is Jim, an elderly neighbor whom she begins to rely on for help and companionship. When she realizes that she’s going to have to hire someone to do repairs on her broken-down home, Jim gives her the name of a local contractor, Dylan Lawson, who has done work for him in the past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Myra calls Dylan for an estimate, she’s astounded by the contractor’s gruff, surly demeanor. But she trusts Jim and there are few other options in the small town. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan can’t help but notice that Myra is young, single, and beautiful, which makes him suspicious of her real reason for calling him. The women in Nyssa pursue him relentlessly but he’s not in the least bit interested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Myra approves his estimate, Dylan begins the process of repairing her home. While he works, she begins writing a book; that is, when she’s not fielding insane calls from Susie who misses her like crazy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slowly, a reluctant friendship develops between the pair, followed by romantic feelings which neither of them can fight. However, their painful past experiences threaten to tear them apart. Can they move beyond their despair and open their hearts to love?</description>

  <description>Holly has her whole life mapped out. It’s simple, really. She just needs to finish her degree in journalism, marry Collin—her high school sweetheart—and live happily ever after.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Max has had a crush on his friend Holly since he moved to town four years ago. He’s been dreading her wedding since she first sent him a text telling him the news. He's dreading it so much, in fact, that he's decided to move back to his hometown in California immediately following the ceremony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He never thought that a change of plan would include taking Holly with him, showing her that sometimes the happily ever after you really want, is the one you never knew you were looking for.</description>

Heartbroken and lost, she decides that she needs a fresh start, in a new city, far away from everything and everyone from her old life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After getting burned the first time, the last thing on Victoria’s mind is love.

  <description>On the idyllic campus of Indiana University, Little-Libby-Nobody runs into Band-Aid All-American-Athlete, and fireworks explode. Libby and Aidan spiral into a collision course of love at first sight versus lust you can’t fight. As the game plays out and their affection grows, they soon realize that labels like cutters and jocks can’t keep them apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Libby and Aidan find themselves in trouble they have to confront the reality of where they each fit in the others’ world. Libby believes superstar jocks don’t take cutters to Rose Well House, in the center of campus, at midnight and pledge their undying devotion beneath its sparkling dome. And Band-Aid imagines there’s no place for a pregnant, small-town waitress in his bull-pen or the major leagues. What happens when worthy opponents refuse to play their hearts out?</description>

  <description>Everything always seems to fall into place for twenty-four year-old Aubrey Jenson, except for when it comes to her luck with men. Bad boys always draw her in and crush her heart, and Black Falcon’s lead guitarist, Riff, is no exception. After sharing a few wild nights together, she leaves him behind, knowing a guy like Riff isn’t the relationship type, merely just a play thing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she returns to New York, she tries to get the passion she felt in Riff’s arms out of her head by dating Isaac, a successful representative at Center Stage Marketing. Just when she thinks she’s forgotten Riff, she’s forced to see him again when her best friend, Lanie, ropes her into being a bridesmaid for her upcoming wedding to Black Falcon front man, Noel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sparks fly instantly between Aubrey and Riff when they’re forced to reunite, and suddenly she finds herself caught between the man that’s good for her and the one who completely rocks her in every way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;**New Adult Romance--Book 2 in the Black Falcon series. This book can be read without reading book one.**</description>

  <description>I had the perfect life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautiful and loving husband.Three gorgeous little girls.  &lt;br&gt;Successful career.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing missing was the white picket fence.  I really wanted that fence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years ago, I lost that life.  I lost my husband.  And I lost myself.  But, eventually, I found my way through the darkness.  I’ve made peace with my new life. I have my girls, and that’s all that matters. They are my world.  I have no illusions of ever falling in love again or getting whisked away on a white horse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; came back into my life. On a freakin’ motorcycle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no way I’ll let him turn my life completely upside down.  &lt;em&gt;Absolutely&lt;/em&gt; no way.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question is…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How long can I keep pretending that I’m happy with my life being right-side up?</description>

  <description>She knew she was heading towards disaster. Every instinct told her to run, but Jesse Ward was a hard man to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been five days’ since Ava O’Shea left Jesse drunk and raging at Lusso – left behind a man who drowned her in his intensity and blindsided her with his touch. Getting over this man was never going to be easy. And now he’s back in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has questions she needs answering, but her determination to get these answers will give the pleasure-seeking playboy the power to destroy her again. She needs to keep her eyes wide open and caution at the forefront of her mind, an ambitious intention when Jesse Ward is within touching distance. And he plans to be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s dark, he’s broken – Ava knows this, but the only way to find out how dark and how broken is to get beneath the steely exterior of this man.</description>

  <description>Young interior designer Ava O’Shea has an appointment for a first consultation at The Manor with the owner, Mr Jesse Ward. She is expecting nothing more than an overweight, cravat wearing, well-to-do countryman, and on arrival, nothing would suggest otherwise. How wrong could she be? This Man is devastatingly handsome, charming and confident. He is also a conceited, hedonistic playboy, who knows no boundaries. Ava desperately does not want to be attracted to him, but she can’t control the overwhelming affect he has on her. Every instinct is telling her to run, so she does, but Jesse Ward is not so willing to let her go. He wants her and is determined to have her. She knows she is heading for heartbreak, but how can she run when he won’t let her?</description>

  <description>He saw her first, but his friend made the move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She settled for the safer choice, but her heart knew the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They love, they crave, they lie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garrett McCarthy, Annabelle Parker, and Milo Roberts were as close as friends could get.  They shared in each other's joy during graduations, promotions, and engagements.  They consoled one another through heartache and loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one of the friend's life is tragically cut short, it's up to the two left behind to pick up the pieces and find out the truth - no matter the cost.  As they slowly start to uncover the nature of his deception, and the very powerful people behind it, they begin to question everyone and everything, even themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone has secrets - some do it for love while others do it for power.  Those secrets can change perceptions, alter reality and sometimes destroy lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you do when you find out your whole life has been a lie?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; You must stick to your CONVICTION, but be ready to abandon your assumptions - &lt;/em&gt; Denis Waitley&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book #3 of the Consequences Series—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were still lessons to learn and consequences for the truth!&lt;br&gt;When Claire Nichols met Anthony Rawlings, she didn’t know they had a past, or that he had plans for her future. Over time, the role of teacher changed—games became reality—and domination turned to desire. Despite an insurmountable history, Claire and Tony found their way back to one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when they seemed to have it all—love, respect, and the promise of a family—the game master exposed the truth. Claire’s world once again spun out of control. Unwilling to allow her child to suffer the consequences of an old vendetta, Claire fled...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At one time, Claire was held captive in an opulent mansion—then her incarceration was a cell inside a state penitentiary. Was her new prison—a tropical island—truly less lonely? Perhaps that was the game master’s plan, all along? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who will save Claire from her oldest nightmare and her newest reality? Will it be Tony? Can he forgive her for leaving him—again? Harry? Will he utilize previously unknown connections to save the woman who infiltrates his thoughts? Maybe Phil? Will his devotion in keeping Claire and her child safe be rewarded? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the cards are played—sins of the past, innocent victims, and truths are revealed. With compartmentalization no longer an option, is the reality too much? Could there be an even worse isolation? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the game master dealing from a stacked deck, can this new high-stakes game possibly be won?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it’s all over and their cards are on the table—SOME will discover their bets were too high—they have nothing left to lose—ALL will learn the crucial lesson—the most important rule—there are CONSEQUENCES for the TRUTH! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aleatha Romig’s CONVICTED!&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Too hot to handle...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabitha Allen grew up in the thick of Chaos--the Chaos Motorcycle Club, that is. Her father is Chaos' leader, and the club has always had her back. But one rider was different from the start. When Tabby was running wild, Shy Cage was there. When tragedy tore her life apart, he helped her piece it back together. And now, Tabby's thinking about much more than friendship...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabby is everything Shy's ever wanted, but everything he thinks he can't have. She's beautiful, smart, and as his friend's daughter, untouchable. Shy never expected more than friendship, so when Tabby indicates she wants more--&lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;more&lt;em&gt;--&lt;/em&gt;he feels like the luckiest man alive. But even lucky men can crash and burn...</description>

  <description>Miss Me Not is a beautiful story of self-discovery, forgiveness, caring, and love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madison Hanson's past demons have given her a shadow of an existence with little hope. With the sudden tragic death of a fellow student, Madison questions her own life choices, and is now forced to evaluate everything she thought she believed in. When fate intervenes and partners her with Dean Jackson, a popular "all around good guy" from school, Madison gets a glimpse of a life that is filled with sunshine that has the power to break through the darkness she has cloaked herself in. &lt;br&gt;With Dean's help, Madison discovers a desire to finally step out of the shadows, and embrace life and all its gifts.</description>

  <description>It’s the eve before Christmas Eve, and all that twenty-three-year-old Landry has on the agenda for the holiday is moping in the bar that he left everything behind to open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he’s got plenty to mope about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He found his girlfriend treating herself to a little holiday delight with his best friend;&lt;br&gt;He hasn’t seen his family in over a year- since he alienated them all and ended up spending a night in jail;&lt;br&gt;And he may have just ruined the perfect, uncomplicated thing he had going with his platonically hot roommate, Mila.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drinks all around!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when he gets a call from his sister, Paisley, begging him to make it home for a huge announcement, he tosses aside his better judgment, (or, what’s left of it after that last round of drinks) and hops on the first train back home to Jersey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But home for the holidays isn’t all mugs of cocoa and fireside chats with his family.&lt;br&gt;Landry left the people he loves the most high and dry when he fled to Boston and spent all of his inheritance…the inheritance money that he was supposed to use to help save his family’s floundering bar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His dad will hardly look at him, his ex is maybe stalking him, his sister has dropped a bombshell on the family, and a flame from the past catches his eye. When Landry’s present and near past collide, it only further complicates things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Landry thought he was leaving all of his problems behind when he left his family in New Jersey. But he comes home to find out that problems, like family, never go away. And sometimes facing the past with the help of someone who’s fearless about the future is the only way to move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers?</description>

  <description>Dylan doesn’t do relationships. He and his older brother watched their dad go through hell and back, so they made a pact years ago—no girl would come between the Gibson boys. But his brother sells out. He's getting married anyway. To the sister of a chick Dylan met at a party, who's probably the angriest girl he's ever met. Unfortunately, she happens to be hot, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ziah’s life is upside down—her safe boyfriend turns out to be not-so-safe, and now her sister is &lt;em&gt;getting married before college is over&lt;/em&gt; to the older brother of a spoiled, party boy who drives her crazy. And also makes her heart beat too fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s no denying the attraction, but there's also no denying how much they irritate each other. When they’re thrown together as forced wedding planners, they find an ally in each other--neither wants this wedding to happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But instead of putting a stop to the crazy nuptials they find themselves at fittings and cake testing. And maybe even…a few dates?&lt;br&gt;Dizzy is a novel about what happens when two people who are determined not to fall in love, maybe do anyway. Maybe.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Book #1 of the Bestselling Consequences Series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony Rawlings had a plan—to teach Claire Nichols to behave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Claire Nichols had a plan—to survive!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an unfamiliar bedroom within a luxurious mansion, Claire Nichols wakes to memories of a brutal abduction. All of her recollections have one common denominator, the man she just met—Anthony Rawlings. Unbeknownst to Claire, Anthony has had her in his sights for a long time. Every action has consequences—and his actions resulted in their chance meeting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facing incomprehensible circumstances, Claire must learn to survive as she comes to terms with her new reality—every aspect of her livelihood is now dependent upon the tall, dark-haired, dark-eyed tycoon. Anthony may appear to the world as a prosperous, benevolent, kind businessman, but in reality Claire learns he is also a menacing, controlling captor with very strict rules: do as your told, public failure is not an option, and don’t divulge private information. Failure to follow these rules and more, are met with serious consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an effort to earn her freedom, Claire learns her lessons well and before long, she unknowingly captivates her captor. Anthony/ Tony reluctantly becomes enthralled with Claire’s beauty, resilience and determination. Their interaction instigates strong emotions, including—fear, anger, love, and lust—as their journey flows into uncharted waters of intrigue and passion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the opening criminal abduction, through the twists and turns, to the unlikely romantic thrills, the suspense climaxes as Aleatha Romig utilizes vivid detail, allowing this novel to unfold like a movie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can you put the pieces of the puzzle together? Claire Nichols abduction wasn’t a random act—did she learn her lessons well enough? Will these unlikely lovers remain true--or will she learn the truth before it’s too late?</description>

  <description>Heavyweight MMA fighter, Romeo Wellings comes from the hard streets of New York where his family ties to the mafia cause him nothing but pain. His life takes a surprising detour when he crosses paths with the twin sister of his long time enemy. After a steamy one-night stand, he faces the fight of his life, but it’s not in the cage. The secret relationship that blooms between Romeo and his real life Juliet has him battling his family and a dark past rather than let her go.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only lawyer in her hometown of Garnet, Jules Conner is also a volunteer Sheriff’s deputy and co-owner of a successful MMA training center. Strong and dependable, Jules is always there for those who need her. Until one forbidden night in Las Vegas with Romeo leaves her feeling so alive she can’t stop reaching out to the sexy, bad boy of MMA, even knowing the forbidden love affair could jeopardize everything.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the tide rises against them and the people they love work at keeping them apart, Romeo and Jules hold onto a dream for a better life together and vow to go down fighting rather than accept a tragic ending.</description>

  <description>With her thirtieth birthday looming, Emma Harrison finds her biological clock clanging and the elusive knight in shining armor yet to appear. She’s running out of options, especially after her gay best friend backs out from being her sperm donor. Of course, there’s always a sperm bank, but Emma fears a donor mix-up might impregnate her with the spawn of Satan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resident company womanizer, Aidan Fitzgerald, is used to always getting what he wants, especially in the bedroom. When Emma spurns his advances at the company Christmas party, he's determined to have her no matter what it takes. After Aidan learns of Emma's predicament, he is quick to offer a proposition that will benefit them both. He will father Emma's child, but she must conceive it with him naturally. Not one for hook-ups or casual sex, Emma is reluctant to take him up on his offer, but his charm, coupled with her intense desire for motherhood, wins out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon their baby-making sessions become more than just physical. Aidan can't seem to walk away from her while Emma begins to wonder if Aidan could be the one. But can Aidan leave his past behind to become the man Emma needs him to be?</description>

  <description>It’s the summer of 1974 and 21-year old Dawn Emerson has only three things she wants to do: compete one last time in the Ellensburg Rodeo, win back her ex-boyfriend Ryan, and become the best damn music journalist at Central Washington University. But all her plans are left in the dust when she’s contacted by Creem magazine to go on the road with one of her favorite groups, the up-and-coming metal band, Hybrid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first the assignment reads like a dream come true. Not only will Dawn land some much-needed credibility as a female music journalist, but she’ll finally get to experience life from the other side of the stage, and maybe crack the drunken, enigmatic code that is guitarist Sage Knightly. Instead, Dawn finds herself on an aging tour bus filled with ego-maniacs, band politics and a whole lot of sex, drugs and rock n’ roll. When monsters start showing up in dressing rooms and some of Sage’s groupies become increasingly strange and dangerous, Dawn discovers the band is not only going places – they’re going straight to Hell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Dawn has a backstage pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Devil's Metal is the first book in a two-part New Adult Horror/Paranormal Romance and very (very!) loosely based on the author's exploits as a music journalist. Hell comes in different forms.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Summer scatters three friends, ties them back together, and makes them question who they have been and who they want to be in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna expected to soak up the knowledge of great Irish writers at her summer workshop in Dublin. But there are some things even the best books can't teach you, and a passionate new friend and an old familiar full of surprises challenge Brenna to follow her heart. By the time she's back in the States, she can't wait to throw herself back into Jake's arms and tell him exactly what he means to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She puts the brakes on that plan when it becomes clear that Jake may not be ready to shoulder any more. He visits his family's palatial home in the mountains of New York, and is exposed to all the possibilities a life surrounded by his pampered relatives and washed in money would hold for him. But is it possible to accept so much and not change who you are? Jake has to face the reality that changing sometimes means losing things...but how much is he willing to put on the line?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saxon has been thrust into a life of drudgery and indentured service he never dreamed of after a brush with the law puts him on family-enforced probation. Who would have thought Sussex County's resident bad-ass layabout would fall head-over-heels in love with a girl, an elderly aunt, and a shot at a whole new life. The problem is, he's a Maclean to his marrow, and it's in his blood to be a selfish screw-up. Isn't it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna, Jake, and Saxon spend one summer growing up, working things out, and doing their best to weather the changes that get thrown their way. But can the love and friendships of one amazing summer last through the ups and downs of the coming years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slow Twitch is book number three in the Brenna Blixen series. Book one is Double Clutch, and book two is Junk Miles. All books in this series are YA Mature. Slow Twitch contains sex, drug references, alcohol consumption, and swearing. It is intended for mature or older readers.</description>

  <description>Kissing someone other than your boyfriend is cheating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what about thinking about kissing someone other than your boyfriend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What about thinking about it a lot?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna Blixen has the perfect boyfriend. He's sweet, sexy, loyal, and sure that Brenna is the best thing that's ever happened to him. But being the perfect girlfriend isn't as easy as Brenna thought it would be, and the pressure that comes with trying to be Jake's everything is beginning to weigh on her. When her mother surprises her with a trip to Paris over winter break, she's torn. She anticipated spending her vacation snuggling with Jake Kelly, ice-skating, drinking cocoa, and relaxing...but what girl in her right mind would turn down a trip to Paris?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things only get more confusing when she winds up unexpectedly and unavoidably thrown into Saxon Maclean's arms in the City of Lights. Far away from the comfort and stability she finds at Jake's side, Brenna faces down the feelings that have been swirling through her since the day she laid eyes on Saxon. Is it fair for her to call herself Jake's girlfriend when she has so many unresolved feelings about someone else?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna is determined to figure it all out, even if it means making some of the hardest decisions of her entire life. She also learns that every single thing she does has rippling repercussions, some that fill her with total regret. By the time she figures out what her heart truly wants, she realizes that she may not be able to have it after all.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;He went there looking for a sure bet…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sole Regret’s bassist, Owen Mitchell, is convinced that romance is for chumps. He’s only looking for a good time, and when he spots an attractive, older woman emitting men-suck vibes at a brand new sex club, he’s sure he’s found it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She went there hoping to get over her ex-husband…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Successful business woman, Caitlyn Hanson, is still infuriated and hurt over her ex-husband’s affair with a much younger woman. She’s only looking to scrub his claim from her body by offering it to the first attractive man who shows her interest, and the young, hot stud, who just sat down at her table, will do quite nicely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;They never meant to get personal…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caitlyn knows she’s not supposed to get attached to Owen just because he gives her body pleasure unlike any she’s ever known, but it’s her first one-night-stand and she can’t seem to keep her heart out of the equation. For once, Owen finds himself in the same conundrum. He likes Caitlyn too much to keep his heart at a safe distance, but will a mistake from Owen’s past drive her away forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owen and Caitlyn's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Book 9: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490398.Thrill_Me" title="Thrill Me"&gt;Thrill Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released) and Book 14: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490409.Thank_Me" title="Thank Me"&gt;Thank Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released)</description>

  <description>What happens when you fall in love with the perfect guy... twice... in one day?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brenna Blixen spent her freshman year homeschooling in Denmark; now that she’s back in the States, she’s determined to make her sophomore year unforgettable. And by unforgettable, she imagined awesome classes, fun friendships, and maybe a little romance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What she got was a whole lot of romance, and all at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same day that dark, brooding Saxon Maclean charmed her with his killer good looks and whip-smart wit, Jake Kelly stole her breath away with his heart-wrenching smile and intelligent, thoughtful focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Saxon is a proud player who makes it clear that he doesn’t know why he can’t get Brenna off of his mind and out of his system, and Jake’s sweet and humble attitude hides a secret past life that might be more darker and more complex than Brenna’s willing to handle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicating the matter is the fact that Saxon and Jake were once best friends and are now arch-enemies... and the more Brenna finds out about their connection to each other, the more intrigued and worried she becomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between keeping the peace with her lovingly over-protective parents, designing t-shirts for her high school’s rising punk band, keeping up her grades in both academic and technical high school, and running the track like a maniac, Brenna has enough to worry about with out juggling two guys who make her heart thud and drive her crazy all at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has to make a choice. But how can she when giving her heart to one of them might mean breaking the other’s?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Cover Design: Steven Peterson)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recommended Age: Older YA</description>

  <description>The last thing Dawson Black expected was Bethany Williams. As a Luxen, an alien life form on Earth, human girls are…well, fun. But since the Luxen have to keep their true identities a secret, falling for one would be insane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dangerous. Tempting. Undeniable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bethany can’t deny the immediate connection between her and Dawson. And even though boys aren’t a complication she wants, she can’t stay away from him. Still, whenever they lock eyes, she’s drawn in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captivated. Lured. Loved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dawson is keeping a secret that will change her existence...and put her life in jeopardy. But even he can’t stop risking everything for one human girl. Or from a fate that is as unavoidable as love itself.</description>

  <description>Leather and lace don't strike sparks. Or do they?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's Valentine's Day, but Macy Rodgers isn't feeling the love. Aside from a torrid, one-night fling in a backseat a few months back, her love life has been sorely lacking, but fortunately she has devious friends who feel like playing Cupid. Wouldn't they be shocked to learn that the match they've made for her is the same one that steamed up the back of that '69 GTO...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seth "Ghost" Warren has just returned to town after an extended absence. Between his grandmother's failing health, his job as a tattoo artist, his band's gigs, and a crazy ex that won't leave him alone, he's stretched thin. Cautious cowgirl Macy is the last thing he needs thrown into the mix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's all country, he's all heavy metal—and Macy knows that if anyone can propel her out of her rut, it's Seth. But when their worlds collide, it's anyone guess if they'll survive with their hearts intact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Contains explicit sex, graphic language, road trips, troublemaking exes, emotional baggage, and an unconventional but exceptionally hot hero tatted and pierced for your pleasure...</description>

  <description>For the last four years, good girl Lane has regretted breaking up with Noel Falcon. She thought she was sensible when she told him his dreams of being a rock star would get him nowhere, but now that he's a rock god and her career is stagnant, she realizes just how wrong she was. When Noel hires the marketing company where Lane is an intern, she’s forced to see him again. If she wants to land her dream job as executive within the company, she has to win him over and secure his account. Too bad Noel is still pissed at her for breaking his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Lane’s company flies her to a Black Falcon concert to gain Noel’s attention, emotions run high the moment she sees him and realizes she’s far from over him. But Noel’s countless trysts with groupies and his cocky attitude make Lane believe he isn’t the same guy she once loved—now he seems to only want her body. Then after Lane discloses she needs him to procure a job, Noel proves he’s a changed man by forcing her to go on the road with him in order to get it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Lane reluctantly takes Noel up on his offer, she becomes willing to do whatever it takes to keep him satisfied, even if it means succumbing to his seductive ways. Lane soon finds deception is a dangerous game and she’s not the only one playing.</description>

  <description>After spending over 2,000 years being a lost soul looking for the angel I was forbidden to fall in love with, I finally found him. Lucky for me he has taken up residence inside the hot body of NYC’s local bad boy, tattooed rock star, Shane Maxton. Turns out, not only is he absolutely perfect, so is the whole Grace Taylor life that I’m stuck in. The only problem is Gabriel. An archangel who wants me all to himself so he kind of kidnaps me. Now I have to find my way back and hope everything works out…</description>

  <description>Book two in the Mitchell Series starts where Letting Go left off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ty and Miranda have always considered themselves cousins, due to the fact that they both share a common relative - Colt - even though they aren't really related at all. After helping Miranda deliver her baby in the backseat of a car, Ty becomes closer to both she and her baby. Their long distance friendship keeps them plutonic, even though in the past they both have wondered if there was something more happening between them. When something happens and Miranda is forced to leave Kentucky and stay at Ty's parents farm, sparks start to fly. Can bad boy Ty change his ways in order to be with the one person that knows him better than anyone? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*This book contains explicit language and sexual situations. Not intended for readers under 18.*&lt;/strong&gt;

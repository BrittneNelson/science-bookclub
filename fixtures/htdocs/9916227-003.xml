  <description>Savanna Tate has loved the same guy since she was 14yrs old. Now she and Tyler are in their second year of college. While Savanna is concentrating on maintaining her high grade point average and academic scholarship, Tyler is busy partying with his frat brothers and screwing around on his girlfriend behind her back. Savanna decides they need a break, just so she can focus and maybe change his mind about his priorities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; One night at a party Savanna catches Ty in the act and after a heated argument, she leaves. In fear of losing her forever, Tyler steals a car and proceeds to follow her even after he had too much to drink. He loses control of the vehicle and from the injuries of the accident he goes into a coma. Everyone blames Savanna for Ty's accident. She loses her friends. His family disowns her. She stops being around people and spends most of her time at the hospital waiting for Ty to wake up so that they can start over and have the future she always wanted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Then his cousin Colt comes back to town to help with the Mitchell family's farm. The chemistry between them is electric, but is Savanna willing to let go of Ty to explore her feelings for Colt? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*Contains sexual situations*&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>Evan Lennox is going nowhere fast. She's living with her grandparents after her parents bailed on her, she got kicked out of her posh private school, her ex-boyfriend proved to be the biggest sleaze imaginable, her former best friend is a back-stabber, and her current best friend is stuck in backwoods NJ. To top it all off, one teeny, tiny fire she lit to burn some memories of her ex goes a little out of control and winds up igniting a good piece of a very powerful family's pecan orchard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evan lands her pampered behind in court and gets sentenced to community service. Which she knows she deserves. But the hard labor and humiliation may be her undoing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she meets Winchester Youngblood on the site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything about him is tricky, confusing, not at all what it seems, and so sexy, Evan can't resist pulling closer. But every step she takes to get to know him gives her more of a reason to back up and put him as far out of life as she possibly can. Because Winch is one hundred percent complicated, and Evan isn't looking for that. At all. She needs to meet a nice, responsible guy, not share searing kisses with the charming hustler she met after they both got sentenced in court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Winch is so much more than what he seems, and Evan finds out that she's falling hard for the guy everyone underestimates and writes off. And Winch realizes that Evan is the one person who's ever challenged him to ask for more out of his life, and her courage inspires him to try to be the person she sees when she looks at him. With every single odd stacked against them, Evan and Winch need to find out whether they have what it takes to fall for each other.</description>

  <description>Psychology student Ashlyn Drake’s neat, orderly life takes a turn for the crazy when she finds the perfect subject for her amnesia thesis – a young man without any memory of his previous life, including the murder he’s accused of committing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Against all common sense, Ashlyn’s drawn to him like a moth to a flame. Perhaps it’s that he’s so incredibly male, and even handcuffed to his hospital bed he could pass for a cologne ad – Scent de Insanity. Or perhaps it’s because she’s spent too many lonely nights studying. Either way, she’s determined to help him solve the mystery of his past. She begins to unravel who he was before, using his cryptic tattoos, and his paintings that scream of a dark past as her only clues. When she finally learns his secret there’s no telling which one is the real him, the gentle lover she’s fallen for or the troubled man with a dark past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNRAVEL ME is a contemporary erotic romance.</description>

They make a deal to work together to expose the dirty cop but they have no idea the strength of their enduring attraction or the sheer evil at work in The ‘Burg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Tanner Layne and Raquel Merrick play their game and dance around the pull that draws them together, Layne has to discover the dark secrets buried so deep in Rocky’s heart she doesn’t even know they’re there at the same time untangle a sinister web of crime so abhorrent it has to be stopped... at all costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to do it, Layne has to enlist everyone, including his ex-CIA mentor, Rocky’s detective brother, the town’s unpredictable informant and Layne’s two teenage sons all the while stopping Rocky from doing something crazy and keeping their game secret so Layne won't get himself dead.</description>

  <description>When Ash loses her boyfriend, she is consumed by grief, loneliness and an overwhelming sense of guilt for her role in not only his death, but the deaths of everyone she has ever loved. Refusing to let anyone in for fear of losing them too, she becomes withdrawn, spending her days reliving the nightmares from her past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until she meets Luke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initially scared by his intensity and interest in her, Ash tries to push him away. But as Luke slowly starts to chip away at the walls she’s built, Ash finds herself doing the one thing she swore she’d never do again — falling in love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the familiar feelings Ash had hoped were long buried with her past begin to resurface, she is forced to ask herself if falling in love again is really worth the risk.</description>

  <description>For the five sexy rock gods of Sole Regret, finding love is easy, keeping it is hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;One more night…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For almost a year, Madison has been Adam’s hook-up every time his band, Sole Regret, tours through Dallas. But in spite of the way he sets her body ablaze with passion, the occasional night of rock-her-world sex isn’t enough anymore. She needs a commitment and knows that won’t fit into Adam’s rock-star lifestyle. Madison will take one more hot-and-heavy night with the sexy musician before she cuts all ties with him for good. Even if she must break her own heart to do it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To tempt him…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life isn’t all bright lights and fan adulation for the lead guitarist for Sole Regret. Madison has seen Adam at his worst and still managed to bring out the best in him. Her cleverly concealed naughty side also brings out the beast in him. He’s never met a more tempting woman in his life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madison has no problem tempting Adam into her bed, but can she tempt his heart into taking a chance on love?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This 32,500 word erotic romance novella contains explicit sexual situations, including some rough backdoor lovin’, hair-pulling, spanking, and whole lotta dirty talk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam and Madison's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Book 7:&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17899077.Tease_Me" title="Tease Me"&gt;Tease Me&lt;/a&gt; (coming soon) and Book 12: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490404.Tame_Me" title="Tame Me"&gt;Tame Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released)</description>

  <description>Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s what seventeen-year-old Sky realizes after she meets Dean Holder. A guy with a reputation that rivals her own and an uncanny ability to invoke feelings in her she’s never had before. He terrifies her and captivates her all in the span of just one encounter, and something about the way he makes her feel sparks buried memories from a past that she wishes could just stay buried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sky struggles to keep him at a distance knowing he’s nothing but trouble, but Holder insists on learning everything about her. After finally caving to his unwavering pursuit, Sky soon finds that Holder isn’t at all who he’s been claiming to be. When the secrets he’s been keeping are finally revealed, every single facet of Sky’s life will change forever.</description>

  <description>The first night after Caroline moves into her fantastic new San Francisco apartment, she realizes she's gaining an intimate knowledge of her new neighbor's nocturnal adventures. Thanks to paper-thin walls and the guy's athletic prowess, she can hear not just his bed banging against the wall but the ecstatic response of what seems (as loud night after loud night goes by) like an endless parade of women. And since Caroline is currently on a self-imposed dating hiatus, and her neighbor is clearly lethally attractive to women, she finds her fantasies keep her awake even longer than the noise. So when the wallbanging threatens to literally bounce her out of bed, Caroline, clad in sexual frustration and a pink baby-doll nightie, confronts Simon Parker, her heard-but-never-seen neighbor. The tension between them is as thick as the walls are thin, and the results just as mixed. Suddenly, Caroline is finding she may have discovered a whole new definition of neighborly...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a delicious mix of silly and steamy, Alice Clayton dishes out a hot and hilarious tale of exasperation at first sight...</description>

  <description>&lt;br&gt;Two worlds of wealth and passion call to Nora Sutherlin and, whichever one she chooses, it will be the hardest decision she will ever have to make. Unless someone makes it for her... &lt;br&gt;Wes Railey is the object of Nora's tamest yet most maddening fantasies, and the one man she can't forget. He's young. He's wonderful. He's also thoroughbred royalty and, reuniting with him in Kentucky, she's in his world now. But this infamous New York dominatrix is no simpering Southern belle, and Nora's dream of fitting into Wesley's world is perpetually at odds with the relentlessly seductive pull of Soren--her owner, her lover, the forever she cannot have. At least, not completely. &lt;br&gt;Meanwhile Nora's associate Kingsley Edge is only too happy to take her place at Soren's feet during her hiatus. Soren is the only man Kingsley has ever loved, and their dark, shared history has forged a bond that neither the years--nor Soren's love for Nora--can break. But a new threat from an old adversary is forcing Kingsley to confront the past, reminding him that he must keep his friends close, and his enemies closer. &lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Gossip Girl meets Hollywood in this steamy new series by That Boy author, Jillian Dodd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keatyn has everything she ever dreamed. Her life is following the script she wrote for the perfect high school experience. She's popular, goes to the best parties, dates the hottest guy, and sits at the most-coveted lunch table.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's just not sure she wants it anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because, really, things aren't all that perfect.&lt;br&gt;Her best friend is threatening to tell everyone her perfect relationship is a scam. &lt;br&gt;Her perfect boyfriend gets drunk at every party they go to. &lt;br&gt;It's exhausting always trying to look and act perfect.&lt;br&gt;And, deep down, she isn't sure if she has any true friends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To add to the drama, her movie star mom has a creepy stalker. &lt;br&gt;A hot, older man flirts with her and tells her they should make a movie together.&lt;br&gt;And she's crushing on an adorable surfer. Dating him would mean committing social suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So she writes a new script. One where all the pieces of her life will come together in perfect harmony. &lt;br&gt;But little does she know, there's someone who will do anything to make sure that doesn't happen.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Being connected to Daemon Black sucks…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to his alien mojo, Daemon’s determined to prove what he feels for me is more than a product of our bizarro connection. So I’ve sworn him off, even though he’s running more hot than cold these days. But we’ve got bigger problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something worse than the Arum has come to town…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Department of Defense are here. If they ever find out what Daemon can do and that we're linked, I’m a goner. So is he. And there's this new boy in school who’s got a secret of his own. He knows what’s happened to me and he can help, but to do so, I have to lie to Daemon and stay away from him. Like that's possible. Against all common sense, I'm falling for Daemon. Hard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;But then everything changes…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’ve seen someone who shouldn’t be alive. And I have to tell Daemon, even though I know he’s never going to stop searching until he gets the truth. What happened to his brother? Who betrayed him? And what does the DOD want from them—from me?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one is who they seem. And not everyone will survive the lies…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>It's been twelve years since Tru Bennett last saw Jake Wethers, her former best friend and boy she once loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake Wethers, sexy, tattooed and deliciously bad lead singer, and brains behind The Mighty Storm, one of the biggest bands in the world, left Tru with a broken heart when he moved from England to America with his family when they were both fourteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sent to interview Jake for her music column by the magazine she works for, they are both unprepared for the sparks that fly the instant they reconnect. Only, there’s a complication to their instant feelings for one another—Will, Tru’s boyfriend of two years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Jake makes Tru a job offer she can't refuse—travelling the world with him and his band. But taking the job means leaving Will behind, and being on the road with the band means spending an inordinate amount of time with Jake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Tru strong enough to resist the delectable bad boy who once held her heart so completely, or will she willingly risk it all for one night with the world's most notorious womanizer?</description>

  <description>Steering clear of relationships has never been difficult for demolitions expert Cole Bowen, but now, with his brother's engagement sending the female population into full-blown hysterics and the town of Alden's month-long festivities helping along, he finds himself in hell. When he discovers Alden's new resident and the object of all his wet dreams, Christine Sheridan, has sworn off relationships and is going to hire a gigolo to get professionally laid, he decides to kill two birds with one stone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Christy is so not drinking again. Thanks to José Cuervo she has her friends signing her up for stud conventions and Cole frigging Bowen offering sex in exchange of fake dates, which is so out of the question it isn't even funny. She knows the domineering man will push her boundaries, and after battling all her life with self-esteem issues, she isn't ready for that. Too bad he won't take no for an answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole is determined to strip away all of her defenses but refuses to lower his ever-present walls, so when Christy realizes she wants more, she's left with only two options; walk away or crack his shield and risk her heart in the process.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;To find happiness, first you have to find yourself.&lt;/em&gt; Krissa has always been the responsible one. Driven to fulfill her mother’s abandoned dreams, to make her husband Derek happy. She’s brought that single-minded determination to the one dream she has for herself—a child. Except she and Derek can’t conceive, and Derek refuses to consider using a stranger’s sperm. The result? Guilt that her desperation is causing their marital rift. The last thing they need is a long-term houseguest, but Derek’s best friend Nate, a nomadic photographer recovering from a career-threatening eye disorder, has nowhere else to go. Nate thought his friends’ home would be a temporary haven from the grief that has dogged his heels since his wife died. Instead he’s in the middle of a marriage in meltdown. Soon their friendship develops an underlying hum of forbidden sexual tension. When Krissa proposes a wild idea—that Nate be their sperm donor—Derek has an even wilder proposal: bypass the fertility clinic and accept Nate’s donation straight from the source. At first, Krissa believes she’s on the fast track to having her dream. But it quickly becomes clear that when the heart gets involved—and secrets are revealed—the simplest of arrangements can become entangled beyond belief. Or repair… &lt;em&gt;Warning: This title contains a man who’s lost, the woman he finds, sizzling ménage sex, tender romantic sex, love lost and love found.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Sadie White's summer job isn't going to be on the beach life-guarding or working at rental booths like most kids her age. With her single mother's increasing pregnancy and refusal to work, Sadie has to take over her mother's job as a domestic servant for one of the wealthy summer families on a nearby island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the family arrives at their summer getaway, Sadie is surprised to learn that the owner of the house is Jax Stone, one of the hottest teen rockers in the world. If Sadie hadn't spent her life raising her mother and taking care of the house she might have been normal enough to be excited about working for a rock star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Sadie isn't impressed by Jax's fame, he is drawn to her. Everything about Sadie fascinates Jax but he fights his attraction. Relationships never work in his world and as badly as he wants Sadie, he believes she deserves more. By the end of the summer, Jax discovers he can't breathe without Sadie.</description>

  <description>Four years ago, Mitch Lawson moved across the breezeway from Mara Hanover and she fell in love with the tall, good-looking police detective who had an uncanny ability to dress well even though he’s single. It was not a stalker kind of love; she knows she has no hope since Mitch is way out of her league. That doesn’t change the fact that he’s her dream man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day Mara’s faucet won’t turn off and she knows nothing about plumbing. Being a good guy, Mitch offers to help then he invites himself over for pizza. Mara gives it a go but finds herself running away from him (literally) on their first date, standing him up their second and then she runs into him (again literally) on her way to save her ne’er do well, criminal cousin’s kids who’d just run away from their ne’er do well, criminal Dad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Mara finds she has on her hands the guardianship of two kids and a gorgeous police detective who’s willing to do anything to help out… including giving fabulous foot rubs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Mara knows who she is and where she came from and she knows Detective Mitch Lawson is better than her. Hot law man Mitch disagrees and his challenge is to convince Mara to let go of her past and he sets about building a family at the same time he finds he also needs to protect them all against known and unknown adversaries that would tear them apart.</description>

  <description>Mixed martial arts fighter Reid Andrews’s chance to reclaim his title as light heavyweight champ is shattered when he’s injured only months before the rematch. To make sure he’s healed in time, his trainer sends him to recuperate under a professional’s care—Reid’s best friend’s little sister, all grown up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disorganized and bookish Lucie Miller needs some professional help of her own. She’d do anything to catch the eye of a doctor she’s crushed on for years, so when Reid offers seduction lessons in exchange for 24/7 conditioning for the biggest fight of his career, Lucie jumps at the chance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon Reid finds himself in the fight of his life...winning Lucie's heart before she gives it to someone else.</description>

  <description>Best friends since childhood, the sexual tension between April and Oliver has always been palpable. Years after being completely inseparable, they become strangers, but the wildly different paths of their lives cross once again with the sudden death of April's brother. Oliver, the responsible, newly engaged law student finds himself drawn more than ever to the reckless, mystifying April - and cracks begin to appear in his carefully constructed life. Even as Oliver attempts to "save" his childhood friend from her grief, her menacing boyfriend and herself, it soon becomes apparent that Oliver has some secrets of his own--secrets he hasn't shared with anyone, even his fiancee. But April knows, and her reappearance in his life derails him. Is it really April's life that is unraveling, or is it his own? The answer awaits at the end of a downward spiral...towards salvation.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;This whole grim reaper thing should have come with a manual.&lt;br&gt;Or a diagram of some kind.&lt;br&gt;A flow chart would have been nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charley Davidson is a part-time private investigator and full-time grim reaper. Meaning, she sees dead people. Really. And it's her job to convince them to "go into the light." But when these very dead people have died under less than ideal circumstances (like murder), sometimes they want Charley to bring the bad guys to justice. Complicating matters are the intensely hot dreams she's been having about an entity who has been following her all her life...and it turns out he might not be dead after all. In fact, he might be something else entirely. But what does he want with Charley? And why can't she seem to resist him? And what does she have to lose by giving in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With scorching-hot tension and high-octane humor, &lt;em&gt;First Grave on the Right&lt;/em&gt; is your signpost to paranormal suspense of the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Notorious Nora Sutherlin is famous for her delicious works of erotica, each one more popular with readers than the last. But her latest manuscript is different—more serious, more personal—and she's sure it'll be her breakout book...if it ever sees the light of day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zachary Easton holds Nora's fate in his well-manicured hands. The demanding British editor agrees to handle the book on one condition: he wants complete control. Nora must rewrite the entire novel to his exacting standards—in six weeks—or it's no deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nora's grueling writing sessions with Zach are draining…and shockingly arousing. And a dangerous former lover has her wondering which is more torturous—staying away from him...or returning to his bed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nora thought she knew everything about being pushed to your limits. But in a world where passion is pain, nothing is ever that simple.</description>

Haven, a second-generation slave, grew up isolated in the middle of the desert, her days full of hard work and terrifying abuse. Carmine, born into a wealthy Mafia family, lived a life of privilege, never having to answer for anything he did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both now seventeen, a twist of fate causes their worlds to collide, making them question everything they ever believed. Entangled in a web of secrets and lies, they learn that while different on the surface, they have more in common than anyone would think.</description>

  <description>As their careers catch fire, Grace and Jack -- everyone’s favorite foul-mouthed, funny, and feisty couple -- find themselves on opposite coasts. Grace has landed in New York City, where she loves being onstage again, particularly because she’s playing a fabulous character in a musical written by her old college flame, Michael. Their rekindled friendship makes exploring the city that much more fun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait, it’s just friendship, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, in L.A., Jack can scarcely keep up with the swirling throngs of women who track him everywhere he goes, the endless press appearances, and the ridiculous rules his manager, Holly, keeps concocting for him -- all part of the buildup to the release of Time, his steamy new film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank goodness for phone sex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even when their schedules allow them to connect, Grace and Jack must keep their relationship off the radar and away from paparazzi cameras. Sure, the sex is sensational, but can this duo survive swirling rumors, the demands of their chosen professions, Grace’s raging internal battles, and a whopping nine-year age difference? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tick-tock, the clock is ticking. Isn’t it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alice Clayton brings the second installment of a tale told with her magical mix of humor and heat, so cuddle up under the sheets and flip on the Golden Girls. Grace and Jack are at it again.</description>

  <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One week in paradise will make or break them…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not enough that Kelsey’s husband left her for another woman. Oh, no. The “other woman” had to be her best friend Evan’s fiancée. Not only has she lost her marriage, she fears losing Evan to the lingering awkwardness and humiliation that hangs between them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan has no intention of letting that happen. He’s got plans…namely, an extra plane ticket to Hawaii now his future wife is out of the picture. There’s only one person he wants on the trip with him, the one who’s always been there for him. The one he should never have let slip away into the arms of a traitorous friend who shattered her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelsey is anticipating a week of fun in the sun with the man who’s always treated her like a little sister. No one’s more surprised when she discovers that Evan has seduction on his mind—and that she’s more than ready for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is the most powerful healing force of all. But past demons have a way of ripping open old wounds, and threatening the survival of even the strongest friendship… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: This title contains explicit sex between best friends, graphic language…and a hero who knows how to put the hot in “hot tub”.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Madison Daniels has worshipped her brother's best friend since they were kids. Everyone thinks she and Chase Gamble would make the perfect couple, but there are two major flaws in their logic. 1) Chase has sworn off relationships of any kind, and 2) after blurring the line between friends and lovers for one night four years ago, they can't stop bickering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forced together for her brother's wedding getaway, Chase and Madison decide to call a truce for the happy couple. Except all bets are off when they're forced to shack up in a tacky 70's honeymoon suite and survive a multitude of "accidents" as the family tries to prove their "spark" can be used than for more than fighting. That is, if they don't strangle each other first…&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>Seventeen year old Katelyn Richards is a stronger person than anyone will ever know, and that is just the way she wants it. Behind her normal facade lies the reality of a broken home life. Thanks to her abusive mother, a string of deadbeat stepfathers, and an unsympathetic system, Katelyn has learned that the only one she can count on is herself. Her life’s mission has become to shield her nine year old brother, Kevin, and to give him the future that they both wish for. A life with no more abuse, no worries about where their next meal will come from, and no more wondering if they will have a roof over their heads.&lt;br&gt;When her mother moves them again, this time to a small town in Montana, Katelyn’s resolve is shaken when she meets Max, a cute boy from her new school, who gets a glimpse into her real world. Max slowly manages to break through Katelyn’s wall of distrust, stirring up feelings she never saw coming. Now with her world more complicated than she ever intended, Katelyn struggles with the decision to follow her heart into the arms of the first boy she has ever loved. A decision that could risk the promise she made to protect Kevin, and to give them the ‘someday soon’ that is so close within their grasp.</description>

  <description>Chase Walker used to be a good kid-charming, athletic, and with a bright future ahead, but that was before travesty struck his life, sinking him into deep despair. Caught up in a world of drugs and alcohol, he doesn't notice time slipping away until he's arrested for underage drinking one night. Fed up with watching her son destroy his life, Chase's mom relocates him to live in a small ranching community with his ex-military grandfather. Chase is far from happy about the situation until he meets, Nikki, the cute cheerleader who won't give football players like him the time of day. Chase enjoys a good challenge though and sets out to claim Nikki for his own. He soon discovers she's more than a pretty face-she's a balm to his troubled spirit also. But when tragedy strikes Nikki's life too, suddenly Chase finds himself put to the ultimate test. Can he trust Nikki, and all that she's taught him? Will it be enough?</description>

  <description>When Jacqueline follows her longtime boyfriend to the college of his choice, the last thing she expects is a breakup two months into sophomore year. After two weeks in shock, she wakes up to her new reality: she's single, attending a state university instead of a music conservatory, ignored by her former circle of friends, and failing a class for the first time in her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving a party alone, Jacqueline is assaulted by her ex's frat brother. Rescued by a stranger who seems to be in the right place at the right time, she wants nothing more than to forget the attack and that night - but her savior, Lucas, sits on the back row of her econ class, sketching in a notebook and staring at her. Her friends nominate him to be the perfect rebound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own. Suddenly appearances are everything, and knowing who to trust is anything but easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mature Young Adult / New Adult</description>

  <description>A marriage in name only...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To save her family home, impulsive bookstore owner, Alexa Maria McKenzie, casts a love spell. But she never planned on conjuring up her best friend's older brother—the powerful man who once shattered her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billionaire Nicholas Ryan doesn’t believe in marriage, but in order to inherit his father’s corporation, he needs a wife and needs one fast. When he discovers his sister’s childhood friend is in dire financial straits, he offers Alexa a bold proposition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A marriage in name only with certain rules: avoid entanglement. Keep things all business. Do not fall in love. The arrangement is only for a year so the rules shouldn’t be that hard to follow, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Except fate has a way of upsetting the best-laid plans…</description>

  <description>INTENSE. DANGEROUS. ADDICTIVE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn’t drink or swear, and she has the appropriate number of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance from the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University’s Walking One-Night Stand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby wants—and needs—to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the ultimate college campus charmer. Intrigued by Abby’s resistance to his appeal, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis’s apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Our journey began in fire...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness—beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I'd never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt;. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other's most private wounds... and desires.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart...</description>

  <description>Enigmatic and sexy, Professor Gabriel Emerson is a well respected Dante specialist by day, but by night he devotes himself to an uninhibited life of pleasure. He uses his notorious good looks and sophisticated charm to gratify his every whim, but is secretly tortured by his dark past and consumed by the profound belief that he is beyond all hope of redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the sweet and innocent Julia Mitchell enrolls as his graduate student, his attraction and mysterious connection to her not only jeopardizes his career, but sends him on a journey in which his past and his present collide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An intriguing and sinful exploration of seduction, forbidden love and redemption, "Gabriel's Inferno" is a captivating and wildly passionate tale of one man's escape from his own personal hell as he tries to earn the impossible...forgiveness and love.</description>

  <description>My name is Willow Masters. I’m a senior in college, I’m smart and I keep to myself.  I haven’t had an “incident” in years.  What all of these facts have in common is that none of them made any difference when it came to Ebon Daniels.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He started out as my sister’s date.  I was instantly infatuated, but had no plans to do anything about it.  I even managed to keep my feelings hidden when he took over my Modernist Literature class for the semester. The problems didn’t start until my sister took pages from my book—literal pages from a book I was writing—and gave them to the one person never intended to see them.  That’s when the lies started.  That’s also when I saw an opportunity to make my only dream become a reality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I took it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And nothing will ever be the same again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How could one lie spark a wildfire that burned down everything in its path?  How could it get me all I ever wanted and then cost me everything that ever mattered?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t seem possible, but it is. It’s possible, it’s true and it’s tragic.  In my book, there is a happy ending, but I don’t know if my life will have the same outcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My name is Willow Masters and this is the story of how falling in love with my teacher nearly destroyed both of our lives.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And how it still might.</description>

  <description>When young, talented medical student Jazz decides to make a case study of Adam Attenborough for her school research project, she has no idea what she’s getting into. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam is handsome, mysterious, and utterly miserable, trapped in the labyrinth of his debilitating mental disorder. After a terrible accident leaving him crippled by short term memory loss, his life becomes a puzzle with pieces that don’t fit together. Fascinated by Adam’s story and his inventive coping strategy of taking photos and leaving himself notes to help remember faces - and discern friend from foe - Adam quickly becomes more than just a case study to Jazz. Turning the pages of his journal, she realizes that Adam’s old girlfriend is the magnificent and beautiful TV star Sophie Steele, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Engrossed in the love story that unfolds in the pages of Adam’s journal as well as newspaper clippings she uncovers at her local library, Jazz quickly becomes intrigued by the man himself, and is driven to discover the truth of what happened to Sophie Steele, once and for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt; Contains some strong language and violent scenes &lt;/em&gt;</description>

I won’t do it again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But there’s Jonathan. He owns the high-rise hotel where I work, and he is gorgeous and charming. I refuse to fall in love with him, even though when he asks me to submit to him, I want nothing more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;****GRAPHIC LANGUAGE, SEX, AND ADULT SITUATIONS****</description>

  <description>**AUTHOR NOTE - This is NOT a BDSM Romance**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're thirteen girls, captive, slave to our master. &lt;br&gt;A master we've never seen.&lt;br&gt;Obedience will become all we know in our shallow existence. It is the only emotion we're permitted to feel.&lt;br&gt;When we're bad, we're punished. When we're good, we're rewarded. &lt;br&gt;Our scars run deep. Yet we survive, because we have to... &lt;br&gt;because HE teaches us to.&lt;br&gt;All of us are special, we feel it with everything we are.&lt;br&gt;He has us for a reason, but it's a reason we don't know.&lt;br&gt;We've never seen his face, but we know that something deeply broken lies beneath the darkness. With every touch, with every punishment, we know it. &lt;br&gt;Then something changed. &lt;br&gt;He showed me who he truly is.&lt;br&gt;Now I want him.&lt;br&gt;I'll go against everything I know to be with him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A monster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My monster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loving him is a sin, but a sinner I am. I won't stop until I see every part of him. Even the parts he keeps locked deep down inside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am Number Thirteen, and this is my story.</description>

  <description>Walker Rhodes is a hot singing sensation who never settles down, spends too much money gambling and gets in trouble on the daily- at least if you believe all the tabloids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madison Myers is a hard working talent agent assistant thrust into the spotlight one day after Walker pulls her on stage during one of his concerts. She tries to stay away from him, but he keeps chasing her. She is strong in her resolve and he is relentless in his pursuit. The question is... WHY?!?!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tabloid Headline Reads:  Walker Rhodes pulls woman on stage during LA concert and serenades her with stars in his eyes and we watched as the sparks flew! But just who is this mystery woman who has stolen Walker's heart?  And will she be the one to finally tie down our favorite womanizing gambler?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our readers poll: &lt;br&gt;80% say no way! &lt;br&gt;The other 20% wish they were her!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read more inside...</description>

  <description>Eve isn’t used to failure. Especially when it comes to her Errands, but that’s exactly where she finds herself waking up in a hospital bed, bruised and bloodied. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only has the Tucker Errand been derailed, Henry Callahan’s is about to do the same. When G informs Eve that the competition is moving in on Henry, she orders her to drop the Tucker Client and get back to Henry, forcing Eve to decide what’s more important: winning the big-time Errands, or keeping her promises to her small-time Clients. Whatever her answer, she knows one thing—she can’t succeed at both without threatening to fail everyone.</description>

  <description>My name is Jade Lennon and I stand still for money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The night I saw Shane Arthur watching me everything changed. A man in a suit always catches my eye, but it was the way he looked at me that was different. Like he knew me or something. He didn’t know me, especially not in my costume. My sobriety rests on staying away from men, but there was something about him that made me throw caution to the wind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After all, I was never going to see him again, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Standing still isn’t the only way I make my money. I also bartend at a concert hall. Never in my wildest dreams did I think Shane was going to show up there. Not only that, but he’s the most recent addition to the orchestra. So now on a daily basis I have to resist one of the most beautiful men I’ve ever met &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he plays the violin. For me that’s one hell of a deadly cocktail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wants me to teach him how to live. I’m not sure how much a twenty-six year old recovering alcoholic who works in a bar and moonlights as a living statue can teach a world class concert violinist, but I’m sure going to try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Life with Strings&lt;/em&gt; is a story of music, art, sex, magical realism, and romance that you will never forget.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expected date of publication: March 24th 2014.</description>

  <description>I know what you’re thinking. “You were such a jerk, Nick!” Believe me, I know I screwed up the best thing I had going in my life, but that was kind of my thing. I’d learned how to run cons before I could even form complete sentences, and I’d always been selfish. But I changed. Lila forgave me, my brother and I were getting along, and I was trying to make a name for myself in the music world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least that was what I was trying to do when I negotiated my way into the recording studio with pop superstar Sadie Sinclair. I thought it would be a piece of cake—charm my way into her heart and into her record label’s good graces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just when I thought I had it all figured out, I got mixed up in a web of lies, manipulation, and deception. A web that had me questioning my motives and desires altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was the fame and fortune really worth the price?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://www.elizabethleewrites.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;www.elizabethleewrites.com&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date on release schedule!

  <description>Brad De Luca is incorrigible.  The premier divorce attorney in town, he is a forty-year old walking hunk of sex, bedding half the town, including his own clients.  Brad is used to getting whatever, and whomever, he wants, and when the newest intern arrives - Julia Campbell, a pre-law student fresh off a failed engagement - he embraces the challenge. Only, happy in her new independence, the last thing Julia wants, or needs, is an older man who could destroy her job prospects, and possibly her innocence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julia is confident in her sexuality, and her effect on men.  But she is far out of her league.  Before she knows it, Brad is stretching her boundaries and opening up a forbidden world of sensual and sexual exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: This book contains explicit sex scenes, including a MFM menage.</description>

  <description>Perfect for the fans of &lt;em&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/em&gt; who are desperately awaiting the release of &lt;em&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/em&gt;, this novella-length digital original will bridge the gap between these two novels from the perspective of the villain we all love to hate, Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Tahereh Mafi’s &lt;em&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/em&gt;, Juliette escaped from The Reestablishment by seducing Warner—and then putting a bullet in his shoulder. But as she’ll learn in &lt;em&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/em&gt;, Warner is not that easy to get rid of. . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back at the base and recovering from his near-fatal wound, Warner must do everything in his power to keep his soldiers in check and suppress any mention of a rebellion in the sector. Still as obsessed with Juliette as ever, his first priority is to find her, bring her back, and dispose of Adam and Kenji, the two traitors who helped her escape. But when Warner’s father, The Supreme Commander of The Reestablishment, arrives to correct his son’s mistakes, it’s clear that he has much different plans for Juliette. Plans Warner simply cannot allow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set after &lt;em&gt;Shatter Me&lt;/em&gt; and before its forthcoming sequel, &lt;em&gt;Unravel Me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destroy Me&lt;/em&gt; is a novella told from the perspective of Warner, the ruthless leader of Sector 45.</description>

  <description>When I met Kiersten, time stood still. It was as if every cell in my body screamed HER. I couldn't look away, I couldn't walk away, I couldn't even move. My other half, my soul mate, was staring right at me. I had to have her. I had to make her mine. But I felt selfish doing that--knowing that I may not have endless amounts of time to give her...and even now that every things' over with and I've been given that time back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing is ever certain in this life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which is why I'm about to do something crazy, impulsive, daring. &lt;br&gt;After all, what type of person would I be if I didn't take my own advice?&lt;br&gt;I'm jumping off the cliff, I'm living fearlessly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the continuation of Wes and Kiersten's story.</description>

  <description>War veteran Kennedy O’Brien is in the business of sticking it to the man—or at least any man who tries to cross a woman. After she returned home from Afghanistan and caught her husband in bed with the nanny, Kennedy lost her faith in men and started Fool Me Once Investigations with her two best friends. After all, there’s no better bounty hunter than a woman scorned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kennedy takes a case to slap cuffs on a bail jumper turned dog-napper, she figures it’ll be an easy paycheck. But trouble has a way of finding Kennedy. Enter the last man on the planet she’d willingly choose as a partner: her cheating ex-husband’s best friend, Griffin Crawford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As gorgeous as he is unwelcome, Griffin has always had a thing for Kennedy, and after keeping quiet about her ex’s cheating, he’ll do anything to earn back her trust. Whether or not she wants to admit it, Kennedy will need help as the case of the Chihuahua thief spirals out of control. Griffin may be just her man—in more ways than one.</description>

  <description>When Bree Prescott arrives in the sleepy, lakeside town of Pelion, Maine, she hopes against hope that this is the place where she will finally find the peace she so desperately seeks. On her first day there, her life collides with Archer Hale, an isolated man who holds a secret agony of his own. A man no one else sees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Archer's Voice is the story of a woman chained to the memory of one horrifying night and the man whose love is the key to her freedom. It is the story of a silent man who lives with an excruciating wound and the woman who helps him find his voice. It is the story of suffering, fate, and the transformative power of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THIS IS A STAND-ALONE NOVEL. The first three books in the series need not be read to enjoy this book. New Adult Contemporary Romance: Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20320762-ignite"&gt;ASIN: B00HH1JVCI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They grew up together as the closest of friends... and then more. When Sara Nolan and Jaxon Barlow decided to be together, their relationship as a young couple was consumed by a love that was both passionate and beautiful. Sara had it all when it came to a boyfriend: romance, trust, and a protector of all things bad. Jaxon had given her his bleeding heart for the keeping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Sara expected was to ruin it all. Falling into a darkness that turned her loving relationship into a chaos of deceit and violence, she walked away from the pain she was inflicting on the man she loved, never seeking to return again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Sara is forced to return to her hometown, she didn't anticipate for Jaxon to be there. Nor does she anticipate the change in him; a change so harsh and callous, he is a stranger with a dangerous agenda of his own. Ignited by her past feelings and the reminder of the guilt she carries in her heart, Sara attempts to avoid Jaxon at all costs… only to find herself trying to pull him out of the same darkness she was once in.</description>

      <![CDATA[<strong>3.5 Jax Stars </strong><br /><br />Loved Jax and Sara's friendship turned rommance and I feel that this book should've ended with a a big fat HEA instead of turning into a biker book. I think Remy could have been introduced and then received his own book.<br /><br />Overall, the story just went weird for me...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;New Adult Romance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pixie and Levi haven't spoken in nearly a year when they find themselves working―and living―at the same inn in the middle of nowhere. Once upon a time, they were childhood friends. But that was before everything went to hell. And now things are... awkward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All they want to do is avoid each other, and their past, for as long as possible. But now that they're forced to share a bathroom, and therefore a &lt;em&gt;shower&lt;/em&gt;, keeping their distance from one another becomes less difficult than keeping their hands off each other. Welcome to the hallway of awkward tension and sexual frustration, folks. Get comfy. It’s going to be a long summer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(70,000 words)</description>

  <description>When Lily Jacobs was born, she inherited Fazire – a genie. Her family had three wishes and they’d only ever used one so Fazire was stuck in the human world. This worked since he’d become a member of the family anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with a genie, Lily's young life wasn’t perfect. To escape the kids making her miserable at school, Lily buried herself in romance novels. One day, when the teasing was just too much, she used one of her wishes. She told Fazire she wanted to find a man like in her books and she made the most complicated wish Fazire had ever heard. Her wished-for man had to be impossibly handsome, virile, fierce, rugged and ruthless (amongst a dozen other things).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also had to think she was beautiful and he had to love her more than anything in the world.&lt;br&gt;Nathaniel McAllister wasn’t born to a life where there were such things as genies granting wishes. His life was filled with drugs, crime and neglect. He was running errands for a gangster before he was in his teens and, even though life and hard work led him to wealth and respectability, he always knew, deep down, he was dirty. When Nate met Lily he knew he was no good for her but as virile, fierce, rugged and ruthless as he was, Nate was no match for the pull of sweet, innocent Lily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Lily’s wish included that she and her hero go through trials and tribulations to test their love. And Fazire wasn’t only a good genie, he loved Lily – so he gave her exactly what she wanted.</description>

  <description>Wanted: Adventurous, open-minded man willing to try anything…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a popular sex blogger, Beatriz gets paid to have orgasms. So being on deadline the week of her sister’s wedding isn’t as rough as it sounds. There’s just one hitch: Bea’s assignment is to write a review of a sex position manual, but she doesn’t have a plus one to play with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news: Ben, the one who got away back in college, is also attending stag--and he's as temptingly gorgeous as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bad news: Ben turned down Bea’s offer of graduation night sex five years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best news: He’s not planning on making the same mistake twice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A red-hot retelling of Much Ado About Nothing for people who love Shakespeare but thought his plays could use a few more sex scenes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Cosmo Red-Hot Read</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;In a sizzling prequel novella to her new series THE DARK ELEMENTS, #1 New York Times bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout draws readers into the extraordinary, irresistible world of Wardens and demons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dez wasn't just Jasmine's crush. A gargoyle Warden like Jas, he helped her come to terms with her destiny—fending off demons and maintaining balance between good and evil. He was her everything...right until the moment he disappeared without a trace. It didn't help that Jas's father had just announced that she and Dez would one day be mated. Hard not to take that personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now he's back, three years older, ten times hotter, ready to pick up exactly where they left off. But Jas isn't taking that risk again. Dez has seven days to meet all her conditions and earn back her trust. Seven days filled with terrifying danger and sweet temptation. Seven days to win her heart—or shatter it all over again...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Have you ever gone just a little too far?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lexie Banks has.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yep. She just had mind-blowing sex with her stepbrother. In her defense, she was on the rebound, and it’s more of a my-dad-happened-to-marry-a-woman-with-a-super-hot-son situation. But still, he’s been her best friend and confidant for the better part of the last few years … and is so off limits. It’s a good thing she’s leaving in two days for a year abroad in Rome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even thousands of miles away, Lexie can’t seem to escape trouble. Raised Catholic, she goes to confession in hopes of alleviating some of her guilt … and maybe not burning in hell. Instead, she stumbles out of the confessional and right into Alessandro Moretti, a young and very easy-on-the-eyes deacon … only eight months away from becoming a priest. Lexie and Alessandro grow closer, and when Alessandro’s signals start changing despite his vow of celibacy, she doesn’t know what to think. She’s torn between falling in love with the man she shouldn’t want and the man she can’t have. And she isn’t sure how she can live with herself either way.</description>

It was a wonderful told story and I highly recommend readers picking it up.  <br /><br />This novella on the other hand although proceeds go to an amazing cause, was dare I say just flat out boring. <br /><br /><img src="http://s2.thejournal.ie/media/2013/10/tumblr_inline_mrwg9xd9vc1qz4rgp.gif" width="375" height="350" alt="description" class="escapedImg" /><br /><br />I think Beau Bennett was if there is such a thing <strong>TOO PERFECT</strong> and had nothing unique or...]]>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WARNING: Recommended for adult readers (18+) only! Mature themes, strong language, and sexual content... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LOTS of sexual content. Patrick is a naughty boy until he meets Elaine. So there's the warning--if you keep reading, please relax and have fun! (It's meant to be fun. *wink*)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;There's a new guy in town...&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Patrick Knight, single, retired Guard-turned private investigator. I was a closer. A deal maker. I looked clients in the eye and told them I’d get their shit done. And I did..."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patrick doesn't do "nice."&lt;br&gt;At least, not anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After his fiancee cheats, he follows up with a one-night stand and a disastrous office hook-up. His business partner (Derek Alexander) sends him to the desert to get his head straight--and clean up the mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there, Patrick meets Elaine, and blistering sparks fly, but she's not looking for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; guy. Or a long-distance relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patrick's ready to do anything to keep her, but just when it seems he’s changed her mind, the skeletons from his past life start coming back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standalone, M/F, HEA&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;In Robin York’s sizzling debut, a college student is attacked online and must restore her name—and stay clear of a guy who’s wrong for her, but feels so right.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Caroline Piasecki’s ex-boyfriend posts their sex pictures on the Internet, it destroys her reputation as a nice college girl. Suddenly her once-promising future doesn’t look so bright. Caroline tries to make the pictures disappear, hoping time will bury her shame. Then a guy she barely knows rises to her defense and punches her ex to the ground.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; West Leavitt is the last person Caroline needs in her life. Everyone knows he’s shady. Still, Caroline is drawn to his confidence and swagger—even after promising her dad she’ll keep her distance. On late, sleepless nights, Caroline starts wandering into the bakery where West works.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; They hang out, they talk, they listen. Though Caroline and West tell each other they’re “just friends,” their feelings intensify until it becomes impossible to pretend. The more complicated her relationship with West gets, the harder Caroline has to struggle to discover what she wants for herself—and the easier it becomes to find the courage she needs to fight back against the people who would judge her.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; When all seems lost, sometimes the only place to go is deeper.</description>

  <description>When a drunk driver tragically orphans Skylar Rose at the age of sixteen, she leaves her dreams behind and takes on the daunting task of helping her elderly grandmother raise her young sister.  While other girls her age were living a typical carefree life, she was picking up double shifts at a local café and struggling to pay the bills. &lt;br&gt;Always putting her sister’s needs and school first, Skylar has never had time to date or develop relationships. Now a senior in college, she has her sights set on an amazing internship opportunity.  The last thing she needed was for a sexy distraction like Sebastian Thorne to walk into her life. &lt;br&gt;Sebastian Thorne had been an entitled and reckless nineteen year old when he got behind the wheel of his new sports car that night. When his night of indulgence goes tragically wrong, Sebastian hesitantly turns to the one person, he knows can make everything go away…the one person he hates ..his father.&lt;br&gt;Now twenty-six, Sebastian is the young enigmatic and powerful CEO of his late father’s design company, Thorne Enterprises.  With both millions in the bank and a new woman on his arm almost every night, the world never knew the dark secret he carried inside.  Still plagued with nightmares from the night of that horrific accident and having to leave the beautiful girl behind, Sebastian vows to find the one that haunts his dreams. Sometimes the choice of revisiting our past opens the door to a future that we never thought possible.&lt;br&gt;Haunted by their past, these two want nothing more than to have their life given back to them. But what do you do when the person who gave you back your life, was the very one that took it from you in the first place?&lt;br&gt;* BOOK 2 THORNELESS will follow VERY VERY SOON!!  Contains sexual content and abusive situations. Recommended for readers 18+ years.</description>

  <description>Impulsive, YES. Irresponsible, SURE. Necessary, PROBABLY. Going to end badly, most likely. Does any of that matter to me, no. I decided that I can't please everyone so this week my only goal is to please me. I’m a selfish cow but I can’t seem to help it. I’m Clara Lord. I own Bloodline’s Tattoo Parlor, have a filthy mouth, no filter and a really strong objection to bossy idiots, pet names and wealthy men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will hate me, love me or love to hate me but either way it doesn’t matter. Everything I touch turns to crap and it’s all my fault. See, I lived through hell. Then I escaped hell and carefully spent the next eight years crafting a perfect little life until Domini Napoli screwed it all up. Now nothings right. Everything’s wrong and all my secrets are coming out.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Father Michael is coming to supper. Will it be Jagger's last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jagger’s erratic behavior is concerning Frano, but not as much as the threat the Donatelli family bring. They want Jagger and will continue to run the D’Angelo business into the ground until he’s handed over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Frano finally relents, agreeing to giving Jagger ten lashes of a whip as punishment for mutilating Father Michael, Alberto shows his true colors, bringing with him a new era of servitude, something Rita never anticipated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rita's discovery as an FBI agent puts her life at risk, but her resemblance to Jagger's first lover may send her to hell.</description>

  <description>Love and Lists is the first book in the Chocolate Lovers spinoff - Chocoholics: The foul-mouthed offspring tell their stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-five-year-old Gavin Ellis has always had the love and support of his family ever since he was a little boy and couldn't stop talking about his penis.  He's also always had their unsolicited advice and uncanny knack of embarrassing him at all costs.  Now that he's an adult and trying to convince the love of his life to love him back, things haven't changed very much from when he was younger.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Gavin's best friend Tyler suggests he make a to-do list of items that will ensure he wins the girl, Gavin is one-hundred-percent on board: after a few six packs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After puking in the shrubs, a bad experience with Viagra, a Sex-Ed course gone wrong, and a slew of other mishaps courtesy of his family and friends, Gavin is pretty sure this list will be the death of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, trying to make someone love you with a list isn't always the best idea.  Especially when "Show her your penis" is the first "to-do" item...</description>

  <description>What do you do when the one person you thought you knew turns out to be the one you knew the least?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty-three year old Marissa Chase, and soon to be college graduate, has everything going for her: wonderful friends, a lucrative degree, and a chance to explore the world. What made it even better – or so she thought – was when her path crossed with the alluring Alec Holden. Unable to stay away from him, Marissa experiences a love like no other, and falls into his world of passion and intrigue. However, things begin to shift when this path takes a deadly turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her trust is put to the test when hidden dangers unfold before her, revealing secrets that have been buried for years. Secrets that were meant to stay hidden. Murder, lies, and betrayal … will Marissa figure it all out in time and escape with her life intact, or will she be too late and fall into the trap of deception?</description>

  <description>Feeling dead in her marriage, Elizabeth Fairchild ditches the dream of her seemingly perfect life with her husband in search of who she really is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She went from her parents' house to her husband's home and never really learned to stand on her own two feet. She decides to leave her comfortable life in Napa Valley in search of her inner fire in New York City. She certainly didn't leave her husband to find another man, but she soon finds herself involved with two: Jack Stevens and Kevin Parker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack is older. He has heart-stopping good looks, is wildly successful, and is very much in control of everything around him - especially Elizabeth. &lt;br&gt;Kevin is younger. He is carefree with a heart of gold and loves Elizabeth's spirit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While Elizabeth's old life still calls to her, she also finds what she needs in New York. But which dream will she choose?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; **********&lt;br&gt;WARNING:  EROTIC ROMANCE... This book contains subject material of an adult nature intended for readers of 18 years old and older. In these pages you will find graphic language and sexual encounters that some readers might disagree with: regular sex, BDSM, oral, anal and threesomes. You’ve been warned. Happy reading! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DISCLAIMER: this is a work of FICTION. It doesn't represent my life, or the lives of anyone I know.</description>

  <description>Description:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years ago, Cody Garrett’s heart was ripped to shreds when Bridie ditched him and married his brother, Scott. &lt;br&gt;With great difficulty, he moved on and rebuilt his life without her, severing all ties with his brother because of their betrayal. &lt;br&gt;Now, Scott, his brother, is ill and a threat to his wife and children. &lt;br&gt;Cody is forced to step in and move them into his house.  &lt;br&gt;Being physically so close to Bridie, and spending time alone with her, brings back a flood of memories, and he finds it a daily struggle to contain his feelings for his brother’s wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Bridie, who likes to put things (and people) in perspective, Cody Garrett was filed under ‘Cheat’ and she too moved on with her life.  &lt;br&gt;But while living with him, she stumbles upon secrets involving Cody and her, that changes everything.&lt;br&gt;Now, she must fight her feeling for Cody and remain true to her marriage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT: (Raw)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But my rage, my anger towards Stephanie was the least of my worries.&lt;br&gt;A different set of fantasies proved even more troubling.&lt;br&gt;Cody.&lt;br&gt;Me and him. Me and him sleeping together.&lt;br&gt;Wait! Allow me to rephrase that. Me and him fucking like crazy.&lt;br&gt;I couldn’t get the images out of my mind. I couldn’t get him out of my mind, and my showers became frequent and colder.&lt;br&gt;It’s true – an idle mind is a devil’s workshop.&lt;br&gt;The moment my mind was relaxed, the workshop came alive and my fantasies sprouted – me and him in the backseat of his Hummer, me and him in my bathroom when the kids were asleep, me and him in a hotel during the day, me and him in the garage having a quickie.&lt;br&gt;This longing for him, the need to touch him, taste him, feel him and breathe him was all-consuming and I unhinged and feverish.&lt;br&gt;Sometimes, I felt like crying, that’s how plagued I was.&lt;br&gt;I thought of him the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. If my sleep broke, my mind drifted to him, sleeping a few feet away.&lt;br&gt;Of course, I suspected he felt the same way. The way his eyes would follow me around, then when our eyes met, he’d shift his away. But sometimes he didn’t, and our gaze locked.&lt;br&gt;He started to walk around shirtless and touched me at every available opportunity.&lt;br&gt;But it wasn’t enough for me.&lt;br&gt;Subconsciously, I went into seduction mode. Maybe even consciously, I don’t know.&lt;br&gt;My shorts grew shorter, my tops grew tighter and my sheer nightdresses grew sheerer. I tossed my hair, cocked my head, smiled at him from under my lashes, slowly licked a spoon, walked like Cat Woman when I was sure he was looking at my ass, and used my cotton candy voice on him.&lt;br&gt;Even though I wasn’t sleeping with him, I had Brazilians and wore thongs.&lt;br&gt;I was ripe for him, I was asking for it and I paraded my wares like a hooker.&lt;br&gt;Wanton.&lt;br&gt;That’s what I was.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just wanted my husband’s brother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;END OF EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MY BROTHER, MY RIVAL is a sexy, two-part, modern-day love story that will have you laughing, crying and gasping with disbelief as the story unfolds. &lt;br&gt;Book one must be read before book 2&lt;br&gt;Warning: sex scenes, violence and coarse language.</description>

  <description>FREE 28, 29, 30 Jan 2014!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cody Garrett, a former Navy SEAL, has never met a skirt he didn’t fancy. His six-pack, rugged looks and bad boy image, ensures a steady stream of hot babes waiting to slip him their phone numbers wherever he goes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, he is confused when Bridie Barker refuses to go on a date with him. It’s not like she’s a stunning beauty or something. According to him, her ears are big, she’s well-rounded and she’s not even a ‘d’ cup. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In spite of her shortcomings, the more she pushes him away, the more he finds himself thinking of her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bridie Barker has control issues, every detail in her life is planned. Her closet is color-coded and she has an array of storage contains so that nothing is out of place.  Her whole world is black and white and grey areas are a no-no. She prefers it that way, it keeps her focused and prevents her from becoming the crackhead her mother was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she meets the refined, yet warm and grounded Scott Garrett, she thinks she has found her soul mate. Unfortunately, and to her disappointment, things don’t pan out with Scott. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While waiting tables, she has a disastrous run-in with his brother, the wild Cody Garrett, King of Body Shots and who parties every night with a different girl. Even though he’s good to look at and makes her laugh, she turns down his advances as he’s clearly the tag-and-release kind of guy, while she doesn’t believe in one night stands, no matter how meaningful they are. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, she is pretty sure he owns not a single storage container and she certain that his closet is not color-coded. Problem is, Cody Garrett won’t take no for an answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My Brother, My Rival is a sexy, modern-day, drama-laden love story that will have you laughing, crying and gasping with disbelief, as the story unfolds.</description>

This is NOT a love triangle but perhaps in the next book readers will have a hot love triangle. <br /><br />I found that I grew tired of the drama and some repetitive phrases (MFF and body shots)...]]>

  <description>The only person poetry-loving Cali Monroe hates more than herself is Logan Waters, the geeky kid who lives in the dorm building next to hers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since Cali's parents told her she would amount to nothing, she has felt entirely inadequate. Friendless and alone, she takes on the mean girl role in hopes it will make her feel better--and Logan serves as the perfect target. He infuriates her with his obnoxiously long lashes, his all too perfect dimpled smile, and his complete lack of personality outside of his intelligence. It doesn't hurt that he's part of the reason her brother is dead, either. So Cali hates him, and he returns the favor. Thus, their prank-filled, insult-driven rivalry is born, and torturing Logan quickly becomes the highlight of her life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Cali's parents set them up on a blind date, she begins to realize Logan might not be as boring as she always thought. He shares her love of poetry, takes a sadistic pleasure in making fun of crepes, and he makes her blush when he calls her smile pretty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And hey, maybe those long lashes of his aren't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; obnoxious after all… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two Roads&lt;/em&gt; is New Adult Romance about finding love, standing out, and learning to embrace who you are. It contains some language and mild sexual content.</description>

  <description>I’ve been unsure about many things in my life except for one thing, that I have always loved him. Every single minute of every single day that I have been on this earth, my heart has belonged to him. It has never been a question, never a doubt. The love had taken on many different forms over the years, but it had always been a constant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Everyone has their definition of love. There have been countless songs sung about it. A gazillion books, articles, and poems written about it. There are experts on love who will tell you how to get it, keep it, and get over it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  We’re led to believe love is complicated. It’s not the love that’s complicated. It’s all the crap that we attach to it and put in front of it that makes it difficult. If you’re smart, you’ll realize this before it’s too late and simplify.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      ____________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amanda Kelly spent her entire life trying to control every aspect of it, while striving for perfection. Her obsession with being perfect, along with her feelings of worthlessness, consumed her. The one thing she thought was perfect in her life was the bond she shared with her best friend, Noah. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything was going according to her life plan until she woke up one day and realized she had fallen in love with him. The one thing she couldn’t control was the affect he had on her. Noah had the power to give her one hundred lifetimes of happiness, which also gave him the power to completely devastate her. He was the one thing in her life that was perfect, but she couldn't allow herself to have him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her life begins to unravel. Events take over and force her to let go of her dreams and desires. She needs to realize that a person cannot control the events in their life, only their reaction to them...but will it be too late for her to save her relationship with her best friend? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Present Perfect is a story of how past events have present consequences and how perfect your present could be if you stopped fighting and just allowed it to happen.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;America’s premier author of provocative fiction delivers the dramatic finale to a series set within the inner circle of glamour, sex and privilege.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it came to playing games, my lover Jax was a master strategist. He pulled strings behind the closed doors of D.C.’s most powerful political players, and somehow still found time to nearly sideline my career. What he didn’t know was that when I didn’t like the rules, I threw them out and made my own. I wasn’t going to let Jax get away with it. I wasn’t going to let him get away at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I loved Jax enough that it was impossible to give up. Jax loved me enough that giving up was the only end he’d consider. He didn’t think I could swim with the sharks. It was entirely my pleasure to show him that I’d already dived in…</description>

  <description>Twenty-five year old Jack Falcon doesn’t do relationships, and why would he when he has woman after woman literally throwing themselves at him? For Jack, life is perfect just the way it is. He works hard and he plays harder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack’s life changes when he meets Belle. Unlike any woman he’s ever met, there is something about this girl that makes him unable to keep away, something beyond the youthful beauty and her innocent spirit. Belle is strong and independent, a big leap from the usual brainless chicks he tends to attract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack begins a dangerous game. He is determined to seduce Belle, and without realizing it, his feelings for her develop beyond anything he has ever felt before. Things become complicated when he learns there are good reasons as to why he should stay the hell away from her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can you stay away from someone you want to spend every waking minute with? And what do you do when you know eventually you will destroy that person? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their feelings for each other deepen, Jack struggles with his own internal demons which threaten to rip them apart. Jack is torn between following his heart and listening to his head, which keeps telling him he is not good enough for her. She deserves better than what he can give her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How far will he push before they both fall over the edge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Really, I’m not as bad as my reputation makes me out to be. In fact, I’d go as far to describe myself as a decent guy. I just have no interest in a relationship that extends beyond a quick fuck when it suits me. I really don’t see how it’s my fault or problem if a chick falls for my boyish charms. Every woman seems to think she can change me, that she somehow has something all the other notches on my belt didn’t have.”</description>

  <description>After clawing her way out of an abusive relationship, the last thing Mara Campbell is looking for is love. Even after a year, dating seems like a laughable prospect at best. She has no interest in getting wrapped up in another emotionally draining relationship; and that's all Mara ever seems to find when it comes to guys — losers, who seem to suck the life right out of her. No, Mara is much more interested in training relentlessly to pursue a career in dance — and she'll let nothing stand in her way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole Davenport is a drop-dead gorgeous professional racecar driver; who's an ace on the track and even better when it comes to driving Mara's heart rate up to top speeds. But, while Mara tries to juggle between advancing her dance career and not losing her heart to a guy who's use to winning; someone else has an entirely different agenda where she's concerned. One that could test the boundaries of her trust and change everything…</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Who is Sebastian Lock?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bar Sophia Pearce is in doesn’t look like much. The wine is bad and the decor worse. But when a sudden attack of curiosity leads her to sneak past security and into the back room, she discovers something unimaginable. The most lavish party she’s ever laid eyes on, in the most unlikely of places.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that’s nothing compared to what comes next, to the man she meets back there. Sebastian Lock. Gorgeous, commanding, and radiating charm, he is exactly the sort of silver-tongued rake Sophia has sworn to avoid. Unfortunately, he doesn’t care much for her promises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every instinct tells her to run, but the chemistry between them is as inescapable as gravity. Soon, he’s opening her eyes to a whole new world of pleasures, pleasures she never thought she’d enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s just one problem. Sebastian is more than he seems. Between the famous company he keeps and the almost paranoid secrecy of his employers, he’s a puzzle Sophia can’t quite solve, and his insistence on keeping things casual forces her to confront the demons of her past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she learn to trust again? Or will Sebastian’s privacy tear them apart?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contains light BDSM, including spanking, restraint, and anal play&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: This book is the first part of a trilogy that is designed to be read together, much like The Blackstone Affair. Sebastian and Sophia will get their happily ever after, but not until the last book.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Rebecca Summers enjoys pleasing herself with the curtains open. When a mysterious stranger calls to tell her that he is watching, fantasy becomes reality as she begins to perform for him. Following his instructions over the phone while he watches from afar, she finds herself craving more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oliver Durant has always been drawn to humans to exert the dominance and control his kind needs to feel alive. While secretly observing her and calling nightly, he can’t seem to get enough of Rebecca, whom he refers to as butterfly. His urges with her are stronger than the need to dominate, as he is driven to possess her in every way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of their worlds are turned upside down when they finally meet and she agrees to enter into a Dominant/submissive relationship with her Midnight Caller.</description>

  <description>Born into a life of privilege and secrets, Nora Blakely has everything any nineteen-year-old girl could desire.  She’s an accomplished pianist, a Texas beauty queen, and on her way to Princeton after high school.  She’s perfect…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving behind her million-dollar mansion and Jimmy Choos, she becomes a girl hell-bent on pushing the limits with alcohol, drugs, and meaningless sex.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she meets her soulmate.  But he doesn’t want her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to girls, twenty-five-year-old Leo Tate has one rule:  never fall in love.  His gym and his brother are all he cares about...until he meets Nora.  He resists the pull of their attraction, hung up on their six year age difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they struggle to stay away from each other, secrets will be revealed, tempers will flare, and hearts will be broken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome to Briarcrest Academy…where sometimes, the best things in life are Very Bad Things.</description>

  <description>After a series of catastrophic misunderstandings and impulsively poor decision-making, Scarlett MacGregor finds herself once again torn between two loves, as different as they may be. Lacking proper closure with their relationship, accompanied by the overwhelming guilt for her role in his devastating downfall, Scarlett resolves to help Mason recover and reclaim his life as a budding rock star. However, now that he has finally claimed her as his, Ash Walker is bound and determined to keep her by his side, and he will go to any lengths necessary to do just that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mason Templeton has hit rock bottom. He’s in love with a girl whose heart and soul belong to another and he’s partied his way off of an international music tour that was supposed to be his big break. Returning home for rehab sounds like the worst possible way to start a new year, but when an unexpected friendship emerges, he begins to realize that maybe everything does happen for a reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Euphoria is the third and final installment of Scarlett, Ash, and Mason’s self-discovering journeys to  happiness and understanding the meaning of true love ~ the kind that begs for complete surrender.</description>

  <description>At the age of sixteen, Samantha Smith’s innocence was shattered in the blink of an eye. She kept the pain to herself for three years, burying her terrible secret beneath black clothes and black makeup, afraid to tell anyone. The price for her silence was the loss of her happiness and all of her friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After moving from stuffy Washington D.C. to laid back San Diego, where Samantha is now a freshman at San Diego University, she is determined to find new friends and reclaim her optimistic spirit. Having thrown away her goth exterior, she hopes that her new sunny look will heal her wounds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dreaming of adventure, she wishes to escape the humdrum middle-class existence that has repressed her fiery nature for as long as she can remember. But her parents are pressuring her to major in Accounting because it’s the safe thing to do. Samantha secretly considers ditching the business major to study Art, a choice that would horrify her parents if they ever found out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Samantha crosses paths with a troubled, handsome, tattoo-clad bad boy, her life spins into overdrive, and Samantha finds herself juggling more adventure than she ever dreamed possible.</description>

  <description>From Adriane Leigh, an Amazon Bestselling author in Erotica, comes a passionately evocative story about wanting what's forbidden, and giving in to desire so sharp and sweet it threatens to consume...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On impulse, Georgia Montgomery buys a beach house on the North Carolina coast looking for a summer of sun, sand, margaritas and best friends. A charming, seductive, and sexy-as-sin visitor isn't what she bargained for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georgia is instantly drawn to Tristan Howell, the pleasure-seeking playboy with an easy smile and eyes the deepest shade of green she's ever seen. She tries to ignore the desire that burns between them, but just like an addiction-one look, one touch, one taste is never enough. Tristan shows her pleasure like she's never known, and over the course of the summer she must decide if she can let go of the world she's always known to embrace the future she isn't even sure she has with the irresistible ladies man who makes it his goal to free her body and soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For mature audiences.</description>

  <description>She’s the sexiest secret at East Park University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rylan Willow is the top model for East Park Exposed, the university’s underground and insanely successful erotic magazine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her friends know her as Evan Cosette, a biochemistry major with a flawless GPA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;East Park Exposed has kept Evan’s tuition paid. All she has to do is keep up the naïve school-girl disguise when she’s on campus and her secret is safe, her two worlds separate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Dallas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the magazine runs a co-ed shoot to broaden readership, Evan’s partner is a gorgeous and disgustingly brilliant grad student. Evan doesn’t know how much of Dallas Whitley she’ll be able to handle, especially when he wants to study with her outside the studio. She promises herself that she can just be friends with Dallas. He has a girlfriend, after all. And Evan needs to focus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She can’t when the co-ed printing brings sales through the roof.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She can’t when her photographer wants to crank the heat for the next issue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every steamy shoot leaves Evan gasping for breath, her true feelings for Dallas clouded by their camera-charade. But the more time she spends with him in the real world, the more she risks someone finding out the truth about her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She needs to decide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who gets Dallas—Rylan, or Evan?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A biker. A tattoo artist. A love to last a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Maddox Cross has always had to be tough. When his father went to jail for murder, the teenager took care of his sister and mother. Now on his own and working security at a night club, Maddox wants to become a tattoo artist-a dream that comes closer to reality when he falls for the hottest, most tatted woman he's ever seen. She's wild and beautiful, and Maddox will do anything to be with her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bee Malone came to town to open up her new tattoo parlor, Masquerade. Since being kidnapped as a young girl, Bee has had trouble getting close to anyone. But when she meets Maddox, she sees that under his hard biker's body is the sensitive soul of an artist. What starts out as a sizzling one-night stand soon becomes so much more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bee wants Maddox to join her tattoo business, but letting him into her life means revealing all her most intimate secrets. And as the past begins to intertwine with her present, Bee fears their love may not be as permanent as their ink . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;70,000-80,000 words.</description>

  <description>Struggling to put her life back together after a tragic mountaineering accident kills her college sweetheart, twenty-one-year-old Holly Treadwell is trying to set aside her grief, forge ahead in school, and find herself again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Carter Hansen, a guy who brings back horrible memories from the night of the accident, finds his way back into her life, Holly’s unsure if she should let him in. He terrifies her in more ways than one and invokes feelings in her that she thought were buried forever. Regardless of her fears, she knows she must face him in order for her heart to heal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone tells Carter that what happened on the mountain that night was just a terrible accident, but even then, he can’t help but carry around the guilt and is unable to forgive himself. He’s drawn to Holly and being near her helps ease his conscience and gives him the release he needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Holly and Carter’s relationship grows, they begin to realize that the more time they spend with one another, the more their wounds begin to heal—her grief and his guilt. But when Holly learns the details about the night of the accident—what everyone has been keeping from her—it will rip open old wounds and tear apart what they’ve both worked so hard to overcome…</description>

  <description>Beth Cornett is the town good girl, so staying out of the way of the motorcycle club’s dangerous members was a no brainer. Unfortunately, she manages to catch the eye of Razer, who has every intention of tempting her to take him on despite her misgivings. When her worst fears are realized, she is left heartbroken, determined to forget her walk on the wild side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Razer was not going to change for any woman, not even Beth. Their lifestyles were too different; betrayed she ran. Realizing his mistake too late; she was not about to forgive and forget. It takes a killer intent on targeting Beth to bring her back to him and The Last Riders for protection. Razer may have learned his lesson, but this time, as long as she is at the club, she has to play by their rules.</description>

  <description>Even a broken heart has trouble resisting a Stubborn Love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emmie Hayes loved the beautiful Ashton Stirling deeply; nobody could deny that. She had given him her youth, and all he gave in return was misery and pain. She was ready for a new beginning, but Ashton wasn’t about to let her go so easily, even if it meant destroying both their lives in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years later Emmie convinces herself she is ready to leave all of that heartbreak in the past and find a little piece of normal for herself. She heads to New York City to pick up where she left off, determined to finish art school. Emmie is determined to focus on school and not let anything distract her, but life has a way of throwing curveballs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paige, Emmie’s new roommate, brings Colin Bennett into her life. His smoldering eyes and lean muscular body are difficult for any girl to ignore. Only thing is, Emmie isn’t any girl. Her past makes her resistant to his charms. Colin isn’t one to give up easily, and just when he thinks he may have found a way to her stubborn heart, her tragic history may have found a way to tear them apart.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;She wants one night. He wants her forever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hayden Summers just landed the job of a lifetime taking pictures for &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; magazine, but she’s determined to leave with no regrets. The first thing on her list? Erase the memory of her cheating ex with a wild night of anonymous sex. The second? Figure out why her best friend, sexy bar owner Jace Jennings, stopped speaking to her the night she told him about the job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace has a problem. Hayden isn’t just leaving the country, she’s risking her &lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;—just when he’s realized he’s in love with her. When fate traps them in the storage room of his bar together, barely contained desire simmers to surface. In one last attempt to keep her, Jace offers Hayden the one thing she wants: a night of hot sex, no strings attached. But when the night is over, will Jace be able to let her go? And will Hayden leave with her heart intact?&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>He had planned a perfect weekend for her…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriel “Force” Banner has been unable to get a certain sexy accountant out of his head. Sole Regret’s inventive drummer has created big plans to keep sweet Melanie entertained all weekend long. Unfortunately, Melanie arrives for their rendezvous with a bit of baggage that just might ruin their fun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She didn’t mean to make things difficult…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Melanie wouldn’t blame Gabe if he left her at the airport with her bit of baggage, but he’s determined to make their limited time together work. When they leave behind the bustle of New Orleans and the rock ‘n’ roll scene to visit his serene oasis outside of Austin, Texas, their romantic weekend seems to be back on track. But life has a way of butting in at the worst possible times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can they learn how to support each other in the face of adversity or will reality destroy their budding relationship before it even takes flight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This novella is 60,000 words long and includes an extra night, because one night with Force just isn’t enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabe and Melanie's story continues in&lt;/strong&gt; Book 11: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490402.Trust_Me" title="Trust Me"&gt;Trust Me&lt;/a&gt; (not yet released).</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Trapped with a billionaire in his mysterious mansion... Can she beat him at his own game?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily Frazer would do anything to save the Frazer Center for the Arts--even take on the infamous billionaire Calder Cunningham. When Lily breaks onto the Cunningham estate, she only wants to find and reason with Calder. (All right, all right, she wants to punch him, too, but that's Plan B.) As it turns out, the arrogant billionaire is willing to give her the money he promised, but there's a catch: she must win it from him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily won't give up the money without a fight, but she quickly discovers that there's more to the attractive, brooding Calder than she initially perceived. To make matters even more complicated, their games of cat and mouse are becoming increasingly intense, and she suddenly finds herself confused by her own emotions. Can she deny her attraction long enough to win the money she needs? What happens if her feelings for Calder begin to overcome her hatred for the things he's done? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A contemporary, steamy take on Beauty and the Beast, His Wicked Games is a tale of devilish deeds, wild passions, and wicked romance.</description>

  <description>The past pulls. The future shoves. The present just begs for a time-out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aislynn Currington is searching for an escape from her tumultuous past, one that includes a severely broken heart and a very complicated relationship with a mother who uses criticism as her preferred mode of expressing love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Quinn is a driven businessman who, even after surviving a serious life-changing event, remains hell bent on avoiding any form of serious attachment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some define insanity as doing things repeatedly while expecting a different outcome. What will Aislynn and Jace need to do to break this endless loop?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of their undeniably intense sexual attraction, witty banter, and love for high-end coffee machines, Aislynn and Jace learn to bravely battle through the challenges of falling in love at the most inconvenient time, in a place they did not plan to be, and with the person they can’t seem to stop running into.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cursive's multiple layers of drama, romance, passion, and humor are tightly bound together by an unforeseeable major twist that will keep the reader engaged and connected until the very end.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Breakout New Adult sensation Monica Murphy returns with a hot new contemporary romance—a heartfelt story of second chances, forgiveness, and redemption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commitment.&lt;/em&gt; That’s what I really want from Colin. Ever since my brother, Danny, died in Iraq, Colin’s done so much to help me, including giving me a job at his popular restaurant so I can leave my crappy waitressing job at the strip joint. But lying in bed with him every night to comfort him from his horrible nightmares isn’t enough anymore. I know he feels guilty about Danny’s death, about not going to Iraq, but I can’t keep living this double life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I love him desperately, but he’s got so many demons, and if he can’t open up to me now, then he’ll never be the real partner I need him to be. I gave him a month, and now I’m out of here. If he truly loves me like he says, he knows where to find me.</description>

  <description>Ever read a book and wish the heroine hadn’t done that, gone there, or slept with that guy? Well, now you’re in charge. The reader decides what happens here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tailor your perfect short story or be adventurous and read through all the different paths to see where life can take you…if you choose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go ahead, pick your pleasure.&lt;br&gt;…&lt;br&gt;Linley Lane, CEO of Lane Technologies, has had enough of blah dates. When she decides to shake things up with a visit to an underground sex club she’s heard rumors about, she realizes she’s way out of her league. This is no usual hookup spot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presented with two potential guides for the night—men who turn her on more in a matter of minutes than a year of lame dating in her high-class circles did—she’s got some tough decisions to make about how she wants to spend the rest of her evening and just how dirty she intends to get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she choose to be romanced by a sexy gentleman? Or will she indulge the rare anonymity Underground affords to revel in wild excess with a like-minded rebel? And where will they go from there?&lt;br&gt;Everything is up to you.</description>

  <description>For twenty-one-year-old Sydney, being in love with Kyler isn't anything new. They'd been best friends ever since he pushed her down on the playground and she made him eat a mud pie. Somewhere over the years, she fell for him and fell hard. The big problem with that? Kyler puts the 'man' in man-whore. He's never stayed with a girl longer than a few nights, and with it being their last year in college, Syd doesn't want to risk their friendship by declaring her love.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyler has always put Syd on a pedestal that was too high for him to reach. To him, she's perfect and she's everything. But the feelings he has for her, he's always hidden away or focused on any other female. After all, Kyler will always be the poor boy from the wrong side of tracks, and Syd will always be the one girl he can never have.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when they're stranded together at a posh ski resort due to a massive Nor'easter, there's nothing stopping their red-hot feelings for each other from coming to the surface. Can their friendship survive the attraction? Better yet, can they survive at all? Because as the snow falls, someone is stalking them, and this ski trip may be a life-changer in more ways than one.</description>

  <description>Ruining Angel brings you Angel's POV from the very beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting in Angel's head isn't easy. He's got these dark broody eyes that beg you to get on your knees and say please when you want a question answering. You want to know what he was thinking the first time he made Bailey his? Well first you'll need to visit his childhood. Bringing you never before scenes from a young Angel's perspective, you'll be blown away by the gorgeous way he works his way into your heart forever. In Ruining Angel, all the important moments of his life are encapsulated in this novella.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what about the aftermath of RUINED? It's here, waiting for you to find out what happens once his and Bailey's secret is out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If ever there was a tale of forbidden love that made you want the characters to get their happily ever after, Ruining Angel is it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(This novella can be read without reading Ruined first)&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>When outlaw biker, Cole Austin sees a young woman handcuffed and being dragged across the yard of the Dead Souls Motorcycle Club's remote clubhouse, he's stunned by the realization of just how dark his world has become. This scene is even more than his twisted soul can stomach. Compelled to intercede and save her, he has no idea his whole world is about to change. He believes he's doing the right thing until a secret she's hiding makes him question if saving her may be the biggest mistake of his life. The two strike a deal, a deal they may both come to regret. Can his soul be saved? Is there anything he won't do for her? Are there some things he just can't? And are there some things she can never forgive?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt; He makes good girls...bad. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante Walker is flippin’ awesome, and he knows it. His good looks, killer charm, and stellar confidence have made him one of hell’s best—a soul collector. His job is simple: weed through humanity and label those round rears with a big red good or bad stamp. Old Saint Nick gets the good guys, and he gets the fun ones. Bag-and-tag.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sealing souls is nothing personal. Dante’s an equal-opportunity collector and doesn't want it any other way. But he’ll have to adjust, because Boss Man has given him a new assignment:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collect Charlie Cooper’s soul within ten days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dante doesn't know why Boss Man wants Charlie, nor does he care. This assignment means only one thing to him, and that’s a permanent ticket out of hell. But after Dante meets the quirky Nerd Alert chick he’s come to collect, he realizes this assignment will test his abilities as a collector…and uncover emotions deeply buried.</description>

Forgiveness proves elusive, and trouble finds her anyway when she discovers a secret club at school connected to the death of her best friend. She learns that swim team members participate in a “Fantasy Slut League,” scoring points for their sexual acts with unsuspecting girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke, wracked with guilt over her friend’s death, decides to infiltrate the league by becoming one of the “unsuspecting girls,” and exact revenge on the boys who stole away her best friend. An unexpected romance complicates her plans, and her dogged pursuit of justice turns her reckless as she underestimates just how far the boys will go to keep their sex club a secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is a New Adult fiction book with mature themes. It contains graphic sex and language and a description of sexual violence.)&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>What happens when a 35 year-old soccer mom from Indianapolis, Indiana sends her only child off to college and suddenly discovers that she has no identify of her own?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what happened to Samantha (Sammie) Dennison. Her marriage was loveless from the start; her 'mannequin' husband has his own agenda, which has never included her, and she feels lonely, ignored and downright &lt;strong&gt;frumpy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her daughter and her best friend both tell her to get a life, and that's exactly what Sammie does, starting with a Kickboxing/Pilates class to get into shape, and then continuing her regiment by signing up for pole-dancing lessons. Sammie graduates at the top of her class, and ultimately ends up with a secret career as a pole dancer at a Gentleman's Club in Indy called 'Jewels.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Known only by her dancer name, "Diamond," she is well on her way to finally carving out a secret life and identity all of her own that brings excitement and mystery to her otherwise mundane existence. The thrill of the dance and sexuality she discovers within herself is a potent mixture, but it's all about the dance with Sammie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until bad-boy biker Slate enters the picture. He is the ultimate 'alpha' male and quickly draws the attention of the dancers - including Sammie. Slate is a 'prospect' for the notorious Outlaw Motorcycle Club, but he is also inexplicably drawn to "Diamond." Sammie is totally out of her league with Slate and the dangerous people he associates with in Indianapolis during the summer of 2012. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No spoilers here, but something BIG is brewing in Indy; and it ain't about race cars either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Diamond Girl' will keep the reader on the edge of their seat from beginning to end; this book has it all: passion, erotica, romance, danger and possibly more . . . much more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:  This book is based loosely on actual events that occurred in Indianapolis, Indiana in the summer of 2012 involving certain members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club after a two-year investigation conducted by various federal agencies.  The names have been changed to protect the parties.  Other events depicted in this book are purely fictional for entertainment purposes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;This book is intended for mature audiences.&lt;/em&gt;

  <description>Lanie Heron isn’t looking for love—no surprise, considering her last serious relationship nearly got her killed. So when Lanie propositions Hop Kincaid, all she wants is one wild night with the hot-as-hell biker who patrols with the Chaos Motorcycle Club...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Hop, Lanie has always been untouchable. She’s too polished and too classy for his tastes. But when she gives Hop the once-over with her bedroom eyes and offers him a night in paradise, he can’t say no. And he doesn’t regret it when he finds that Lanie is the best thing that’s ever happened to him—in or out of bed. Now the trick will be to convince her of that.</description>

  <description>This sexy, emotionally charged romance continues the story of Damien Stark, the powerful multimillionaire who’s never had to take “no” for an answer, and Nikki Fairchild, the Southern belle who only says “yes” on her own terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our desire runs deep. But our secrets cut close.&lt;/em&gt; Beautiful, strong, and commanding, Damien Stark fills a void in me that no other man can touch. His fierce cravings push me beyond the brink of bliss—and unleash a wild passion that utterly consumes us both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet beneath his need for dominance, he carries the wounds of a painful past. Haunted by a legacy of dark secrets and broken trust, he seeks release in our shared ecstasy, the  heat between us burning stronger each day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our attraction is undeniable, our obsession inevitable. Yet not even Damien can run from his ghosts, or shield us from the dangers yet to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Complete Me &lt;/em&gt;is an erotic romance intended for mature audiences.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Seven days. And seven rules to break…&lt;/em&gt;District Attorney Vanessa MacGregor firmly believes that structure and order are the stuff that dreams are made of. Happiness &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be planned—and it starts with the seven rules she’s laid out for her future. But as she’s organizing her best friend’s wedding in Hawaii, all of Vanessa’s best-laid plans are about to meet their match in a wickedly hot MMA fighter…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson "Jax" Maris is focused on surfing, training, and fighting. That is, until he opens up his big mouth and finds himself having to pretend he’s engaged to his little sister’s best friend, Vanessa. When they’re forced to share a romantic bungalow, however, their little charade suddenly takes a turn for the seriously sexy. And while Jax is definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of Vanessa’s long-term plan, he has seven days—and seven naughty nights—to turn her seven-rule plan upside down.&lt;br&gt;</description>

  <description>New school. New friendships. New life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not so much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alexandra is pissed about her parents abandoning her. She's beyond pissed that her friends did the same. She's enraged because things are unclear about her brother's death now. So her first stop is at Jesse's house to demand answers. She wants to know why her brother was friends with the criminal crowd before he died and she knows he holds the answers. But when she sees him, she doesn't get the answers she expected. Instead, she finds out that their chemistry never faded and soon heats up again! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some habits die hard. Soon Jesse and Alex are back to their ways of sneaking around. He's a near-celebrity at school and she doesn't want to deal with the backlash of being his girlfriend. Alex is tired of being hurt so she's learned the lesson not to confide and lean on others. However, she can't seem to help herself when it comes to Jesse Hunt. The big question isn't if she will survive if their relationship goes public, it's if she will survive when the real truths about her family and brother come out? Or when she learns that Jesse knows more than what he's told her?</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Tall, dark, and lethal...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trouble just walked into Nicholas Rixey's tattoo parlor. Becca Merritt is warm, sexy, wholesome — pure temptation to a very jaded Nick. He's left his military life behind to become co-owner of Hard Ink Tattoo, but Becca is his ex-commander's daughter. Loyalty won't let him turn her away. Lust has plenty to do with it too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With her brother presumed kidnapped, Becca needs Nick. She just wasn't expecting to want him so much. As their investigation turns into all-out war with an organized crime ring, only Nick can protect her. And only Becca can heal the scars no one else sees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Desire is the easy part. Love is as hard as it gets. Good thing Nick is always up for a challenge...</description>

  <description>“So I live my life according to the rules of others while my secret festers its way through my body. It bleeds slowly out of my heart and into my veins. Each word of my secret pulsing through me as it gets closer to the surface. I imagine one day it will get so close to the surface it will spring forth from my lips and reveal the monster I really am.” – Ruined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bailey Michaels is living a lie. She has a handsome and successful fiancé, a great job and a house in a town she adores. Her friends and family know her as the perfectly crafted individual she has created in their minds. Her deception knows no bounds when it comes to keeping the truth from everyone else. But it’s not enough. She craves the love of the one man she can’t possibly have – the only one who shares her secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite her angst over continuing her forbidden affair, nothing can keep her from Angel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His dark looks, chiseled jaw and broodiness make it impossible for her to ever deny him anything. So when presented with a choice, Bailey knows she finally has to make a decision. Keep living the lie with her fiancé, Carron, or finally be with Angel – the man who’s had her heart since she was fifteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The funny thing with life though; just when you think you’ve got it all figured out, fate has a way of stepping in and turning the best laid plans to ruins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;****&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A romance with a twist that you never see coming is an understatement! Shelly Pratt's imagination is astonishing and her story will leave you breathless." - Rhonda Dennis, The Green Bayou Novels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I loved it five star easy." – Kerri Williams, The Justice Moore Trilogy.</description>

  <description>She’s running from the law, and the law wants her &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opportunity was just too damn delicious for Ginger Peet to pass up. The purse full of money she finds—$50,000 to be exact—could give her and her teen sister the new start they need. So she grabs the cash, her gothy sibling, and their life-sized statue of Dolly Parton, and blows outta Nashville in a cloud of dust. &lt;em&gt;Chicago, here we come...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out, Chicago has some pretty hot cops. Hot, intense, naughty-lookin’ cops like Derek Tyler, who looks like he could eat a girl up and leave her begging for more. And &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. Tempting as he is, getting involved with the sexy homicide lieutenant next door poses a teensy problem for a gal who’s on the lam. But one thing is certain—Derek’s onto her, and he wants more than just a taste. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as far as he’s concerned, possession is nine-tenths of the law.</description>

  <description>Rock star drummer Bishop Riley doesn't have a drug problem. Celebrities—especially ones suffering from anxiety—just need a little help taking the edge off sometimes. After downing a few too many pills, Bishop wakes up in the hospital facing an intervention. If he wants to stay in the band, he’ll have to detox while under house arrest in Seldon, Alaska.　&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hockey player Penny Jones can't imagine a life outside of Seldon. Though she has tons of scholarship offers to all the best schools, the last thing she wants is to leave. Who'll take care of her absentminded gramps? Not her mother, who can’t even be bothered to come home from work, let alone deal with their new tenants next door. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Penny’s not interested in dealing with Bishop’s crappy attitude, and Bishop’s too busy sneaking pills to care. Until he starts hanging out with Gramps and begins to see what he’s been missing. If Bishop wants a chance with the fiery girl next door, he’ll have to admit he has a problem and kick it. Too bad addiction is hard to kick…and Bishop’s about to run out of time.</description>

  <description>“Is it any wonder I became a bank robber?” said Robin. &lt;br&gt;But she never dreamed she’d fall in love…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;15-year-old Robin McArthur thinks she has it all figured out when it comes to bilking her wealthy dad for guilt money as a substitute for his genuine affection. Until one day he suffers a stroke, and she learns the brutal truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’re broke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And everyone from bankers to bookies has come to collect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His only saving grace is what he reveals to Robin in between drools: He truly does love her, in spite of all his mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Panicked and desperate, Robin figures she has two choices. Either surrender to the pestering caseworker and live in a skanky foster home, or take a chance and sneak her dad out of the hospital to make a run for it. Little does she know that stealing a car and hitting the road means that before the day is through, she will rob her first bank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now an outlaw, Robin finds a backwoods trailer park to hide her dad from authorities. There, she encounters Creek, a local bad boy who also commits crimes to provide for their motley neighbors. Realizing she could use Creek’s help, Robin proposes an ingenious plan—they should team up to rob banks together. But when their partnership leads to a romance that turns Robin’s world upside down, she soon begins to discover that people are more precious than pocketbooks, and real love means opening your heart to the kinds of treasures money can’t buy…</description>

  <description>Riley Walker makes all the right decisions and knows exactly where her life is headed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley Walker does not make mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riley Walker certainly doesn’t make spontaneous decisions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But then Riley Walker gets dumped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spectacularly, gut-wrenching, stomp all over her heart dumped. And she is feeling more than a little angry. And a whole lot bitter. And suddenly the girl who has always done everything right feels like doing something completely wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garrett Bellows, lead guitarist for the local band, Generation Rejects, is going through life without a plan. Trying not to think past the next gig or the next party, he has worked hard to not become too attached to anyone or anything. So he is shocked to find himself drawn to the snarky girl with a chip on her shoulder. She pisses him off and puts him down. He knows she’s nothing more than a self-entitled college brat who thinks she’s better than the townie boy without a future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alcohol and a hefty dose of lust leads to a night both Riley and Garrett immediately regret. Her embarrassment, his pride and the weight of rumors and misconceptions convince Riley and Garrett that their one-time indiscretion will never be repeated. Particularly when their harshest critics are each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But how do you reconcile a head that wants to let go with a heart that keeps holding on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And what happens when your biggest regret begins to seem almost perfect?</description>

Now, a month away from turning eighteen and orphaned by the death of her grandparents; she knows exactly what she wants. All it takes is a spontaneous ski trip with her narcissistic roommate to Colorado, to make it a reality. When he happens to show up at a party in Aspen, Wilson becomes tangled in the powerful emotions of first love, sexual inexperience, and society’s principles. She lives a whirlwind weekend filled with newly discovered boundaries, calloused aches for a family she never had, and all the pressures of keeping their weekend together a secret.</description>

  <description>Coming off a break-up with his latest “friend with benefits”, the last thing Aidan Fitzgerald needs is a family hassle about his bachelor status. But after standing up as godfather for his great-nephew, Mason, that’s just what he gets at the Christening Party.  Escaping the wrath of his father and sisters, he wants nothing more than to get to the company Christmas party.  There he knows he can knock back a few stiff drinks and find some new no-strings-attached girl to take home for the night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Emma Harrison wants is to attend another party—least of all one at work. After throwing the annual life celebration (for the anniversary of her fiancée’s death) with close friends, she’s finally gotten the courage to take matters into her own hands and become a mother. Convincing her slightly inebriated best-friend, Connor, to be her sperm donor was a lot easier than she thought, and all that’s left now is to start the process.  But at her best friend and work colleague, Casey’s, insistence, she decides to make an appearance at the company Christmas party for her new boss’s sake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither Aidan nor Emma could imagine what fate had in store for them at the party.</description>

  <description>Thirty-five year-old Allison “Alli” Lancaster has it all—a fabulous job, a beautiful 15 year-old daughter, a hilarious BFF and a gorgeous house with a pool and Jacuzzi in an exclusive Las Vegas neighborhood.  What she doesn’t have is a husband, because she kicked her lousy, cheating ex to the curb nine months ago.  Since then, Alli has paid her dues with seemingly endless self-improvement and seemingly endless mourning.  Now she’s ready to move on and try new things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alli’s idea of “trying new things” is nothing like that devil-of-a-best-friend of hers.  Somehow, Sara, the devil of a best friend, talks Alli into trying out a sex toy, sleeping with a younger man and letting a stranger in a lab jacket put hot wax on a place that should never, ever, ever see wax.  And that’s only the beginning.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alli never saw her life going quite like this.   She also never thought she’d meet someone else who had the very real potential to change her life forever.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But she did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enter the new guy.  He’s gorgeous, refined and mature.  He’s also marriage material.  But that poses a problem for Alli, who renounced the institution of marriage when she renounced her ex.  What’s a girl to do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They say that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.  But what the heck happens when you can’t leave Vegas?  Well, you spin the wheel, of course.  You play the game and let the chips fall where they may.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alli just hopes she can find them all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*******&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caution!  Only read this book if you want to laugh and are not offended at adult themes and language.  This is not a Young Adult book.</description>

  <description>Tattooed bad boy James Bowen is about to marry the love of his life. Everything would be perfect if it wasn't for the tiny detail that his bride-to-be is freaking out big time. And trying to hide it from him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tate Cooper is losing it. She loves James with all her heart and wants to be married to him; it's the getting married that's killing her. Still grieving the loss of her father and brother,and totally overwhelmed by the wedding arrangements, she's in full emotional meltdown. But James deserves a happy bride, not a high-maintenance, sorrow-filled, guilt-stricken one, and, by God, she's going to give him that, even if she has to paste on a smile and fake it till she makes it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;James doesn't know whether to be amused or pissed. He understands she's running scared, but there is no way in hell he's going to allow this to continue; he's going to push her to confront her fears until she happily embraces their ever after.</description>

  <description>24-year old Pax Tate is an asshole.  &lt;br&gt;Seriously. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But he’s got his reasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesn’t understand why.  What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didn’t work.  His dad couldn’t overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldn’t keep up the impossible perfect façade. &lt;br&gt;So he slipped far, far from it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesn’t want to deal with.  If he pretends that the emptiness isn’t there, then it isn’t, right? &lt;br&gt;Wrong. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it’s never more apparent than when he meets Mila.  &lt;br&gt;Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart.  He doesn’t know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that he’s got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When memories of his mother’s death resurface from where he’s repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense.  Mila is the one…the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He knows that.  And he’s working on it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But is that enough to make her stay?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;How can you talk about something you can’t remember?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before the ski trip, sixteen-year-old Cassidy “Sid” Murphy was a cheerleader (at the bottom of the pyramid, but still...), a straight-A student, and a member of a solid trio of best friends. When she ends up on a ski lift next to handsome local college boy, Dax Windsor, she’s thrilled; but Dax takes everything from Sid—including a lock of her perfect red curls—and she can’t remember any of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Back home and unable to relate to her old friends, Sid drops her college prep classes and takes up residence in the A/V room with only Corey “The Living Stoner” Livingston for company. But as she gets to know Corey (slacker, baker, total dreamboat), Sid finds someone who truly makes her happy. Now, if she can just shake the nightmares and those few extra pounds, everything will be perfect... or so she thinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Witty and poignant, Colleen Clayton’s stunning debut is a story about moving on after the unthinkable happens.</description>

  <description>Previously homeschooled Camie Ramsey is being shoved into the shark-infested waters of public high school, where even helium filled, penguin bespeckled arm floaties likely won’t help keep her inexperienced, fifteen-year old head above water in that rip current of hormones and emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Camie’s worldly wisdom might be severely lacking (i.e., the closest she’s come to being kissed was sitting too close to the TV whilst Jake Ryan leaned in to give Samantha that fateful 16th birthday kiss), but she does understand her only hope for survival is if she’s thrown some kind of “social” life preserver before she sinks like a freaking rock. However, what will her fate be when she endeavors to flag down the only lifeguard on duty, the enormously popular and ridiculously beautiful Tristan Daniels? The most sought after and virtually most unattainable guy in school who not only makes Camie’s heart flatline on a recurring basis, he’s also the one guy who seemingly doesn’t know she exists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Feeling like an inept piece of chum that could ultimately be swallowed by Jaws, can Camie get Tristan to rescue her from floundering in the treacherous deep, or is she destined to be Shark Bait?&lt;br&gt;______________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author's Note:&lt;br&gt;While the tales themselves are fictional, some of the events and characters are very loosely based in reality and on my experiences—but don’t worry, the names of the characters, most of their unfortunate fashion sense and/or questionable taste in music has been changed to protect the not-so innocent. &lt;br&gt;______________________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to language and some adult content, this book may not be suitable for readers under the age of 16.</description>

      <![CDATA[I found this book to be extremely frustrating although it was pretty realistic. It was very slow reading, the inner monologue went on forever, the couples back and forth was exhausting.

  <description>Warning: This contains explicit sexual content, adult language and situation intended for MATURE readers only. If you haven’t experienced obliterating, complex-borderline-mental, transcendent kind of love—to the point of desperation—then this novel isn’t for you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will they survive the tsunami of trials heading their way? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;+ Bass Cole + Emma Anderson + Carter Mason +&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;expLosive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;scOrching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;graVitating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;intEnse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emma was beyond glad to escape back to Aspasia and be with Bass again. After a disastrous weekend spent in London—turned into twisted mess after Carter’s persistent, over-bearing and unfaltering dedication to get her back—it seemed that the soccer-stud, Carter Mason was finally standing ground and started to fight for the woman he loves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Emma found herself in a limbo when Bass started pressing for answers to questions she wasn’t ready to face herself. Little did she know that things were about to shift, testing her limits as she fights her way out of the clustered mess she got herself into. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bass Cole only wanted a several things from Emma: &lt;br&gt;Loyalty. Honesty. Trust. Love.&lt;br&gt;What happens if none of these apply?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emotions ran deep as revelations started to unfold—piece by piece. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear. Doubts. Secrets. Heartaches and the merry-go-round carnival of angst continue.</description>

  <description>Seventeen-year-old Grace grows up knowing she’s different, but she always attributed it to a mother who didn’t want her, a father who abandoned her, and a curse that sets her apart. Despite those struggles, her grandfather remained her rock and confidant. Her life irrevocably shatters the day her grandfather dies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day of his funeral sets off a chain of events, making Grace question everything she’s ever known to be true, and as a result, who she can truly trust. She inherits his house, part of his money, his Guardian and something that ties them together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just before Grace’s 18th birthday, she is thrust into a world she couldn’t fathom existed and does everything she can to thwart the destiny suddenly forced upon her. She’s been chosen for greatness, but at what cost? With eyes now open, she must choose to either be Chosen, or watch those around her suffer the consequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Torn between the man who’s come to protect her and the one sent to destroy her, she teeters on the edge of decision, trying to come to grips with who she is, what she wants and what all of that means for her, those she loves and the rest of mankind.</description>

  <description>Emmy thinks her boss Kyle Sterling of Sterling Corporations is a jerk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, she sleeps with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emmy tries to put the mistake behind her, but then finds herself snowed in with Kyle. As the snow builds, so does the heat in the house between the two. The problem is that Kyle has a steady girlfriend that he is unwilling to break up with. Emmy cuts Kyle off and starts dating Luke. Even as their relationship takes off, Emmy is finding Kyle hard to shake. He is blatant in his feelings and desires for Emmy, putting her in an awkward situation. She tries hard to resist Kyle, but deep down inside Emmy's motives are shady. When Emmy succumbs to her hidden feelings for Kyle without setting Luke free, devastating consequences ensue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to her two men, Emmy daydreams about doing violent things to her loud mouthed, opinionated mother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With some humor and sarcasm, and of course, some tequila, Emmy's world will flip upside down as she deals with the results of "accidentally on purpose" falling for two men at once.</description>

  <description>With his tight leather pants and a sharp edge that makes him dangerous, Jet Keller is every girl’s rock and roll fantasy. But Ayden Cross is done walking on the wild side with bad boys. She doesn’t want to give in to the heat she sees in Jet’s dark, haunted eyes. She’s afraid of getting burned from the sparks of their spontaneous combustion, even as his touch sets her on fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jet can’t resist the Southern Belle with mile-long legs in cowboy boots who defies his every expectation. Yet the closer he feels to Ayden, the less he seems to know her. While he’s tempted to get under her skin and undo her in every way, he knows firsthand what happens to two people with very different ideas about relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will the blaze burn into an enduring love. . . or will it consume their dreams and turn them to ashes?</description>

  <description>What if with one choice you could change your whole life in a matter of seconds?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aston Boyd has always put everything into her work. She has never needed anyone in her life and has survived on her own since she was 18, never looking back. When she gets her dream promotion and becomes the new editor at one of the biggest publishing houses in Arizona, she thinks she has finally figured it all out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, when Aston receives an invitation to her first love's wedding, she starts to re-evaluate just how much she has given up for her career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a mission in mind to try and win back the one she let go, she never took in to consideration that what she might need, or even want, could be right in front of her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will she be willing to put her heart out there to get back the life she could have had, or will she try for something new?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sloan Holden is the quintessential bad boy trying to cover all that up with his good boy act. He has spent the last 9 years trying to prove to his over bearing father that he can change his ways, and one day run his publishing house. The only thing standing in his way is the slew of fast women and his wild lifestyle, which he just can't seem to give up. He doesn't do relationships and always vowed to stay single forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot can change when the one person you thought you would never fall for worms their way into your heart, but will the feelings be returned?</description>

  <description>Luke Price's life has always been about order, control, and acting tough on the outside. For Luke, meaningless relationships are a distraction-a way to tune out the twisted memories of his childhood. He desperately wishes he could forget his past, but it haunts him no matter what he does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Violet Hayes has had a rough life. When she was young, she was left with no family and the memory of her parents' unsolved murders. She grew up in foster homes, living with irresponsible parents, drugs, and neglect, and trying to fight the painful memories of the night her parents were taken from her. But it's hard to forget when she never got closure-and she can't stop dreaming about what happened that tragic night. To make it through life, she keeps her distance from everyone and never allows herself to feel anything.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then Violet meets Luke. The two clash instantly, yet they can't seem to stay away from each other. Although they fight it, they both start to open up and feel things they've never felt before. They discover just how similar they are. But they also discover something else: The past always catches up with you . . .</description>

  <description>Hope didn't have the best role model when it came to relationships. She’s content with her current no-strings-attached extracurricular activity with the lead singer of her band. She’s never believed in love and commitment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mason starts his eighth school in five years anticipating nothing more than the usual—boring classes, fighting more than making friends, and girls happily willing to succumb to his easy smile. He’s never put much stock into love at first sight—until he sees her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of their painful pasts, Hope and Mason discover that sometimes never can become forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This is a mature young adult. Recommended for 17+ due to sensitive subject material, harsh language, and sexual situations.</description>

  <description>Grace Burke doesn’t need a thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She enjoys her quiet life in Fall Rivers, Colorado—running a bookstore and coffee shop with her cousin, Kate. The two have a successful business, a small circle of friends, and each other. What more could she want?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the Anderson brothers move into the house across the street, it doesn’t take long for her to realize exactly what she’s been missing. At first sight, the youngest brother, Michael, captures Grace’s heart, and her quiet life is disrupted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then it turns upside down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grace isn’t the only one with eyes for Michael. Nina Sandler, one of Michael’s clients, threatens to come between them. When Nina can’t get Michael’s attention, she focuses on Grace—in a very dangerous way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But love is never easy and if the best things in life are worth fighting for, then Grace must find the courage to fight. Not just for love and happiness but for her very life.</description>

  <description>After Noel Falcon professed his love to the one girl who truly holds his heart in the palm of her hand, he decides to try his damndest to keep Lane Vance in his life forever this time. There’s no way he’ll let her slip through his fingers again without a fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The instant they are together Noel begins to plot a way to ask his headstrong lady-love to be his wife, but every attempt to pop the question is foiled by a string of mishaps that prevents him from the perfect moment to get the job done before he goes back on tour with Black Falcon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distance is a bigger challenge than Noel expects, and the one-eyed beast of jealous raises its ugly head when Lane takes on a job working on an ad campaign for Embrace the Darkness. With Striker—a man that’s made it clear in the past he’s very interested in more then her business sense—lurking around her constantly, Noel wants to claim Lane now, more than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ROCK THE BAND is a 27,000 word novella from the Black Falcon Series</description>

  <description>A New Adult Contemporary Romance&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After finishing design school six months ago, Erin Angelo left her tragic past behind in the States and started a new life in Milan, Italy. Burying the grief, silencing her demons, and living a life without any real attachments has worked well for her so far. But when Erin secures her first real job as a budding clothing designer, her controlled world is shaken to its core by the mysteriously sexy director of the local symphony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alek Dostov is a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. He’s successful, hot, the son of a millionaire, and women all over the world flock to see one of his performances. For Alek, Erin represents the ultimate challenge: sexy, smart, and unaffected by his charms…or so she thinks. Just like Erin, Alek avoids attachments that leave him emotionally vulnerable. But unlike Erin, his pursuit of all things pleasurable is ruthless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing how wary they both are concerning any kind of committed relationship, Alek finds a way to pursue Erin, satisfying the intense attraction between them without sacrificing the freedom they both enjoy. Sometimes the deepest passion brings out the darkest emotions. And Erin finds herself completely unprepared for the forbidden world of the young maestro and his truths and even his secrets, as she struggles to deal with her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Music, passion, betrayal and forbidden love spun together in one of the most romantic cities in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This novel contains sexual situations and mature language. It is intended for an audience at 17+ years of age.</description>

  <description>Patricia Grace Kincaid is haunted by her past and no matter what she does, the ghosts won’t stay away. A childhood incident nearly ruined her life. A mistake that she made two years ago ripped her to shreds. She isn’t the same feisty, fearless bitch she used to be… or is she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What will happen when the person she screwed over storms back into her life? She freaks. Is it for the reason she’s always hoped for… that Tony Lopez, the breathtakingly sexy Latino love of her life, has finally decided to forgive her? Hell no. Will he demand her complete submission? Yes. Will he make her life hell? Double yes. Will she, in return, torture him? Hell-to-the-yes. Will her past come back to haunt her? Absolutely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author’s warning: Including, but not limited to: a deep, dark childhood, lots and lots of cussing (as in, A LOT), a ton of fighting, maybe hair pulling, a bitch with a vulnerable side, and last, but not least, über possessive, over obsessive, crazy hot alpha males on the verge of needing therapy… and maybe a tear or two.</description>

But Aidan isn’t going down without a fight—especially not until Emma lets him reveal the secret of his past that caused him to be so commitment phobic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But fate intervenes when premature labor forces Emma on strict bed rest for two weeks. Aidan steps forward with a shocking proposal. To prove his love and commitment for her and their unborn son, he will take a leave of absence from work to care for her around the clock. Vowing to guard her heart, Emma reluctantly agrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While she is touched by Aidan’s attentiveness and tender loving care, Emma is thrown for a loop by the amorous attentions of ER doctor, Alpesh “Pesh” Nadeen. Pesh is everything Emma could ever want—successful, stable, and ready to settle down and be a husband and father. Pesh wants nothing more than to win Emma’s heart, but she is not sure she’s able to give it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her heart may still belong to the very man who broke it—the one who is so desperately trying to win her back.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Falling in love isn't always easy or pleasant. The intense and angst-filled story of Emma and Scott is a painful, gut-wrenching and exhausting portrayal of how hard it can be to let go...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Picking up the pieces and starting again in the US, Emma enrols in college with her cousin, Ashley. She is finally free to do what she wants and live how she chooses, and no man will ever rule her decisions or emotions again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until Scott Mason walks on stage...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Intense bad boy Scott is the lead singer of a popular local rock band. A ladies’ man and Ashley's long-time friend, Scott holds an instant fascination for Emma — she finds herself drawn to him, even though he represents everything she hates and needs to stay away from in a guy. He treats females like he does a cigarette — light it, use it, and lose it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For her cousin's sake, Emma makes an effort to get along with Scott, but she soon discovers that there is more to him than first appears, making him even more dangerous in her eyes. Behind the façade of friendship, jealousy, obsession, fear and insecurity fester — an internal battle rages as she fights her attraction and does everything she can to stop history from repeating itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing she knows for sure is that if she breaks her rule, it may destroy her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Contains mature content — recommended age 17+.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>When Lauren Monroe first laid eyes on Michael Delaney back in high school, she had every reason to stay away from him; within minutes of their first encounter, his volatile actions confirmed his notorious reputation. But Lauren saw something in him that caused her to question his bad-boy persona, and against her better judgment, she took a chance. She had no way of knowing that the unlikely friendship they formed would become so important to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Or that it would end so painfully.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight years later, when Lauren begins her new job at Learn and Grow Day Care, Michael is the last person she expects to see. Refusing to revisit the hurt and confusion of their past, Lauren vows to keep her distance from him. But staying away from Michael proves to be more difficult than she thought, despite her lingering grief and her instincts for self-preservation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lauren and Michael recall the friendship that changed them forever and the events that tore them apart, will they finally be able to heal? Or will the ghosts of Michael’s  past prove to be too much to overcome?</description>

  <description>When reserved flight attendant Bianca gets one look at billionaire hotel owner James Cavendish, she loses all of her hard-won composure. For a girl who can easily juggle a tray of champagne flutes at 35,000 feet in three inch heels, she finds herself shockingly weak-kneed from their first encounter. The normally unruffled Bianca can't seem to look away from his electrifying turquoise gaze. They hold a challenge, and a promise, that she finds impossible to resist, and she is a girl who is used to saying no and meaning it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bianca is accustomed to dealing with supermodels and movie stars in her job as a first class flight attendant, but James Cavendish puts them all to shame in the looks department. If only it were just his looks that she found so irresistible about the intimidating man, Bianca could have ignored his attentions. But what tempts her like never before is the dominant pull he seems to have over her from the moment they meet, and the promise of pleasure, and pain, that she reads in his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is intended for ages 18 and up.</description>

  <description>Dana is definitely not the kind of girl to be living in the dump of a wilderness lodge she finds herself waitressing in. But when Craig, the sexy cop who’s handling the murder case where she’s a witness, suggests it—it seems like a good idea. Now she’s got no BMW, no shopping and an assortment of hairy Alaskan men who definitely belong in a run-down old lodge. Her exciting visits from Craig are getting less exciting, and the lodge owner, Jason, is quickly moving from grouchy and judgmental, to funny, smart and unexpectedly complex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason knows exactly the type of girl Dana is—beautiful, spoiled, and high maintenance. She’s everything that hurt him in the past, and why he now lives as far away from city life as he can manage. If he wasn’t so hard-up for help, he would have never said yes to his friend, Craig. Despite his reservations, Dana becomes the perfect antidote to everything in his life—both his disaster of a divorce and precocious little sister who shows up on his doorstep. Jason realizes he’s falling for Dana too late to stop it, or even slow it down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the trial approaches, Dana knows it’s time to move on with her life—but is her life back in the city she left or with a guy she never meant to fall for?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(NEW ADULT)</description>

I love this series and each and every character in Sea Breeze, Alabama.  On the flip side, this book just didn’t wow me like all the others. Still that Cage York is pretty fantastic!  <br /><br /><img src="https://sphotos-b-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/p480x480/1234789_10201029627995568_1602451344_n.jpg" width="420" height="375" alt="description" class="escapedImg" /><br /><br />There were a few typos, the price was high and th...]]>

  <description>Warning: This is not a virtuous and tender love story. It’s chaotic, ruthless, and tragic. This story takes love and kills its innocence, steals away the pure moments, and crushes the hearts of the broken. A story born in childhood, tying one girl to one boy, leads to a destructive path—that hurts more than it doesn’t, that shatters more than it heals—testing the love that binds the two through a lifetime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tegen Matthews is the daughter of Dorothy Kelley, a club whore in the Hell’s Horsemen. A plain little girl, Tegen falls into the gritty world of the motorcycle club. When she meets a sweet, caring boy, she embraces the warmth and affection he shows her. Cage West is the son of the president of the Hell’s Horsemen. Tall and blond with deep brown eyes, as he grows up Cage realizes the power of his dimpled smile and smooth drawl. With one chance encounter, Tegen becomes forever tied to Cage. Following is a wayward journey that is filled with regrets, mistakes, and heartache, pulling at the threads that hold them together. Cage and Tegen fight hard but love harder, and in the end, what matters is where the journey takes one girl and one boy, who have been twined with one another since the beginning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is Tegen and Cage’s story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Love doesn’t erase a broken heart, and it sure doesn’t change people. But no matter how old, how flimsy, how frayed the rope of love is, it keeps you tethered to the people you love.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;If he had been with me everything would have been different...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wasn't with Finn on that August night. But I should've been. It was raining, of course. And he and Sylvie were arguing as he drove down the slick road. No one ever says what they were arguing about. Other people think it's not important. They do not know there is another story. The story that lurks between the facts. What they do not know—the cause of the argument—is crucial.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So let me tell you...</description>

  <description>Alyssa Boyd had big plans.  Big plans that included getting the hell out of the little town she’d grown up in with her two best friends. When she decided it was time to let one of them know her true feelings for him; a change of plans resulted in a tragic turn of events.  Now, Alyssa is left alone to find her way out of the darkness that an untimely death has left in its wake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jesse Vaughn was never good at letting people in.  He’d learned a long time ago that it’s easier that way because people leave, or, unfortunately, die.  The one person he wanted to let in doesn’t want him anymore. The only problem is he can’t stop thinking about her.  Jesse returns to the childhood home he left behind with one goal in mind… to convince her that they should be together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Jesse finds Alyssa she’s not the same girl he left behind.  She’s wild, reckless and hell-bent on not giving Jesse a second chance.  Lucky for Jesse, his stubborn streak has always been a mile-wide and he’s not about to give up on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When your life has been shattered can you really pick up all the pieces and move on?</description>

  <description>Cami Wimberley has a plan, and that plan includes no room for boys—especially the big time party animal, Hunter Wilder, no matter how handsome and charismatic he is. She’s beautiful, a senior, extremely talented, gets good grades, and is working her way toward her dream college to be a musical theater major. Everything is perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter Wilder does not want a girlfriend—that would complicate his life way too much right now. He especially doesn’t want this girl, Miss-Goody-Two-Shoes, so how come he can’t keep his eyes off her? He tries to keep her at arms length, but fate seems to keep pushing them together. Before long, it’s obvious to everyone they’re crushing on each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As sparks begin to fly, Hunter finds himself sinking deeper and deeper into hot water.

  <description>Emotionally crippled Liz isn’t looking for a relationship when she meets delish boy-next-door, Cohen. He’s a few years younger, a volunteer firefighter, oh…and a virgin, making him totally off limits. But never one to back away from a challenge, she’s drawn to him even while she continues to satisfy her physical needs elsewhere. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as she spends her evenings in another man’s arms, she somehow finds herself curled up in Cohen’s bed each night. It’s been a long time since she had a true honest-to-goodness make out session, but Cohen’s showing her just how much fun not having sex can be.&lt;br&gt;When Cohen’s injured, her real feelings for him rise to the surface, and she has to decide if she’s willing to take a risk on love after enduring so much heartbreak in her past. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAKE ME YOURS is the sexy conclusion to UNRAVEL ME. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashlyn and “Logan” from UNRAVEL ME also make a few, um *appearances* …ahem.</description>

  <description>Sick of being the only virgin among her friends, Bliss Edwards decides the best way to deal with the problem is to lose it as quickly and simply as possible - a one-night stand. But her plan turns out to be anything but simple when she freaks out and leaves a gorgeous guy alone and naked in her bed with an excuse that no one with half-a-brain would ever believe. And as if that weren't embarrassing enough, when she arrives for her first class of her last college semester, she recognizes her new theatre professor. She'd left him naked in her bed about 8 hours earlier.</description>

  <description>Sienna Jensen had no plans to return home when she graduated college last spring—after all, her dreams lie in California. But when she discovers her grandmother’s Nashville home has been foreclosed, and the new owner has started the eviction process, Sienna has no other choice but go back to Music City. And she comes face to face with the flawed, gorgeous man she never thought she’d see again. The man who now holds the deed to her grandma’s estate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When millionaire rock star Lucas Wolfe finds the outspoken redhead glaring at him from across a courtroom, he’s both infuriated and intrigued. He still can't get the night Sienna almost spent with him out of his mind, and the chemistry between them is as undeniable as it was two years ago. He craves Sienna more than ever. And just like everything Lucas hungers for, he’s determined to have her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, Lucas will do whatever it takes to lure Sienna into his bed, even if that means making a deal with her: ten days with him, playing by his rules, and he’ll hand over the deed to her grandmother’s home. Though she agrees to the arrangement, Sienna is conflicted. Because of her duty to her family. Because of promises she’s made to herself and a past that still haunts her. And as Lucas’s game of seduction continues, and Sienna is introduced to his dark, erotic world and even darker background, she realizes that at any moment, she could be devoured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;*This novel contains adult situations and content*&lt;/strong&gt;

  <description>The second part in The Blackstone Affair series! Looming danger. A love worth fighting for. A man who’ll go all in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethan Blackstone has a problem on his hands. He’s broken Brynne’s trust and she’s left him. He’s unwilling to live without her and isn’t giving up—he’s dead-set on getting his beautiful American girl back. The passion between them was explosive, but the secrets they hid from each other are dark and chilling and are powerful enough to destroy their shot at a life together. With political threats now directed at Brynne, Ethan is running out of time and he’ll need to gather all his strength and agility to protect her from the dangers that could take her away from him forever. Will Ethan be able to save Brynne from a past that keeps her locked in fear? Will he ever feel the warmth of her touch, the solidity of her trust again? This is a love-struck man who is willing to do whatever it takes to possess the heart of the woman he loves. He’ll go to any lengths to protect her. He’ll go all in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is the fiery story of what happens when two people surrender to a love so great it can heal the scars of the past and give way to a life of pure, rapturous ecstasy.</description>

  <description>The scorching tale of one girl, two brothers and a love triangle…that’s not. Olivia Townsend is nothing special. She’s just a girl working her way through college so she can return home to help her father run his business. She’s determined not to be the second woman in his life to abandon him, even if it means putting her own life on hold. To Olivia, it’s clear what she must do. Plain and simple. Black and white. But clear becomes complicated when she meets Cash and Nash Davenport. They’re brothers. Twins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cash is everything she’s always wanted in a guy. He’s a dangerous, sexy bad boy who wants her in his bed at any cost. He turns her insides to mush and, with just one kiss, makes her forget why he’s no good for her. Nash is everything she’s ever needed in a guy. He’s successful, responsible and intensely passionate. But he’s taken. Very taken, by none other than Marissa, Liv’s rich, beautiful cousin. That doesn’t stop Olivia from melting every time he looks at her, though. With just one touch, he makes her forget why they can never be together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Black and white turns to shades of gray when Olivia discovers the boys are hiding something, something that should make her run as far and as fast as she can. But it’s too late to run. Olivia’s already involved. And in love. With both of them. Both brothers make her heart tremble. Both brothers set her body on fire. She wants them both. And they want her. How will she ever choose between them?</description>

  <description>Two secrets. One bet. Who will break first?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor Caldwell can't decide if she wants to kiss her new college roommate or punch him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the one hand, Hunter Zaccadelli is a handsome blue-eyed bundle of charm. On the other, he's a tattooed, guitar-playing bad boy. Maybe that's why Taylor's afraid of falling in love with him, or anyone else. She doesn't want to get burned, so she needs him gone before it's too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hunter himself has been burned before, but Taylor's sexy laugh and refusal to let him get away with anything make her irresistible. Determined not to be kicked out of her life without a fight, Hunter proposes a bet: if she can convince him she either truly loves or hates him, he'll leave the apartment;and leave her alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the man behind Taylor's fear of giving up her heart resurfaces, she has to decide: trust Hunter with her greatest secret, or do everything in her power to win that bet and drive him away forever.</description>

  <description>Chad Gamble, all-star pitcher for the Nationals, is one of the best players on—and off—the field. And right now, the notorious bad boy wants Bridget Rodgers. But with her lush curves and snappy comebacks, the feisty redhead is the kind of woman a man wants to settle down with…and that’s the last thing Chad needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the paparazzi catch them in a compromising position, Chad’s manager issues an ultimatum: clean up his act or kiss his multi-million dollar contract goodbye. To save his career, his meddling publicist says he'll have to convince everyone Bridget isn’t just his flavor of the week, but his girlfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being blackmailed into a fake relationship with Chad Gamble isn’t easy, especially when the sizzling physical attraction between them is undeniable. With a month to go on their arranged pretense, it's going to take every ounce of willpower they have not to fall into bed together...or in love.</description>

  <description>From the bestselling author of Pulled and Take This Regret comes a gripping new tale of loss and love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;William has spent six years running from his past and the last eight months trying to rid his mind of the dreams that increasingly haunt his nights. Trapped in a world of false ambitions and feigned affections, William knows he’s reached a breaking point and something’s going to give.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggie had lived her entire life without hope until one man showed her what it meant to be loved. He’d been her light in a lifetime of darkness. Six years ago, that darkness stole him away. Without him, she’s surrendered herself to an existence she doesn’t know how to escape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the family William left behind is struck by tragedy, he is called back to the one place he’s sworn to never return to again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a moment that will change his life forever, William comes face to face with the girl who, with one look, captured his heart. He is unable to ignore the buried desires and the hope for the future they’d once believed they’d have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now William is ready to fight to take back what had been stolen from him six years before.&lt;br&gt;But he never imagined what that fight might cost him.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A.L. Jackson gives you an intimate look into the lives of a family bound by an unseen connection in this new contemporary romance.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;First in a stunning new trilogy by &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Teresa Mummert.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;“I’m not naive. I know I don’t get the happily ever after. My knight in shining armor took the highway detour around this god forsaken shit hole. I’ve made peace with that. That doesn’t mean I’m going to lay down like a doormat and let every cocky prick in the trailer park have his way with me.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cass lives a depressing life in a small trailer park in Eddington, Georgia, with her mother and abusive boyfriend Jackson. She works hard to barely make ends meet. But everything changes when Tucker White, the lead singer in the band Damaged, walks into her diner. He tries to show her that there is more to life than the hand she has been dealt, but Cass soon learns that being with Tucker will come at a high price.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>Aside from her dad, who passed away when she was six, Cassidy Jameson has only ever trusted one man: her best friend, Tyler. So of course she follows him to Texas when he leaves for college. She just didn't expect to be so drawn to their new roommate, Gage, a gorgeous guy with a husky Southern drawl. The only problem? He's Tyler's cousin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gage Carson was excited to share an apartment off campus with his cousin. He didn't mind that Tyler was bringing the mysterious friend he'd heard about since they were kids ... until the most beautiful girl he's ever seen jumps out of his cousin's Jeep. There's something about Cassi that makes Gage want to give her everything. Too bad Tyler has warned him that she's strictly off-limits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite everything keeping them apart, Cassi and Gage dance dangerously close to the touch they're both been craving. But when disaster sends her running into Tyler's arms, Cassi will have to decide whether to face the demons of her past ... or to burn her chance at a future with Gage.</description>

  <description>BDSM erotica writer Tiffany Reisz fractures the famous Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale in this sexy short story, a free prequel to THE SIREN (Mira Books, August 2012).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mistress Nora needs a vacation. She might be the one flogging the clients, but Kingsley, her sexy French boss, is the real sadist who rarely gives her a day off. They strike a backseat deal: Nora gets one month off and a trip to Europe if she can sneak into a rival BDSM club and get the dirt on the owner. But she’ll need more than her little red riding crop when she comes face to face with Brad Wolfe, the one man who stands between her and freedom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only readers 18 and older please.</description>

  <description>After the death of her parents, Robbie Byrne is put in foster care where she meets her exact opposite, Luc Cintrone. Abandoned as a small child, Luc is a foul-mouthed rebel who takes it upon himself to be her defender, whether she likes it or not. As they grow up, they fumble through their different roles in each other's lives—family, confidants and then, ultimately, lovers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as the couple is settling into their newfound relationship, they encounter a beautiful lawyer, Payten, who is immediately taken by Luc's rough edges. But he denies her, making him absolutely irresistible in her eyes. Payten is a woman who has grown accustomed in her privileged life in obtaining whatever she wants, no matter the cost or sacrifice. And she is fairly confident Luc will eventually see things her way…one way or another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trigger Warning: Cheating hero&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>After making a bad decision when she was very young, Kia Clementine finds herself in hell. Then, suddenly, within the time it takes for a shotgun to blast, her hell changes. Completely. Then out-of-the-blue she sees Sampson Cooper, her celebrity crush. A man the whole world knows is decent. A man the world knows is loyal. A man the world knows is good. All of these very unlike her now dead husband.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He’s sitting at a table right next to hers. And she catches his eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Terrified of the interest Sam shows in her, Kia finds the courage to go out with him. Not long after, she shares her dark secrets and Sam shares that he’ll stop at nothing to gain her trust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sam leads Kia to heaven, Kia realizes that Sam is living his own hell. But although he gives her beauty and she gives him everything, he withholds his trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even with all the beauty Sam shows her, Kia wants it all. But Sam forces Kia to make a heartbreaking decision and only she can decide. It’s all or nothing.</description>

  <description>Wickedly sexy James Bowen is a bad boy of the highest order -- tattoos and attitude included -- which unfortunately ranks way up on Tate's not-a-chance-in-hell list, right there along with skydiving naked over Teheran and juggling Ebola vials just for kicks. But what the heck, she's on holiday, the guy is absolutely irresistible, and she needs to unplug from her life. With her dad and brother gone, Tate is left to deal with the family restaurant, which is fast going down the drain. Her employees are acting out, her boyfriend has bailed out, and her very own private stalker is emailing her to death with lovely threats of doom, fire, and dismemberment. So yeah, maybe a little holiday fling is in order. Strictly sex though, and no follow-up whatsoever once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She hadn't counted on her take-charge holiday fling having an opinion of his own and stubbornly sticking around, before &lt;em&gt;and after&lt;/em&gt; the sex, making himself at home in her life. There is definitely more to James than meets her prejudiced eye, and even if she's not ready to look deeper, James isn't prepared to permit her not to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content and graphic language.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>"His music moves the world. Can his love move her heart? "&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nick Blackthorne knows all about words of love. They're the reason he's the world's biggest rock star. The irony? He turned his back on love a long time ago, lured away by the trappings of fame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An invitation to a friend s wedding is a stark reminder of how meaningless his life has become. When he enters that church, there'ss only one woman he wants on his arm the one he walked out on a lifetime ago. But first he has to find her, even if all she accepts from him is an apology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kindergarten teacher Lauren Robbins once had what every woman on the planet desires. Nick. Their passion was explosive, their romance the stuff of songs and it took fifteen years to get over him. Then out of the blue Nick turns up at her door, and all those years denying her ache for him are shattered with a single, smoldering kiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But molten passion can't hide the secret she's kept for all these years. Because it's not just "her" heart on the line anymore and not just her life that'll be rocked by the revelation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Remember your first crush on a rock star? Now add smoldering sex, a raw and undeniable passion, soul-shattering orgasms. And secrets.</description>

  <description>In my debut novel, Breathe, Sadie may have fallen in love with the teen rock star, Jax Stone, but readers fell head over heels for Marcus Hardy. This is his story…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcus Hardy had hoped to enjoy a year away at college while he put the summer he’d rather forget behind him. But instead, he’s jerked right back to the coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama due to a family crisis. His dear ol' dad found himself a girlfriend only a few years older than Marcus. So now his sister needs help dealing with their mother who is mentally falling apart. The only bright spot to returning is the fascinating red head who sleeps over several times a week. The problem is she's sleeping in bed with his new roommate, Cage York. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Willow “Low” Foster needs a place to live. Running to Cage’s apartment every time her sister kicks her out isn’t exactly a long term solution. Juggling her courses at the local community college and a part time job doesn’t produce excess income. But Cage has a new roommate and suddenly sleeping over at her best friend’s apartment isn’t such a bad thing. Not when she gets to see those sexy green eyes of Marcus Hardy’s twinkle when he smiles at her like he wants her there. &lt;br&gt;Even though Cage seems a little territorial where Low is concerned, Marcus finds time to spend with Low without upsetting his roommate. Cage may use his small college baseball star persona to sleep with every hot female in his path but he’s still under the disillusion that when he’s through sowing his wild oats, he’s going to marry Low. Marcus intends to change that assumption for both Cage and Low. Until his carefully laid plans come crashing down with a revelation he never expected. He’ll have to choose between Low or his family. Because once the truth comes out.... there’s no other choice.</description>

  <description>Anya Gage has learned that to get anything good in life, you have to work for it. She has no expectations, no dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then she finds herself at a party where she doesn’t want to be and she meets Knight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight Sebring knows who he is, what he wants and what he likes. And he gets it. But he never expected something as sweet as Anya Gage to wander into his bedroom during a party he did not expect to be having to borrow his phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight tries to leave Anya to the life she deserves of white picket fences and a man who watches football on Sundays – good, normal and clean. But when Anya comes to his nightclub and finds herself in a situation, he knows someone has to look after her, he can’t fight it anymore and he decides that man will be him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knight teaches Anya that, just as with the bad, in life you should also expect the good. And he teaches her this by giving it to her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Knight has a dark past and just as he desires Anya for exactly who she is, he fears when she finds out exactly the man he has become and always intends to be, she’ll leave him for good, normal and clean.</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;With THE LOOK OF LOVE, bestselling author Bella Andre introduces you the Sullivan family. In this fun and emotional contemporary romance series, when a Sullivan bad boy falls...he falls hard. And it's forever.    &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chloe Peterson is having a bad night. A really bad night. The large bruise on her cheek can attest to that. And when her car skids off the side of a wet country road straight into a ditch, she’s convinced even the gorgeous guy who rescues her in the middle of the rain storm must be too good to be true. Or is he?    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a successful photographer who frequently travels around the world, Chase Sullivan has his pick of beautiful women, and whenever he’s home in San Francisco, one of his seven siblings is usually up for causing a little fun trouble. Chase thinks his life is great just as it is—until the night he finds Chloe and her totaled car on the side of the road in Napa Valley. Not only has he never met anyone so lovely, both inside and out, but he quickly realizes she has much bigger problems than her damaged car. Soon, he is willing to move mountains to love—and protect—her, but will she let him?   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chloe vows never to make the mistake of trusting a man again. Only, with every loving look Chase gives her—and every sinfully sweet caress—as the attraction between them sparks and sizzles, she can’t help but wonder if she’s met the only exception. And although Chase didn’t realize his life was going to change forever in an instant, amazingly, he isn’t the least bit interested in fighting that change. Instead, he’s gearing up for a different fight altogether…for Chloe’s heart.</description>

  <description>Nina Sheridan’s on a timeout adventure in the Colorado Mountains. She needs distance from her clueless fiancé, distance to decide whether she wants to spend the rest of her life with a man who doesn’t care enough to learn how she takes her coffee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arriving in a blinding snowstorm at the A-Frame she rented, she comes face to face with the most amazing man she’s ever seen. Minutes later, when he kicks her out of his house, she goes head to head with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond angry because she’s flown half a world away to start her timeout adventure, not to mention her sinuses hurt, she heads back down the mountain and ends up in a ditch. Unable to extricate herself, she gives up, hopes for rescue and falls asleep in the backseat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next morning she wakes up in the amazing man’s bed and she’s sick as a dog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Holden Maxwell spends days nursing her back to health and then he spends the next two weeks trying to convince her to take her Colorado adventure further, in other words, make it permanent and take a gamble on him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nina has a tough time fighting her attraction to Max, especially when it seems all Max’s friends, her mother and stepdad and the whole town want them together and both she and Max get embroiled in the murder of Max’s ex-friend and the town of Gnaw Bone’s most detested resident – a man everyone has motive to kill, especially Max.</description>

  <description>There is no rehearsal for true love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When A-list film actor Ryan Christensen ducked into her pub to escape his screaming fans, never in a million years did Taryn Mitchell think her life was about to change forever. But now, eight months later, after a whirlwind romance, Taryn wakes up in Ryan’s Hollywood hotel room to find a diamond to die for on her left ring finger—and her face splashed across the cover of every gossip magazine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ryan’s very public proposal is catnip to the tabloids, his management team is worried, and Taryn must figure out how a small town girl like her fits into his glittering world. What does it take to make a relationship work amidst telephoto lenses, daily on-set temptations, and jealous fans who will stop at nothing to keep you from walking down the aisle with the man of your dreams?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With no script to follow and no chance for a dress rehearsal, Taryn and Ryan will be forced to take the plunge and risk everything to make their love last.</description>

  <description>Courtesy of watching his mom’s relationships, Sebastian Hawkins knows what girls need to do to get a guy. He has what he considers a PHD in hooking up. When he needs extra cash for a car, Sebastian starts up an online venture as The Hook-up Doctor, to anonymously help girls land the guy of their dreams. Of course, his services don’t offer a happily-ever-after guarantee. He’s seen firsthand getting together never means staying together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then he falls in love… &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the last girl he would expect…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Totally not in his game plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suddenly, Sebastian finds himself muddled in the game he’s always prided himself on. He can’t even pick up girls at parties anymore! Why would anyone want to be in love when it turns you into a stuttering, screwed-up, mess with really lame stalker tendencies? Stalking? Totally not his gig. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Hook-up Doctor won’t let himself go down easily. He’s always known how to give a girl what she wants and now it’s time to figure out what a boy wants… and he definitely plans on getting it.</description>

  <description>All his life Tate McCullom has been taught to be responsible, and he is the very model of what a respectable man should be. Until the night he gets drunk and sleeps with a woman he barely knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, six weeks later, she's pregnant, alone, and broke. Once again, Tate must take responsibility for his actions, and makes plans to marry his child's mother. There's only one problem...he has to tell his fiancée.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abby Grayson hasn't had an easy life. As the daughter of the town whore, people either avoid her or think she's like her mother. For Abby, it's a struggle just to fill her belly and keep a roof over her head.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Loneliness and a secret yearning for this man she thought she'd never have led her to spend the night with Tate. But the last thing she needs is a baby when she can barely take care of herself. Desperate, but too proud to ask for help, she finally agrees to accept a job from Tate - the job of being his wife. Now she has almost everything she's ever dreamed of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, only one thing will gain her Tate's love - his realization that the night he spent with her was no drunken accident. It was a last-ditch attempt to win the woman he really wanted.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/em&gt;BESTSELLER&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sure, opposites attract, but in this sexy, smart, eBook original romance from RITA finalist &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author &lt;/strong&gt;Ruthie Knox, they positively combust! When a buttoned-up banker falls for a bad girl, “about last night” is just the beginning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cath Talarico knows a mistake when she makes it, and God knows she’s made her share. So many, in fact, that this Chicago girl knows London is her last, best shot at starting over. But bad habits are hard to break, and soon Cath finds herself back where she has vowed never to go . . . in the bed of a man who is all kinds of wrong: too rich, too classy, too uptight for a free-spirited troublemaker like her.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nev Chamberlain feels trapped and miserable in his family’s banking empire. But beneath his pinstripes is an artist and bohemian struggling to break free and lose control. Mary Catherine—even her name turns him on—with her tattoos, her secrets, and her gamine, sex-starved body, unleashes all kinds of fantasies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;When blue blood mixes with bad blood, can a couple that is definitely wrong for each other ever be perfectly right? And with a little luck and a lot of love, can they make last night last a lifetime?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Includes a special message from the editor, as well as excerpts from these Loveswept titles: &lt;em&gt;Because of You, Ride with Me, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Midnight Hour&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;</description>

  <description>Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old. No matter what ingenious schemes Indy used to capture his attention, Lee never showed an interest and Indy finally gave up. Now Indy's employee, Rosie, has lost a bag of diamonds and bad guys are shooting at him. When Indy gets involved, Lee is forced to help. Complicating matters, Lee has decided he's interested, Indy's decided she's not. But she can't seem to keep Lee out of her life when she's repeatedly stun gunned, kidnapped and there are car bombs exploding (not to mention she's finding dead bodies).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indy's best bet is to solve the mystery of the diamonds before Lee. Lee's challenge is to keep Indy alive and, at the same time, win back her heart.</description>

  <description>There’s nothing worse than living next door to your childhood nemesis, except maybe being forced to share your dream project with him, being blackmailed into going along with something that was just wrong on so many levels, and having your hot cocoa stolen by the person that drove you to drink it in the first place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as she has plenty of hot cocoa, a pair of pliers on hand and is able to resist Connor O’Neil’s bad boy charm then Rory James should be able to make it through this project with her sanity intact. If not…..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She’d probably face a few more nights in jail, have a few more restraining orders slapped against her and lose her heart to the man that ruined her life.</description>

But when Trey encounters Reagan's sexy bisexual roommate, Ethan Conner, he can no longer deny who he is or what he wants. Reagan heartily agrees to a solution that opens up a hot new world of sexual experience--and love--with the two men she wants the most.</description>

  <description>Getting a boy to fall head-over-heels in love with you isn’t easy. Especially when he’s been in love with your cousin for as long as you can remember.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lana has lived her life in her cousin’s shadow. Ashton always made perfect grades, had tons of friends, and looks model-perfect. And she’s always had Sawyer Vincent—the only boy Lana’s ever wanted—wrapped around her finger. But now things are different. Lana has a chance to make Sawyer see her, and she’s taking it. If only he’d get over Ashton—because Lana is sick of second-best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sawyer’s heart is broken. He’s lost his best girl to his best friend. And then Lana comes to town. Ashton’s cousin has always been sweet and soft-spoken, but now she’s drop-dead gorgeous as well. Sawyer doesn’t know if Lana can heal his broken heart, but spending time with her might at least make Ashton jealous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What starts as a carefree fling becomes a lusty game of seduction. Sawyer and Lana may have different motives, but their scintillating hookups are the same kind of steamy. . . .</description>

  <description>True love can blossom in unexpected places. This is Jaden pretending not to notice. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaden McEntyre and Parker Whalen are a wrong fit from the start. Jaden is driven and focused, Harvard Med School within reach. Parker has a past-a reputation-and the rumors about his mysterious habits abound. So there's no reason why, when they're assigned to work together on a project in English, they should discover they have anything in common, or even like each other, and they definitely shouldn't be falling in love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they bond over Edith Wharton's tragic novella, Ethan Frome, the "bad boy" vibe Parker plays begins to dissipate. Soon, Jaden finds herself shedding her own "good girl" image: sneaking around to be with him, confiding in him, and ultimately falling hard for this leather-wearing, motorcycle-driving loner who plays into the rebel stereotype.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, Jaden can't shake the feeling that there's more to Parker than he's letting on. He's hiding something from her, and discovering the truth means reconciling the Parker she's grown to love with the person he really is. Because it's possible that his life inside the classroom-everything Jaden knows-is one, massive lie.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;A fresh, urban twist on the classic tale of star-crossed lovers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Brittany Ellis walks into chemistry class on the first day of senior year, she has no clue that her carefully created “perfect” life is about to unravel before her eyes. She’s forced to be lab partners with Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the other side of town, and he is about to threaten everything she's worked so hard for—her flawless reputation, her relationship with her boyfriend, and the secret that her home life is anything but perfect. Alex is a bad boy and he knows it. So when he makes a bet with his friends to lure Brittany into his life, he thinks nothing of it. But soon Alex realizes Brittany is a real person with real problems, and suddenly the bet he made in arrogance turns into something much more. &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a passionate story about looking beneath the surface, Simone Elkeles breaks through the stereotypes and barriers that threaten to keep Brittany and Alex apart.&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  <description>He was tall, at least six feet, with dirty blond hair that hung over his eyes. His T-shirt read &lt;strong&gt;Nietzsche Is My Homeboy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, that was Matt.  Who Julie Seagle likes. A lot.  But there is also Finn.  Who she flat out loves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Complicated? Awkward?  Completely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But really, how was this freshly-minted Boston transplant and newbie college freshman supposed to know that she would end up living with the family of an old friend of her mother's? This was all supposed to be temporary.  Julie wasn't supposed to be important to the Watkins family, or to fall in love with one of the brothers.  Especially the one she's never quite met. But what does that really matter?  Finn &lt;em&gt;gets&lt;/em&gt; her, like no one ever has before. They have &lt;em&gt;connection&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here's the thing about love, in all its twisty, bumpy permutations—it always throws you a few curves.  And no one ever escapes unscathed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Best-selling author Jessica Park mines the territory of love’s growing pains with wit, sharp insights, and a discernible heat and heartbeat. Her previous novels include Relatively Famous and she authored the e-shorts &lt;em&gt;What the Kid Says&lt;/em&gt; (Parts 1 and 2) and &lt;em&gt;Facebooking Rick Springfield&lt;/em&gt;.</description>

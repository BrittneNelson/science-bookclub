  <description>From the New York Times bestselling author of Into the Deep&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LIVE YOUNG. LIVE HARD. LOVE DEEP.&lt;br&gt;Charley and Jake’s story concludes in Out of the Shallows…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somehow, after everything they’ve been through, Jake Caplin and Charley Redford made their way back to one another. But finding each other and staying together are two completely different things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Charley’s world is flipped upside down, she begins to question the choices and decisions she’s made since her arrival in Edinburgh, and in an effort to grip onto what she holds most dear she believes she must sacrifice her love for Jake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning to the States for her senior year, Charley struggles to find peace and happiness. While everyone else seems to be finding themselves in college, Charley is terrified that, along with almost everything else that’s important to her, she’s lost herself.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While friends and family deal with their own tumultuous lives, there is one person resolved to uncover the reason behind Charley’s sudden defection and unhappiness. Refusing to give up without a fight, Jake believes he is the only one who can truly understand what Charley is going through, and this time he’s determined to prove he’s there for her no matter what obstacles are thrown in their way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, as Charley strives to make it through the biggest personal journey of her life thus far, there is no guarantee that the woman she is becoming will still need Jake as much as the girl she once was did...</description>

  <description>In the beginning, there was him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gutsy, green-eyed Eleanor never met a rule she didn't want to break. She's sick of her mother's zealotry and the confines of Catholic school, and declares she'll never go to church again. But her first glimpse of beautiful, magnetic Father Søren Stearns and his lust-worthy Italian motorcycle is an epiphany. Suddenly, daily Mass seems like a reward, and her punishment is the ache she feels when they're apart. He is intelligent and insightful and he seems to know her intimately at her very core. Eleanor is consumed—and even she knows that can't be right. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when one desperate mistake nearly costs Eleanor everything, it is Søren who steps in to save her. She vows to repay him with complete obedience…and a whole world opens before her as he reveals to her his deepest secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danger can be managed—pain, welcomed. Everything is about to begin.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;When life's always been a mess, can you still turn it into something beautiful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jace Riley’s close connection with his identical twin brother, Jaxon, is put to the test when he tries to choose between keeping his promises and following his heart. Is this girl that still haunts his dreams, even after four years, really worth it? Jace can’t help but wonder if he made a huge mistake all that time ago when he let her walk into someone else’s arms, especially since that someone was his twin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Audrey Mills often wonders at what point she should throw her hands up in defeat and allow all of the horrible circumstances of her life to overtake her. Despite the demons she has faced, however, something inside her won’t give in. When she leaves her small town in Texas to attend college in California, Audrey runs into the one guy who could make her or break her. But is the past they share too painful for them to overcome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second book in the broken series. While each book can stand on its own, it's recommended you read Beautiful Broken Rules before Beautiful Broken Mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Adult/Adult Contemporary Romance - recommended for ages 18 and up. &lt;/em&gt;</description>

  <description>Teresa Hamilton is having a rough year—she’s in love with her big brother’s best friend, but he hasn’t spoken to her since they shared a truly amazing, mind-blowing, change-your-life kiss. She got out of a terrible relationship. And now an injury is threatening to end her dance career for good. It’s time for Plan B – college. And maybe a chance to convince Jase that what they have together is real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jase Winstead has a huge secret that he’s not telling anyone. Especially not his best friend’s incredibly beautiful sister. Even though he and Teresa shared the hottest kiss of his life, he knows that his responsibilities must take priority. He certainly doesn’t have time for a relationship. But it doesn’t help that all he can think about kissing the one girl who could ruin everything for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As they’re thrown together more and more, Jase and Tess can’t keep denying their feelings for each other. But a familiar danger looms and tragedy strikes. As the campus recovers, the star-crossed couple must decide what they’re willing to risk to be together, and what they’re willing to lose if they’re not…</description>

  <description>For Luisa Chavez, a twenty-three year old former beauty queen, a better life has always been just out of her reach. Sure, she’s had men at her feet since she was a young teenager but she’s never had the one thing she’s craved – security. Having grown up in near poverty, her waitressing job in Cabo San Lucas can barely let her take care of herself, let alone her ailing parents. Every day is another unwanted advance, every day is a struggle to survive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Salvador Reyes, the depraved leader of a major Mexican cartel, takes an interest in her, Luisa is presented with an opportunity she can’t afford to pass up. She’ll become Salvador’s wife and exchange her freedom and body for a life of riches – riches she can bestow upon her deserving parents. But Luisa quickly finds out that even the finest wines and jewels can’t undo the ugliness in her marriage, nor the never-ending violence that threatens her every move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon, Luisa is looking for an escape, a way out of the carefully controlled life she’s leading. She finally gets her wish in the worst way possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it is, being the wife of Salvador makes her an ideal target for rival cartels and there’s one particular man who needs Luisa as part of his cartel’s expansion. One particular man whose quest for power has destroyed lives, slit throats and gotten him out of an American prison. One particular man who will stop at nothing until he gets what he wants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That man is Javier Bernal. And he wants Luisa. He wants to take her, keep her, ruin her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless she ruins him first.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***WARNING*** This book deals with drug cartels and as such it contains a lot of sex and violence and some violent sex. It can get pretty ugly, pretty dark and pretty crazy. There is drug use, abuse, a bit of torture and dubious consent. The hero is not a hero and the villains...well, they're even worse. If this sort of thing bothers you, please do not read. This ain't no cupcake farting unicorn kind of book***&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;***While this is a spin-off of The Artists Trilogy, prior knowledge of the books is not needed. DIRTY ANGELS is the first in a trilogy, however each book can standalone and follows or introduces different characters***</description>

  <description>IT HAPPENED IN VEGAS.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't be held responsible.  Things that happen there are supposed to stay there, right?  Right?  Yeeeah.  Not so much.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andie's just days away from tying the knot, but there's just ooooone little glitch.  Apparently, she's already married.  Or someone with her name is married to a guy out in Oregon of all places, and the courthouse won't issue her a marriage license until it's all cleared up.  Tripping her way through cow pies and country songs to meet up with a man who gets around places on horseback is her very last idea of how to have a good time, but if she's going to get married, make partner at the firm, and have two point five kids before she's thirty-five, she needs to get to the bottom of this snafu and fix it quick ... before her fiance finds out and everything she's been working toward goes up in flames.</description>

  <description>Secrets and lies. They are everywhere: haunting her, tormenting her. In the midst of it all, he’d been her escape, her passion. The only person she’d trusted in six years. And then he’d made her doubt that trust, cutting her deeply. But as she’d once told him, she was damaged, not broken. She is ready to fight and not just for survival. She is fighting for the truth and she won’t stop until she has it, not even for…him.</description>

  <description>A present life worth moving on for. A past best left to memories tucked away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaxon Dean has reached a point in his life where everything is as it should be. He has the personality, the looks, and the charm, to basically get whoever he desires—except Cassandra Tyce. She's immune to his playboy ways, quick wit, and over indulgence of himself. There is only one time he can recall having to work as hard to snag the one he had his sights set on…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a much simpler time in life, all he had to worry about was passing classes, hitching a ride to places, and collecting phone numbers. Although on his first day of high school, Jaxon found not every girl was susceptible to his charms. Could one person truly change his overzealous ways? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An unexpected turn of events can leave even the toughest ones lost without hope... Hope of ever recovering, of ever wanting to see tomorrow, of ever feeling true happiness again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of Cassandra Tyce, Jaxon will learn that sometimes, lying to oneself can be the sole reason a person stays torn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*This book contains adult situations and some explicit language.*</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;Fallen Too Far&lt;/em&gt; was Blaire's story. Now it's time for Rush to share his side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everyone in Rosemary Beach thinks they know how Rush Finlay and Blaire Wynn fell in love. But Rush is back to tell his side of the story...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rush has earned every bit of his bad-boy reputation. The three-story beach house, luxury car, and line of girls begging for time between his sheets are the envy of every guy in Rosemary Beach, and Rush handles it all with the laid-back cool of a rock star’s son. All he needs are his best friend, Grant, and his sister, Nan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Blaire Wynn drives into town in her beat-up pickup truck with a pistol under her seat. The Alabama farm girl instantly captures Rush’s attention once he discovers that the angelic beauty is his new stepsister, but he vows to keep his distance. Even if she needs his help. Even if he craves her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Rush knows why Blaire is all alone in the world, forced to ask for help from the father who abandoned her three years ago. And he knows if he gets too close it will destroy Nan, who has a secret connection to Blaire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He has every reason in the world to stay away from her. Find out why he doesn’t.</description>

  <description>An ambitious intern. A perfectionist executive. And a whole lot of name calling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whip-smart, hardworking, and on her way to an MBA, Chloe Mills has only one problem: her boss, Bennett Ryan. He's exacting, blunt, inconsiderate--and completely irresistible. A Beautiful Bastard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bennett has returned to Chicago from France to take a vital role in his family's massive media business. He never expected that the assistant who'd been helping him from abroad was the gorgeous, innocently provocative--completely infuriating--creature he now has to see every day. Despite the rumors, he's never been one for a workplace hookup. But Chloe's so tempting he's willing to bend the rules--or outright smash them--if it means he can have her. All over the office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As their appetites for one another increase to a breaking point, Bennett and Chloe must decide exactly what they're willing to lose in order to win each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Originally only available online as The Office by tby789--and garnering over 2 million reads on fanfiction sites--Beautiful Bastard has been extensively updated for re-release.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;From the New Adult sensation and New York Times bestselling author of Until You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madoc and Fallon. Two estranged teenagers playing games that push the boundaries between love and war…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She’s back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the three years she’s been away at boarding school, there was no word from her. Back when we lived in the same house, she used to cut me down during the day and then leave her door open for me at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was stupid then, but now I’m ready to beat her at her own game…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three years and I can tell he still wants me, even if he acts like he’s better than me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I won’t be scared away. Or pushed down. I’ll call his bluff and fight back. That’s what he wants, right? As long as I keep my guard up, he’ll never know how much he affects me….</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood novels have introduced readers to a "different, creative, dark, violent, and flat-out amazing" (&lt;em&gt;All About Romance)&lt;/em&gt;world. Now, as the vampire warriors defend their race against their slayers, one male's loyalty to the Brotherhood will be tested-and his dangerous mixed blood revealed...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Caldwell, New York, has long been the battleground for the vampires and their enemies, the Lessening Society. It's also where Rehvenge has staked out his turf as a drug lord and owner of a notorious night club that caters to the rich and heavily armed. His shadowy reputation is exactly why he's approached to kill Wrath, the Blind King and leader of the Brotherhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rehvenge has always kept his distance from the Brotherhood-even though his sister is married to a member, for he harbors a deadly secret that could make him a huge liability in their war against the lessers. As plots within and outside of the Brotherhood threaten to reveal the truth about Rehvenge, he turns to the only source of light in his darkening world, Ehlena, a vampire untouched by the corruption that has its hold on him-and the only thing standing between him and eternal destruction.</description>

  <description>The &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Disaster&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Walking Disaster&lt;/em&gt; phenomenon continues in the first heart-pounding new adult romance in The Maddox Brothers series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiercely independent Camille "Cami" Camlin gladly moved on from her childhood before it was over. She has held down a job since before she could drive, and moved into her own apartment after her freshman year of college. Now tending bar at The Red Door, Cami doesn’t have time for much else besides work and classes, until a trip to see her boyfriend is cancelled, leaving her with a first weekend off in almost a year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trenton Maddox was the king of Eastern State University, dating co-eds before he even graduated high school. His friends wanted to be him, and women wanted to tame him, but after a tragic accident turned his world upside down, Trenton leaves campus to come to grips with the crushing guilt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eighteen months later, Trenton is living at home with his widower father, and works full-time at a local tattoo parlor to help with the bills. Just when he thinks his life is returning to normal, he notices Cami sitting alone at a table at The Red. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the baby sister of four rowdy brothers, Cami believes she’ll have no problem keeping her new friendship with Trenton Maddox strictly platonic. But when a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever—even if she is the only reason their already broken family could fall apart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first installment of the Maddox Brothers books, readers can experience the rush of reading &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Disaster&lt;/em&gt; for the first time, all over again.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Now the #1 international bestselling author returns. The new Crossfire novel by Sylvia Day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gideon calls me his angel, but he's the miracle in my life. My gorgeous, wounded warrior, so determined to slay my demons while refusing to face his own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The vows we'd exchanged should have bound us tighter than blood and flesh. Instead they opened old wounds, exposed pain and insecurities, and lured bitter enemies out of the shadows. I felt him slipping from my grasp, my greatest fears becoming my reality, my love tested in ways I wasn't sure I was strong enough to bear.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the brightest time in our lives, the darkness of his past encroached and threatened everything we'd worked so hard for. We faced a terrible choice: the familiar safety of the lives we'd had before each other or the fight for a future that suddenly seemed an impossible and hopeless dream...</description>

  <description>**NEW YORK TIMES &amp;amp; USATODAY Bestselling Series**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There’s optimistic. And there’s Jesse Walker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If he wasn’t so charming, his sunny disposition and incessant grin would get old. Fast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Falling in love with the broken girl who had at first seemed immune to anything resembling love was the best thing to happen to Jesse since the Walkers adopted him when he was five. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Jesse’s life continues at the ranch and Rowen begins making her mark in the Seattle art community, they wonder where the middle ground is. Or if there even is one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As push comes to shove, they’re forced to make choices neither are eager to make, and Jesse and Rowen have to face what their lives might look like without the other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can two people with such tragic pasts and different presents expect a promising future  together? Whatever the answer, they’ll need a lot more than love to make it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*Recommended for mature readers due to moderate content and language.*</description>

  <description>Schizoaffective disorder: a mental illness in which a person experiences a combination of mood disorder and schizophrenia symptoms.&lt;br&gt;I know about this illness—very well—because I suffer from it. It’s been four years since my diagnosis, and ever since, I’ve been living in a dark hole. Voices constantly invading my thoughts. Hallucinations. All of which force me to question if what I’m experiencing is even reality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But here I am, still hanging on, still breathing and living through it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is, until he stumbled into my life. Logan Reed. I don’t want any part of him. I’ve pushed him away, but he isn’t easily deterred. I’ve told him I’m different, but he doesn’t care. He’s trying to slowly break me down. I’m trying just as hard not to let him. He doesn’t know how truly damaged I am; what will happen when he does?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know the truth—he’ll never be able to look at me the same way again. Just like everybody else.</description>

  <description>There's only one thing in life Lucien Knight really hates, and that's husbands who cheat on their wives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's only one problem in Sophie Black's life. Her cheating husband...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment Lucien &amp;amp; Sophie meet, the seal is set.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Romantic, emotional &amp;amp; intensely erotic, &lt;em&gt;Knight and Play&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect read for lovers of international bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Bared To You&lt;/em&gt;. Let yourself be swept away by Part One of the Knight series from Kitty French, a romance so hot it'll burn your fingers...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CEO of Knight Inc. Lucien Knight is catch-your-breath gorgeous and damaged by his troubled past in Norway. All grown up and relocated to London, he's built his empire of adult clubs from the ground up to become the gorgeous patron saint of the sex industry. No one knows the dark childhood secrets that have given Lucien a backbone of steel and a heart encased in ice.  No one until Sophie Black, that is...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the moment girl-next-door Sophie accepts the job as Lucien Knight's PA, she understands how Alice must have felt when she tumbled down the rabbit hole. Lucien takes her safe, vanilla life away and plunges her head first into a huge dish of fantasy flavours. Rich, spicy chocolate covered with dark, oozingly lickable sauce? Check. Tutti-frutti with indecently red, glistening cherries on the top? Yes please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucien strips away all of Sophie's inhibitions, and when he instructs her to select three new toys, she soon realises he has more than a game of Monopoly on his mind... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's opened the door to a whole new pleasure packed world without limits, and Sophie is utterly intoxicated. But how far is she willing to go? And what happens when she has to step back into reality again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucien &amp;amp; Sophie's is a story of star crossed love and forbidden passion, a sexual odyssey that spans the globe and changes both of their lives forever. Let it change yours, too.</description>

  <description>THE STORY YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Kyle Calloway died, he took a part of Nell with him. She wasn’t the only one left to pick up the pieces, however; Kyle’s death left a gaping hole in the hearts and lives of his parents and his older brother Colton, and ultimately broke the will of the girl he loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE STORY YOU NEVER IMAGINED...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Becca de Rosa is Nell’s best friend. When Kyle died, Nell was so devastated that no one could reach her, not even her best friend Becca. As she tries to help Nell through her grief, Becca’s own life is thrust into turmoil, and everything she knows is changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Dorsey asked Nell out the week after her sixteenth birthday, but that date never happened. Instead, he ended up going out with Nell’s best friend, Becca. He had no way of knowing, then, how that one date would send him on a life-long journey with Becca. He had no way of knowing the tragedies and triumphs he would experience, or that in Becca, he might find the love of a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE HEARTACHE YOU’LL NEVER FORGET...</description>

  <description>Gather ‘round, love, because I want you. I want what you have, I want what you don’t have, I want more of what I already have. I want. But if you so much as ask for something in return, go ahead and walk away. Know if you want to play in my world, it’s every man for themselves and the weak become mine. Leeches will be obliterated because I make it my job to destroy them. I protect what’s mine and I take what’s yours…because that’s what I do. I want.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My story will not endear me to you and, frankly, I could care less if it does because I’m in this for the money and nothing else. There’s nothing redeeming about me. I’m a corrupt, money hungry, immoral asshole from Los Angeles. I’m every man’s worst nightmare and every girl’s fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m Spencer Blackwell…And this is the story about how I went from the world’s most coveted guy to the guy no one wanted around and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.</description>

For several reasons, this book didn’t hold my attention and when you start skimming at 50 percent it’s time to re-evaluate.<br /><br />Just one too many cow scenes…<br /><img src="http://www.somegif.com/gifs/13642433291914831570.GIF" width="340" height="320" alt="description" class="escapedImg" /><br /><br />I also found Spencer’s dialogue and thoughts were down right cheesy. <br /><br /><strong>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;STRINGS is not suitable for slut shamers, uptight stone throwers, Holier-Than-Thou prudes, humorless virgins, persons with chronic neck or back pain, pearl-clutching bitties, those who disparage crude humor or vulgarity in their many forms, closed-minded people with sticks up their asses, or anyone under the age of 18. The vile, base language and shocking, unholy sexual acts contained herein are not condoned by anyone with a lick of sense and should certainly not be reproduced without proper training and protection. The potty-mouthed and perpetually horny "heroine" (the term is used loosely) of this book does not resemble a normal, well-adjusted, or remotely believable person in any way, shape, or form. The author acknowledges that the characters in this book are shallow and two-dimensional; the plot is both ridiculous and insipid. She makes no apologies for any of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Readers are strongly advised to wear latex gloves whilst reading to minimize contamination risks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free-spirited musician Letty Dillinger adheres to a strict, “no strings attached” policy when it comes to men. After a wild night of unabashed sex in a fancy hotel room, she never expects to see the adventurous stud she dubs “Shades” again. When her all-girl rock trio books a tour at the last minute as the opening act for their archenemies, Letty’s shocked to discover she knows the competition’s new lead singer. Intimately. Shades is no longer a one-night stand. Now he’s the guy she has to one-up on stage every night for the sake of her career.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing close quarters on a bus with her sexy nemesis and his bad-boy buddies puts Letty’s Golden Rule to the test. On this tour, guitar strings aren’t the only things being played. And when heartstrings are pulled too hard, they’re bound to snap sooner or later.</description>

  <description>Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him. Rise up the ranks of the family business. Marry the rich girl of his parents’ dreams. Pretend that wealth and privilege was all he’d ever wanted. Then a girl named Della breezed into town, a beautifully imperfect stranger who captured his heart and opened his eyes to a new kind of future. Woods is ready and willing to sacrifice everything for her when the sudden death of his father leaves him with his mother to care for and a business to manage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Della is determined to be strong for Woods, even as she’s quietly falling to pieces. No matter how far from home she’s run, the ghosts of her past have never stopped haunting her. Struggling to hide her true feelings from Woods, Della fears she can’t be his rock without dragging him down into the darkness with her. But is she strong enough to let go of the last thing holding her together?</description>

  <description>There will be a second book, but it isn't a sequel, in that there's no cliffhanger in 'The Tied Man #1', or need to buy a second book. The first book can be read as a stand alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author Tabitha McGowan:&lt;br&gt;'Towards the end of the writing process I realised I couldn't write a simple epilogue to TTM, and I really felt there was a second story with the same protagonists, but a whole new plot. There will be two major locations - Spain, and Dublin - and an introduction to Finn's wider family, and also the horror that is the O'Halloran clan! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really wanted to let Finn and Lilith grow and heal and discover, and learn to deal with the demons that they both still have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately I love writing for both Finn and Lilith, and I wasn't quite ready to let the pair of them go *just* yet!'</description>

  <description>With Book Two of the Experiment in Terror Series, Perry Palomino and Dex Foray trade in the stormy Oregon coast for the unforgiving deserts of New Mexico. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the for­got­ten town of Red Fox, New Mex­ico, a Navajo cou­ple is tor­tured by things unseen and by motives unknown. Wild ani­mals slink through their house in the dark, a bar­rage of stones pound their roof nightly, and muti­lated sheep car­casses are turn­ing up on their prop­erty. Armed with a cam­era and just enough to go on, Perry and Dex travel to the des­o­late locale, hop­ing to film the super­nat­ural occur­rences and add cred­i­bil­ity to their flail­ing web­cast. Only their show has a lot more work­ing against them than just grow­ing pains. Tested by dubi­ous ranch hands, a ghost from Dex’s past, and shapeshift­ing decep­tion, the ama­teur ghost hunters must learn to trust each other in order to fight the most ancient of myths…or die trying.</description>

  <description>Edible, delicious, delectable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel Langley is more than familiar with those three words in her line of work. After all, she spends her afternoons and evenings creating desserts so divine that your mouth will water and your taste buds will tingle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They aren’t, however, the words she would have ever expected to think of when she locks eyes with a certain lawyer she knows only as Cole.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With each encounter, the infuriatingly persistent man becomes more impossible to resist, and edible is the exact word that comes to mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crave, demand, covet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole Madison knows exactly what he wants, and Rachel Langley is it. From the moment he spotted her at Whipped, he knew he wanted to grab hold and take a bite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the woman has enigmatic moves, avoiding him at every turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But not for much longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachel’s time is up, and as far as Cole is concerned, he’s waited too long for a taste of what he desires. Nothing, including the woman herself, will stop him from consuming what he hungers for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only question left is: Who will take the first bite?</description>

  <description>THE STUNNING CONCLUSION TO THE THIS MAN TRILOGY!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Manor, the very place where their passionate love affair began, fills with guests on what should be the happiest day of Ava and Jesse's lives. She has accepted that she'll never tame the fierceness in Jesse-and she doesn't want to. Their love is profound, their connection powerful, but just when she thinks that she's finally gotten beneath his guarded exterior, more questions arise, leading Ava to believe that Jesse Ward may not be the man she thinks he is. He knows too well how to take her to a place beyond ecstasy . . . but will he also drive her to the brink of despair? It's time for this man to confess.</description>

  <description>Professor Gabriel Emerson has left his position at the University of Toronto to embark on a new life with his beloved Julianne. Together, he’s confident that they can face any challenge.  And he’s eager to become a father.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Julianne’s graduate program threatens Gabriel’s plans, as the pressures of being a student become all consuming. When she is given the honor of presenting an academic lecture at Oxford, Gabriel is forced to confront her about the subject of her presentation – research that conflicts with his own. And in Oxford, several individuals from their past appear, including an old nemesis intent on humiliating Julia and exposing one of Gabriel’s darkest secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an effort to confront his remaining demons, Gabriel begins a quest to discover more about his biological parents, beginning a chain of events that has startling repercussions for himself, Julianne, and his hope of having a family.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Flirting with the Grave...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half-vampire Catherine Crawfield is going after the undead with a vengeance, hoping that one of these deadbeats is her father - the one responsible for ruining her mother's life. Then she's captured by Bones, a vampire bounty hunter, and is forced into an unholy partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for finding her father, Cat agrees to train with the sexy night stalker until her battle reflexes are as sharp as his fangs. She's amazed she doesn't end up as his dinner - are there actually &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; vampires? Pretty soon Bones will have her convinced that being half-dead doesn't have to be all bad. But before she can enjoy her newfound status as kick-ass demon hunter, Cat and Bones are pursued by a group of killers. Now Cat will have to choose a side . . . and Bones is turning out to be as tempting as any man with a heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

  <description>What if everything you think you want isn't what you actually need...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Shelly Monroe is a woman who doesn't shy away from going after what she wants, but lately good sex has been hard to find. Shelly's become increasingly frustrated with the men she's been dating and the men she believes are the right choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joshua Daniels is certainly not even close to the right choice. In fact he is exactly the wrong choice. For one thing, he's Mason Langley's best friend and best man. Second he's too much of a risky complication for Shelly to even consider.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then why can't she stop thinking about how delicious he looked that first night she met him at Exquisite? Why is it so imperative to keep her lusty desire for a man that doesn’t meet her preconceived mold hidden from Lena and Mason, her trusted friends?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems unreasonable that being with a man completely wrong in theory could somehow feel so right. Then why is it the more she sees him the more enticing he becomes?</description>

  <description>Samantha is a stranger in her own life. Until the night she disappeared with her best friend, Cassie, everyone said Sam had it all-popularity, wealth, and a dream boyfriend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sam has resurfaced, but she has no recollection of who she was or what happened to her that night. As she tries to piece together her life from before, she realizes it's one she no longer wants any part of. The old Sam took "mean girl" to a whole new level, and it's clear she and Cassie were more like best enemies. Sam is pretty sure that losing her memories is like winning the lottery. She's getting a second chance at being a better daughter, sister, and friend, and she's falling hard for Carson Ortiz, a boy who has always looked out for her-even if the old Sam treated him like trash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Cassie is still missing, and the facts about what happened to her that night isn't just buried deep inside of Sam's memory-someone else knows, someone who wants to make sure Sam stays quiet. All Sam wants is the truth, and if she can unlock her clouded memories of that fateful night, she can finally move on. But what if &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; remembering is the only thing keeping Sam alive?</description>

  <description>&lt;em&gt;“We can do this easy,” she whispered close to his ear as he groaned in agony, “or it can go real hard on you.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Well, of course he wasn’t going to go easy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author Cindy Gerard plunges readers into the heart of a seductive contest of wills between a hard-living hero and a beautiful rogue operative who is on a mission to dig up the secrets of his past. Tension sizzles in this pulse-pounding first adventure in Gerard’s action-packed new series as Eva Salinas lures Mike Brown from the sultry streets of Lima, Peru, to the desolate Idaho wilderness on the hunt for the cold-blooded traitor behind a fatal military operation that haunts them both.</description>

  <description>If your inner wolf and your body react rather enthusiastically to a psychotic Alpha male who’s own wolf has a tendency to turn feral, it can’t be a good thing, can it? Entering into a bargain with him wouldn’t be good either. Unfortunately, Taryn Warner, a latent wolf shifter, doesn’t have many options open to her right now. Okay, she has no options. Basically it comes down to whether she’ll do what it takes to escape the arranged mating with the sick SOB that her father set up. As the answer in this case is yes, it looks as though she’ll have to agree to Trey Coleman’s deal…she’ll have to mate with him instead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having always disliked shifter politics, Trey Coleman hadn’t bothered trying to form alliances with other packs. Now that his uncle – a wolf with many alliances – means to take Trey’s territory and his pack, he has no option but to form some alliances of his own very quickly or he’ll be easily outnumbered in the upcoming battle. He figures that the easiest way to do that would be to mate with a female whose Alpha is powerful and influential. There’s only one problem with that – he would then be stuck with her, and the last thing Trey wants is a mate. When he hears of Taryn’s situation, he offers her a deal – if she falsely claims he’s her true mate and allows him to claim her, he’ll save her from her arranged mating and then let her leave after the battle with his uncle is over. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sounds like a pretty straightforward deal...but soon Taryn and Trey realize they got more than they bargained for. Their mating instincts to protect and possess are weighing on them, they crave each other’s touch and company, and their inner wolves don’t like it whenever they’re apart. Add in that they’ll have to deal with this for an entire three months until the day of the battle finally arrives, and they’ve got themselves a recipe for disaster – or maybe for something quite the opposite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: This novel contains an extremely sarcastic Alpha female, a broody possessive Alpha male, bitter in-laws, voyeuristic enforcers, a whole lot of dirty talk, and steamy bedroom battles for dominance. &lt;strong&gt;Reader Advisory:&lt;/strong&gt; This book also contains a graphic ménage scene - not for the faint-hearted.&lt;/em&gt;</description>

Now they're seniors and ready to make their last year in high school the best yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Allie confesses to Sam that she's enlisting in the army when they graduate, her future seems bleak and distant. She can't imagine going on without her. They were supposed to go to college together and have the great new experiences they always talked about. Dreamed about. She's depressed and suddenly she's not looking forward to the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until Zeke comes along and changes it all. He's new to school and the area, so she befriends him and welcomes him into their crazy, fun group of friends. Her senior year doesn't seem so bad after all now.

  <description>In At Peace, Benny took his cousin Cal's back. And so did Benny's dead brother's girlfriend, Francesca. Since his brother's death, Benny has been nursing his grudge against the woman he thinks led to his brother's downfall.

But when Frankie takes a bullet while on the run with Cal's woman Vi, Benny has to face his feelings. The problem is, Frankie has decided she's done her penance to Benny and his family. Penance she didn't deserve to pay. She's done with Benny and the Biancihi family. She's starting a new life away from Chicago and her heartbreaking history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Frankie's new life leads her to The 'Burg, where Benny has ties and she finds she hasn't quite succeeded in getting away</description>

  <description>Book #3 in reading order of events in book series, per author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are things in bassist Jace Seymour’s past that he is unwilling to share with anyone. To cover his guilt and anguish, he seeks dominatrix Mistress V (Aggie) to temporarily placate his inner turmoil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aggie doesn’t have much use for men–besides the power rush she gets when they’re begging for mercy at her feet–but Jace isn’t like her usual clients. His cool defiance and unexpected dominance in the bedroom drives her to distraction and quickly steals her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When circumstances threaten Jace’s position in Sinners, Aggie must help him regain his rightful place in the band while showing him that time and love can heal all wounds.</description>

  <description>He wants just one night…&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After growing up with an abusive, alcoholic father, Army Special Forces Sgt. Brady Scott vowed never to marry or have kids. Sent stateside to get his head on straight—and his anger in check—Brady’s looking for a distraction. He finds it in his beautiful new neighbor’s one-night-only offer for hot sex, but her ability to make him forget is addictive. Suddenly, Brady’s not so sure he can stay away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;…what they need is each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orphaned as a child, community center director Joss Daniels swore she’d never put herself in a position to be left behind again, but she can’t deny herself one sizzling night with the sexy soldier who makes her laugh and kisses her senseless. When Joss discovers she’s pregnant, Brady’s rejection leaves her feeling abandoned. Now, they must overcome their fears before they lose the love and security they’ve found in each other, but can they let go of the past to create a future together?</description>

  <description>Beckett Taylor is a murderer. His calling, his craft are destruction and intimidation—whether he wants it that way now or not. He left Poughkeepsie to keep his brothers safe, to keep Eve safe. Set up with happy lives to live, they’re better off without him, right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But all his willpower crumbles when he hears his brother Blake’s frantic voice on the phone. An unknown enemy has moved in on his old territory, and Livia’s been taken. In an instant, Beckett knows it will take an attack only he and Eve can execute to bring her back. All his self-imposed embargoes are torn to shreds, perhaps along with the new man he’s struggled to become.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Brother, call Eve. I’ll be there soon.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this emotional and action-packed sequel to Poughkeepsie, Debra Anastasia conjures a tale of love at its most raw and ragged. With Beckett and Eve, how could we expect anything less? But even when it’s messy, not magical, true love perseveres. Real love finds a way—for better or for worse until death does part.</description>

She needs to kill the kingpins responsible for Cameron’s death before they come looking for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Cameron secretly observes Emily, he has no idea of the danger he has placed her in—or that it may already be too late for him to save her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scare Crow is a tale of revenge, terror, and love as Emmy and Cameron embark on separate journeys to face enemies, correct past mistakes, and.............. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;find their way to their destinies.</description>

  <description>&lt;strong&gt;Before.&lt;/strong&gt; Miles "Pudge" Halter's whole existence has been one big nonevent, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave the "Great Perhaps"  (François Rabelais, poet) even more. He heads off to the sometimes crazy, possibly unstable, and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed-up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young, who is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing is ever the same.</description>

  <description>Kathleen Turner has goals. She moved to Indianapolis to start seeing to them, but things aren't going quite as well as she'd hoped. She's a runner for a high-powered law firm in town, not the most prestigious of positions, but it and her part-time bartender gig at least pays the bills. And one of the senior partners is a dreamboat in that obscenely rich, disturbingly good looking, slightly snobbish sort of way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before she did a mortifying face plant in his lap during a meeting, she was quite happy ogling him from afar. After that...well...she was more about the avoiding. Mature, no. More likely to assure she keeps her job, yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She's made some friends in the few months she's been in Indy. One of those friends is her neighbor Sheila, though Kathleen can't say she's completely comfortable with Sheila's job choice as a high-dollar escort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's the middle of the night when Kathleen hears fighting coming from Sheila's apartment. As disturbing as that is, it's the ominous sound of silence afterwards that keeps Kathleen from falling back to sleep. Slipping from bed with the intention of making sure everything is okay, Kathleen knocks on friend's door, only to find Sheila murdered, her naked body sprawled on sheets stained crimson with her blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shock and horror are followed by gritty determination when it becomes clear that Sheila's death isn't random and it isn't the result of a jealous boyfriend. It's the opening gambit in a web of murder, deceit, conspiracy, and fraud that stretches to the law firm for which Kathleen works. Maybe to the very office that Blane Kirk commands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Kathleen Turner, law office runner, can trust no one if she wants to survive.</description>

  <description>The golden skies, the translucent twilight, the white nights, all hold the promise of youth, of love, of eternal renewal. The war has not yet touched this city of fallen grandeur, or the lives of two sisters, Tatiana and Dasha Metanova, who share a single room in a cramped apartment with their brother and parents. Their world is turned upside down when Hitler's armies attack Russia and begin their unstoppable blitz to Leningrad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet there is light in the darkness. Tatiana meets Alexander, a brave young officer in the Red Army. Strong and self-confident, yet guarding a mysterious and troubled past, he is drawn to Tatiana--and she to him. Starvation, desperation, and fear soon grip their city during the terrible winter of the merciless German siege. Tatiana and Alexander's impossible love threatens to tear the Metanova family apart and expose the dangerous secret Alexander so carefully protects--a secret as devastating as the war itself--as the lovers are swept up in the brutal tides that will change the world and their lives forever.</description>

  <description>Lucas had it all – popularity, a devoted girlfriend, a brotherly best friend, and a loving mother who would do anything for him. His life was right on course to be a successful and fulfilling one, until the crash changed everything. It happened late one night during a sudden downpour. That evening, three young lives were lost and one life was left irrevocably altered. As the lone survivor, Lucas finds himself surrounded by swirling gossip of reckless drunkenness from the small town he used to warmly call home. Amid his own guilt and self-hatred, Lucas struggles to find hope, find peace, and maybe, even find love again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SKoW Award winner 2010 - Best Het, Most Memorable</description>

Amber is still emotionally scarred from the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father. Together they make an unlikely pair. Their relationship has always been a rocky one, but what happens when Amber starts to view her brother's best friend a little differently? And how will her brother, who has always been a little overprotective, react when he finds out that the pair are growing closer? Find out in The Boy Who Sneaks In My Bedroom Window.</description>

  <description>MacKayla Lane’s life is good. She has great friends, a decent job, and a car that breaks down only every other week or so. In other words, she’s your perfectly ordinary twenty-first-century woman. Or so she thinks…until something extraordinary happens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When her sister is murdered, leaving a single clue to her death–a cryptic message on Mac’s cell phone–Mac journeys to Ireland in search of answers. The quest to find her sister’s killer draws her into a shadowy realm where nothing is as it seems, where good and evil wear the same treacherously seductive mask. She is soon faced with an even greater challenge: staying alive long enough to learn how to handle a power she had no idea she possessed–a gift that allows her to see beyond the world of man, into the dangerous realm of the Fae….&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Mac delves deeper into the mystery of her sister’s death, her every move is shadowed by the dark, mysterious Jericho, a man with no past and only mockery for a future. As she begins to close in on the truth, the ruthless Vlane–an alpha Fae who makes sex an addiction for human women–closes in on her. And as the boundary between worlds begins to crumble, Mac’s true mission becomes clear: find the elusive Sinsar Dubh before someone else claims the all-powerful Dark Book–because whoever gets to it first holds nothing less than complete control of the very fabric of both worlds in their hands….</description>
